","This is one of those movies that you will be quoting for the rest of your life with your friends! Tropic Thunder is a great satire that I was honestly expecting to be terrible. <br/><br/>The story was actually perfect to make fun of action movies and Hollywood. The situational comedy was genius as these actors were forced to actually survive a war like setting. The action scenes themselves resembled really action movies and were nicely done. They added the action in with the hilarity, and all of it worked perfectly.<br/><br/>There were two characters that really stand out. Robert Downey Jr and Tom Cruise were both comedic gold! You won't recognize either of them, but they fit the roles fantastically. Some people find Downey's character to be inappropriate, but please take it for what it is supposed to be. Downey Jr was making fun of method acting and taking that concept to a completely new level with this role. I didn't realize Tom Cruise was in this until the credits. He is in a role that I never thought I would see him in. He is outrageous and over the top. His scenes are some of the most memorable from the movie.<br/><br/>I don't want to give too much away since I don't want to spoil any of the comedic gold. Just know that you will be kept laughing the entire time, and the movie will just keep getting better. This is a great watch and definitely worth your time; 8/10."

","Originally saw ""Tropic Thunder"" in theaters, that was fun! Gargantuanly hilarious and witty; quite memorable too. Tom Cruise was gold, so was Danny McBride, Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr, Matthew McConaughey, Nick Nolte, and Jay Baruchel. Almost never get tired of watching this epic movie probably seen it 30 times since release! Hope this gets remembered for many years, sorry I didn't review it sooner."

","This is hands down Ben Stiller's best movie. It has great action, great dialogue, great acting, great music and great humor. This movie is filled with quotable lines and works very well. The performances I have to single out for praise are Ben Stiller, Robert Downey Jr, Jay Baruchel, Matthew McConaughey, and Tom Cruise. I feel like this movie approaches it's themes in a way similar to Blazing Saddles but Blazing Saddles has a lot more slapstick. The Tugg Speedman character is not as memorable as Derek Zoolander but this movie is far better than Zoolander is. This is my favorite Ben Stiller movie alongside Meet The Fockers, Zoolander, Starsky and Hutch, and Night At The Museum 1 and 3 but I still haven't seen There's Something About Mary. I honestly prefer Robert Downey Jr as Kirk Lazuras over him as Iron Man but they are both fantastic performances. Tom Cruise is awesome as Less Grossman. He owns his character that is very different from everything else he has done. I hope Ben Stiller is proud of this movie because to me this is his best one."

","I saw this movie in theaters and fell in love with it. I've seen it many times throughout the years and have noticed most people either don't know or don't care for this film. After rewatching it yesterday, I just had to write about it.<br/><br/>The casting was incredible in my opinion. People think of Ocean's Eleven or The Departed as movies with dream casts. I think Tropic Thunder holds its own. Tom Cruise and Matthew McConaughey are solid minor/supporting characters. I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise, but I find myself quoting all of his Les Grossman lines consistently. Nick Nolte, Steve Coogan, Bill Hader and Danny McBride are great additions. Jay Baruchel is his usual self, Brandon T Jackson was a solid part of the mix and the three main leads really deliver. Special mention to RDJ, by far my favorite performance. It's ridiculous how many layers there are to his character. At some point he's an Australian actor playing a Black guy playing an Asian farmer.<br/><br/>Almost every single scene has a quotable line. The action is very well done and the story's so wonderfully over the top.<br/><br/>I think the biggest win is how well it has aged in my opinion. Movies like The Hangover were really funny when they came out, but I find there's no replay value. The jokes don't work well the second time around. The same goes for something like Deadpool. On the other hand, films like Borat, Anchorman and Tropic Thunder still make me laugh regardless of how many times I've seen it.<br/><br/>I wish Ben Stiller would go back to doing stuff like this. A Les Grossman sequel would've been absolutely incredible!"

","I just got out of a midnight showing and I was absolutely blown away. I fully expect this to be a mediocre movie at best, but it surprised me in all aspects. It was well directed, acted, the action scenes were actually very well done and pretty epic, and most of all it was hilarious. I doubt I stopped laughing for more than a minute or two. I don't want to give anything away so I will keep it brief, but do yourself a favor and see this in theaters with friends.<br/><br/>PS. As a black man, I did not find Robert Downey Jr.'s character offensive at all. He was probably the most hilarious character in the movie."

"Simon_Says_Movies","9","110","157","23 October 2008"," A lightning quick wit!
","Damn, is Robert Downey Jr. on a roll Rarely (if they occur at all) have comebacks been so bold and so memorable. When slated to star as Tony Stark in May's Iron Man which kicked off the blockbuster season with a bang and a slap, the public, excluding his die-hard supporters of course, were baffled at the atypical casting choice of the Marvel hero. For myself, I have always loved Downey Jr. from his excellent portrayal as Charlie Chapin, to his perfectly suited role in Shane Black's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, he is always the best thing about a film. Lightening struck again (or I suppose first, if you want to follow his career chronologically) midyear with his smart portrayal as an overprotective principal in Charlie Bartlet, so it only seems suitable for him to cap off the summer with his best work yet.<br/><br/>Directed by, and starring Ben Stiller, Tropic Thunder is an epically vast improvement over the suicide inducing effort that was Zoolander and finds Stiller in his best comedic acting form since Meet the Parents. Our adventure follows a group of primadonna actors who are shooting a high budget war epic in Vietnam. As director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) sees his funds draining and his production falling apart at the hands of the maddeningly inept cast, the inspiration for the movie ""Four Leaf"" Tayback (Nick Nolte) suggests that the film would be better shot guerrilla style using hidden cameras and some improvisation. But, after a series of unfortunate (but hilarious) events leave the troupe stranded, they must both save the picture which their careers are riding on, and possibly themselves at the same time. Adding the flavour to this endeavour are Tugg Speedman (Stiller) as a flailing action has-been, Jack Black, who has also had a successful year, as Jeff Portnoy, an Eddie Murphy-esquire comic, Apatow regular Jay Baruchel as Kevin Sandusky, rapper turned actor Alpha Chino (Brandon T. Jackson) and of course Kirk Lazarus (Downey Jr.) as the Oscar winning method actor. We also get career high cameo and supporting work from various familiar Hollywood faces, Mathew McConaughey and the much buzzed appearance by Tom Cruise, who is simply fantastic.<br/><br/>The most satisfying aspect of Tropic Thunder is that despite show stealing work from Cruise and Downey Jr. everyone gets their slice of the comedy pie. One actor is never in the spotlight too much, and nobody hogs the funny too much. And boy is there a lot of funny; this film is one of, if not the best satire made about Hollywood and the jokes come high and low, subtly and bluntly, and they almost always strike home. Controversy has been in the air surrounding both Downey Jr.'s blackface portrayal as an African American and gags surrounding a film Tugg Speedman had previously filmed in which he was mentally handicapped. While it is inevitable that some will be offended, it is important to remember that both of these jabs are not against such groups, but against Hollywood who churns out method actors who take their job with a block of salt, not a grain. Even complaints I have read regarding this film I see as intentional inclusions by Stiller, who I believe has been in the business too long to have done such without careful thought and consideration.<br/><br/>The film starts without warning with a series of phony trailers featuring the stars of the feature, and are some of the funniest segments I have ever seen, especially that of Downey Jr.'s. Tropic Thunder does not let up however as the ready to quote one-lines, again mostly from Downey Jr. and Cruise, come so fast you will have to make a list once the film has concluded. All in all, this picture is what we needed, a biting satire/spoof that doesn't have the word Movie after it. With a similar action/comedy hybrid formula as this year's Pineapple Express (which both star Danny McBride), Tropic Thunder pours on the laughs like a storm and presents a wit that is nothing less then lightening quick.<br/><br/>View all my reviews at Simon Says Movie Reviews: www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"
"if-i-could-stay","7","320","495","14 August 2008"," Sharp Satire
","'Tropic Thunder' is the sharpest, nastiest, and most honest parody of Hollywood since Altman's 'The Player'.<br/><br/>If Doweny Jr. in black face, the script's use of ""retard"", or the politically incorrect humor offends you, you're missing the point.<br/><br/>Only Russel Crowe, Robin Williams, and Harvey Weinstein should take offense. The parodies of their personalities, their films, and their business tactics are downright cruel. (But, so, so true, and so brilliant.) I must credit every actor -- particularly Downey Jr. and Cruise -- for their performances, and for making their characters more than stereotypes for cheap laughs.<br/><br/>The more you know about Hollywood, the more you will appreciate the film. If not, just go and laugh at the genre. It takes balls to leave in a scene discussing how Blue-Ray conquered HD-DVD (and expect anyone to fine it funny). But it is funny.<br/><br/>To utterly relish the insanity, brush up on 'Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse'.<br/><br/>They got it so right. So, so, so right."

"jaredmobarak","8","298","489","6 August 2008"," Welcome to the goodie roomTropic Thunder
","Despite my somewhat indifference, bordering on dislike, of Ben Stiller and most of what he does, Tropic Thunder has been on my much-anticipated list for some time now. The audacity of what he was attempting, spoofing the industry that was giving him the money to do so, blatantly and lovingly, was too great to ignore. And then there is the cast of stars with cameo after cameo of surprise faces joining in on the fun, not to mention the intense marketing strategy pushing it along. Websites for each fictional actor, a site with clips from the Rain of Madness making of documentary (a Heart of Darkness send up ""directed"" by co-writer Justin Theroux), and even a faux E! True Hollywood Story to air the week before its premiere in theatres just add to the mythology and attention to detail that went into its making. Now, having finally seen the end result, I must say it didn't let me down. True, I was expecting more in the way of story and plot, especially with all that background info manufactured, but when you get down to it, the entertainment value is off the charts, the one-liners are going to be quoted for years to come, and the laughs come often and hard.<br/><br/>To take on subject matter as lofty as a send-up to war films, mainly Apocalypse Now, needs a certain amount to bravery and confidence to not care if it all backfires. The production value and effects make this seem as though it is a certified blockbuster falling apart at the seams. Sure the characters are funny and the events on display hilarious, but by the look and feel of the aesthetic, this is a war film to the end. Between that realism and the love I have for meta-narrative, there was little chance Stiller would be bombing in my eyes. Something about movies within movies intrigue the heck out of me, and this one having actors within actors just played up my interest more. There was truly no better way to start this movie then how was done: the playing of Alpa Chino's rap music, consumerism selling commercial and trailers for our three leads' previous films. What better way to be introduced to our action star, our funnyman, and our award winning thespian? Knowing full well the extent of satire going on, each spot delivers, giving a little background into the work these men have done in the past.<br/><br/>Directly connecting with the subsequent shot, a live scene from the film at hand, the egos finally come out and show face. Jack Black's Jeff Portney reins in his comedian schtick to portray a hardened solider, voice rasping as he shows his serious side; Stiller's Tugg Speedman attempts to revive the action cred he tried to leave behind with his Oscar-bait turn as a mentally handicapped man in Simple Jack, where he went ""full retarded, no one ever comes back from that""; and Robert Downey Jr.'s Kirk Lazarus, Australian genius at his craft, playing a black man like he was born one. The scene continues without a hitch, explosions everywhere, screams heard in the distance, and a heartfelt death about to be delivered, until the men show their true colors. Tugg can't make himself cry, (he's just not that good), and Kirk's blubbering and drooling is just so real that the two must partake in a pissing match while effects guru Cody, (the red hot of late Danny McBride), let's loose the one-take only scorched earth fire storm. It's all falling apart and script-writer/former soldier Four Leaf, (the always gruff Nick Nolte), gets the director, (Steve Coogan with one of the best film exits I've ever seen), to agree on guerilla filming, deep in the jungle of foreign lands. Here is where the fun begins and where the movie inside the movie becomes real, or, in effect, the actual moviekind of like ""the dude playing the dude, disguised as another dude"". The levels at play here are just too many to mention.<br/><br/>Besides a weakly written role for Black, the rest of the men are given enough to work with for some truly great moments. Stiller has a few instances where he returns to his over-long annoying routinepouring ""fake"" blood into his mouth for onebut for the most part did a real good job, especially with his tough guy poses shooting off his gun. Jay Baruchel shines as the only non-celebrity involved, the guy who went to boot camp, read the novel and the script, and idolizes the men he is working with. Good to see him get a more beefed up role as opposed to the side parts in Apatow films. And the back and forth between Downey Jr. and Brandon T. Jackson's Alpa never get old. The whole dynamic of real black man versus fake was unceasingly funny.<br/><br/>There were plot points that irked me throughout, TiVo's cameo being the biggest culprit, but I found myself pushing the problems aside and just enjoying the ride. Downey Jr.'s facial expressions, voices, and presence may steal the show, but what really allowed me to forget my worries was an absolutely brilliant cameo from Tom Cruise. His studio executive, pompously crass, loud-mouth made me think of all the horror stories you hear about the Weinsteins, and his dance moves can not be equaled. Tropic Thunder is first and foremost a vehicle for a bunch of friends to have a blast poking fun at their craft and really at themselves. I'll be remembering quotes all night now, thinking that while the story itself doesn't necessitate me watching it again soon, the jokes just might make buying it a mustnot to mention the wealth of extras that DVD is sure to have."
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","8","248","413","13 August 2008"," ""He Who Must Not Be Named"" brings down the house, steals what is probably the smartest, dumbest, and arguably the best comedy of 2008
","Very rarely do comedies hit the mark in terms of both smart humor and dumb humor in the same movie, let alone the same scene. That's what we've got with Tropic Thunder, a comedy that excels in both satirical jokes and laugh out loud stupidity. If you're game for any of that, in addition to quite possibly the funniest and most shocking cameos of all time, then Tropic Thunder is the perfect movie to close the summer of 2008 with.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller has always been the poster boy for trying to mix these two severely different types of humor recently, and has failed in his other two main directing attempts (although Zoolander was funny). Here, he more than succeeds in making Hollywood the laughingstock of the summer, and who better than Stiller to do so, someone who has been around the business his entire life.<br/><br/>Obviously, what's going to get the most laughs is our cast, which is one of the best comedy casts assembled, in my opinion. Our supporting performers are just as strong, if not stronger than our big three leads (definitely stronger than Jack Black), and we are treated to some of the funniest cameos of all time...One of Tropic Thunder's cameos, one of the most famous and serious actors in the world, nearly steals the movie, and is funnier than the last time he did a role like this (Austin Powers 3). If you don't know who I'm talking about by now, just wait until you see him. He'll have you on the floor laughing by the end of the movie. Other cameos (including a Judd Apatow boy and a former People's Sexiest Man Alive) are entertaining, but they have nothing on the big guy.<br/><br/>Now, to the actual cast...Starting with Stiller himself. Stiller has always been great at playing over the top asses, and that's what his character here is. There's plenty of exaggeration, plenty of laughs, but I felt there could have been more arrogance and more development in his character. The film belongs to Robert Downey Jr. (why am I not shocked by this?), who could sneak a Golden Globe nomination in if he's lucky for his performance as super-serious star Kurt Lazarus. Downey is absolutely hilarious, yet believable as this actor who believes acting is larger than life, and provides for the best satire of all. Jack Black is, if anything, forgettable and provided few laughs (though he does deliver one of the funniest lines of the movie). Jay Baruchel and Brandon Jackson are great in their supporting roles, and were the most well rounded characters (especially Baruchel). Danny McBride (three out of the last four movies I've watched have had this guy in it) of Pineapple Express is just as great here in another hilarious role tailor made for him. Nick Nolte is an odd presence, but an asset nonetheless. Steve Coogan's short role is memorable.<br/><br/>Stiller's main point in the film was obviously to make fun of Hollywood and his fellow actors as well, and he succeeds enormously. The fact that mentally challenged rights groups are calling for boycotts only proves Stiller's point: we all need to chill out, and stop taking things so seriously (where's The Joker when you need him?). The ""bad"" scene where the characters say 'retard' a few times is actually one of the best satire scenes in the movie. The scene isn't making fun of mentally challenged people, rather the actors that have won Oscars for playing them. Dustin Hoffman and Peter Sellers are not spared.<br/><br/>Like Pineapple Express before it, Tropic Thunder suffers from a less than stellar second act, which is used to attempt to ground the film in reality. This is unnecessary. We know that this could never happen. Insurance policies wouldn't even let a director think about doing what Coogan's character does in this film. However, the film starts and finishes very well (in fact, it starts better than any comedy of the year). It finishes with roars of laughter, and even though it is just absurd, it doesn't matter, because we've had a great time along the ride. Yes, Tropic Thunder is vulgar, but nowhere near the other Apatow brand products out these days. There's some blood and graphic violence, but nothing too bad."
"space_base","8","288","503","1 August 2008"," Ben Stiller and company hit the comedic mark with ""TROPIC THUNDER.""
","Advanced screening: Toronto (July 31, 2008) Tropic Thunder is a film I've anticipated (from it's trailers/ Downey Jr's ""Blackface"" controversy) for quite awhile, but knowing Ben Stiller's hit (Reality Bites) or miss (Zoolander) directing filmography, I kept my expectations relatively lukewarm. Luckily that wasn't necessary because it's Stiller's best effort as a director to date as well as one of the best comedies of the year.<br/><br/>Starting with the best fake-trailers this side of Grindhouse, TROPIC THUNDER develops into the most uniquely wacky blend of satire/action/ and gross-out I've ever seen. At first it appears to be a straight-up spoof on popular war films, then it becomes a film within a film, then an attack on Hollywood and the film industry in general. Also present are some rather shocking (and hilarious) sight gags (exploding film-crew members, the brutal slaughter of an endangered species) that managed to catch everyone off guard (yet not offend them).<br/><br/>The main reason TROPIC THUNDER works so well though is it's stellar ensemble cast. You have the likes of Ben Stiller, Robert Downey Jr, Jack Black, Jay Baruchel, Steve Coogan, and Nick Nolte all turning in terrific comedic performances that they obviously had fun with. Tom Cruise gives the extended cameo of the year as a studio executive, while Tobey Maguire and a slew of other actors make notable appearances. Ultimately it is Downey Jr. who steals almost every scene as the platoon's very white, African-American squad leader.<br/><br/>Rude, witty, and ballsy, TROPIC THUNDER is a great time at the movies. It's hard finding worth-while large budget comedies these days, but DIRECTOR Ben Stiller, supported by a strong cast and a great premise, has proved himself to be the right man for the task. 8/10"
"Kzooisaiah","10","252","449","13 August 2008"," The Best Comedy in Years!
","""Tropic Thunder is a film that understands biting satire. It sets out to villainize the very people that made the film possible. It understands parody and it understands good comedy and delivers consistent laughs throughout. It starts out with a promising bang and from there, continues to revel in its absurdity and wit. The script is sharp and provides a great basis for the humor that spurs the film on, however, it's truly the actors that take it to the next level. Robert Downey Jr's performance as the lost Australian actor is perhaps one of the most standout performances in a comedy. Not only that, but Tom Cruise's Les may just be the engine that brings this film home. Its both ridiculous and a furnace of hilarity. But in all truth, the chemistry within the rest of the cast is undeniable. I would have to caution viewers, this film may not be what you're expecting. Ben Stiller's previous films and even his own written ""Zoolander"" are quite different from the tone and the visuals of Tropic Thunder. And its not just in the profanity or utter gore, its within the concepts behind the film. It dares to go into areas that are politically incorrect and what say may even find on the offensive side. Its not afraid to traverse the areas outside of hands-off comedy. Like I said, this could be satire at is very best, and its got the cast and the laughs to prove it. If you're a fan of balls- to-wall, brazen comedy that isn't afraid of the lines, this will be your cup of tea. You'll be laughing from start to finish and reveling in the ride. It's fresh and that originality carries it somewhere great. There is a total lack of predictability and its shies away from the clichés and THAT is something I think a lot of films haven't been ballsy enough to do."" -another critic"

"scottiejd2000","9","295","543","11 July 2008"," The funniest movie in years!
","I went to see this at an advance showing last night and spent much of the time laughing. The beginning as previously mentioned is extremely creative with a clever cameo from Tobey Maguire and once the movie begins it is non-stop humor from start to finish. The star of the movie by far is Robert Downey Jr who is simply perfect but the real scene stealer is Tom Cruise, though his screen time is limited, his scenes are hilarious. Definitely one to repair the somewhat tarnished image of the past few years. Stiller is his usual self but is overshadowed by Black and Downey Jr. not surprising given the multiple roles he played behind the scenes. Wall to wall cameos, particularly at the end (blink and you'll miss them) and I really won't tell you which the funniest cameo was as that may spoil this gem of a joke....provided you catch it that is! highly recommended movie - I will definitely be heading out to see it when it comes out for general audiences!"
"mummychic12","9","9","12","10 April 2017"," Pretty stupid and irreverent, and HILARIOUS - just make sure you have a good sense of humor going in to it
","I don't even know where to start with this movie. It's silly, and hits on pretty much every major stereotype of all different races, on Hollywood, and the Vietnam War. If any of this offends you, don't watch the movie. If you can laugh at yourself, then you will enjoy it immensely. This movie is insanely quotable like many of my favorite comedies. The characters all have great one liners, but I have to say for me Robert Downey Jr. makes this movie. He plays Kirk Lazarus, method actor, playing Sgt. Lincoln Osiris...in blackface. Like I said, you have to bring your best sense of humor to this movie, but the brilliant thing is that they acknowledge the implications of everything they make fun of, and then continue to make fun of it. The other black character in the movie, Alpa Chino, calls Kirk Lazarus out every time he says something stereotypical. You only have to look at the names of all of the characters in the film to see that there is no stone left unturned, so to speak, when it comes to recognizing stereotypes. Another personal favorite character of mine is Tom Cruise's character Les Grossman (who is arguably my favorite Tom Cruise character of all time because he doesn't take himself seriously for once) as the unscrupulous, vulgar Hollywood executive who only cares about getting his cut for making the movie. The movie ends with a gangsta rap dance sequence in his fat suit, which to me is totally worth it even if you don't like the rest of the movie. If you're into smart stupid humor, you'll enjoy this movie."

","Saw this at the Washington, DC screening on the 10th.<br/><br/>And Got Some I did. A comedy that is not Apatow's is refreshing nowadays. A relentless hard R comedy that fuses elements of practically every famous war film ever made. Beginning with trailers a la Grindhouse for every major character was already a sign of a hilarious film. While most of the humor was ""funny-but-i'm-not-laughing"" the same amount of laugh out loud humor and gags was provided as well, courtesy of mostly Stiller and Downey Jr. Who I wholeheartedly feel - stole the show. I can't say I've ever seen any character like his in a film of this genre, which already I feel will enter the classics. What's refreshing about Thunder is that it's actually original in certain aspects of the storyline; such as when they decide to shoot the film guerilla style in the jungle only to have the director of the film....- I'll leave this at that. A spoof of war films that isn't tireless or idiotic like the recent Epic/Date films... which do not even deserve to be called ""spoofs"". And be prepared for Cruise, who plays the most radical role of his entire career."
"bob the moo","Null","76","143","15 October 2008"," Although it is right on the edge of disaster, the film is actually pretty funny and smart if you go with it
","When an all-star Vietnam film is put in the hands of a first time British director, the results are an ego-dominated shambles that is a month behind schedule after only five days of shooting. Director Damien Cockburn makes a decision that the experiences of ""Four Leaf"" Tayback will be best captured on film by dropping the basic cast in the jungle and forcing them to experience as close to reality as possible while catching it all on camera. Sadly when Cockburn is killed by a mine mere minutes into the mission, the cast are left in the middle of a dangerous jungle, not entirely sure of whether this is real or not.<br/><br/>When I went to see this film I hadn't expected it to be much more than a basic comedy but the reality is that this is a pretty smart satire of Hollywood and movie acting that also produces silly laughs one would expect from a Ben Stiller film. The ""black-face"" issue has been mentioned in regards the film walking a fine line between being funny or offensive but to me the bigger tightrope act is between being funny and being stupidly silly. Here and there it gets very close to falling over that line (eg all of Tom Cruise's stuff) but if you are with it then it manages to just about stay on the right side of the line. The daft plot allows for micky-taking in regards big studio action movies, spoilt actors, bad projects, studio executives and so on  it is never sensible but it is mostly very funny. I think the film doesn't always succeed though because it sort of straddles two stools and those who want one or the other will have reservations while the smaller number who recognise both stools will perhaps see flaws on both. To explain that better I should probably say what I mean rather than referring to furniture and backsides. See as a satire it is undeniably broad and clumsy with the digs being made in clever but still quite obvious ways and you do have plenty of laughs that are knock-about that don't sit with those looking for smart satire. On the other hand you have those who love the silliness of it but don't really ""get"" it when it is trying to make digs even if they laugh their heads off at a character eating blood in the misunderstanding of it being a special effect. Somehow though it just about works by just going all out for it and things like the racial issues, anti-Semitic stuff etc all hang together sufficiently.<br/><br/>The cast are a big part of making it work. Stiller is solid throughout and works his character as well as he makes fun of him. Downey Jr is very impressive as the deep-method actor who produces the controversy. Black is a necessary evil but at least his character's drug addiction makes him of value within the satire even if his performance is still a fat guy shouting. I liked the support from both Baruchel and Jackson, who held their own alongside the starry cast. The rest of the cast include solid turns from Nolte, Coogan, Maguire (great superhero movie reference), Pollack and others are all in the shadow of a great Tom Cruise who to me is the one we should be talking about when it comes to controversy tightropes. He is always about an inch away from being embarrassingly silly but yet he pulls it off.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is not a perfect film by any means. The satire and the knock-about humour don't compliment one another that well but somehow it all works and the majority of the risky moves are pulled off even if it is not quite as clever as it would like to be. To some it will be the stupidest thing they have ever seen, to others  the funniest; the truth is somewhere in the middle and it is enjoyable for it."

They want to make sure no one is filming or taking snapshots of the movie. It is very funny, Ben Stiller is the star and is a fiction action star with lots of films to his credit. While filing in Vietnam they stumble into a war with drug lords who think they are DEA. Stiller and cast believe there are hidden cameras and they are still in production making their epic film. Tom Cruise also stars and when he appeared I told my wife there is Tom Cruise, at the end of the movie she said which one was Tom Cruise? Go figure, he is not playing the Tom we know and love from Top Gun. As the first test audience we answered questions about the movie and some viewers were selected for a discussion panel afterwards. This should appeal to Ben's fans as well as anyone wanting a laugh filled evening."

","I was lucky enough to catch an advance screening of this movie on June 26 in Dallas and let me say that this movie is brilliant. It starts off with fake trailers from the 3 big actors (Stiller, Black and Downey Jr.) and doesn't stop there. The beginning is a tad slow, but once the men get to their ""filming location"" the film picks back up again. The best part of this movie for me, besides the performance of Downey Jr., was the smaller parts contributing to the overall whole of the movie. Danny McBride was hilarious, as was Steve Coogan as first time director Damien. Get ready for multiple cameos in this movie, as there is well over 15 solid ones. The only part I didn't like in this movie was the leader of the gang that captures Ben Stiller, but I quickly got over it and saw the movie as being funnier with him in it. Edgy comedy, mixed with great action and great character development made this movie one of the best comedies I have seen in years and I cannot urge everyone to go see this movie enough.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I had heard a lot about 'Tropic Thunder' about how hilarious it is along with being a sharp satire. A great ensemble cast also raised my expectations. It started great. The spoof trailers were Hilarious, especially 'Satan's Alley'. The starting scene is excellent. But I somehow found the rest of the movie, not so interesting. It is watchable, but not ROFL. RDJ plays Kirk Lazarus, An Australian academy award winning actor ( doesn't that sound familiar? *cough* Crowe *cough*) is hilarious with his stereotypical anachronisms of Africans. Ben Stiller plays Tug Speedman, a falling franchise star whose attempts at serious acting have failed. Jack Black plays Jeff Portnoy, a comedy franchise star who relies on toilet humor. Brandon T Jackson plays Alpha Chino ( Ahem!) And Jay Baruchel palys a novice actor. Sure, the satire bits work. RDJ's character mocks method acting. We get it, but still, is that where the fun ends? Frankly, I expected more. Tom Cruise though, in a cameo, brings in the best laughs, and brings the house down.Watch out for his dance in the end. Overall, I think it's definitely a watchable movie, but a wee bit overrated."
"erikgloor","3","160","377","7 September 2008"," Stupid, but not in a funny way
","Every now and then a movie comes out that leaves its audience asking how in God's name did this film ever get made? How did the pitch go to its producers ...? Let me see if I've got this straight: You want to make a comedy about some pampered actors making a Vietnam movie who are purposely thrown into an actual confrontation to lend some realism to the operation? Then you see who produced the film -- the actual film -- and then you start to understand: Ben Stiller, the star of the movie -- actual and fictional.<br/><br/>Ugh.<br/><br/>When I was a kid my friends and I would get together in my back yard and shoot comical karate movies with the video camera from the AV department of the school where my Dad taught high school biology. We'd ham it up and watch them over and over again, laughing hysterically each time. But even when I was 13, I knew that the reason these movies were so funny to us was because we were the stars and because we got all the inside humor. One wonders if Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr. and the assorted other Hollywood A-listers filling the supporting rolls in this film ever knew as much as I did when I was 13. As I looked around at my fellow moviegoers as the credits rolled on 'Tropic Thunder,' watching Tom Cruise on the screen dancing to some rap song and made up to look like a fat, balding typical Hollywood movie producer, I can tell you with the utmost earnestness, they do not. We all sat there in the dark, waiting for the rest of the laughs a movie with such talent available must surely provide, ultimately. But alas, it never did. Maybe 'Tropic Thunder' is funny to people who work in the movie industry, but I wouldn't know because I'm not one of them -- and neither is 99% of the movie-going audience.<br/><br/>Sure there are a few giggles and guffaws here and there, but 'Tropic Thunder,' can never quite make up its mind about what it is. Is it satire or slapstick? It tries for both but achieves neither. Mostly it's just a lot of crude humor and hammed-up bluster.<br/><br/>I'm no expert, but it seems to me satire works best when you can really focus on the material you're sending up and not distract by randomly introducing strange, unique elements to your story. For instance, in what universe would the head of a jungle-dwelling, gun-toting Asian heroin ring be a 10 year old boy? What are you lampooning? Heroin rings? And its weird enough that a movie director would allow his actors to be set up for real danger on the orders of the movie's producer, so you really don't need the author of the book the film's based on to be a fraud, too. We understand some actors go a little nuts and don't break character, but you needn't conjure up some fictional surgical procedure that allows white people to become black to drive that comic point. You keep all the other constants constant, see, so you can focus on the core humor.<br/><br/>And having no core humor is not an excuse -- though that would surely be the one this film's makers would offer if pressed by an angry mob of moviegoers each seeking a refund. If you've seen the TV trailers for this picture, you've already seen much of the few decent one-liners. And watching Stiller once again set himself up to be hilariously humiliated over and over grew tiresome somewhere around the middle of 'Meet the Parents.' Jack Black's comic talents are squandered. Robert Downey Junior never quite delivers as a Russell Crowe type perpetually lost in a Shaft-esquire black militant role he's playing for the movie being made in the story. Uh, yeeaahh ... that's sooooo Russell Crowe. Matthew McConaughey phones in some whacked out Hollywood agent. Nick Nolte forgettably mumbles up the book author role. And Tom Cruise's performance, as the movie producer, is notable mainly for its clumsiness and bad taste.<br/><br/>Things blow up, people blow up, bats are eaten, disgusting, distasteful things happen. There's a lot of tortured movie-about-movies humor that never really gets any traction. But the problem is you never really care about why any of it's happening and that's often the difference between good comedy and bad. It stands to reason clowny things will happen to a bunch of clowns and that's all this movie's characters are ever shown as. Who cares? Staying in and checking the latest stand-up act on Comedy Central's a better bet than dropping your 9 at the theatre on this one.<br/><br/>This movie review by Erik Gloor."

I like Ben Stiller as an actor and as a director and even here he has a couple of moments but I was depressed by the outcome.

Filled with so-so stars of modern cinema, it is an attempt to be a satire on Hollywood and its maleness/action movies along with a cheap way of getting laughs out of taking the rise out of Platoon, Rambo etc. Tucked away of course is the irony that Hollywood cannot sell an Iraq war movie, but can make a fortune out of a comedy about the tragedy of Vietnam - got that teen redneck dudes! It just is not funny, just a series of apparently good jokes (how Hollywood portrays a black man) totally and utterly stretched beyond any sense of humour. And in doing so, merely repeats the clichÃ©s of martial Americanness - Masters of the Universe - where even liars about their army service get good ol US salvation! And when are the likes of Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Ferrell, Carell, Vaughn, Rogen going to get off our screens? All we get are so-called slacker nerds triumphing at love, war, drugs and all that jazz - the complete and ultimate male fantasies. Of course they do it all with that post-modernist, deconstuctionist, ironic flavour, but, unlike their forebears - Bob Hope, Jack Benny, Jack Lemmon - they are neither funny nor particularly attractive as characters!

"ggulcher","1","116","272","5 October 2008"," Pure and utter crap... and that's generous
","No spoilers but I flagged it anyway - there's no ""spoiling"" what's thoroughly rancid all on its own. Apparently one of the seminar posters who've flooded this film entry with bogus rave reviews found mine ""offensive"" so I'm having to dumb it down (appropriate to its subject,) and re-post it. Maybe these studio employees a tad thin-skinned. Tsk.<br/><br/>Non-standard disclaimer: I only went to this Golden Turkey shoo-in because my significant other had a friend who said it was funny. Now I want to find out who this friend is and... let's just not go there.<br/><br/>First off, I was never much of a fan of Ben Stiller - he always seemed just...a bit dull - until his ""Night at the Museum"" won me over. I was really hoping to get a kick out of this, I really was. Unfortunately...<br/><br/>This is easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I don't say that lightly. Ordinarily I will give points to a film crew just for having created something, even if it's junk, because at least they made an effort. But...no. In this case I'm just baffled. You've got Ben Stiller, Nick Nolte, Robert Downey fresh on the heels of his excellent ""Iron Man,"" the always-pitch-perfect Tom Cruise and Matthew McConaughey, every single one of them turning in flawless acting performances - and STILL you've got one of the all-time worst pools of fermented bat guano ever to stink up a silver screen.<br/><br/>I've said it before, and let me say it again: Hollywood is a sewer. There are no writers left in that town capable of stringing together a cohesive sentence, much less a story with an intelligent premise, admirable characters, an engaging plot or a meaningful theme. They can do lots and lots of fart jokes, impotent profanity, shocking blood-and-guts gore, satire that's unintentionally self-satirizing, and Beavis & Butthead-caliber gross-outs. And that's...about all. I've already expended far more effort in trashing this cinematic excrement than it will ever merit, but I want to warn the unsuspecting. There is a reason why ""reality"" shows crowd television schedules folks, and that reason is: Hollyweird is utterly devoid of writers with functioning brains. Or maybe it's just the full flowering of the drug resurgence - I seem to remember this same kind of vacant crap about the time Fleegle, Snorky and the boys were making their big splash on the Banana Splitz hour.<br/><br/>What ""Tropic Thunder"" was trying to accomplish will perhaps remain a mystery forever. It failed as satire, as comedy, as drama, even as mindless action spectacle. The only other burning question is how it ever managed to get into the Top 10 box office. Yeek. <br/><br/>Avoid at all costs. This is two hours of my life that were essentially stolen from me, and I'm not happy about it."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","9","26","52","15 August 2008"," Hollywood parodies itself and this was absolutely hilarious!
","These past few years we've had a few comedies come out where it does make fun of what Hollywood is today, but they're usually average and get a couple laughs. We now have Tropic Thunder, this movie is a parody of today's Hollywood with random actors in a big movie and succeeds so well with non stop laughs and fun actors. Tropic Thunder is so well put together and was a perfect spoof of the method actor, the comedian, the rapper, and the action star together in a movie, not to mention Tom Cruise, who knew this guy could be so funny? I mean in a movie; but it seems like he had an absolute blast making this movie, everyone looked liked they were having fun and Ben Stiller really did a great job, this was one of the funniest movies I have seen this summer. Coming here on IMDb there were a lot of haters who were just trashing Rober Downey, Jr. and calling this film so racist, after they see this movie, I'm sure their mouths will be shut, because he was the greatest part of Tropic Thunder.<br/><br/>Tugg Speedman, the action star, Jeff Portnoy, the comedian, Alpa Chino, the rapper, Kevin Sandusky, the ""and introducing"" actor, and Kirk Lazarus, the method five time award winning actor. These stuck up egotistic actors/wanna-be's are starring in the new big budget Veitnam War movie, but it's not going so well with these guys who can't seem to get motivated. So the director and author of the book ""Tropic Thunder"" take them out to the real jungle of Vietnam, the guys still think they are doing the movie, but what they don't know is that they are being attacked by real terrorists, way to get motivated.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is seriously one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while, I miss these comedies where the humor is the kind that is just a spoof of real life people. Hollywood today is incredibly ridicules when you think about it and Tropic Thunder just makes you laugh about it. Without a doubt Robert Downey, Jr. stole the show with his controversial character, ""the dude playing the dude disguised as another dude"", going from a white Aussie to a hard core black man, he actually had me convinced, maybe he should be nominated for an Oscar, lol, just kidding, but he was great. Ben Stiller has redeemed himself very much, he hasn't made me laugh so hard since Zoolander. Jack Black was also incredibly funny, I loved his hard core addiction to heroin and how it drove him crazy. I highly recommend this movie, it was so much fun to watch and is guaranteed to have you laughing like crazy.<br/><br/>9/10"
"mkittappa","2","94","218","26 August 2008"," I may have laughed a lot, but that doesn't make this a good film
","I must admit I did laugh a lot whilst watching this, but that doesn't make this a good film, or a good comedy for that matter. Imagine if you will, taking someone on a night out with bunch of your old school friends, mates from a sports team that you play in etc. You have a great laugh at all the in jokes and times you spent together, but your guest cannot see the fun because they just weren't there. Maybe one or two of the stories were funny to outsiders, but for the most part unless you are part of that community it all just goes over their heads. <br/><br/>This is the fundamental problem with Tropic Thunder. I went to see this movie with my wife, and because I work in film production there were many in jokes and nuances that I found funny. I have seen egotistical actors, inexperienced in-over-their-heads directors, crazy crew members, dealt with bizarre studio politics, worked in guerrilla style film making, and shot in unusual and politically unsound regions. Most of the humour in this film relies on the viewer being able to cross reference those experiences with the very exaggerated situations shown here. My wife however, not working in film production missed most of the jokes and came away quite bored with whole experience. Take away the in house laughs and all you are left with is toilet humour, gross out laughs and some send ups of classic Vietnam movies. <br/><br/>It seems that the film makers really struggle to make humour outside of themselves. For instance the Simple Jack retard story about how an action star tries to win Oscar fame by playing a character with learning difficulties in a very bad movie is supposed to be a satire as to how big movie stars can be out of touch with real life subjects. I don't believe that this is intended to be insensitive and offensive to people with learning difficulties, but unfortunately this plot device is executed so badly and pushed so far that instead of lampooning Hollywood stars as it set out to do, it becomes extremely offensive to the very people it did not intend to offend.<br/><br/>I'm assuming that discovering the drug lord is only child is supposed to be funny, but try explaining that to NGOs who work with the child soldiers in Africa. When you look at the lost childhoods, violence and poverty caused by this issue how can this be funny. This is yet another attempt at humour in this movie that failed to hit its mark. Maybe this was an attempt to highlight the issue of child work / slavery problems, but an R Rated comedy like this is quite clearly the wrong vehicle to make socio-political commentary. The plot would have worked just as well if the drug had been a regular guy, and would have been far less incendiary. <br/><br/>The references to Apocalypse now, Platoon, Deer Hunter were quite funny. The Chucky send up didn't quite work for me, but at least I saw the joke and I'm sure Child's play fans appreciated it. Again these were movie in jokes, that relied on the viewer previously seeing the movie that it was sending up, but at least these could be appreciated by anyone who had seen these particular films.<br/><br/>All in all unless you have experience in the movie business there are few laughs to be had with Tropic Thunder. This film is really up Hollywood's own anus. Movies are meant to be enjoyed by all. $150,000,000 of the general public's hard earned cash spent at the box office on a film that generates laughs for only movie insiders is quite irresponsible."

","I have no clue where to begin with this review. This movie is one of the most off the wall movies I have seen in years, yet it does have a plot, and a lot of humor mixed in.<br/><br/>Without spoiling things, the beginning is very creative, and nothing that you would expect. Once past that, we get into the crux of the movie. Speedman (Ben Stiller) and his crew are in Vietnam, working on a movie based on the book ""Tropic Thunder"" and the director and author of the book are on set the entire time. During one particular scene, Speedman is really fed up with his crew, and wants to do his own thing. So, the crew goes back to where they were dropped off, and Speedman does his own thing. Speedman gets captured by a group of people and the crew through getting lost eventually figure out, we are in a movie and have to follow the script they had to find Speedman.<br/><br/>There are so many laughs in this movie, some of it was over the top, but some of it was almost crying laughing. Jack Black plays his usual comedic self, but Robert Downey Jr. does a great job with what his character is. Downey had a lot to deal with, and when you see the movie, you will know what I mean.<br/><br/>Some of the music was placed where you wouldn't expect was funny too, some of it original, some of it songs you have heard before. I had not seen the trailer prior to this, which may be a good thing because I am not sure I would have laughed as much. I am very close to saying pay full price for this, but very little of the humor wasn't funny."

I might've chuckled once or twice - my wife made not a peep. The audience we saw it with - in a theater that was about half full - chuckled here and there, though, not consistently and never with the entire crowd.<br/><br/>Frankly, this is a poor film on every level. Setting aside the so-called controversy - Robert Downey in black face! Ben Stiller playing mentally retarded! - what exactly was the point? Lots of big name actors with almost nothing to do - I wonder what attracted Jack Black to this film, as he's left with pretty much nothing to do, except roll around in his underwear. Matthew McConaghey is wasted in the stereotypically slimy agent role and Tom Cruise goes way over the top with his bald hat and fat suit. I've seen comments that this is the movie that's going to revive Cruise's career - my guess is, is that this will be the final nail in the coffin.<br/><br/>When I saw the previews for this, I didn't laugh once, but, I thought 'well, it seems like a funny idea.' But, it's not even an original idea - how many movies have we seen that make fun of spoiled Hollywood actors? Talk about an easy target - and, yet, this movie couldn't even get that right.

I was also surprised to see a boy about the age of 12 in the movie(he appeared to be with his Mother).

The acting was actually terrible too (despite having so many celebrities in it).<br/><br/>The worst thing by far however, was the script - what on earth was Ben Stiller smoking when he wrote this??? It was just dire and painful to watch. It was devoid of any talent whatsoever - I cannot believe that Ben Stiller of all people, could have written something so completely unfunny. I actually used to think highly of Ben Stiller (he was brilliant in Meet the Parents) - not any more I can tell you.

It seems that a movie can be terrible, badly written, unfunny, completely talentless and still get praised highly only because of the A-list cast being in it.<br/><br/>A lot of the scenes were also very offensive to certain groups of people and totally unnecessary.

The trouble is that despite filling it with stars, Black, Coogan, Stiller, Cruise, Nolte et al they forgot to fill it with jokes and any they did put in are puerile and akin to the level of a Farley Brothers gross out, which meant that I only laughed once and that was more of a stifled guffaw than a laugh out loud. Tom Cruise only seems to be in the film to swear and do a silly dance which considering he does that now on every show he goes on to promote anything just seems stale. The story if you can call it that is so loose it almost falls off, the saving grace is the music which is what you'd expect from a Vietnam movie all Rolling Stones and Buffalo Springfield.

There are good things about the movie like Tom Cruise's amusing part as a sleazeball studio exec and Ben Stiller playing with a real decapitated head even though he thinks it's prosthetic. These two good things are not enough to save it. Overall skip this entirely in theaters and go watch Mummy 3 instead you'll be far more entertained. What an unfunny embarrassment!"

Nobldy laughed and one third of the audience did walk out before the end. Maybe it was a great inside joke for film makers, or actors, but I was very disappointed.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller fans are probably getting their fix, but it has been awhile since he did anything really funny. Jack Black was underused. He was truly a third wheel.<br/><br/>Some interesting cameos. However, I am amazed so many beg name actors were willing to play a part in this awful movie.

","A movie about a group of actors subjected to the mercy of the jungle and an organised band of heroin traffickers isn't a typical pitch for a comedy, but man, it really, really works.<br/><br/>It's the hilarious performances of the star-studded cast that make the movie so great. The film is blessed with the likes of Jack Black, Matthew McConaughey, Tom Cruise, Ben Stiller and Robert Downey Jr. (as well as many more), all of whom were perfect for their roles; Tom Cruise as a bald, foul-mouthed studio executive and Robert Downey Jr. as a white Australian / black soldier (no, that isn't typo) are by far the funniest performance of the movie, almost every scene the each of them were in had me crying.<br/><br/>One thing I will say about the movie, and this isn't a fault per say, is that it goes into maximum overdrive with the gore, action and explosions, and isn't concerned about treading over toes when it comes to what some may perceive as more sensitive topics such as mental retardation and race; the jokes made are obviously not malicious but if you're looking for a clean comedy or have a (very) low tolerance for those kinds of things then you won't enjoy the film. You have been warned.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is just oozing layers of satire and parody, is jam-packed with an A-list cast, explosions and manages to find that balance between obnoxiously crazy and obnoxiously safe with great success. Easily one of the funniest and most enjoyable movies I've seen in a while, just fantastic."

","Tom Cruise was hilarious, Jack Black was marginally funny and everything else just sucked. I went for a bathroom break during the last 30 min. just to have something else to look at. I LOVE Robert Downey Jr., but his character was so dull it was almost physically painful to watch. And Ben Stiller? Good grief- he needs to drop all Zoolander-ish roles pronto. That's exactly how I would describe his character in this movie- Zoolander get stuck in the jungle. Nick Nolte seemed bland to put it mildly. I'm completely stunned that someone of RBJ Jr's caliber would have anything to do with this movie. He must have lost a bet. To say that he was slumming would be the understatement of the century. At least Tom Cruise proved he can still be funny- and without jumping on couches or punching the air. Save your money."

He has had some great comedies and he's had some mediocre ones. This is at the bottom of that list. The cast is good. That is the only positive note that was hit. The stars could not manage to rescue this out of the discombobulated hash of sight gags and buckets of references to body parts. It was too much to ask. Yes, there are plenty of things for people to find offensive in a variety of ways. A lot has already been said about this so if you are easily offended you won't be in this audience anyway. Movies that are offensive have been made before and will be again. But some of those movies are also funny. This one isn't. Judging from the people around me, I am not alone in this conclusion."

","I went to see this film as I noticed it had Jack Black in it, and I thought he was so funny in things like Empire Records, and School of Rock, (and also in Tenacious D - some of his music vids are superb like Tribute). But then I go and see this and I am seriously let down. I expected Jack Black to be totally off his head proper rock-n-roll style, going in attacking the enemy in a proper rock-n-roll style like he did in School of Rock, but for most of the film Jack is pretending to be a stoned out actor, that can't concentrate on anything but drugs for more than five seconds. There was one or two funny bits in the film, like the Panda scene, the bat scene and the bit where Jack is going cold turkey and is tied to the tree, but the rest of the film was the most boring load of rubbish I've ever seen. All the actors were supposed to be actors from rubbish movies, making a rubbish movie that turns out really good, but this film just makes really good actors look really rubbish. Possibly the worst scene in the whole film was the Forrest Gump bit where they make fun of Forrest Gump, I think that could have been so much funnier if Jack Black had been doing that and it had been about someone who was ADHD, 'cos then Jack Black could really have gone off on one in his usual hypo style. I also found that Forrest Gump section very insulting towards people with disabilities, I have Asperger's and ADHD and found it really poorly done, without any consideration for people watching the film who have learning disabilities.<br/><br/>After seeing this film it certainly has put me off going to see any of Jack Blacks other films."

","Depending what direction your moral compass points will determine whether or not you enjoy this movie. I don't know what Ben Stiller was thinking when he crossed the line and dove head first into the ridiculous. I found myself unable to laugh at the failed attempts to shock humor us, I actually found myself cringing and embarrassed that they would try to get someone to even chuckle. I am a huge Stiller fan but this movie went way below any expectations I could have imagined. This movie had such potential if it would have only been made in a way that focused on intelligent creative humor and not trying to grab a cheap laugh from a severed head etc. I may be the exception but out of the 12 people in the theater I heard 4 laughs during the entire time I was there. I did leave about 30 min. before the end but I can bet it didn't get many more. I hope that after this disaster Ben will return to the kind of scripts that made him a superstar in the comedic world of film.

At least they all stretched their limits a bit (Meant with the most sarcasm I can type with.) Luckily Jay Baruchel and Brandon T.

Holy moly... what movie was everyone else seeing? Tom Cruise, who was unrecognizable, only cursed and generally made an ass out of himself. Matthew, I'm the most annoying movie start ever, McConnehay just was himself... annoying! Robert Downer Jr was the only remotely entertaining part in the movie.

","This movie started off so well and could have done with out the 3 million F-word utterances. The premise of a war movie in a movie and the black Downey Jr, the director getting killed early on and the guerrilla style he intended to use had the beginning of a great movie. Then it literally gets flushed down the toilet. I was embarrassed, frankly,and the radio station who was running the screening should be embarrassed for promoting and backing such a disgusting film. The only good part was Downey Jr and his best scenes were in the trailer. I remember someone in another movie saying that just because you can do something, doesn't mean you should. The writers and producers could have gone the route they did and ignore a more acceptable thread with the movie, but they chose the easy way instead of the respectable meaningful route. <br/><br/>The route that could have seen this movie realize it's fullest potential of a classic fake war movie being made inside a great drama. Where the actors could have taken their roles more seriously and dove deeper into who they were trying to be. Downey's character hints at such a thing but he is overshadowed by Stiller's immaturity and stupidity and Black's inability to remain mature. I'll bet good money that someone will make such the movie these guys couldn't make , maybe even me, I'm a filmmaker. And perhaps, while Stiller and Black pout in their seats, I'll be collecting my first Oscar for the movie they could not make."

Perhaps talking to 3 years olds has damaged his brain, and so he can only write humor that 3-10 year olds would find funny.<br/><br/>Movies I have liked recently include Iron Man, The Dark Knight, Juno, Hellboy 2, and even Jumper and Wanted were at least entertaining.<br/><br/>I put this movie at the bottom of the barrel, as I have only walked out on a few movies in my life...it's a stinker.

I had no interest in watching a movie that resembles Twisted Metal. Anyways, long story short, I ended up loving Death Race and hating Tropic Thunder. Seeing it last was a mistake too. I was falling asleep. My complaints for this movie is that it's made out to be soooo goddamn funny and it's not. It has some good jokes here and there (mostly by RDJ) but it's not a comedy treasure. That quote from the trailer after the movie came out, ""You'll Be Quoting This Movie Forever"", is seriously wrong. It should say, ""You Will Be Quoting RDJ's Lines Forever"". Also, Jack Black, who I usually like and I think is funny, sucked in this movie. He barely does anything in the movie or help it progress. It was a waste to have him in it. I'm a big fat guy--I could have been in the movie as his character and it would be the same thing! Ben Stiller, who gets a lot of flack, was okay in this. Although the Simple Jack thing was a little funny (when they show the trailer) it became really annoying. I am also disabled but it didn't offend me.

Just about nothing happens after this point that's remotely funny. Tom Cruise's character was terrible all he does is yell and curse.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this movie but in the end hated everything about it, biggest waste of money I've ever spent at the theaters. Many people I know feel the same way about this movie. Go rent Dumb and Dumber."

","Rarely can so much money have been spent to so little effect, or for so few laughs.Like the recently released, ""Step brothers"",a funny idea is stretched too thinly over too long a period, and snaps and destroys itself.Awash with in-jokes,visual references to other films and other ""knowing"" material which was probably quite funny in the set trailer park after a few beers, the humour does not survive the cold light of day.<br/><br/>Stiller, who writes, directs and stars in the film (always dangerous territory) implodes with the self indulgence of it all, and his sister Amy, listed as script supervisor appears to have been absent for the gig.In De Palma's magnificent ""Carlitos Way"", Sean Penn plays a part so removed from the norm that it is possible to forget that he was in it, whilst revelling in his character's performance.Here, Tom Cruise is virtually slapped across your face before the final ""reveal"".<br/><br/>I smiled a few times, but didn't laugh once, no-one did at the screening i attended.Which is a shame, because the idea of a war film that turns real does have some decent comic and dramatic possibilities. Few are explore though, as the stellar cast of actors amuse themselves by having a good time - amongst themselves.<br/><br/>Lees money, a smaller cast, shorter running time and a better script were the solution.Avoid."
"grzes-5","2","11","20","13 October 2008"," Worst ""comedy"" I ever watched...
","As an action movie, it is OK. Visual effects, extreme cinematography, dynamic montage, dozens of explosions, hundreds of ammo fired and so on. But as a comedy, it is hopeless. Dull dialogs, probably intended to be funny, but they aren't - they are just stupid. There were only few moments in the movie which caused me to laugh, but it's not enough to call it comedy - actually, this amount of humor is typical rather for action movies (like ""Lethal Weapon"", or even ""Boondock Saints""), but these movies don't claim to be comedies. This movie is Action - and nothing more. Bad humor, no convincing plot, no suspense.<br/><br/>So, if you liked ""Rambo"" and ""Commando"", you will probably enjoy this movie. But if you want watch something funny, rather avoid this movie."

","Ben Stiller receives a ton of goodwill from me. Asides from looking like a thoroughly likable person, he's been in a couple of films which I have loved. Worringly he has also been in more films that I haven't. In fact, it is hard to remember the last time a Stiller film made me laugh. As I walked in to the cinema to see Tropic Thunder my fingers were crossed.<br/><br/>It started off brilliantly. The first five minutes were guffaw inducing, popcorn spilling nuggets of comedy gold. It was like bumping into an old friend and picking up where we had left off. Then reality set in and for the rest of the film it felt like watching the old friend disappear into something he was not.<br/><br/>The story felt as though it had been butchered from a once promising idea. At no point during the film did it deserve my suspension of disbelief. If, as a film maker, you are going to ask me to suspend it at least fill in the gap. As this was a comedy, give me laughs. There weren't any I can remember. I know the Cruise moment was meant to be funny, but to me it wasn't even close to raising a smile. The crudity and attempts at offensiveness were sad to watch. Surely Stiller has more talent than that?<br/><br/>This is a film about becoming detached. Detached is exactly what Stiller has become. It's as though he has lost sight of what makes something funny. Hopefully he'll be found sooner rather than later!<br/><br/>Maybe I just missed the irony and subtle subtext? That's what I'm clinging to because I still want Stiller to succeed. My hope is that he resets his dials and gets it right next time because any more dross like this and he'll end up relegated to that strata of the last resort DVD rental when all the good films are out."
"dbborroughs","3","11","20","28 August 2008"," Not my cup of blood
","I hate Ben Stiller. Actually I really dislike him. Some times he's okay some times he's not. I find his sense of humor often obvious and stupid. So with that in mind is it any wonder that I had problems with Tropic Thunder? The plot of the film has a director of a mega-action epic unable to control his stars and in desperation drops them in the jungle with some notes telling them to make it up as they go along. The problem is things instantly turn real, though the dunderheads don't realize it at first.<br/><br/>Scattershot film satire on Hollywood is often too much of a not so good thing. Beginning with one of the bloodiest sequences in any war film (its so over the top that its played for laughs even as it disgusts) the film drives head long at deflating everything Hollywood and superstar. No one and nothing is left unscathed. The problem is that the humor runs from dead on to brain dead stupid. Much of it seems to be funny if you're on the inside of Hollywood, which I'm not so the performances fall flat. Tom Cruise's much heralded portrait of a studio exec left me scratching my head yea he's like a lot of management people I know but whom ever he was referencing was lost on me.(How funny one finds the film seems to run in relation to how much knows about Hollywood. The more my friends know the funnier they find it, the less they know the more they dislike it) Other bits like the now infamous ""retard"" discussion are really well done on an intellectual level, but at they don't work as performed. Stiller is much to knowing in his direction and you never believe he's not aware that the camera is right there with him.<br/><br/>The easiest way to know if you're going to like this is know if you find Ben Stiller and his films like Zoolander and Cable Guy funny. If you do you have a shot.<br/><br/>I liked it in pieces and in theory but not as a whole.<br/><br/>And yes Robert Downey is excellent as a white guy pretending to be black."

","I was expecting one decent joke in this film, one piece of humour that would make me laugh properly. But no. My journey to the cinema was more amusing than anything in this awful attempt at a comedy. The funniest part of the film, which wasn't that funny, was when Ben Stiller's character throws that child off of him and off the bridge. I thought that with the likes of Jack Black and other members of the cast that it would be better than it was. The plot wasn't particularly good either. The only thing going for this film is the actors in it who have put their names to it. I just hope i will learn from this experience and not pay to go and see a film as amusing as a funeral."

","Here in Israel, most movies have an interval inserted at some point so that they can sell more popcorn. It was significant that several people left at the interval and did not return. My girl friend and I discussed leaving too, but didn't. This movie, and its critics on this website, demonstrates the different perceptions to what is funny and what is not, on different sides of the Atlantic.<br/><br/>Yes there are funny moments in this film, some very funny, but not nearly enough in its 107 minutes. It was strangely quiet in the cinema we saw this film in. Perhaps the best fun was trying to work out who was Robert Downey (a great favorite of mine) and Tom Cruise. Others have commented on the story so I won't repeat it.<br/><br/>Just be warned. Unless you are a great fan of American humor, you will not find it very funny at all.

Also the film didn't serve any kind of twist or message or plot so therefore it should only be watched if one likes this kind of humour and entertainment.<br/><br/>All in all i found the film to be a good reflection of our times, in the sense that the modern attitude is a quick thrill or laugh no matter how cheap or at what expense (of another person or stereotype). If it wasn't for Robert Downey Jrs extremely tongue in cheek performance that took his stereotype role to the limits this film, for me, would have got a 1 or 2 star.<br/><br/>However: If you like the following from a film you will like this one:<br/><br/>*Relentless satire.

The caliber of the acting line-up was pretty good, and the character development, even the characters that were superfluous to the story line, was pretty good. The language was a little over the top, even considering that it was an attempt to keep the tone in line with the characters that were being portrayed. I would be surprised if the sort of person who would consider going to see a movie like this would find it offensive.

","But not me!<br/><br/>Ben Stiller directs, stars and co-writes this spoof action movie that sees actors making an army jungle movie forced to rely on their acting skills to survive a real life jungle hell: The kicker being that they don't realise they are fighting for their lives. Joining Stiller in the cast are Robert Downey Junior, Jack Black, Brandon T. Jackson, Jay Baruchel, Nick Nolte, Steve Coogan, Matthew McConaughey and Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>Making a decent profit at the box office and garnering more critical praise than not, Tropic Thunder has more than proved its worth and reason for being made. However, that's not to say it's universally a good film, because it isn't. Comedy is naturally objective, so shall it be with the spoof or parody movie, for every Airplane or High Anxiety there is a Scary Movie 4 or Epic Movie. Evidently Tropic Thunder has etched itself into the hall of fame of great spoof pictures, something which baffles this particular viewer. In fact I would go so far as to say that without Cruise's brilliant comedy performance (yes you read it right) this would/should be bargain basement fodder. A shame since I like almost everyone involved in the film. It's just that to me the joke wears thin after the first quarter, the characters become annoying (particularly Downey Jr.) and Stiller and his team have to resort to ""Retard"" and ""Drug"" jokes to fill out the running time. Neither of which were funny in the first place.<br/><br/>Power to you if you had to hold your sides in when watching this, and fair enough if you are mostly forgiving towards Black and Downey Jr. because you be fans of theirs.

"Turfseer","2","13","25","29 December 2010"," Stiller's Vietnam War action film spoof is as bad as the films it attempts to satirize
","When Ben Stiller first approached Robert Downey Jr. about acting in 'Tropic Thunder', Downey was quoted as saying, ""this is the stupidest idea I've ever heard.""  Stiller reportedly replied, ""Yeah, I know—isn't it great?""  Somehow, in Stiller's mind, 'stupid' is equated with 'funny'.  Nonetheless, 'Tropic Thunder' was tremendously successful at the box office which I believe had little to do with the puerile script but more with the action sequences and special effects that appealed to the male teenage and young adult audience.  I'm reluctant to concede that Stiller has any talent in the area of screen writing but as a director of action sequences, he probably can hold his own with most of the action sequence directors out there today.  <br/><br/>'Tropic Thunder' begins with some mildly amusing takeoffs on movie trailers and commercials. Rapper Alpa Chino (Brandon Jackson) promotes his 'Booty Sweat' energy drink and Stiller as Tugg Speedman in Scorcher VI: Global Meltdown where each sequel seems the same as the other.  Less successful is Jack Black's obnoxious 'The Fatties: Fart 2"" which consists of Black playing each character in a fat suit and farting continuously. The final trailer, 'Satan's Alley', starring Downey's ""Kirk Lazarus"" and Tobey MacGuire feature two monks attempting to repress their sexual longings for one another.  The takeoff is obviously designed to satirize such gay-themed movies as 'Brokeback Mountain'; it's a good way to start a comedy but things begin going downhill almost immediately after the opening sequence.   <br/><br/>'Thunder' calls for a complete suspension of disbelief as to the plausibility of the plot.  I wondered why Vietnam would ever allow an American film crew to film a movie written in the style of the jingoistic 'Green Berets'.  That's where the film-within-a-film is initially being shot but the locale shifts to Laos (or possibly Myanmar) after the spineless Brit director Damien Cockburn is ordered by studio head Les Grossman to get his actors back in shape after the picture goes way beyond budget in the first week of filming.  At the suggestion of the author the film is based on, Tayback (who is later unmasked as a fake Vietnam veteran), Cockburn sets up cameras in the jungle and is assisted by his pyrotechnics expert, Cody, to create explosions which are designed to bring verisimilitude to the film. The cast is ordered by their newly self-actualized director to take a trek through the jungle with a hastily patched-together script as their guide. <br/><br/>I realize that 'Thunder' is not to be taken seriously at all but how do the filmmakers actually capture the footage which is later turned into an Academy Award winning documentary at the film's end?  They would have to have thousands upon thousands of cameras placed in every nook and cranny of the jungle to capture what the actors are doing.  I assume they later used surveillance footage from the Dragons' own cameras when the cast were being held captive in the heroin dealers' lair. But even so, Tayback and Cockburn's idea to create the documentary is too ludicrous for even a silly film such as this.  <br/><br/>There is little to gain by rehashing Thunder's amateurish plot.  Suffice it to say it involves the kidnapping of Stiller's Speedman character along with Cody and Tayback (Nick Nolte) by a goofy Flaming Dragons gang.  The rest of the cast must earn their mettle by saving their buddies from the gang, despite the fact that all their weapons are mere props.  'Thunder' is supposed to be a satire on action films but by the time Stiller and his gang win their brownie points, you can't tell if this is really a satire or simply a bad action picture.<br/><br/>Stiller's main problem is a lack of imagination. For example, he'll come up with the bit about Kirk Lazarus dying his skin black and refusing to break character until we almost reach the film's end. How much can we take of Downey doing his shtick ad infinitum? The same goes for Stiller's 'Simple Jack'. According to Stiller, 'Jack' is not making fun of mentally handicapped people per se but rather actors like Dustin Hoffman who portray a caricature of an idiot savant in 'Rainman'. Stiller doesn't seem to realize that the idiot 'Simple Jack', is a far cry from Hoffman's brainy eccentric. Some people might find a Goofy Gumby such as 'Simple Jack' to be funny but after about ten minutes, can't we move on to something else? 'Thunder' intentionally is designed to be in bad taste but occasionally the films' scenarists ruin the comic tone by going too far. One such moment is when they actually kill off the director Cockburn; another moment is when Speedman kills a lovable Panda.<br/><br/>I wouldn't go so far as to say that 'Tropic Thunder' is the worst film of 2008 but it comes close. The make-up department however does deserve an award for making Tom Cruise unrecognizable as a sleazy, Hollywood producer."

A casting couch? What is the deal, he can't act, simple as that. Then there's Jack Black, he overacts and is not at all funny. Ben Stiller is not even worth a mention here because his movies, with the exception of ""Meet The Parents"" series and a few others are bombs. The action scenes where the huey's were orbiting and the A4's came in to do their bombing runs, were pretty cool. The druglords were humorous as was Alpa Pacino. Robert Downey Jr. was wasted as were other characters of the team. Matthew Connaughey had a minor supporting role, but, he played it with his usual good-hearted abilities. Tom Cruise, drop him, without revealing anything, even his talents were wasted by a poor script and being teamed up with less than adequate actors."
"axsmashcrushallthree","3","13","25","8 January 2009"," Too politically correct to be truly memorable

I missed it in theaters, but grabbed it on DVD.<br/><br/>I was initially positive about it, but after a retake, I broke down. It's certainly well-mounted with great production values and good performances, but loses its way in the overt attempt to entertain and hand-hold the audience that dooms most foul-mouthed comedies to unmemorable mediocrity. Too many parody and satire sequences are played so broadly that one laughs at the spectacle rather than the subtle jabs that really could put it above most junk out there.<br/><br/>And that's really a shame, because I've seen it all before, and more importantly because Stiller and company just nail it in a few small truly memorable exchanges, most of which include Robert Downey, Jr. People describe the obvious ""Heart of Darkness"", ""Platoon"", and ""Rambo"" references, but the script quotes and alludes to so many films, producers, and actors that it's a virtual beehive of smack.<br/><br/>To put it succinctly, I think that Stiller and Company wanted to make a sharp, biting satire on the business, but felt the need to couch it in a typically raunchy, pedestrian framework in order to bring in the largest possible audience (and the largest cash flow).<br/><br/>And what's left? Just F-bomb country and small organ mentality, particularly from that hog of a Jack Black. All of this is a bit too politically correct for me, and therefore, in a sense, the film parodies itself. Upon reflection, I can only give it a 3 out of 10 simply for the exchanges between Downey and Stiller. <br/><br/>It's not too hard to imagine that Downey could receive an Oscar nomination for this because that's what the world of film has come down to - a world where subtlety and thought is drowned in frantic excess."

Losers like Jack Black (Kung Fu Panda, School of Rock) and Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man, and other films today's theater generation doesn't care about). He even got Tom Cruise out from leading his tyrannical cult and beating his wife to play some pointless role. As usual, it all falls flat in an instant.<br/><br/>Probably the most prominent aspect of this film is Downey Jr. in blackface. Groups and organizations have come up protesting the film for its derogatory usage of the word ""retard"", but so far, nothing about blackface. Whatever.

","There seen to be only eight ways for humans to reference themselves. Only 5 are considered possible though I have encountered six I believe. Rarely, three are present here.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr is an actor on-screen. We never lose sight that it is he. He plays an Australian actor, loosely based on Heath Ledger. Postproduction took out some of the more obvious references to Ledger after his death and to point more to Russell Crowe, but it is clear that the transforms noted here are of the type encouraged in Australians and practiced in Batman.<br/><br/>That character, surgically transformed, plays an African American. But it doesn't stop there. Like many black men, this one plays a character, a role. Some jokes with the ""real"" black man (who has done something similar) highlight this.<br/><br/>Since this inner, inner, inner, inner, inner man is selfconsciously in a film, he mugs. That's five layers of identity, three of them abstractions. No one alive today could pull this off I am sure. Depp probably when he was younger. A few actresses alive could, but even they have been lazy recently. So this is something of a special experience for me.<br/><br/>Stiller, who wrote this, creates a simpler set of folds for himself, just so that we don't miss what this is all about. We will be aware of the by now common layering of writing, directing and starring, but Stiller is the first that I know to do it like Woody does, backwards, with the character creating the writer instead of the other way. Once in the movie proper, he adopts a role of a simpleton, something he is forced into but anchors the same way that Downey's character to the fifth does.<br/><br/>The encounter between these two quantum logical persons isn't written as cleverly as we wish  how could it be?<br/><br/>As an incidental effect, Tom Cruise gives us a character that nearly redeems a career of energetic inadequacy. That alone might have been worth it, especially given the religious contexts. But Downey? A prince. A prince.<br/><br/>I had dinner with a regular reader last night.

","Believe it or not Ben Stiller was once very funny <br/><br/>"" That's right Theo . In one film with Cameron Diaz "" <br/><br/>You've just given away the punchline so shut up and don't interrupt again . But that sums up Stiller . THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY is a double edged sword . Even for someone like myself who is not keen on the comedy genre that film was exceptionally brilliant and for years afterwards everyone looked forward to seeing Stiller in a film that if it was a fraction as funny as THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY would still have been a classic comedy . Sadly it didn't happen and by the time TROPIC THUNDER came out audiences had given up on Stiller . This is a great pity because TT is a scathing satire on Hollywood and anyone who classes themselves as a movie fan will love this <br/><br/>It hits the ground running and we're treated to some smart spoof trailers and the film continues in the same vein where Hollywood is making a Vietnam war epic and the over wrought nature of it is matched by the fact it's over budget and well behind schedule and this is the least of the problems as the cast of method actors are about to be kidnapped by violent bandits .<br/><br/>There's somethings that are recognisable to the satire . Obviously this mock film owes direct references to APOCALYPSE NOW and PLATOON but they go a bit deeper than this . I take it Kirk Lazerus is a hybrid of Russell Crowe and Daniel Day Lewis while substance abuser Jeff Portnoy is inspired by Philip Seymour Hoffman ( Which wouldn't have been evident at the time ) while Stiller's character one time movie Idol whose stardom has almost disappeared might be a direct nod to Tom Cruise . Actually the one possible failing of the film is Cruise in the role of Leo Grossman , the cynical and ruthless studio head . Cruise doesn't do cynical or ruthless and he fails to convince as a heartless philistine anymore than he convinces that's bald and short sighted . This is a small failing and rightfully the film concentrates on the dilemma faced by a mob of method actors stuck in a dangerous situation"

","First of all, I would like to say that I noticed some great comments about this movie, so I decided to take a try although it looked pretty much rough to me at the beginning. First couple minutes of movie were enough for me to judge that it wasn't fun at all. I have nothing against Ben Stiller, in fact, I liked some of his movies, but this one is pathetic, enormously aggressive with some sort of sick humor. There were some funny scenes, I admit, sarcastic-sort-of humor, but the rest of it was something like confessions of a psycho frustrated person.<br/><br/>If you watch the movie, you can clearly sense that it is a sort of parody, but far away from Scary Movies or some similar parodies.<br/><br/>Making a movie - that's art (well, clearly, this one isn't). What happened with good movies, the artistic ones with good story lines and general impressions? To make this sort of movie, so called parody/comedy, I think you need a ""good healthy humor"". So, to be honest, I find this movie extremely pathetic with awful dose of bad humor. Sorry, but if this sort of movies are going to become stereotypes of ""good"" movies, than the art of film has already disappeared."

I managed to sit it out for the full duration of a painful 107 minutes, being left dumbstruck at the sheer awfulness of the entire film. The over emphasis of the gore was the only entertaining part of the film. Mediocre, if not poor playing of parts only added to the true shock of the film. If this was an attempt at satire, maybe Ben Stiller and co ought to sit down and have a re-think of the meaning of the word. No wonder Ben arrived at the launch night looking so pained.

Rober Downing Jr. is the only reason I give this movie a 4. His ridiculous portrayal of a black soldier had me smiling every time he uttered a line. Jack Black is average as always unless you give him a comedic gold script.

","This is the new worst film I have ever seen. If fails for two reasons. First, it's not funny. Second, it attempts to parody war movies; a foolish and dangerous task at any time, made now absolutely inconceivable considering the current state of US military affairs. Traditionally, war movies have served to allow veterans to describe their experiences to the general audience. These films have helped veterans reintegrate into society and have helped veterans shape society for the better by educating those who don't know about the horrors of war (The Best Years of Our Lives (1946) comes to mind). A parody of war movies can only be a parody of veterans war experiences and of war itself. And we all know that war is f------g hilarious. The only people you have a right to make this film or laugh at it are the veterans who have served and bled. The civilian viewers of this film will use it to assuage their discomfort, guilt, or fear about war, current and past, by making themselves believe that war is just another silly benign aspect of their superficial lives. The message received: ""Worried about the meaning of your country's involvement overseas? Don't be, it's no big deal...war movies aren't reality-based, it's all just Hollywood b----s--t."" There is nothing to laugh about here. I invite the actors of this film to immediately join actual combat units, as grunts, and complete full tours out on the streets of Iraq or in the hills of Afghanistan. This film purports to make fun of Hollywood, of its superficiality. I say, Hollywood, you can't wipe your hands clean just by making fun of yourself as if to say, ""Yeah, about those films we made which you watched before you signed up and got yourself killed...Uh yeah, we were just f------g with you. We were actually just trying to make some money."" You did make the money and you are making the money, and it is blood money. So, if you are truly contrite, actors, put your self-parodied superficial lives away, and come do a real tour. Then, when you're done, you can tell us how f------g funny war is, and how those war-films are so bogus, you panty-waste c--ksuckers. Otherwise, shut the f--k up. However, if you wish to continue if your current vein, may I suggest your next film, Ben Stiller, be a parody of Schlinder's List? You might also considering making parodies of films about 9-11?"

","Granted, I only saw this movie because I lost a bet on a football game (damn Colts) and I went into the theater with some bias against, well, everything about it I knew from the trailers. Despite that, I did not think this movie could have been worse than the previews made it look. I was wrong.<br/><br/>This is yet another ""summer block-buster"" that clubbed itself in the head before it even left the starting gate. It did so by having trailers repeated ad nausea that give away the punchlines to the more entertaining jokes in the movie. By the time you make it too the theater you have no reason to laugh at the black-face routine that Robert Downey Jr. puts into the show because you have most of the lines memorized already, whether you like to or not.<br/><br/>As for the stuff that was not in the trailers: gee, Ben Stiller and Jack Black star in a comedy about dopey white guys stuck in the jungles of Vietnam, so I'm going to assume there will be a joke involving a monkey at some point. And let me guess, the climax of the gag will be the monkey throwing poop at someone? Am I right? Yep. 100 f***ing percent correct. Even if you haven't seen this movie, the premise and jokes are already crystal clear, and therefore lose any impact before they are even played out.<br/><br/>I hated Ben Stiller for the longest time after being dragged to see ''Along Came Polly'' with a friend when the movie I wanted to see, ''Big Fish'', was sold out. However, I know he can act in good films. Examples being Wes Anderson's ''The Royal Tannebaums'' and a cameo in episodes of the HBO series' ""Curb Your Enthusiasum"" and ""Extras"" (Stillers cameo as the director in the war film episode marks what I think is the best show in the regrettably short-lived series). <br/><br/>This is another example of an actor who's popularity causes Hollywood to throw crappy type-cast scripts in their direction along with huge checks they'd normally be crazy to turn their backs on. It has happened in the past with Jim Carrey (who broke up his terrible movie streak with ''The Truman Show''), Rob Schnieder (who still makes bad movies, just less volume these days), Mike Meyers (see Rob Schnieder), and Jack Black (who broke up the bad streak for a second in ''Be Kind Rewind'', but then got back on the crap wagon just as quick as he seemed to be off).<br/><br/>Downey Jr. was the only reason this movie received a rating any higher than one star out of ten. Downey is a seriously good actor who can take on dramatic roles on a regular basis, which is why when he does comedy it seems more out of the ordinary, and thus much funnier. This result is comparable to other actors like Don Cheadle, Samuel L. Jackson, Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio. However, it was all Downey could do with this script to not have a funny quip or anecdote stomped upon in the following sequence by a cliché slapstick routine or poop joke involving (mostly) Stiller and Black.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor, never make a bet with a serious consequence you are not absolutely positive you'll win, and DON'T EVER EVER EVER SEE THIS MOVIE!"

How could that go wrong? Thankfully Robert Downey Jr. is in this movie; he saved me from slitting my wrists. He and Brandon Jackson as Alpa Chino have some genuinely funny exchanges, and his comic timing is once again impeccable. Jack Black, usually reliable, is given almost nothing to do. Even Danny McBride, hilarious in Pineapple Express, gets nothing to do here.

"Screen_Blitz","9","6","10","12 April 2017"," Ben Stiller's Hollywood satire fare is subversive and audacious, yet wildly funny
","Ben Stiller's Tropic Thunder is a comedy that opens the door to arguably the most clever and groundbreaking spoof of Hollywood politics ever to put to film. This action comedy hybrid makes the score not solely on outrageously belly laughs, but tackling original ways on poking fun at the extravagant world of Hollywood and perhaps the entertainment business itself. Director and actor Ben Stiller serves as the hefty hand for bringing this subversive comedy to life in ways that without a doubt questionable and have stirred up a fair amount of controversy. At the same time, he makes an inspiring achievement at bringing birth to one of the most audacious, yet funny comedic vehicles in recent years. Opening up with fake four trailers introducing the four main characters each as Hollywood actors, this movie follows the story of a film crew lead by English filmmaker Damien Cockburn (played by Steve Coogan) who must lead a group of prima donna actors including: Tugg Speedman (played by Ben Stiller), a Sylvestor Stallone-like action star, Jeff Portnoy (played by Jack Black), a comedic star of a popular comedy franchise known for flatulence jokes, rapper Alpa Chino (played by Brandon T. Jackson), Kirk Lazuras (played by Robert Downey Jr.), an Austrailan actor undergoing a controversial blackface make-up alteration to portray an African-American soldier, and Hollywood newcomer Kevin Sandusky (played by Jay Baruchul). These actors are making a Vietnam War movie based on the memoir by U.S veteran John Fourleaf (played by Nick Nolte). Frustrated by the actors' incompetent acting skills, Cockburn is adviced by Fourleaf to drop them into the the jungles of Vietnam where they are forced to rely on their acting talent to survive against a dangerous Vietnamese drug cartel. <br/><br/>This satirical action comedy operates not only as a near-endless cornucopia of raunchy sex jokes and snappy comedic dialogue, but also a fresh source of smart (and hilarious) spoofs of popular war movies. Opening up the story is the characters in their fictional acting forms performing a gruesome, yet appropriately unrealistic combat sequence pays a sweet homage to Oliver Stone's 'Platoon'. While the special effects including explosions going off and the sight of an actor disemboweled by an Vietnamese bayonet serve as shocking eye meat, the humor is what sets the tone of the story. From there on, the plot settles in with the lead characters dropped off in the jungle of Vietnam where their filmmaking experience turns into a dangerously real 'Apocalypse Now'-like adventure with plenty of snappy meta humor and social commentary of the showbiz thrown around and about. Although Ben Stiller is not well-known for pushing the envelop with audacious humor, he manages to stretch the boundaries with character sporting dubious tropes that very few (if any) cinematic entries are capable of even getting away. One of the attention-grabbing is his character Tugg Speedman's loathed portrayal of a mentally impaired farmer named in a film within the film 'Simple Jack' which has raised the eyebrows of many including the mentally handicapped community. Though some will be able to engage in the satirical purposes behind this fictional figure, there is a certain level of offense that shouldn't be ignored. Another questionable of course, would be Robert Downey Jr. playing a race- altering role in the form of blackface that while adds to some witty satirical commentary, can also be seen as a rather bold move. <br/><br/>Ben Still makes an astounding achievement of assembling an overwhelmingly inspiring cast to the screen, blending the crowd with some comedic veterans and more dramatic actors. And joining the ensemble cast is director Ben Stiller himself as the main character Tugg Speedman, who serves as an action star drawn as a homage of Sylvestor Stallone in the popular 'Rambo' franchise. Stiller breaths plenty of charisma and comedic fever into the role, it is hard not to admire. Grabbing the public attention is Robert Downey Jr. playing an African-American soldier who suits as an opposite of his real-life caucasian persona (both within and outside the film). Downey proves himself charismatic in the role, and brings major appeal to his otherwise controversial character. Jack Black, stepping the role of a Chris Farley-like comedic star, adds some good comedic touch as does Brandon T. Jackson as the Ludicrous-like Hip-Hop star. Jay Barachul is good, but brings nothing truly memorable due to the limit in which this character is written. Danny McBride as the pyrotechnics operator does his job here. Playing Speedman's agent is fellow Matthew McConaughey is makes a surprising on screen presence. But arguably the most shocking performance displayed on screen as Tom Cruise who sports a bald cap and fat suit to portray a foul-mouthed studio executive who goes trigger-happy with sprouting F-bombs every minute he's on screen. While his performance does shine, the biggest shocker is learning who is the character is as his bald cap and fat suit render him completely unrecognizable, especially as the actor is somewhat of a stranger in the comedic territory. <br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is a wildly entertaining take on Hollywood satire, generated with outrageous laughs and powerfully appealing performances an inspiring cast. At the very best, the film marks not only an exhilarating entry in the comedy genre, but also an inspiring demonstration at Ben Stiller's directing chops. This movie doesn't hold back on being wildly irreverent and audacious with humor, but that's the good news."

","For some reason I ordered this on DVD (it was released this weekend). I had glanced at the IMDb score and thought ""Good score, must be a fun way to kill a couple of hours..."" How tragically and naively wrong I was.<br/><br/>Clearly the IMDb rating has been influenced or manipulated in some way by those with a vested interest. Nothing else could explain the current rating in relation to the vast majority of reviews.<br/><br/>So please pay attention to the following message: DO NOT BUY THIS FILM ON DVD - IT IS BEYOND DREADFUL.<br/><br/>I buy a lot of DVD's, but I am actually really angry that I wasted £10 on this, it is so staggeringly poor. I truly wish I could get my money back as I feel conned.<br/><br/>OK - the film. Well, many others here have already commented, but I am moved to say that rarely has such a total lack of talent been put before the public. I liked Stiller in ""Zoolander"" - pithy and clever. I quite like ""Night at the Museum"", and ""Meet The Parents"" was good fun.<br/><br/>""Tropic Thunder"" on the other hand is a whole different barrel of excrement.<br/><br/>Given that it is written by, produced by, scripted by, directed by and starring Mr Stiller, I can only conclude that a/ he has not watched the film himself, or b/ it is noble of him to take the blame.<br/><br/>Some key points: - The script is incoherent, as is Downey Jnr (and most of the rest of the cast).<br/><br/><ul><li>The script is desperately poorly written.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The plot premise is promising, but squandered in minutes.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The opening two minutes of the film (the spoof trailers) are the only amusing part of the film. It then goes off a cliff like a weighted Artic carrying a lorry load of lead balloons.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It's crude and crass. Not funny crude and crass. Just nauseatingly puerile and unpleasant. I can't even suggest it is schoolboy humour, as it isn't that sophisticated.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>It isn't satire (satire is intelligent and makes a point). It isn't a spoof (a spoof is ludicrous and funny). It isn't ""comedy"" either (comedy makes you laugh and smile). It is actually almost a new genre entirely of it's own.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Jack Black is the worst he has ever been, and his character - a bloated ""comedy star"" obsessed with hard drugs is so repellent that I spent the entire agonising length of the movie with my face a fixed mask of horror (according to my better half who also attempted to endure this).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Tom Cruise achieves staggering new heights of embarrassment. His rabid expletive ridden tirades are not biting satire, they are just cringeworthy and forced.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Nolte is pointless and looks uncomfortable as if he has a horrible sinking feeling throughout. Matthew McConaughey, a great actor when he tries, gives his best shot. But given that his character is effectively one joke which isn't funny in the first place, he is on a hiding to nothing from the start.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Steve Cougan actually manages to be the best actor in all this hideous mess, and he is dispatched early on anyhow. I think he should be grateful as he is the only one to escape with a shred of dignity.</li></ul><br/><br/>The stellar cast must be appalled at what Ben Stiller has created. Overblown, pointless, unfunny visual diarrhoea with no discernible redeeming qualities whatsoever. Surely Mr Stiller will never again be able to persuade such actors of note to take part in another debacle.<br/><br/>It saddens me that at no point in the pre-production process did someone have either the nerve or the knowledge to say ""Hang on a minute Ben, this just simply isn't funny."" Ben Stiller has committed the cardinal film making sin - a comedy that is not only devoid of any laughs, but actually so poor it is offensive to a viewer with any level of discernment.<br/><br/>Having just about managed to watch it (a supreme act of will in itself), I feel insulted and scammed out of my money. I turned to my wife and said, ""That was possibly the worst film I have seen in a decade"". She not only agreed, but used one of the overused expletives from the movie to describe her dissatisfaction at a wasted 1hr40min of her life.<br/><br/>If I could give it less than one star I would."

","With this cast I expected so much more from this film. I guess it can be blamed on the writing and the direction but I am not so sure. It is not that good and not that funny. Shooting a war film that goes way over budget some one gets the bright idea to move the film site to the real jungle. There they run into real bad guys, drug dealing bandits. They are lead by a kid which I find very hard to believe, especially in Asian society. Stiller is captured by the bandits and thinking it is part of the movie tries to play it so. He is recognized from a previous role and is spared from further torture. The remaining cast of not heroes find him and attacks the site with weapons that are loaded with blanks. Fortunately the explosive expert and her not really a Vietnam war veteran show up, rig some charges, and save the day. I will not watch this movie again."

","I was really disappointed with this film after all of the pre-DVD launch hype and good IMDb ratings. Apart from a very few funny moments, which I still laugh about now when I reflect on them. The start to the film is reasonable, but again has been hyped as fantastic by reviews all over. there is the odd funny reference to other Vietnam type films, but i still can't fail to see why it has all been hype'd up. In my opinion the Tropic Thunder start is smashed apart by the similar scripted element in Appocalypse Now! I believe that Tropic Thunder, again in my opinion, is a very poor film trying to make money more on the marketing and hype surrounding it. Don't let this put you off watching it, but if you want my advise rent it instead of buying it."

Months ago I rented it, and my wife and I gave up 30 mins in, realizing we hadn't even sniggered once at the film (tho we did at the fake trailers that precede the film). Seeing that the film is on some 'best of 2008' lists, I gave it another shot. Still no cigar! I could find nothing to laugh at in this film. I'm not offended by the race and handicap portrayals that offend others, but I simply did not find it remotely amusing. Nothing. Not once did I laugh.<br/><br/>I love comedy of all sorts (tho perhaps have a bias to Brit comedies), and simply cannot understand what people are finding funny in this. I suspect many of the movie reviewers appreciate it more because they're 'in the business'... I find Office Space funny for that same reason. But for everyone else, what are you laughing at here? This is no classic comedy. It's far beyond a lot of other dismal comedies that hit the market (eg those appalling 'spoof' movies), but there's not much going for it. All of the characters were one-joke ponies. The visual humour was stretched. Much of it was simply pointless.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm getting old..."

The extremely self-centered, shallow and just hilariously clueless actors, which are well-delivered by the cast, make you laugh constantly. I specially love Robert Downey Jr. playing the actor trying to play a black man through hilarious racial stereotyping.<br/><br/>Towards the end however, the film itself resorts to using exactly the same devices it has been making fun of throughout. The characters suddenly become all-American action heroes who band together to defeat the evil Asian drug-smuggler, while toting guns and tossing tired one-liners (sigh). Even though it seems like this is done on purpose by the makers in order to further the satire of the film, it takes the whole experience down several degrees and makes it boring to follow.<br/><br/>At the end even the caricature of the heartless, abusive film-executive Len Grossman suddenly becomes an OK fella with a big pat on the back. I guess they just can't help themselves...<br/><br/>After thoroughly enjoying two-thirds I felt disappointed in the lame events that close the film."

","Tom Cruise, Jack Black, Ben Stiller. I would never go out of my way to watch a movie just because it starred one of those three. In fact, I would normally avoid watching movies if it starred one of them because I usually just find them too annoying to pay proper attention to the movie itself. However, in Tropic Thunder all three of them put forward performances that had me laughing from start to finish. Especially Tom Cruise, I totally did not expect to enjoy it nearly as much as I did. The plot, script, and acting in this movie are beyond what you would normally expect in a fun summer blockbuster, and with the way comedies seem to be going down hill lately, I think this movie deserves to be remembered as a classic standing above all others. Where as most action/comedy movies tend to focus too much on the comedy and fail to deliver on any serious action scenes (The Other Guys, Pineapple Express) this movie perfectly blends some truly hilarious moments along with amazing set piece explosions and action sequences more befitting a Michael Bay movie. If you haven't already seen this one your missing out and I highly recommend giving it a chance. There hasn't been a better comedy made since this came out over ten years ago now."

","Tropic Thunder is full of all the satires of big Hollywood stereotypes. The action star, the method actor, and the comedian who relies on farts and nothing else. Staff Sergeant John ""Four Leaf"" Tayback's (Nick Nolte) memoir ""Tropic Thunder"" is being made into a movie. Action star Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), Australian method actor Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.), drug addicted comedian Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) rapper Alpa Chino (Brandon T Jackson), and newcomer Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel) are the stars of the film. Because the film is running on a tight schedule and risks being shut down by producer Les Grossman (Tom Cruise) director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) is forced to drop Tugg, Kirk, Jeff, Alpa, and Kevin in the middle of the Vietnamese jungle to shoot the movie guerrilla style. But strange things go on and eventually the actors are forced to act like real soldiers. Tropic Thunder is a load of fun. All the jokes are funny and it's so satisfying with a bunch of quotable moments. It's not a movie for everyone but for those are not easily offended, you will have a blast."

","This film is part of a limited, but toxic genre, a category I call, ""Gene Wilder Gone Mad"". It is driven by vanity,(Stiller's) and his mistaken belief that anything he does is hilarious. Unfortunately, we are left to fast forward around him to get to the nuggets of talent that characterize Downey's tour de force. Much sound and fury,about less than nothing.<br/><br/>By contrast, it is astounding to watch Downey present us with simultaneous layers of an actor-within-an actor within an actor walking through a meaningless film while stepping back to remind the cast and us that it's only a movie.<br/><br/>Downey's take on acting black--or is he ""being"" black, is in stark contrast with the film's take on Asians, reminding one of Brando's comment on Larry King's show several years ago. in which he described Hollywood as the most racist of cultural centers.<br/><br/>And then there's the surrealism of Tom Cruise's performance; astonishing!

","This movie is a disaster. Renaming it to ""Tropic Blunder"" may hurt the ego of its producers but would be truer to what the audiences should expect. The film is gory and disrespectful of war veterans and people who have risked their lives in the Vietnam war or in any war. Gore and blood are enmeshed together with cynicism and insensitivity which we are to take as some deep form of artistic reflection on the evils of war and violence. Ben Stiller proves yet again that while he can be a good comedian when someone else directs him he does not live up to the job of directing. The film is filled with cursing, profanity, and sheer stupidity to the point of becoming unbearable. However, we must admit that there are several funny and witty lines in the disastrous dialog. One of those rare moments is when, Robert Downy Jr.'s character, who is a white man pretending to be black, gets into an exchange with the other African American in the group about the phrase ""you people."" Downey Jr.'s acting is still impressive, even in the midst of poor plot and writing. Besides these ""pearls"", which are few and far between, the flick is simply bad, bad, bad. And it is not funny.

"alexkolokotronis","9","15","33","6 January 2009"," The Grand Finale to the Age of Parodies
","Tropic Thunder may not be a great movie by general standards but when it comes to the genre of comedy it is pretty far up there. Especially considering that comedies are just not as popular or respected as they used to be. Particularly that of parodies but Tropic Thunder maybe the last successful parody for a long time. <br/><br/>The performances all around were just laugh-out-loud hilarious. Ben Stiller of course led the cast. Although I tend to dislike Stiller his performance was not over-acted as he seems to do in many of his movies. Robert Downey Jr. who probably gave the funniest performance or somewhere in the realm of that from the cast of characters. His role as Kirk Lazarus, the 5 time Oscar winner, who then for his next role would play a man of a different ethnicity was humorous enough in itself but his performance took it to another level. His lines were witty, smart and maybe not so smart which combined to make one of the funniest yet gratifying performances I have ever seen. Then of course there was Jack Black who many people felt got the low end of the bargain in terms of screen time in material and that maybe so but he had quite a few moments that made me laugh about as much as any of the other actors did. Then of course there was the many of cameos by widely respected and famous actors. The most impressive one from Matthew McCounagey, Nick Nolte and Tom Cruise was in fact Tom Cruise. He played Les Grossman, a loud mouth conceited producer of the movie that Stiller and company set out to make. His comic timing was simply perfect and was my favorite of all involved. With this performance he might of paved another way to keep his career a success. He is quite a talented actor but still his performance in comedy caught me and probably many other people off-guard. At first the idea of him getting an Oscar nomination seemed crazy but as I think about it there weren't many supporting performances better than his this year.<br/><br/>The writing and directing was also done very nicely. Some of the material that was given to the actors to work with was phenomenal especially that of Robert Downey Jr. Of course though the many mockingly made jokes at the Hollywood and the film industry was done in a very nice subtle way, like a true parody should. Also some of the action surprisingly from the movie was done surprisingly well. What was really good though was the casting. Like many other parodies, the art of using the cameo to generate laughter was used very well. The cameos of the many famous actors involved all contributed to the movie, they were not rushed into the movie but used for a purpose.<br/><br/>In light of many recent parodies such as Date Movie, Scary Movie etc., it is very obvious that this branch of comedy seems to be dying off in movies. It is very possible that after Tropic Thunder there really won't be another good parody let alone a respectable one. Even without all of that Tropic Thunder is one of the most hilarious movies I have seen in a while and I would say is a must see."

Way to go Ben Stiller. Make fun of people that are not able to defend themselves. I don't make fun of your height or lack there of.<br/><br/>Also, I think this is a perfect example of how one actor's fame should not be an excuse for blackface to be re-introduced in film. I don't care how famous Robert Downey Junior is or how much he makes per film. Wearing black face is offensive. Anyone who is entertained by this aspect of the film contributes to the promotion of racism. Way to go Ben, aka William West.

I now have to voice my opinion, if you are expecting a typical Ben Stiller comedy where you actually will laugh, this movie is not for you. There isn't anything funny about this movie, other than people giving it good reviews. It looked so promising, it had a totally original idea and great comedy actors, yet none of the potential was reached. The script is horribly written and the dialogue is just as bad. The worst part about it was that there is no funny jokes or situations in it. I know this movie has been attacked for making fun of certain groups of people, but that isn't why it should be attacked. It should be attacked for wasting peoples money and time on a poorly written and definitely not funny comedy. By the way 5 out 10 is being gracious!"

Jack Black's character in the film w/in the film is great, w/ a constant stream of rapid-fire Vietnam War phrases which will delight those familiar with the lexicon.

Poor Jack Black is relegated to running around screaming. And as for Tom Cruises much hyped cameo. Who cares? It would have been funny if he spoofed himself, but there were no Scientology jokes.

"Chrysanthepop","Null","11","24","28 October 2008"," Tropic Laughter
","As a director, Ben Stiller comes up with an awesome amusing satire/spoof that pays homage to classics like 'Platoon', 'The Deer Hunter', 'Rambo', 'Crocodile Dundee', 'Apocalypse Now' and many more. Stiller and co-writer Justin Theroux have done a good job in the writing department. It's got some of the funniest dialogues I have heard in a long time. It couldn't have been easy to make a spoof using references from so many classics and at the same time remain a smart film but these two do a fine job. The plot might is brilliantly infused with humour and homage. The dialogues, acting, overall sense of humour and satire put it much higher than the usual daft comedy.<br/><br/>Clearly their intention was to create something fun and it also looks like the cats and crew had a blast during the making. Contrary to what many have stated, I did not find anything remotely racist or offensive about it. It's a spoof and while some movies of the genre might go a bit too far towards being derogatory, 'Tropic Thunder' stays within the limits and remains funny.<br/><br/>Then of course there's the stellar cast that includes Ben Stiller, Nick Nolte, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr, Tom Cruise, Matthew McConaughey and Steve Coogan, all of whom work together brilliantly. Stiller is pretty much Stiller. He's likable and carries off the lead role well but it is Jack Black and Robert Downey Jr. who stand out. They have the funnier scenes. While goofy comedy isn't anything new to Black, Downey Jr. does an excellent job in playing an Australian actor who plays a fake black man in a war movie. I did a lot of laughing out loud after watching these two. Tom Cruise springs a hilarious surprise as a bald, hairy, vicious, pompous, foul-mouthed film producer and adds to the laughter quotient and Steve Coogan is equally superb as the poor director who is pressured by the studio and who isn't taken seriously by his cast and crew even after his end.<br/><br/>Perhaps the script could have been a little tighter if so many things were not left open to interpretation, such as why that particular island was chosen to get the actors to 'act'. But then again, there's plenty of entertainment to let something like that get in the way. Also the TiVo sequences were a bit overdone but McConaughey does a good job<br/><br/>making a fool of himself with an irritating performance. I wished that his character would be brutally murdered. A few of the jokes were overdone like Ben Stiller tasting the blood from the decapitated head. I did miss a bit of feminine presence as there is hardly any woman.<br/><br/>Overall it is a finely executed film with some sharp camera-work and slick score. The action sequences are well shot. It's a great movie to watch with a bunch of friends and laugh about. I know I'll be revisiting it soon."
"GrandpaBunche","8","11","24","14 August 2008"," Very funny, and just hand Robert Downey Jr, the Oscar right now!
","I'd like to take a moment to suggest the Academy nominate Robert Downey Jr. for Best Actor. Seriously, his performance in TROPIC THUNDER was a comedic masterpiece that deserves recognition and the film wouldn't have been half as fun without him. Oh, wait. Maybe I should review the movie! TROPIC THUNDER is ostensibly a satire of the rampaging excesses of Hollywood and focuses on the making of war movie being shot in Viet Nam that's hampered by a newbie director and its borderline insane lead actors. When the director admits to the film's tyrannical producer that he's lost control of the production, he's advised in very profane terms that the only way to deal with out-of-line actors is to get mean, so, spurred on by a suggestion from the 'Nam vet author of the memoir the film's based on, the director drops the film's five principals off in Myanmar and tells them he's going to shoot a down-and-dirty, semi-improvised bit of footage that'll get the actors back on track putting them to the test in the rough, with minimal crew and supervision. And then the doo-doo hits the fan in all manner of ways, several of which are potentially fatal to all involved.<br/><br/>That's really all I can say without giving away the comedic surprises  you'll note I've taken pains not to discuss most of the cast; you'll discover it all for yourself  but I will say that what starts out as a ""Eff you"" to Hollywood turns into more or less a straight-up action-comedy about halfway through the movie, and while it's still quite funny its shift in tone and focus is somewhat strange. But that's not much of an issues when you have Ben Stiller as a clueless action star, Jack Black as a manic and unwillingly detoxing comedy star, and a host of others willing to look and act like complete and total morons and assholes, with Downey's balls-out nutjob Australian uber-thesp who's so ""method"" that he get his skin surgically darkened in order to portray a black character.<br/><br/>Affecting a ""ghetto"" accent and rocking a theoretically-scary-to-white-folks facial intensity, Downey's a total pisser from start to finish and I have to applaud him for taking a role that if mishandled could have resulted in him being torn limb from limb by irate black people whenever he set foot out of his house. I swear I haven't laughed at anything so hard in a long time and it should be made clear that this is not a blackface role, but is actually a study of a guy who's completely insane and won't drop character  he states that he's there to make a movie and won't go out of character until he records the DVD commentary  even when the plot takes a scary and incredibly dangerous turn.<br/><br/>TROPIC THUNDER is by no means perfect, but it is funny and it gains points for Downey and Ben Stiller's jaw-droppingly un-PC nod to nauseating and offensive allegedly star-making performances that involve actors portraying the mentally handicapped. You've probably heard about the controversy over the film's allegedly insensitive usage of the words ""retard"" and ""retarded"" and the protests over its supposed hurtful and mocking intent, but it's quite apparent that the protesters have not seen the film and are aware of the use of the derogatory verbiage out of context. As used in the movie, the offending terms come from the mouths of people we're clearly supposed to see as clueless, self-absorbed egomaniacal assholes, and the way they use the words paints the users of the terms in a highly unflattering light; the film does not mock the mentally handicapped, but it does mock the insensitive Hollywood jerkoffs who exploit them in order to garner critical kudos by turning in ""sensitive"" and ""heartwarming"" performances in movies like THE OTHER SISTER, RADIO and I AM SAM.<br/><br/>So take my word for it and check this one out in the theater. Just make sure you don't miss the coming attraction reels (HINT, HINT)."

","I live on Kauai where the movie was made, so I had to see it to see all the local places and people used in the film. I have enjoyed almost all of Ben Stiller's movies...but this is his wake up call. Ben...get help. You're not funny anymore. Using the F-word every 7 seconds does not make people laugh. It offends them. And That's just for starters. This could be the worst, most unfunny, most offensive movie of the decade...possibly of the century. There was only one likable character in the whole film (and it wasn't any of the stars). How can you enjoy a movie(that is supposed to be a comedy), when all the lead characters are crude, mean, self-centered, amoral jerks. What a waste of studio money. What a waste of my money! The only thing worse that this movie existing is that some parents brought their small children to see ...and....some people saying they wanted to see it again. God help America!"
"CuriosityKilledShawn","4","7","14","19 September 2008"," Why does Tom Cruise?
","There's nothing in Tropic Thunder that you haven't seen Ben Stiller spoof before, and spoof better, in five minute clips such as Mission: Improbable or Die Hard 12: Die Hungry. His character of Tugg Speedman is yet another one of his many un-self-aware stereotypes like Derek Zoolander or White Goodman.<br/><br/>Besides this, what is most disappointing about Tropic Thunder is the fact that Stiller had all the pieces to make a truly great and sublime comedy, but he messed it up. Yes, I did laugh here and there but I'm afraid that most of the jokes miss the mark and the comic timing is a little bit off. The randomness of some scenes defy the internal logic and seem like they belong in a different film.<br/><br/>I was wishing for a sharp satire on modern Hollywood, but all we get are unironic bad-taste gags. The fake trailers in the opening are the best part. The cast are mostly wasted, and the motivations of their stupid actions seem to be lost on them, the actors they are playing and the roles those actors are playing. Get your head around that. I think that Stiller got a little muddled when writing the script. They never really kill anyone and we never know if they are firing blanks or not. And if they are, why don't they pick up some real guns when they have the chance?<br/><br/>It's better than Zoolander by a million miles, though it's really sad how a film this flat and uninspired blows the box office away while something like Last Action Hero, a very similar film which is a hundred times as good, ends up being a flop and laughed at whenever it's brought up in conversation.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor, skip Tropic Thunder and spent the night inside with the DVD of Arnie's misunderstood 1993 epic."

What a contrast! Ben Stiller was typical old Ben. This is probably Jack Black's least funny movie that he has taken part since King Kong.<br/><br/>The over all message of the movie is that actors have no lives getting lost in their roles and movie producers (Tom Cruise) exploit them for what they are worth buying them off with money. Having said that, the type of movie-goer that will find this movie really funny will not pick up on that message. I was disappointed and this movie (Tropic Thunder) is now on my list of worst movies of 2008.

","Lights, Camera & Action!!! Just what i expected: non-stop laughs, action, Ben Stiller being Ben Stiller, Robert Downey, Jr. stealing the show, Tom Cruise's funniest role of his entire career, up and coming actor Brandon T. Jackson showing us everything from his arsenal and Jack Black finally being him old self at being very crazy and absolutely hilarious!! Tropic Thunder is an instant comedy classic and will have you laughing out of your seats a bunch of times, it is better and funnier than Pineapple Express & Step Brothers in my opinion and just blew them out of the water!!! Being a Ben Stiller fan, i think this is his best film since There's Something About Mary. What Robert Downey, Jr. did for Iron Man, he did for this movie and quickly becoming one of my favorite actors and definitely gets an Oscar nod from me for either the roles of Tropic Thunder or Iron Man. Jack Black did a great job at finally doing his special talent: making people laugh and haven't been doing that since Nacho Libre (I thought that was his funniest movie since, that movie was very funny, in my opinion.) For those who wants to know what Tom Cruise did, i'll give you two big words: FREAKING HILARIOUS!! He was absolutely crazy and had me falling out of my seat every time until his role came to a close!!! And for Brandon T. Jackson (mostly everybody don't know who he is but i think this show should refresh your minds: Nick Cannon's Show: Wild N'Out.) He also was in 2005's Roll Bounce with Bow Wow. He was amazingly hilarious with the back and forth action between him and Downey, Jr. Well, the movie was hilarious throughout and had my sides burning just what expected from the movie and it's a comedy classic!! Cut!!! My work here is done."

"Bravesfan17","10","6","12","21 May 2010"," The funniest work from Ben Stiller as an actor, writer, and director
","Ben Stiller is one of my favorite actors out there, and shows some real ambitious work in writing, directing, and producing Tropic Thunder. This movie is not trying to be offensive to anyone. Stiller's movie is making fun of all the different kinds of actors.<br/><br/>The opening is hilarious in smart in introducing who all of these characters are. From the commercial for Alpa Chino and his Booty Sweat drink to the fake trailers, Stiller shows us who these characters are.<br/><br/>Stiller plays Tugg Speedman, an actor well-known for doing a lot of action movies hoping to show some serious acting work. Stiller is funny in his portrayal as an actor who has hit every high and low point in an acting career. Tugg Speedman is still vying to be a serious actor even after his director Damien Cockburn, played by Steve Coogan, dies from stepping on a land mine.<br/><br/>Jack Black is funny as Jeff Portnoy, a well known comedic actor who is trying to show that he is serious. He is funny with some parts, but Black doesn't have that much to do.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. steals the show as Kirk Lazarus, a 5 time Oscar winning actor who takes every role he does really seriously. Kirk Lazarus is so serious that he goes through pigment changes to play the platoon's African American sargeant. Downey is brilliant and has the funniest lines including: ""I know who I am. I'm the dude, playing the dude, disguised as another dude."" He is that good that I don't think anyone else could play that role as well as Robert Downey Jr. has.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise also steals the show as Les Grossman, a really mean executive producer with the dirtiest mouth ever. Tom Cruise is just flat out hilarious and nobody can do the dances that he does. Cruise shows that he can do some real comedy.<br/><br/>There are also some funny characters in Alpa Chino, as the rapper who is trying to make it as an actor, and in Kevin Sandusky, a young aspiring actor who is working with his idols.<br/><br/>Stiller is not trying to make fun of anyone other than actors, which is what Tropic Thunder is about. This movie is funny, original, and one of the best that Ben Stiller has done."

For those who walked into the theater to see this movie,assuming you saw the trailer, and came away shocked at the content in the film I can only come to the conclusion that you, like Tugg Speedman, are indeed a retard. Robert gave a superb performance and I believe his career is thriving right now. There were other great performances but overall I was shocked at how well Ben Stiller, who I never really gave great mind to, could write such an intelligent comedy. This is one for the ages that would even do the likes of Mel Brooks ""blazing saddles"" homage. For just about the entirety of this film I found myself laughing as I have not laughed in years. I seldom write reviews but was compelled by this film. It really is good and if you have the right since of humor, and are not easily offended, I think you might just have a great time watching this.

"cheriekeane","7","11","27","25 July 2008"," Thunder with little Lightning
","I'm Black and I saw Tropic Thunder (TT) at a screening on July 9. The movie as a whole is a funny satire of the Hollywood culture and the movie making process. (A bit like a comedic version of the documentary ""Lost in La Mancha"" with Johnny Depp from 2002).<br/><br/>Now, for Robert Downey Jr.'s (RDJ) performance as a Black sergeant: I didn't find it offensive, and he pulled it off by walking a very fine line between being overly empathetic with Black men and simply attempting to mimic/copy their ""perceived"" mannerisms.<br/><br/>I'm female, and I know a lot of Brothers, so to see a white guy try to earnestly mimic what they perceive as the ""essence"" of what a Black man is, is comical and an interesting sociological study in and of itself.<br/><br/>RDJ seems to boil that essence down to the tone and cadence of his voice, and into the dialogue his character speaks. He drops his voice an octave, speaks in a staccato style, and spouts a lot of African American proverbs (old sayings). RDJ isn't terrible, I wasn't offended, but I would shudder to think of less-talented white actors trying this. Also, the younger Black soldier played by Brandon T. Jackson keeps RDJ's character in check, so that he doesn't wander over into what could easily be an Al Jolson-style minstrel performance (which one could argue Tom Cruse's portrayal of a studio exec fond of rap music, does).<br/><br/>For action movie fans, there are plenty of explosions, and some gory violence, so you should be very entertained (this is definitely not for children). I didn't much care for the subplot involving the Vietnamese drug ring's obsession with a mentally disabled character (think Sean Penn in ""I am Sam"") played by Ben Stiller's character in a previous movie. This makes the movie feel too long, even though it clocks at under 2 hours.<br/><br/>Stiller and his co-screenwriter clearly highlight those aspects of Hollywood movie making he wishes to send-up: Matthew McConaughey's portrayal of an agent/manager obsessed with enforcing the most minute details of his client's contract.<br/><br/>Or Alpa Chino's (character played by Brandon T. Jackson) insistence, that he's charitable in purpose when selling ""Booty Juice"" -- complete with a roster of rap video 'hos -- so that he can donate the proceeds to charities which help the Black Community. That these videos do more damage to the community than any charity donations could ever undo is lost on the character, which may be Stiller's point, but it is probably too subtle a point for most black you into rap culture (and the Record industry Executives who continue to sign and promote artists who make this type of music) to pick up on.<br/><br/>I also didn't enjoy Jack Black's character as a drug-addicted, star of comedic movies (It's hard to make drug addiction funny, in my opinion).<br/><br/>I did thoroughly enjoy Jay Baruchel's performance as one of the only actors in the movie with real-world experience in the military. A refreshing discovery even though his role is limited.<br/><br/>Had Stiller kept the movie as a comedic turn on the documentary ""Lost in La Mancha, I believe he would have been more successful movie.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 6.5/10<br/><br/>Screenplay Concept: 8/10 Script clarity/execution: 5/10 Performances: 6/10"

Although the criticism that it slows down following the initial setup of the premise is valid, the jokes become a lot more subtle. Ben Stiller does a great send-up of Tom Cruise and Cruise himself does a hilarious setup of studio bosses. Jack Black's heroin-fueled comedian-trying-to-do-legitimate-acting-work is a bit one-note. As always the weakest part of the film is Matthew McConaughey who is just awful. The best part of the film is watching Robert Downey, jr. go all-in betting his recently resuscitated career on a very controversial character. HI-larious."

","Tropic Thunder is sharp, funny and very entertaining comedy which gives no mercy to the actors or the people involving to the film making.<br/><br/>Opening sequence gives many laughs. It doesn't really mock the great war movies but ables the film makers to show how great parts can be used again with funny spices in the mix. The rest is the big party of great performances. The plot has been thought very well. There is a one action star, one funny man and of course you have to have a method actor. Robert Downey Jr hits the home run as the serious drama, method actor from Australia (Hmmm... I wonder who have they had on their mind?) who takes the acting on the whole new level. It isn't no wonder Downey Jr. was noticed by the Academy Awards and for a such a funny performance! Tom Cruise parties in the role of a producer with a mean mouth. Other cast is also in the order.<br/><br/>In the movie there is so much great stuff that a great movie buff can really enjoy. I am a great fan of the Academy Awards and it is always funny when someone questions the criteria what movies or performances gets the nominations.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is one of the most funniest movies in the of 2008!

"curtis-8","6","5","10","15 August 2008"," 15 Years Too Late and a Lot of Laughs Too Little
","I just saw Tropic Thunder. It wasn't bad, but it didn't live up to expectations. I can honestly say that I enjoyed Stiller's last directorial effort, Zoolander, much more than I did this flick. For me TT has two major flaws. Firstly, they couldn't decide whether they were filming a spoof or a satire--spoofs have jokes, satires have bitingly comic themes. Some of Stiller's jokes are goofy, laugh out loud surreal Zoolander-type stuff spoofing war movie clichés, but a lot of the movie is more like a social satire of the modern movie business, with characters behaving in non-joke ways to joke situations. And the two styles don't mix well in this movie. I think Still had way too much time to think about the screenplay over the years and was very, very interested in the story and characters, but couldn't resist sticking the cheap jokes in there as well--which take us as the audience out of the story and characters. Two styles in conflict. Secondly, the genre Stiller is using to spoof and as his springboard of satire, the Viet Nam War flick, is one that would have last been relevant to do a take on about 15 years ago. I mean, really--visual quotes from Platoon and Rambo? Those flicks aren't old enough for true iconic nostalgia and not current enough for most folks to really ""get"" the spoofing.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's an OK picture. Not much more. Maybe a really skilled director could have done more with it, but Stiller is still more of a performer than a director."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","6","13","14 August 2008"," A terrific Hollywood spoof and blend of comedic styles
","We've seen plenty of Ben Stiller comedies, we are very familiar with Jack Black's sense of humor and if you've watched a fair share of movies (including ""Iron Man""), you know how good Robert Downey Jr. can be, but never before have you seen them like this, teaming up to create summer 2008's best comedy. ""Tropic Thunder"" is not a violent action comedy like it lets off--instead the gun is aimed at Hollywood, taking shots at actors, writers, producers, the whole lot as they try and make a Vietnam War film. It's not the most laugh-out-loud funny comedy in recent years, but its combination of great and diverse talent playing a variety of amusing characters and clever Hollywood-spoofing jokes makes it a unique brand that is familiar but fresh.<br/><br/>""Tropic Thunder"" is a new war film based on a book written by a war vet played by Nick Nolte. The film brings together action star on the decline Tugg Speedman (Stiller), drug- addict comedian Jeff Portnoy (Black) and over-dedicated several-time Oscar winner Kirk Lazarus (Downey Jr.) who has undergone surgery to become black for the film. The film brilliantly starts with three trailers from their previous work, the funniest being ""Satan's Alley"" starring Lazarus and Toby Maguire as gay monks. <br/><br/>With cast and crew unable to gel on set and receiving terrible publicity with the threat of being shut down, their director (Steve Coogan) agrees to send the actors into the actual Vietnamese jungle and film them guerrilla style. Only it all goes wrong and it quickly isn't a movie anymore.<br/><br/>Directed by Stiller himself and written by him and lesser known actor Justin Theroux, there is definitely a sense that the film centers around Stiller's character and his style, but this is definitely all about the coming together of Black, Stiller and Downey Jr. along with some familiar but smaller names from Apatow Productions like Jay Baruchel of ""Knocked Up"" and Danny McBride from ""Pineapple Express."" Britain's Steve Coogan is transitioning nicely to America as the film's aggravated director and Tom Cruise takes a bold risk as the film's self- centered, foul-mouthed producer.<br/><br/>Downey Jr. steals the show. He's playing an Australian who is playing a black man and stays in character at all times--it's ridiculous. You believe it so easily. His style really freshens up what could have become just another Stiller movie. Cruise, while not hysterical, really leaves you asking if that's him the entire time, because he really transforms for the role and not just in being bald and fat. The performance definitely gets props.<br/><br/>It's the spoofing that really does it, though. While viewers may see red flags with the warnings about insensitivity toward people with mental disabilities and with Downey Jr. in blackface, you can pretty clearly tell why and it's not to make fun of either group. All the main characters basically make fun of actors with their descriptions: Stiller is like a dumb Tom Cruise, Black is a drug-addicted Eddie Murphy type, Downey Jr. is a pretty clear shot at Russell Crowe, etc. The plot is loaded with more cracks as well as some other clever humor and jokes. The film is also not bad as an action film with plenty of explosions.<br/><br/>There might be some jokes that don't work, but there's lot of different jokes in this movie because of the variety of comedians in it, so if something misses you're sure not to see the same type of jokes following it up. The general tone, however, is crude humor and that's where the R rating comes in. There is also a decided lack of female actors in this film, which gears it pretty much for guys only. This is a fun movie though and is sure to lead to more Hollywood-spoofing films in the future should it pull at the box office."
"sbb6592","9","6","13","14 August 2008"," Stiller shines again as director
","Ben Stiller has been around movies nearly all his life with his own career and the at one time large career of his father. Naturally he has a taste of how discombobulated things can get especially with some of the most provocative of actors are working in the same movie. <br/><br/>What does that have to do with this movie? Well, everything really because as an average audience member I only see the actors on screen so I never really know too much about their antics and the chemistry that is involved with a group of people making a movie. This is the fourth movie Stiller has directed and each on has not as much gotten more funny, rather then better quality script, acting, and over all narrative. <br/><br/>What makes this movie special is that Stiller combines realism in the sense of conversations before and after ""cut"" is yelled while at the same time pleasing the average viewer who wants to see explosions and action. It's as if Still completely understands in only his fourth directing job how to capture an audience of almost any kind. <br/><br/>If you go into this movie hoping for a lot of laughs you will get that and leave satisfied, while at the same time if you wish for a good script, and great casting/performances then those wishes will be granted too. It is rare that a ""spoof"" (although you can hardly call Tropic Thunder that because it approaches different genres) contains a compelling story line and characters that you genuinely take an interest in. Why? Because that's not what is expected of a spoof/comedy and the actors know that going in. Stiller once again exceeds expectations and has the help of Downey Jr. (who is hilarious and magnificent as a psychological mess of an actor) and Cruise who comes out of no where to play the part of a snobby rich entrepreneur perfectly. This movie almost starts a new genre of a dramatic spoof although it might sound odd it makes sense when seeing the film as there are countless laughs and also excellent plot twists/narratives. <br/><br/>The main idea though, is to enjoy a movie and I can almost guarantee that most viewers will enjoy this movie because it relates to almost every kind of audience. This movie seems to be the likely successor to The Dark Knight for the weekend box office because many people will want to see it twice and really understand all of the concepts in this magnificent film."

Especially when dealing with an ""Amanda"" problem.<br/><br/>Third. The dreaded ""r"" word. This movie really made a point that was missed by people looking for something, anything, to protest. It's satire. It was supposed to raise the question ""Why does just about every actor who portrays a mentally handicapped character get at least an Oscar nomination?"" It's as if the handicapped make people feel so awkward and guilty that actors automatically get respected for doing that role. If Simple Jack had been a movie it would have been shunned and protested, which it was in the Tropic Thunder Universe, and rightfully so. Using the word ""retarded"" reflects the ignorance of the film industry and of these characters. Not every movie made about the disabled is great, and that was the point."
"ArrestedDevelopee","8","6","13","13 August 2008"," An Experiment in Winning Satire!
","Tropic Thunder is a film that understands biting satire. It sets out to villainize the very people that made the film possible. It understands parody and it understands good comedy and delivers consistent laughs throughout. It starts out with a promising bang and from there, continues to revel in its absurdity and wit. The script is sharp and provides a great basis for the humor that spurs the film on, however, it's truly the actors that take it to the next level. Robert Downey Jr's performance as the lost Australian actor is perhaps one of the most standout performances in a comedy. Not only that, but Tom Cruise's Les may just be the engine that brings this film home. Its both ridiculous and a furnace of hilarity. But in all truth, the chemistry within the rest of the cast is undeniable. I would have to caution viewers, this film may not be what you're expecting. Ben Stiller's previous films and even his own written ""Zoolander"" are quite different from the tone and the visuals of Tropic Thunder. And its not just in the profanity or utter gore, its within the concepts behind the film. It dares to go into areas that are politically incorrect and what say may even find on the offensive side. Its not afraid to traverse the areas outside of hands-off comedy. Like I said, this could be satire at is very best, and its got the cast and the laughs to prove it. If you're a fan of balls-to-wall, brazen comedy that isn't afraid of the lines, this will be your cup of tea. You'll be laughing from start to finish and reveling in the ride. It's fresh and that originality carries it somewhere great. There is a total lack of predictability and its shies away from the clichés and THAT is something I think a lot of films haven't been ballsy enough to do."

","I'm just gonna come right out and say it, ""I loved this movie!"" I laughed consistently through the whole thing and at the moment it's one of the funniest movies I've seen in quite some time.<br/><br/>Who better to write and direct a movie about Hollywood and its eccentricities than Ben Stiller, a guy who grew up in the fold with actor parents? If you've seen the trailers you know the story. A handful of troublesome actors are dumped in the middle of Vietnam by their director in an effort to scare worthy performances out of them with guerrilla style film making tactics. What you don't see is the fact that in spite of the film being set mostly around the main actors in the jungle, the entire film industry is skewered right down to the last key grip. Agents and producers fight over whether to favor money or common human decency. Actors argue over method. An effects guy is just plain insane. And the war vet who wrote the source material for their production is just as crazy as the drug dealers our heroes run a foul of. Every actor, including the many cameos spread among the celluloid are at the top of their game. People who like to laugh should be easily entertained here and anyone who has ever watched a behind the scenes documentary may very well bust a gut before it's half over.<br/><br/>As for the controversy behind this. Don't peg it before you've seen it. The use of the word retard should not in anyway be construed as offensive in this film. They are making fun of people(especially Hollywood's) perception of the mentally challenged. That's the whole point of the movie. The same point made with Robert Downey Jr. in black face. The movie is poking fun of its own industry...and industry with a dubious reputation for the amoral and misinformed. That's why this is classic."
"Poet_Prince","9","7","16","14 August 2008"," Definitive Action Comedy
","A trailer opens with a young-rapper as he flaunts his ''super smooth moves'' in front of the camera. The audience bursts into laughter, though not so much over the hip hopper's dance ensemble, as the canned drink that he's holding in his right hand. Neither Crunk Juice, nor Pimp Juice hold a candle to the label stretched across this can of aluminum:Booty Sweat...<br/><br/>And so begins Tropic Thunder, the quintessential slapstick film of the summer. Renown movie stars, Ben Stiller,(Meet the Parents, Starsky and Hutch), who also happens to be the film's writer, Jack Black (Shallow Hal, King Kong),and Robert Downey Junior(Charlie Bartlett, Iron Man), in his most outrageous role to date, come together to give birth to an amazing action comedy. The famous ''Play within a Play''concept, is realized brilliantly here as we join the misadventures of four A list movie stars, Tug Speedman (Stiller), Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.), Jeff Portnoy (Black), Alpha Chino, played by Brandon T. Jackson, and Kevin Sandusky, played by Jay Baruchel, who each sign a contract to take part in a gritty, explosive, Vietnam blockbuster film, itself based on a war documentary.<br/><br/>You're not misreading, real life actors, portraying real life actors, who are themselves portraying characters in a film. But if that doesn't seem like a zany enough plot, throw in the fact that these top-grossing actors, soon find themselves (unawares),in a real-life Vietnam terrorist situation, and you've got one wacky movie.<br/><br/>From the initial moment, we're treated with laughs, as the film launches with a fake commercial (the aforementioned Booty Sweat introduction), and follows up with a series of three fake movie trailers to boot, all of which host several additional big name actors, and who both portray, and parody themselves. From there, the main character's are introduced, each of their persona's captured via separate encounters with the media, and in as flamboyant and parodic a fashion, as any moment of Mad TV or Saturday Night Live might seek to flaunt. Afterwards, we're taken to the (in-movie) set of ''Tropic Thunder'', where Tug Speedman, Kirk Lazarus, Jeff Portnoy, Alpha Chino and Kevin Sandusky are within their perspective roles for the movie. And it is here that the audience, not only receives a first glimpse of the fantastic chemistry that the directors helped to forge between the actors, but also of the sheer hilarity that is found within Robert Downey Jr.'s character, Kirk Lazarus. The first moment Lazarus's attempted, ''African American'' accent is heard, along with stereotypical demeanor, heads will roll.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller's unique comedic style and timing, also helps move the film along in an ideal direction.This, along with the utter randomness of Jack Black's drug fueled character, who happens to fall into a state of random insanity, as he goes into a chronic withdrawal during he and the other actor's trek through the Vietnam wilderness, the result of matters suddenly going from film, to real-life crisis, only helps power this non-stop rocket ship of a motion picture. Kevin Sandusky, played by Jay Baruchel, is a typical struggling teen actor whose own acting abilities, shallow as they are in comparison to the other three, is the result of their inspiration. Fascinatingly, Jackson's character (who is African American), aspiring rapper Alpha Chino's streetwise, ''O.G.''personality, finds itself almost in direct conflict with Kirk Lazarus's, whose in-movie character often goes from perhaps aloofly identifiable with some African Americans,to entirely the opposite,becomes an interesting conflict within the film, and a comedy device that is no less than entertaining.<br/><br/>Also making the A-list credits for the film, is actor Matthew McConaughey (How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, We are Marshall), who plays Rick Peck, friend and fellow actor to Stiller's character, Tug Speedman. And though Peck tends to be more of a minor character than some of the others in the film, his presence and acting here prove quite welcome. <br/><br/>Yet the stars don't quite end there. Nick Nolte (Mysteries of Pittsburgh, The Spiderwick Chronicles), joins the cast as washed out Vietnam veteran, Four Leaf Tayback, and is in fact the key character who leads Tug Speedman and his band astray, right into the hands of a terrorist camp. But what may perhaps stand as the biggest surprise in Tropic Thunder,may come from Tom Cruise's (War of the Worlds, Mission Impossible 3),part as domineering movie producer Lee Grossman, whose demeanor and mouth, might seem altogether unexpected for the recently berated actor, but that serves as the icing on the movie's cake.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it comes down to this. If ever there were a slapstick comedy film that got just about everything right, Tropic Thunder would be it. There's simply very little that it gets wrong. Sure, perhaps maybe the random stupidity of it all could have been toned down a bit, in exchange for some other element or another, but what would be the point? The film's atmosphere is almost perfectly established,with wittiness and pretty decent character development to boot. This is Ben Stiller at his finest, and silliest. And well,it's Robert Downey at what I believe to be his silliest, and most inventive. It's a genius, and quite clever film, that pokes immense fun at an element of our popular culture which we love and cherish a little more than it might deserve, Hollywood and the movie industry itself. And it goes down in my book as the second best movie of the summer, and perhaps one of the greatest comedy flicks in recent years. So do yourself a grand favor, and see it before the summer ends.<br/><br/>-S.S."

","Tropic Thunder - Five actors are sent to shoot a war movie in Laos after their film goes over-budget, with the catch being that there are also some gun-toting drug den dwellers occupying the jungle. The bunch is comprised of a normal actor (Jay Baruchel), a rapper/actor named Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson), a comedian (Jack Black) that's an Eddie Murphy/ Mike Myers/ Robin Williams hybrid, action star Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) who once played a mentally handicapped man to try and get an Oscar, and Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) who is the sort of extremist method actor Hollywood loves to dote with Oscars, so for this role he has donned blackface.<br/><br/>Dear god this movie is funny! Forget just war movies (Though it rips those up aplenty. It riffs Saving Private Ryan, Platoon, countless dying scenes...) this movie delivers Hollywood's head on a stake. Right from the start the movie also spoofs Disaster movies, sequels, lowbrow comedies, and historical films. Tropic Thunder crosses so many boundaries and insults so many people with such skill and humor that it has to be given the highest praise in return. Several insults are only surface deep though. The Association for the Mentally Handicapped has been up in arms about this movie, but if they were to pay close attention, it's really Hollywood's use of these people that the film is spoofing.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller is good. It might have actually been funnier if his part was played by Steven Seagal, but that man could never allow himself to be beaten up in a film, or act. Stiller tones down the parts of previous performances I've hated, and keeps the funny parts. Jack Black delivers so many funny lines pitch perfectly as the least likable of the characters. Brandon T. Jackson and Jay Baruchel (who actually did play a mentally deficient person in Million Dollar Baby) provide strong comedic support. But Robert Downey Jr. runs away with the show in a role that should be completely tasteless, wrong, unfunny, and nonexistent. But oh my god if he does not pull it off and steal the show incidentally. He's wonderful. As Kirk Lazarus he almost never breaks the character's character, even when it's clear that no cameras are around. Every other line from his mouth is a gem, and you know some of the lines from this movie will become tired once they're put on T-shirts and quoted by 13-year olds. <br/><br/>The writing overall is top notch. I know a movie must be pure awesome when I am loving the performances of Tom Cruise and Matthew McConaughey, two actors I really don't like. Funnier with more bite than Borat. A better send-up than Hot Fuzz, Tropic Thunder is the Ben Stiller film I was waiting for and unaware than I was waiting for. It gets an A."

It's well directed, very well acted (especially RDJ) and it has been my favorite movie for a long time. All the characters are funny. The premise is great and it's just so funny. Seriously, this film is comedic gold. The fake trailers at the beginning is genius, and there are also hilarious references to old war movies. This film is a satire that mocks Hollywood in a really smart and funny way. Brandon T Jackson is great, Jack Black is great, of course, Ben Stiller is great and Robert Downey Jr is just flat out hilarious. Tom Cruise is probably the funniest one after RDJ, with a role he plays perfectly. I'm a huge Ben Stiller fan and I'm glad he made this wonderful film."
"Ben_Cheshire","8","3","5","3 September 2015"," Tropic Thunder is a movie about a movie playing another movie
","Apparently, Ben Stiller met actors who were in Platoon and talked about it like they'd been to war, and that struck him as ridiculous and many years later, he helped turn that thought into a war movie.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is basically a self-aware action-comedy, a satire on the vanity of movie actors. Its easy to misjudge it, I've found. On first viewing, I just didn't think there were enough jokes. Its a strange animal because it has its feet equally in the action and comedy camps. Its almost as much about becoming the thing, as it is about satirising it. The movie I think is interesting in the way it pushes through the meta stuff to get to some kind of reality. It would make a good introductory text for a class on the nature of truth and reality, if not for how easily misunderstood its dialogue about race and disability groups are. While its clear to me that the intention is to make fun of movie actors at all times, I can understand how some people might have felt the movie was irresponsible in its messages with the ""Simple Jack"" storyline and the blackface storyline. <br/><br/>I know Downey Jr. was conflicted about accepting the role of a method actor who gets so immersed in his role as a black seargent that he can't drop character, but I'm glad he did accept it, because he's hilarious. He steals every scene he's in. As does Tom Cruise, who many didn't recognise until the closing credits, back in the day. Some of the team players get forgotten. Jay Baruschel is an excellent straight-man. He's the character we relate to, the one actor who hasn't been swallowed up by vanity. Jack Black also has a bit of a thankless job. He's unpleasant as the Fatties star, unpleasant as the drug addict, and has one hilarious scene when he's tied up to the tree. Steve Coogan also has an important part, and he plays it well. <br/><br/>Back in 2008, I was expecting maybe Zoolander or Anchorman, which have maybe 50% more jokes. Tropic Thunder is a different animal. Its a bit more measured, but its way more exciting and immersive than any of the other over the top comedies it gets lumped along with."

When I saw the previews and saw the cast, I was absolutely sure that I would be laughing out loud from start to finish. However, somebody forgot something: a script. The movie is all over the place, and there are so many f-bombs that you feel like you are watching Scarface again. At least in Scarface a case could be made that it was somewhat appropriate. Most of the f-bombs in this film are totally unnecessary, and thus insulting to the viewer. I thought Tom Cruise's character was funny initially, but I soon grew tired of his antics and language as well, and he eventually went way over the top with his characterization.

"Archblood","10","3","5","27 October 2008"," Tropic Power!
","Tropic Thunder, a Ben Stiller directed effort, opens with what's supposedly a furious skirmish during the Vietnam War. When the carnage was later revealed to be part of a over budget movie production (the film's name happened to be 'Tropic Thunder' too) , the real story kicks off.<br/><br/>The comedy, 'a film within a film' as popularly described, is basically about a group of Hollywood thespians who had found real trouble in the infamous South East Asian region of the Golden Triangle after their director, out of desperation, decided to ditch them in the middle of a jungle crawling with gunmen and drug runners.<br/><br/>Encouraged by the dangerous advice of John 'Four Leaf' Taybacks (Nick Nolte), a Nam veteran whose memoir (yep, named 'Tropic Thunder' too) was what the movie production was based on, rookie director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) rashly plunged his band of prima donna stars into hostile territory, hoping that he can quickly complete shooting in guerrilla style. No sooner, after he declared himself savior however, he met a messy end, leaving the cast on their own to figure out the script. As events will soon reveal, it is going be a highly charged experience beyond their reel moments.<br/><br/>The 'platoon' of Tropic Thunder is a interesting ensemble of Tinseltown stereotypes, considering that TT is a candid take on the ever dynamic world of movie making. There's Ben Stiller as Thugg Speedman, the' highest paid and highest grossing action star ever'..... whose record of box office flop tells otherwise. Robert Downey, Jr's Kirk Lazarus, the most talented of the group, is the multiple Oscar winning type. A method actor in practice, he had taken too seriously his role of a Afro American Sergeant that he had his skin cosmetically altered black and adopted a Jive accent. Jack Black is the dope junkie comedian, Jeff 'Fats' Portnoy, whose capability in inducing laughter seem to rely on the rampart usage of flatulence in his movies.<br/><br/>Apart from this colorful trio of characters, the supporting cast consists of Jay Baruchel as the by-the-book little known actor, Kevin Sandusky, Brandon T. Jackson as Alpa Chino, a rapper who had crossed over to acting and Danny McBride as the trigger happy special effects wizard, Cody Underwood. Look out also for Tom Cruise in his most unusual role as an extremely obnoxious movie executive.<br/><br/>With these unique line up of screwball stereotypes and strange characters, Tropic Thunder is one of the freshest idea of a comedy in recent years. The film had thankfully, not degenerate into cheapening slap-sticks even while it pokes fun at celebrities and Hollywood, with the funnies mainly based on a diet of tabloid news and pop culture. Good, justified humor is something you can expect throughout the movie as the well executed direction and screenplay ensure every few minutes' worth of hilarity.<br/><br/>The strength of Tropic Thunder also lies in its most obvious references and inspirations patterned from a handful of Vietnam War flicks including Full Metal Jacket, Platoon and Apocalypse Now, the latter seemingly the key influence of the movie. These elements are quite useful in the mental exploration of its key characters, particularly Lazarus' apparent identity crisis and Speedman's descent toward his darker side. Overall, it's also a smart excuse for fire fights, explosions and exaggerated action sequences for maximum comedic impact.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder, in conclusion, is an original, outrageous tribute and parody to the world from which it hailed and the films that made the idea of it possible. Comedies, in the last few years had either been over done spoofs or ridiculous digs on human relations but TT had proved otherwise that the same formulas need not always be the solution for comedy box office gains. At a time of lackluster performance from its genre, it may well stand as a testament that Hollywood do still have something to tickle the world with..... or to be tickled about."

However, I am unbelievably glad that I went, because as it turns out, Tropic Thunder is nothing short of the funniest movie of the year. There was not one scene in the movie that did not work. It tells the story of Tugg Speedman, Kirk Lazarus, and Jeff Portnoy, (Played by Ben Stiller, Robert Downey, Jr., and Jack Black) and their attempt to film the greatest war movie ever made, based on the memoirs of Four Leaf Tayback, (Played by Nick Nolte) but what they don't realize is that they are actually in a real battlefield. I could easily tell more, but I don't want to give it away. Ben Stiller was very good, and Robert Downey Jr. was absolutely hysterical. But obviously, the real star of the show was Tom Cruise. He plays a fat, balding, movie producer that says the F word every other word, and he NAILED it. Tropic Thunder is hysterical, and easily the funniest movie of the year."

"DICK STEEL","10","7","17","1 November 2008"," A Nutshell Review: Tropic Thunder
","First of all, the goodies begin even before the main movie starts proper, with some hilarious fake ads and trailers just like Tarantino and Rodriguez's Grindhouse features which fabricated some material of its own, so don't be a dweeb and be late for the movie.<br/><br/>Now that the public service reminder is out of the way, Tropic Thunder managed to live up to its hype, which in my personal opinion is a bit difficult these days because the marketing folks usually put the best bits in the trailers so that there's no more surprises left, or that the narrative actually fizzles out into mediocrity, losing steam halfway through the movie. Thankfully, this movie managed to pace and therefore sustain itself right through to the ending.<br/><br/>There were a couple of plus points in the movie that made it rewarding to sit through. First of all, the movie satirizes almost everything that makes up the Hollywood film industry, with some keen poking of fun from the actors to the crew, from agents to the studio executives, not to mention relatively direct spoofs of Vietnam War movies like Platoon and Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>Then you also have the ensemble characters who add plenty of dimensional flavour and brought to life by their respective cast. Typical characters for ensemble movies get included , ranging from the action hero, the comedian, the character actor, the rapper turned actor and the newbie teenager on the cusp of his first big memorable break. While the keyart might have only Stiller, Downey Jr and Black on its marquee, the supporting roles and cameos also earn as much respect in delivering this movie, especially an almost unrecognizable Tom Cruise, who dons a bodysuit to hide his pretty boy looks (not the first time he's done in, ala Vanilla Sky), and possessing the rare gift of incessant swearing which I haven't seen him do since Born on the Fourth of July.<br/><br/>His character, sleazy studio executive Les Grossman, gets my thumbs up for lighting up the screen each time he's on, and probably had single handedly stole the thunder (pardon the pun) from the main leads, which I thought director Ben Stiller had realized the campiness of this role, that he decided it should be milked a lot more. While he plays against type, I doubt Cruise will get any Oscar nods for this insane role, but there's always MTV to show its appreciation to his madcap antics done right, for a role and not on a couch.<br/><br/>Besides his supporting role, there were also others such as Steve Coogan as the rookie English director having to control his prima donna actors, and also to try and keep the movie from spiralling further out of budget and schedule, and Nick Nolte as Four Leaf Tayback, a Vietnam Vet who lost 2 of his hands, whose book the movie Tropic Thunder is based on, given the industry's raid on books and graphic novel material to make movies, if not going down the path of remakes. Look out also for plenty of cameos such as Jennifer Love Hewitt, Alicia Silverstone, Jon Voight, and Tobey Maguire if you're on time to view those fake trailers.<br/><br/>And what of the leads? I thought they probably had a good time making this movie, hamming up for their characters and providing some crazy laughs. Ben Stiller leads the team as Tugg Speedman, the action hero who desperately needs a hit to repair his reputation after a disastrous dramatic stint in which he plays the much-frowned upon retarded role of Jack the simpleton. His character is a little of a show-off, and he managed some superb nuances in his persona as the cock-sure action person. Robert Downey Jr plays his opposite number, the exaggerated multiple-award winner Kirk Lazarus who stays in character all the time until the release of the DVD commentary, undergoes a controversial surgical procedure to help him ease into the role, and shares probably some of the best scenes with Stiller in the movie. Move aside Tony Stark/Iron Man, Downey Jr's role here is more memorable!<br/><br/>And to round things off, Jack Black got quite muted as the fart-it-all comedian who doesn't feel appreciated and is a drug junkie, Jay Baruchel as the teenage nobody hoping that his role here amongst the heavyweights would get him laid, and Brandon T Jackson's Alpa Chino just cracks me up on his name alone, as the rapper turned actor slyly promoting the beverage he endorses, and has a very fleeting suggestion of homosexuality (somehow the rage these days in comedies?)<br/><br/>Definitely justifies its accolades as one of the comedies of the year. Get some!"

This gut-bustingly hilarious masterwork of sheer brilliance dares to subvert Hollywood expectations resulting in a daring, imaginative, original, intelligent, clever, witty, biting satire on Hollywood.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller provides a film that challenges our rosy view of Hollywood by radically suggesting that studio execs are fat, balding idiots whose reading doesn't extend beyond MAXIM. He also suggests that method actors sometimes go too far. He also dares to suggest that Hollywood actors may be exploitative in their approach to playing mentally special people and their reasons for doing so. He also dares to suggest that war movies are far too fake and glorifying, and that booty-obsessed rappers may be closet homosexuals.<br/><br/>I, of course, am utterly STUNNED.

I still have no idea what this film is about - and maybe that's what Stiller intended. The movie inside the movie concept? The plot: (as I understood it) movie actors making a Vietnam era film in Vietnam. Production goes awry and the director moves the action without a production crew into the jungle. Allegedly hand held cameras were set to capture the action. The real jungle holds other problems - child drug lords???? That's where I lost interest.

The big budget war movie that the actors are portrayed to be making in the beginning of the film (a very silly, ridiculous, audience insulting, over-budgeted war film) is actually what THIS film turned out to be! I actually felt insulted watching this picture because it was just so bad and stupid and NOT funny.<br/><br/>There were a FEW really funny lines and a FEW really funny 10 second scenes throughout the entire film, that's IT.

I'm actually amazed Stiller was behind the writing and directing, as his quality of work is usually much better.<br/><br/>One good thing with this film is that it was shot well.

","I am British-Black and I really enjoyed this film. It was a satire of how Hollywood portrays various social groups on film and then has the audacity to pat itself on the back thinking it has portrayed these groups of people accuracy and with sensitivity  when the exact opposite has happened! It is also a reflection on how money/profit driven the Hollywood movie industry is, caring more about how much money they can bring in without care or thought to the quality of the end product or to the staff and actors who work on the film. I was not offended because I understood the film and think that all those people who are jumping on the bandwagon claiming this film is offensive are doing it as a way to gain self publicity and don't care that they are raising their profile on the backs of the actors, writers and producers of this movie. Ben Stiller and Co brought a subject to light everyone was aware of in a way that did not preach to people but just highlighted it in the hope it would make everyone first acknowledge it does exist and second have Hollywood think twice about how they choose to portray different social groups. This movie was well directed, produced and brilliantly acted by all principal actors and I laughed in all the right places and ended up thinking throughout that they are so right and truly appreciated what Ben Stiller and Co had done! I rate this film 10/10 because if you think about it this film made Hollywood stand up and really look at itself and it didn't like what it saw! It is just a shame self-publicity seeking individuals are doing their best to prevent that message being clearly received!"

","Okay, let me get one thing straight because this bothers me so much: Robert Downey Jr's performance was not as brilliant as everybody makes it out to be. He wasn't Razzie-worthy, but he wasn't Oscar-worthy, either. Okay, now that it's off of my chest, let me unmask this movie. It is unnecessarily gory. It was humorous but disgusting at the same time, and the latter outweighed the former. The humor was derivative, and the plot was like a slice of Swiss cheese. The verbal vulgarity made my ears bleed. Sometimes there was a scene of humor that was either so disgusting or so stupid and unfunny that I just thought ""Hurry it up already"". There were a few moments that were just plain surreal, something to which a text-crazy individual might cry: ""WTF?!"" I had high hopes for Tropic Thunder (I heard it was hilarious, and, of course, Robert Downey Jr. was nominated for Best Supporting Actor), but it let me down. Definitely not a ""must-see"". Five out of ten, for the number of mere chuckles it fished out of me in its one hundred seven minutes :)"

","Sometimes a movie hits Satire Gold, because it points out the absolute absurdity of an industry in a way that everyone realizes how ludicrous it is except the people in the scene.<br/><br/>The premise is that a group of actors is doing a Vietnam film (based on the only book about a true event that got a movie deal) but are totally hung up on their own egos to realize they are in deep trouble.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of Jack Black (who plays a drug-addicted overweight comedy star) or Ben Stiller (who I have never considered funny). I've only recently warmed up to Robert Downey Jr (who artificially makes himself look black for this role, much to the chagrin of his black co-star.) yet in this film, they work.<br/><br/>The guy who steals the comedy is Tom Cruise, almost unrecognizable with a bald head and paunchy middle. He plays an over-the-top producer who terrorizes everyone working for him. (Some have compared him to the reprehensible Weinstein brothers, but I thought Cruise might have had Sumner Redstone in mind.) <br/><br/>Obviously, more than a few people who are too influenced by political correctness winced at some of the jokes, but that's really their problem. The jokes ARE funny, even if society had programmed us to feel guilty about laughing at them. So have a good laugh in the privacy of your living room."

I think that some of the lines and scenes in the film, although meant as a parody of the way Hollywood does Vietnam type war films and not actual veterans, were still in bad taste. I won't do any spoilers and I know that maybe my views are tainted by my own experience but I just had a hard time with it. I went for a laugh and found little to laugh at despite the obvious intent to lampoon movie producers, directors and actors.

"Danusha_Goska","5","5","11","18 August 2008"," Would Have Been Twice As Funny If Half As Crude
","The funniest part of ""Tropic Thunder"" comes before the movie starts. There is a commercial for a hip-hop, ghetto drink, ""Booty Sweat,"" advertised by the rapper Alpa Chino, shown lasciviously caressing the sweating bottoms of two jiggling black women. There are coming attractions for three movies, one a satire of Eddie Murphy's ""Klump"" movies, one a satire of action movies, and one a satire of Oscar-bait, self-serious movies. These bits are funny, but hardly new; satire of popular culture, in MAD magazine, Saturday Night Live, even the ""Road"" movies, is old stuff. No new ground is broken.<br/><br/>""Tropic Thunder"" itself is further satire on the movie business. The problem is, unlike the opening ""coming attractions"" and ad for Booty Sweat, ""Tropic Thunder"" doesn't so much satire current movie's repetitiousness, staleness, crudity and heavy-handedness, as it becomes heavy-handed, crude, repetitious, derivative, and stale. Writer-director Ben Stiller seems to be going for an no-holds-barred satire along the lines of ""Dr. Strangelove."" So, Stiller fills his characters' mouths with the ""F"" word, the ""C"" word, the ""S"" word, and repeated threats to emasculate and variously violate each other. But ""Dr. Strangelove"" was made during an era writers had to rely on their sophistication, rather than their command of vulgarity, to be funny. In ""Tropic Thunder,"" the use of four letter words and physical threats of emasculation in virtually every sentence becomes incredibly wearying and incredibly unfunny very, very fast.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr is good as a full-of-himself multiple Oscar winner who ""never breaks character until he's done the DVD commentary."" Though white and Australian (and maybe inspired by Russell Crowe?), he plays an African American soldier. Downey's performance has been controversial; but not for any substantive reason. There's nothing offensive in Downey's comedic performance. Tom Cruise, as a Hollywood mogul, is another story. As Manohla Dargis pointed out in the New York Times, Cruise depicts an anti-Jewish stereotype, the crude, hairy, money grubber. And . . . Cruise is just not funny in this part. He is uncomfortable to watch.<br/><br/>Some have complained about the film's references to mentally handicapped people. The movie does NOT make fun of retarded people. Rather, it makes fun of the film community's tendency to distribute Academy Awards to actors who portray mentally handicapped people."
"femaleanimefan","9","5","11","17 August 2008"," Full of great characters and non-stop laughs
","I don't think I've laughed this hard during a movie in years. I initially thought it was just going to be a stupid movie with a few laughs, like Get Smart was. But I was wrong. Tropic thunder is a hilarious film full of great characters and ridiculously funny moments.<br/><br/>The plot, as you probably know, is about a bunch of actors : Tugg Speedman, an action star whose career is going down the toilet, a rapper named Alpa Chino (say it), an Australian method actor named Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr. in another great performance), a heroin addicted comedic actor named Jeff Potnoy (Jack Black), and a rookie actor, who is also the only one to attend boot camp named Kevin Sandusky. After just 5 days of shooting, director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) cannot handle how self-absorbed the actors are. So Four Leaf (Nick Nolte), who wrote the book the movie is based on and also claimed to be part of the war, decides to throw them out in jungle with cameras placed everywhere.<br/><br/>It's a lot funnier than it sounds. Every moment in the movie is genius. From the interaction between Lazarus and Chino, Tugg being kidnapped by the ""Flaming Dragons"", and Jeff's constant heroin needs, there is never a dull moment in the film.<br/><br/>The acting is surprisingly great. First off, since everyone is talking about it, the Tom Cruise cameo. He's barely recognizable, but he's also pure genius. It's not really a cameo, since he appears many times during the film. It's great stuff. Another stand-out is Robert Downey Jr. as Lazarus. He steals almost every scene he's in, and also does a great Australian accent. The rest of the cast is good too, and I actually liked Ben Stiller.<br/><br/>All in all, it's great summer entertainment. Definitely one of the funniest movies in a long time, and possibly the funniest of the year."
"mjjusa-1","9","5","11","15 August 2008"," A Bull and Cock Story
","I haven't enjoyed a Hollywood within Hollywood movie like this since 'Tristram Shandy, a Cock and Bull Story."" Which I had to see twice just to get all the inside the business jokes. Jokes and asides that flew fast and furious, making it one of the best movies of 2006.<br/><br/>'Tropic Thunder' is, without a doubt, one of the best movies of 2008 and might actually be a double double insider Hollywood movie. On the one hand it is just funny and gross and skewers everything and everybody who has ever worked in the 'business.' On the other it's a wonderful homage to Shandy. The humor mined from rival actors/celebrities interactions found in Ben Stiller's Tugg Speedman and Robert Downey Jr.'s Kirk Lazarus mirror that played out in Shandy's Steven Coogan and Rob Brydon as their screen lives and real lives and insecurities made for humor within and without the actual movie movie. Or is that the movie's movie movie? I don't think it was chance that Ben Stiller choose Steven Coogan to play the Director of 'Tropic Thunder.' It was sly genius.<br/><br/>Tristram Shandy, A Cock and Bull Story is a about trying to film a movie about an unfilmable book. 'Tropic Thunder' is a movie based on a faked war memoir, unread by the cast, the script unread by the leads, the movie made unfilmable by the actors' rivalries and the Director's incompetence. The Producer is going to pull the plug on the whole shebang until Tristram himself (Coogan) dumps the actors into the jungle to see if they can be all they can be. So the audience and the Director of the Director (Stiller to Coogan) can use for comedic effect the laws of Hollywood celebrity with its cellphones, producers, agents, G5a, and contract riders and the laws of the jungle..<br/><br/>Hmm, I hope that this isn't too confusing because the Tristram/Thunder connection makes a great funny movie even funnier.<br/><br/>Laughs, belly laughs, imagination, great fun, and up close seats to the Hollywood we think might be the real Hollywood. Cameos, satire, anarchy, totally non linear, totally unexpected situations, not a dull moment, which is the highest praise I can give in a year filled with so many witless boring comedies.<br/><br/>Go see it. Go see it twice. I'm betting it's even funnier the second time.<br/><br/>By the way, there is a lot of cock talk in the movie...and indeed, one bull."

"D_Burke","7","5","11","14 August 2008"," Not A Home Run Movie, But Probably A Base Hit
","I am probably going to get a lot of scrutiny for this review, but I really don't care. The truth is that I saw it, I liked it, but I didn't love it the way I thought I would. Let's face it: this summer has had some surprises, and a few movies that have lived up to their hype. ""Iron Man"" was one of those pleasant surprises, and ""The Dark Knight"" fit into the latter category.<br/><br/>However, ""Iron Man"" and ""The Dark Knight"" are not comedies, and therefore are not as subjective. In other words, there are rarely any mixed reviews for these movies. Comedies are more hit or miss, and this comedy was a mixed bag for me.<br/><br/>I was expecting an over the top farce on Hollywood, and that's exactly what I got. There's a potential problem in that when comedic actors try to spoof the so-called corrupt movie industry, 95% of the audience don't normally get the jokes because they haven't worked in Hollywood. However, one of the movie's strengths is that Ben Stiller, who also wrote and directed this film, made some smart choices in terms of on screen gags and certain cameos to bring a majority of the audience in with the joke. For instance, the mock previews at the beginning of the film were brilliantly over the top. And it was funny to see Tom Cruise as an overweight, short-tempered studio executive.<br/><br/>Also, the movie's #1 strength can be summarized in three words: ROBERT DOWNEY, JR. He was just fantastic in this film. Of course, he's going to face a lot of scrutiny for his role since he spends a majority of it in black-face, but he really nailed the method actor spoof incredibly well. As long as people see that he's making fun of actors who take themselves too seriously, not people of color, they'll enjoy every minute he's on the screen. I would even go as far as to say that Downey could even be a potential nominee for Best Supporting Actor at next year's Oscars. You may think I'm crazy, but remember that Madelyn Kahn was nominated for her role in ""Blazing Saddles"" back in 1975. Downey's scenes with rapper/actor Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson, a great straight man in this film) were pretty good, too.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there were some major inconsistencies with the plot and the character development which, had they been explained better, would have resulted in a funnier film. For instance, Ben Stiller plays an Arnold Schwarzeneggar/Sylvester Stallone like action hero who wants to be taken more seriously as an actual actor, which is understandable. However, it is never explained why he kept making those action movies which make him look like a one trick pony. Stiller's character came off more as a cheap ripoff of White Goodman (from ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" (2004)) and Derek Zoolander (from ""Zoolander"" (2001)) combined. There could have been a lot more originality and depth in his character, but the scenes of him as ""Simple Jack"" were funny enough to expose his character's vanity.<br/><br/>Furthermore, why would a movie studio hire a first time director (Steve Coogan) to shoot a big budget movie about Vietnam? This is a spoof movie on Hollywood with a lot of name dropping, and no one thought to explain why Oliver Stone wasn't hired, or Francis Ford Coppola. That was a missed opportunity to get a good laugh, and to remove a plot inconsistency.<br/><br/>I love Jack Black, but man, was he a disappointment in this movie! Speaking of plot inconsistencies, it was never explained nor mentioned why Black, as an A-list comedic actor by the likes of Mike Myers or Eddie Murphy, was cast in a serious movie about the Vietnam War. His character appeared to express no motivation to have a serious role, and his drug-addiction antics were also flat and not even worthy of a light chuckle. His character was direction-less, and he really could have been written a lot better for Jack Black's sake. After all, Black is extremely talented and incredibly funny. To see his talent go to waste in this movie is too bad.<br/><br/>I'm sure my disappointment in this movie comes from waiting four months in anticipation for its release. But I reiterate when I say that I'm not entirely disappointed with this movie. There were some moments of big laughs, and those moments came when it didn't seem as though the cast (or the script) tried too hard for a laugh. There were just some missed opportunities for laughs, especially in relation to war movies. For instance, they were shooting a Vietnam movie, yet it seemed as thought the only movie they could spoof was ""Platoon"" (1986) with Ben Stiller copying Willem Dafoe's famous arms in the air pose. There were also some key opportunities to spoof ""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987) or ""Born on the Fourth of July"" (1989). After all, with Tom Cruise in the cast, how could they not reference that movie? So I'm marginally recommending this film. It was good, but not great, and it's worthy of being rented. Robert Downey, Jr. was this movie's saving grace, and he's really the comeback kid of 2008."
"hoobits","8","5","11","13 August 2008"," So whip smart it is dumb.
","A movie so whip smart it is dumb. So good at mocking these excessive Michael Bay, Tony Scott type action flicks that it is one unto itself down to the cinematography, the editing of picture and sound with those ""emotional"" choirs and slow mo death falls, to blowing the flip out of everything. <br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is one of the better comedies I've seen in a long while and I don't like Ben Stiller much, and here he is writing, directing and starring. And doing a bang up job in two out of those three departments. Performance wise he feels a little off, doesn't fit in with the rest of the gang as well, in terms of ""are the actors fitting these kinds of roles, these stereotypes? Are they believable?"". Stiller isn't a Stallone action guy, nor a Tom Cruise. In fact I would have preferred Cruise in Stiller's role, though he is very good (I mean evil) in the role he does play.<br/><br/>Still... Stiller is decent and funny as action door knob Tugg Speedman. If it weren't for the way Stiller plays him, which is goofier than everyone else, the film probably would be very misunderstood, and not play as much of as a broad comedy as it can be. But the operative words are ""can be"" because Tropic Thunder is a focused film in many ways, despite it being loud and all over the place (For that is one of the satirical points it is making). The characters arcs of shedding tired stereotypes for quite possibly just as stereotypical ones is great.<br/><br/>People are talking about Downey Jr. a lot, as he's playing a white dude who is playing a black dude in the movie within the movie. And he is amazing, playing up tired images of black people, pointing at the utter ridiculousness of it all and channeling some Russel Crowe and Daniel Day Lewis to boot. But this is rally an ensemble piece. Everyone plays their part, has their say, and never are they better when all together as a team (hey it's like a lesson they have to learn in the movie!)<br/><br/>Jack Black, Jay Baruchel and Brandon T. Jackson in fact fit their roles perfectly, so effortlessly. Baruchel, basically playing himself (if you know his previous roles) ironically stands out as the young unknown geek actor who is kind of supposed to be in the background. And finally a role has been written for Black that really does something for him. Yes he is the annoying, loud, fat drug addict, not too far fetched for someone like Black, but it works playing to his strengths. Jackson, while not as a standout for his humor, is almost the moral compass of the group, and here is the rapper turned actor who markets an energy drink called Booty Tang. And you gotta love Matthew McConaughy as the agent for ""Tuggernuts"".<br/><br/>While the film is incredibly successful at mocking everything within Hollywood and thus our culture at large, (and offending many I am sure) there are no real clear standout moments for me. Odd I know, but again the film is so good at being what it is spoofing that it is kind of not funny at times, looking so sleek and being so loud and even ""Oscar bait-y"", and in a way that is kind of awesome."

","Tropic Thunder (2008): Dir: Ben Stiller / Cast: Ben Stiller, Robert Downey Jr., Jack Black, Tom Cruise, Matthew McConaughey: Offensive yet hilarious satire of Hollywood egos and a corrupt studio system based on politics. Studios threaten to cancel a big budget war film until they are flown to a war invested jungle to complete filming. Problem is that they believe it's part of the movie. A triumph for director Ben Stiller who surpasses earlier work, which includes Zoolander and Cable Guy. He plays action star Tugg Speedman who desperately needs a hit film and finds himself drugged out of his mind. Robert Downey Jr. steals scenes as Australian actor Kirk Lazarus who through surgery emerges as the African American Sergeant. Jack Black plays comedian Jeff Portnoy who specializes in fart jokes but his downfall seems to be his struggle with drugs. He becomes so dependent that even when he attempts withdrawal he cannot tolerate the condition. Then there is the scene stealing executive producer played by Tom Cruise who sports a bald cranium and a profane attitude centered around getting the film made, and he is great in every scene he is in. Matthew McConaughey as Tugg's agent also stands by with Cruise yet expresses more concern. While the film plays well as a comic action war film, it also presents a satire view or insightful look into the closed doors of Hollywood studios. Score: 9 / 10"

","I went to the movies a couple of weeks ago with my best friend Rick, to see this and Death Race. We both had wanted to see this from watching the previews and promotions; Death Race was his idea. I had no interest in watching a movie that resembles Twisted Metal. Anyways, long story short, I ended up loving Death Race and hating Tropic Thunder. Seeing it last was a mistake too. I was falling asleep. My complaints for this movie is that it's made out to be soooo goddamn funny and it's not. It has some good jokes here and there (mostly by RDJ) but it's not a comedy treasure. That quote from the trailer after the movie came out, ""You'll Be Quoting This Movie Forever"", is seriously wrong. It should say, ""You Will Be Quoting RDJ's Lines Forever"". Also, Jack Black, who I usually like and I think is funny, sucked in this movie. He barely does anything in the movie or help it progress. It was a waste to have him in it. I'm a big fat guy--I could have been in the movie as his character and it would be the same thing! Ben Stiller, who gets a lot of flack, was okay in this. Although the Simple Jack thing was a little funny (when they show the trailer) it became really annoying. I am also disabled but it didn't offend me. I just figured, if this is the best they can do, then maybe I'm not so disabled after all. This is surprisingly a movie that you should wait till it comes out on DVD.

Ben Stiller is quite inept storyteller and director - and this movie shows it in the most brutal way.<br/><br/>The movie had interesting premise and even some actually funny scenes, but I counted less than five of them (including ""fake trailers"" at the start of the movie). Most of the movie is actually filled with nonsense talks about problems of the actors that may be probably funny if you are an actor yourself or you do study acting. For me as non-actor it was only extremely boring experience when I watched actors babbling some weird psycho stuff. I do understand why someone finds funny crazy movies, even movies with disgusting jokes, but it is really beyond my mind how anyone can actually enjoy dialogs that remind me of intellectual Swedish theater plays. This is no Hot Shots for sure! What's most interesting the movie remains boring even in its ""action"" parts and remains to be completely unfunny and uninteresting to the very end.<br/><br/>I watched TV recording of this movie so I could fortunately fix this ""experience"" by deleting it.

From the fake trailers to the big action opening sequence, it opens up with a bang only to dip down not along after the actors enter the real jungle. Call me sick but I liked the gross-out humour parts reminding me of Monty Python sometimes. I also liked the constant profanity. The best acting and funniest bits probably come from Tom Cruise disguised as an unrecognizable foul-mouthed movie producer. Robert Downey Jr playing the black sergeant manages to do quite well and is probably the coolest character so I doubt he'll offend black people even though he's white. The interactions between him and the real black guy could have been stronger and funnier though.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller has some funny bits but the whole retarded Simple Jack routine wears thin really fast. Jack Black is the weakest link providing much manic energy but very little in terms of acting skill or actually funny comedy. He's the most caricatural one-dimensional and annoying of the bunch. I'm not a huge fan of war movies but even I caught a few references so war movie buffs should have a ball. So in the end, Tropic Thunder was hit and miss for me. Comedies making fun of war and primadonna self-involved actors are few and far between so if those subjects appeal to you, then a rental is worthwhile.<br/><br/>Rating: 6 out of 10"

Tom Cruise should definitely join dancing with stars next time it starts up a new season.<br/><br/>This movie is fun to watch. Everything from the director exploding to Tom Cruise dancing, great movie. The dance scene with Tom Cruise was worth it alone.<br/><br/>For anyone who loves comedy, this is a must see.

Even though it's not bad, but it's not like you want to watch it in one sitting. It took me 2 sittings to finish this movie.

"adamscastlevania2","5","1","1","15 February 2015"," Stiller may hit the target, but he still aimed low
","(48%) Ben Stiller's part poke at the movie industry, part gross-out comedy, part Vietnam war movie spoof is one of mere amusement rather than real or substantial laughs. A big draw here is the star-studded cast, but it's that element that I feel hampers this overall as there really isn't enough screen time for everyone to make that much of an overall impact. Jack Black has it easy playing a drug addicted Hollywood jerk, which basically means he spends most of the film freaking out. Downey Jr's character is just a tool to rip into method acting. While Stiller mostly attacks Oscar bait movies. Everything this has is just made up of easy targets and cheap laughs. Tom Cruse has never really been the funny-man, it's just something he doesn't do all that well, and here he's covered in so much latex and fake body hair that the role could have easily been played by almost anyone. And as there's so little faith in his character to raise a genuine laugh resulting in the makers getting him to dance not once but twice. The film is well shot, and the jungle locations look great, but this needed to hit more than just easy targets."
"slokes","6","1","1","12 February 2013"," Well, I Laughed Anyway
","Ben Stiller as an actor annoys me. He's too one-note and often shallow, making a poor fit for the derivative concept movies Ben Stiller the scenarist devises. Fortunately, Ben Stiller the director seems to have enough talent and good comic sense to bail the other Bens out sometimes.<br/><br/>Such a film is ""Tropic Thunder.""<br/><br/>Tugg Speedman (Stiller) leads a cast of coddled stars acting in a Vietnam war movie who have run their production a month behind schedule...in just the first week. Director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan), facing dismissal, opts to plant his actors directly in the jungle, away from their handlers and expensive distractions. Everything, of course, goes wrong.<br/><br/>What exactly goes wrong is something I don't want to spoil, except to say that viewers of ""Galaxy Quest"" and ""Three Amigos"" will recognize the situation. It's neither original or freshly delivered, though the fate of the frantic Cockburn did surprise me. As is the case with other Stiller films I've seen, we get a plot that exists only as a minimal structure for laugh lines and sight gags. Judd Apatow and Adam McKay make the same kind of comedies, but they seem to go for more audience engagement and character development than I see Stiller doing.<br/><br/>Stiller's strength is that he's a funny guy, and, in this movie, does a solid job developing an ensemble feel with his fellow actors. Robert Downey Jr. got most of the notice (and an Oscar nomination) as Australian method actor Kirk Lazarus who opts to play an African- American with the help of a special operation that amounts to blackface. He's so committed to his part he vows not to break character ""until the DVD commentary.""<br/><br/>Actually, in reality Downey didn't even do that until the commentary was nearly over. He presents a very funny character who talks entirely with lines lifted from a 1970s Blaxploitation thriller, like ""Ain't nothing but a thang."" He takes offense when someone says ""you people"" to him, meaning of course annoying method actors.<br/><br/>""What do you mean, YOU PEOPLE!"" he demands, eyes glaring.<br/><br/>""What do YOU mean, you people!"" asks the one actor on set who really is black, Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson).<br/><br/>The back and forth between these guys is really well delivered, with Jack Black getting in some fine lines and reaction shots as the strung- out star of a series of obnoxious fatty ""Klumps""-style comedies. There are some first-rate bits throughout, particularly an over-the-top opening action scene where the ample bloodletting is played for laughs and a discussion between Kirk and Tugg about the merits of not going ""full retard"" when assaying a mentally challenged role.<br/><br/>This, like Kirk's racial identity issues, could have stuck Stiller in Mel Gibson Land but instead comes off as successful satire. It's really the dog-eared story and Stiller's struggle to justify his star billing with a Derek Zoolander retread that make ""Tropic Thunder"" just a fun time-waster rather than an absurdist comedy to remember. You will laugh, but you may not remember a thing about this film a week later."
"Chase_Witherspoon","6","1","1","30 October 2012"," Not the full-lark though still earns a chuckle
","Irreverent tale of movie stars who are dropped in the middle of Vietnam thinking they'll be covertly filmed to promote realism in their next feature, when they discover they are really being hunted by local rebels. Stiller is the bone-headed leading man, Downey Jnr a face-painted African-American impersonator, Jack Black a cocaine-snorting bowl hair-styled actor whose fictitious credits include copious 'fart-joke' films (perhaps a poke at ""Norbit""). Each of them is on a journey to discover their inner thespian and learn to become more humble in the face of adversity, so goes the film's message.<br/><br/>There's some raucously funny moments (Tobey MaGuire's cameo is a side-splitter), but equally, there's a number of misfires and subtlety isn't an adjective you could use to describe Stiller's sledge-hammer style. Tom Cruise's cameo morphs into a self-indulgent supporting role that seriously tests the patience, while by contrast, Steve Coogan's role as a frustrated director, at his wits end dealing with prima donnas, is tragically brief.<br/><br/>Site gags and puerile dialogue aside, the film's core joke and running gags on racism and intellectual disability will either strike a chord, or offend, depending on your moral barometer. If you don't take it too seriously, though it's occasionally hit and miss and probably fifteen minutes overlong, you should still be entertained."

"DinnerWithAndre","5","1","1","5 January 2009"," Not the best, not what I expected, but it saved Tom Cruise.
","I don't have much to say about this movie. The humor was pretty transparent, I got all the references to Hollywood and which actors they were digging on and still couldn't force a laugh. The only funny moment, apart from anything coming out of Les Grossman's mouth, might have been Downey Jr. saying, ""We cool, right?"" to which Alpa Chino (really clever name, Stiller) replies, ""Not really."" At least it was a slap in the face for the all the fans of ""White Chicks"" who once called black-face a dirty, racist shtick. Now we know it's just not funny, period -- white or black.<br/><br/>Luckily, I saw this movie for the first time right after I saw ""Valkyrie"".<br/><br/>Get where this is going? <br/><br/>Of course, I wouldn't listen to the reviews: ""Tom Cruise is good for a laugh,"" etc. ""Valkyrie"" was great, if you can ignore Tom Cruise's lackluster performance, or just ignore him altogether (if they'd filmed him at home for a week he'd have made a better Nazi, I'll bet). So I left the theater, 10 bucks in the hole, and the worst part was that Hitler won in the end! Who saw that one coming?! Anyway, I was disappointed in ""Valkyrie,"" but I knew I had ""Tropic Thunder"" on DVD, sitting unopened at home. I popped it in, hoping against hope to restore my faith in recent movies, which it didn't. It made me wish Ben Stiller would've given up after ""Meet the Parents."" <br/><br/>It wasn't until halfway through that I realized it was Tom Cruise up there in the best role I've seen him in yet. His foul-mouthed, larger-than-life Grossman, like James Lipton on a pot of espresso and a handful of Stacker-2s, was nothing short of terrific. He utterly saved this film for me, injecting laughs after long bouts of watching Ben Stiller do his whiny face in the jungle, while he also sent ""Valkyrie"" the way of the July Plot. Just a funny coincidence that I saw both in four hours' time, and that he ruined a decent sort of film while saving a really bad one. He's a wild card, and not to be trusted with anyone's lead role. If you're a producer considering Tom Cruise, please consider that he'll more than likely either make or break your film, and no matter what he does, he will not fit in."

The worst of bad ideas is summed up with this film. Ben Stiller and Jack Black are not my most favourite of actors but I really love Robert Downey. Unfortunately Downey made a really bad mistake by taking part in this abortion. The humour just does not work and the satire is far too heavy handed to hit home. There was obviously a lot of money spent on this but it was wasted on effects and not spent on the script. Anyone who can find this rubbish amusing must be of such low intelligence and expectations it is hardly measurable. A total waste of a great cast (Stiller and Black excepted) and a script fished out from the bottom of a deep, deep waste bin . I think I would maybe class this as a vanity project for Stiller and an indulgence by Cruise and Downey. It's success astonishes me - it is a long SNL script and a bad one at that."

","Ask yourself this when you see ""Tropic Thunder"": Is the audience understanding this as a satire or are they taking retard jokes at face value? Why is this movie getting fantastic reviews? Critics are really giving this movie too much credit when the assume that brilliant satire underlies a mind-numbing reminder that Hollywood can still blow things up. I wonder if critics dared to go see this movie with the general population - then they would realize that laughing at Stiller's portrayal of mentally-retarded characters in the movie is not the same as laughing at the idea that Hollywood exploits these characters for entertainment.<br/><br/>The beginning held great promise, but even the acting of Robert Downey Jr. couldn't save this terrible excuse for a script. Stiller has worked on this for 10 years? Are you F'ing kidding me? I thought two guys sat down with a quarter of weed and just sat around for 5 hours saying ""... and then what if THIS happened?"" SPOILER ALERT: Matthew McCaughahey throws a TIVO box at a missile to save a helicopter from being blown up, with no mention of why he is in the Vietnamese jungle in the first place (uninspired spoof). Wake up critics - this is failed attempt, and would have been condemned to the caliber of ""Superhero"" movie if it didn't have such quality actors.<br/><br/>Satire is not stupid; it requires more than this simple rehash of Hollywood norms.

And within minutes you be laughing so hard because there are a lot of funny moments in the movie, some what of the wall. There are so many idiotic moment in this film but i'm not going to spoil that right now. But what makes the movie so funny? Robert Downey Jr. is perfect for playing in the role as a Australian man playing a black man but overshadowed by Black and Stiller and was given a multiple role screen time for the movie. This is not like a Apatow type nowadays but it will be funnier along with pineapple express.

"Jonny_Numb","5","4","9","20 August 2008"," Tropic Blunder
","It's hard to deny how inspired the premise is: that, in an era where John Rambo gets a blood-soaked, retro-fit reboot and the schlockmeister 'satirists' responsible for ""Meet the Spartans"" have another sign-of-the-apocalypse turd about to be unleashed upon mouth-breathing American audiences, that Ben Stiller would come along and meld both worlds into an action-comedy taking aim at a point in history that has almost exclusively been relegated to epic dramas (""The Deer Hunter""; ""Apocalypse Now""; ""Rescue Dawn""): the Vietnam war. While ""Tropic Thunder""'s general plot (that a bunch of prima donna macho actors become stranded in Myanmar but think it's all part of a movie they're filming) is far from original, its setting and implications provide a fertile ground for risquÃ© comedic shenanigans; and with a strong cast led by Stiller, Jack Black, and a wonderfully wacky Robert Downey Jr., the promise of a gut-busting good time is all but guaranteed. Strange, then, that while ""Tropic Thunder"" delivers spurts of chuckle-worthy lines and sight gags (Downey himself being one of 'em), the overall experience feels blunted and safe, reverting to stale satire of the Hollywood system (in a disastrously unfunny subplot involving a slimeball producer (played by none other than Tom Cruise) and an agent (Matthew McConaughey) looking to get his star a TiVO) to defang the proceedings. Even more problematic is the script's confusion over satirizing action-film excesses while being excessive itself: there is a tug-of-war between ridiculously overblown action scenes and broad, ""see-what-sticks"" humor (which requires the actors--Stiller, Black, and Cruise in particular--to play their parts to the rafters) that ultimately renders the proceedings meandering at best, pointless at worst. While Downey's performance and character shows the only real signs of creativity and comedic riskiness (he's an Australian actor playing a black Southern soldier), the three phony trailers (while also broad send-ups) that precede the actual movie portend a great untapped reservoir of humor. Too bad."

","Seeing a fat, bald, hairy Tom Cruise intensely moving to hip hop music after ferociously roaring at his underlings may give a cheap thrill but it will not make a decent movie.<br/><br/>This movie had a few such cheap thrills that do make you smile and even laugh out loud, however the movie seemed so recklessly made that I would not recommend seeing it, at least in the theaters.<br/><br/>The movie starts with several fake movie previews of the made up actors that give you an idea of who they are. There is a low brow B action movie hero, a wildly messy stooger like comedian that specializes in bodily noises and another self indulgent ""serious"" actor.<br/><br/>The laughter continues as the actual movie starts and we witness these actors making a Vietnam War movie. Seeing the dramatic way Speedo (Ben Stiller's character) is shot and a few other spoofs, brilliantly and hilariously satirize Vietnam War movies.<br/><br/>After the 15 minutes of fake previews and the Vietnam War movie spoofs, it unfortunately digresses into the story created. Perhaps it was part of the joke to create such a ridiculously stupid story, showing Tom Cruise dancing one minute and Jack Black shooting the Vietnamese in his underwear the next, but it also seemed so high budget and cinematically sweeping with beautiful cinematography of the exotic Vietnamese jungles that it seems as though this movie did not know where it wanted to be. It was also so recklessly made or edited that you barely know what is going on.

If you'll remember three Hollywood silent western stars are transported to Mexico which if you'll remember was in one anarchic state during the teen years of the last century. <br/><br/>What we have here is a few actors who are doing a Vietnam War movie in Vietnam giving the director and producer all kinds of grief with their various hangups. What to do is set them down in total isolation in the jungle with cameras and explosive devices.<br/><br/>Unfortunately that part of the jungle is now the turf of some nasty drug dealers who are intrepid actors have to do some real battle with. Especially after they capture one of them, Ben Stiller, and the ransom they demand from the producers ain't forthcoming.<br/><br/>The best gag in the film is Tom Cruise and the hilarious portrayal he gives in an unbilled role. I can't say more because that is the whole point of the joke. <br/><br/>Tropic Thunder could have stood some improvement, but I laughed pretty good in the theater.

","This film is arguably one of the best comedies of the 2000's. Ben Stiller after having a lull in his career came back strong with Tropic Thunder. He directed and co-wrote the screenplay with Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen. The cast for the movie was spot on. It brought back Jack Black back to the spot light and allowed juggernauts Robert Downey Jr and Tom Cruise to give iconic performances.<br/><br/>The plot of Tropic Thunder is that it's a movie about a movie. A group of actors set out to make a big budget Viet Nam film. However, they end up being put in the thick of a drug zone that forces the group to assume the roles they are playing. <br/><br/>Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) is an actor who use to be hot and now finds himself trying to save his career as leader of the team. Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr) is an Australian with multiple Academy Awards who undergoes pigment surgery to play his role. With the addition of Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson), Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), and Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel) as the rest of the team they set out to make movie history. <br/><br/>This film was nominated for one Oscar. It went to Robert Downey Jr. While this was the only Oscar it was nominated for it could have been nominated for Best Original Screenplay. Since the Academy doesn't often nominate comedies it didn't happen. <br/><br/>That aside the film is a work of genius. I have watched this movie year after year and still find it funny as I did that day in the theaters. Tropic Thunder gives you a chance to laugh at the Hollywood depiction of making a movie and gives you the chance to appreciate the talent that went into some of the performances. All together this film is just a great chance to let yourself laugh and have a good time."

","Tropic Thunder is a movie that I felt very disappointed and confused. I saw the good reviews on IMDb and other places and thought it was going to be that great yet when I saw it, it was kinda boring and unfunny. I'm gonna disagree with the majority and say that Tropic Thunder had a couple of chuckles, but was overall a rather dull comedy and a not very funny action film. I felt that the actors were mugging for the camera and the cheap shots at Hollywood were so far removed from reality that most of the satire fell flat.<br/><br/>The characters weren't that bad but really not that great either. Consider the Robert Downey Jr character. Downey did as good a job as anyone could in that role, but the role itself was not funny past the first second we see him. It was basically the same joke told throughout the film and it was only slightly amusing the first time. I'm not sure if African Americans were offended by the role, but I wouldn't be surprised because the character is not making any satirical comment that relates to anything in reality. Its just a white guy acting like a black guy. And he did it pretty wrong. Honestly they should have either gotten a black actor for that role or just make Downey Jr. without the makeup (not looking like a black male). The treatment of retarded people was also offensive, in my opinion, as was the treatment of Vietnamese people. And the ending was very predictable and not funny. As a rewatch 04.27.17' this film is not as bad as initially thought as for the comedy is mostly hit or miss. It is well with the chemistry of the lead characters, and the fake trailers and stories the film makes ensuring given the leads a backstory is well done. The supporting characters work well, with some of them stealing their scenes (Danny McBride, Nick Nolte, and especially Tom Cruise portraying his disguising character).

This is two hours of my life that were essentially stolen from me, and I'm not happy about it."
"jhsteel","7","3","6","26 March 2009"," In the spirit of satire, it works well
","This movie needs to be understood in the spirit in which it was meant. I don't like action movies or crude humour, but I enjoyed the whole because I understood where it was coming from. The initial ""trailers"" were hilarious and that gave me strong clue as to what to expect. As with The Player and Gosford Park (both by Altman) the main aim is to make a point that won't be spotted if taken at face value. This film works on a different level than a straight comedy because most of it is parody, and therefore the ""offensive"" jokes are intended to be taken in that spirit. I'm a big Robert Downey Jr fan and he was excellent in this - his true ability shone through, playing a method actor who is playing a black man playing a soldier. How many people could handle that? Jack Black's task was a bit more thankless but he made a good job of the character that he played. The cameos were great - this is another reminder of The Player (another Hollywood satire) which is full of cameos.<br/><br/>I found the plot interesting in its own right and if you enter into the premise of what might happen if a bunch of actors were actually dumped in a jungle for real, it takes on another dimension, ie. you can also take it seriously as an adventure. I was quite gripped by the story because I wasn't sure what would happen in the end (one major character died early on). Try to suspend disbelief and not be offended, and you might enjoy it."

","It seems to me that nearly every other comedy at the moment is a sex comedy that is either produced or written by Judd Apatow or it stars Seth Rogen . I don't have too much of a problem with that as they all tend to be quite funny but for how long? Luckily Tropic Thunder bucks that trend and we have a comedy that is not only different but is very funny too.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller plays pampered action superstar Tugg Speedman, who is cast in the biggest, most expensive war movie ever produced. He sets out to Southeast Asia with a ""Who's Who"" of celebrity co-stars. They include Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.), an intense, three-time Oscar(R)-winning actor; Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), star of the popular gross-out comedy franchise ""The Fatties""; multi-platinum hip-hop-star-turned-entrepreneur-turned-actor Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson); and first-timer Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel). Soon after the production begins the actors are thrown into a real-life situation and are forced to become the fighting unit they're portraying, in order to find a way out of the jungle in one piece.<br/><br/>Is there a more versatile actor around at the moment that Robert Downey Jr.? If there is i cant think of one. Despite his well publicised problems in the past he has come back with a vengeance and the diversity of rolls he picks has to be admired . From Chaplin to Iron man everything he does seems to work , but he has outdone himself here as the Australian method actor Kirk Lazarus who has a skin pigment operation to turn himself into an African American so as to immerse himself into the role He is quite Brilliant and makes this film worth watching on its own.Apparently he had some reservations about taking the part in case it would offend. I'm so glad he decided to do it.As Kirk Lazarus says ""I know what dude I am. I'm the dude playin' the dude, disguised as another dude! "" There are also some superb comic performances from Tom Cruise and Ben Stiller . You have to check out the final credits when Cruise's Character , Les Grossman , is dancing to gangster rap , Priceless.<br/><br/>Basically this movie is one big micky take out of Hollywood and it's actors and i admire Director Ben Stiller and the cast for going along with that.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed Tropic Thunder and although it does get a little silly at times the brilliant script and the first class comic acting make this a film not to be missed.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

The story there lacks a soul, and good cast does not bring any rescue. The most dumb thing to me was that it was obvious that to hide the lack of any actual concept, they tried to cover it with obscure texts which simply did not work (and I'm not saying I'm against hard wording). The only funny thing to me was to spot out that the ""rich man"" was actually played by Tom Cruise, which I did not catch in first moment.<br/><br/>I'm not saying you should not see it, but be warned."

","An out of control parody of war films such as ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Platoon"" which also makes fun of contemporary Hollywood and everything within it. ""Tropic Thunder"" starts off high flying and dominant, but then fizzles quickly when it actually gets to the heart of its story. Actors Ben Stiller (also co-writer/director), Robert Downey, Jr., Jack Black, and others get thrown together in a would-be epic Vietnam flick, but their prima-donna ways lead to issues abound for their first time British director (Steve Coogan), their war veteran screenwriter (Nick Nolte), and a crazed movie mogul (an almost unrecognizable Tom Cruise as he is totally unbound) who funds the entire production. Thus the actors get thrown into an East Asian hotbed of international heroin production where the enemy has the tale-tell signs of 1970s Vietnam. Another one of those big budget summer would-be blockbusters which shows all its good points in the movie spots and cinematic trailers. The movie ends up being a long and tiring exercise accentuated by foul-mouthed characters and chaotic set pieces. Downey, Jr.'s transformation into an African-American is weird to say the least and Black's hidden narcotic addiction is supposed to be a funny side-story which ends up being annoying and completely unwanted. Just think ""The Three Amigos"" for the 2000s group who crave constant adult situations and mediocre outcomes. 2.5 out of 5 stars."

","Brilliant Robert Downey Jr. as 6 time Academy Award Winner Australian actor Kirk Lazarus, who has physically altered himself to play African American character Linc, says, ""I don't read the script. The script reads me!"" Confused fellow actor Kevin Sandusky (excellent Jay Baruchel) exclaims, ""What do you mean?"" Writer and Director Ben Stiller's ""Tropic Thunder"" is absolutely hysterical, and is the funniest movie of the year. With the screenplay by Stiller, Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen, from the story by Stiller and Theroux, ""Tropic Thunder"" is among the funniest and clever movies ever made. The work alone by Robert Downey Jr. as acclaimed actor Kirk Lazarus and the almost indistinguishable Tom Cruise are beyond praise and totally off the hook. There is a scene where Downey as Australian Lazarus, playing a Black man, is disguised as a Vietnamese speaking Mandarin. No wonder even Lazarus is confused saying: ""I know who I am! I'm the dude playing the dude disguised as another dude!"" No more shall be revealed about Cruise's role. Needless to say it is comic genius.<br/><br/>Director Ben Stiller generates amazing performances from his lead actors including himself, Jack Black, Downey, Brandon T. Jackson, and Nick Nolte. But the surprises are the big name supporting actors like Matthew McConaughey as Tugg's agent Rick Peck and of course Tom Cruise. ""Tropic Thunder"" will offend virtually everyone, and every group of people. Stiller and crew have written bold biting comedy blind to elements of conventional taste that mercilessly mocks the egos at play in the world of celebrity and entertainment.<br/><br/>""Tropic Thunder"" is about a movie within a moviewell, for the most part. In ""Tropic Thunder"" overwhelmed movie director Damien Cockburn (wonderfully scattered Steve Coogan) is charged with making the Vietnam War picture ""Tropic Thunder"". ""Tropic Thunder"" is based on the book by wounded Vietnam vet Four Leaf Tayback (completely out there Nick Nolte). Damien (Coogan) is charged with the nearly impossible task of filming this movie with a cast of ""prima donnas"". Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) is the washed up action star seeking to revive his plummeting career. Kirk Lazarus (Downey) is the Oscar Winner Actor, who remains in character until he does the narration for the DVD release. Lazarus also underwent a controversial procedure to look like the African American sergeant he plays in the movie. Rapper Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson) is the Chris Ludicrous-like character crossing over from hip-hop to acting. Jeff Portnoy (crazed and funny Jack Black) is the comedic star, whose claims to fame are movies about flatulent characters. Portnoy is also a big time coke addict. Kevin Sandusky (geeky funny Jay Baruchel) is the young actor with his big break. After 4 days of shooting ""Tropic Thunder"" is something like $100 million dollars over budget according to ""E!"" Under mounting pressure from his producer, Damien (Coogan) follows the whacked out recommendation from Tayback (Nolte). Damien basically high jacks his actors into the jungles of Vietnam to film his greatest war movie ""guerilla style"". Predictably something goes very wrong. What follows is hilarious comic mayhem. Ben Stiller has the toughest role, because his Tugg is a complete idiot. To his credit he doesn't get smarter. It is only through Stiller's charm and support by Downey, does Tugg become sympathetic.<br/><br/>The controversy surrounding the characterization of the mentally disabled or handicapped, is warrantedI suspect. The inappropriate vernacular is used. However, in context the target is really the skewering of narcissistic method acting and actors. In the exchange Lazarus (Downey) advises Speedman (Stiller), ""Never go full"" This is a well written piece about Oscar politics and what lands with an audience involving Hoffman, Hanks, Sellers, and Penn. The arc for this narrative thread is not smug or cruel. We do live in interesting times.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. is an amazing talent. As Kirk Lazarus, Downey demonstrates that he can do virtually anything on screen and just kill. Even as out there as his character Lazarus; he can generate insight whether it is his conversation about ""Simple Jack"" with Stiller or when he says to Jackson's Alpa Chino, ""We cool?"" Downey enrolls an authentic presence in the most warped contexts. Stiller grounds his Speedman in compassionate stupid. As director Stiller delivers his talented cast on deadly comic ground. ""Tropic Thunder"" is smart, offensive, and will make you laugh out loud."

I just want to say that it is not acceptable to use the ""r"" word, especially when it is used to make a cheap punchline. People, especially children, are hurt everyday by being called the ""r"" word.

Explosives and uproarious! Writer/director Ben Stiller and his fellow screenwriter Justin Theroux have made the awesome finale to the 2008 Summer movie season.<br/><br/>It's a good thing Ben Stiller has so many A-list friends who are willing to appear in this movie even for a cameo.

"fwomp","10","4","10","30 August 2008"," Can You Say ""Oscar-Worthy""?
","There aren't many movies that live up to the hype seen on previews and ads. Fewer still in the comedy genre that might have a shot at an Oscar. But TROPIC THUNDER does both thanks to a sturdy screenplay, perfect acting, and some of the funniest dialogue you'll hear this year.<br/><br/>Standing out amongst other ridiculous comedies that often go for the cheap-shot, Tropic Thunder hits higher comedic notes thanks to a plethora of items. First is the screenplay. From the VERY BEGINNING of the film, you immerse yourself in these characters' lives. My advice to movie-watchers is to show up early and watch the previews, as you're in for a not-so-subtle surprise. The ""faux-previews"" were an excellent way to introduce the characters and get an immediate feel for who they were. And who are they? Ben Stiller (NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM) stars as Tugg Speedman, an actor on the downward slide of success. Having been a big action star (think Sly Stallone), Tugg is having difficulties procuring decent roles. Although Stiller does a fine job as the actor-turned ...well ...actor, he doesn't hit the mark in terms of losing himself in the part like others did (see below)...<br/><br/>Jack Black (NACHO LIBRE) is Jeff Portnoy, a two-bit actor who's comedies are all about gaseous releases (""Everybody laughs at me just because I fart!""). He's also an addict and when he tries to clean up in the jungles of Vietnam, Black turns in some of the funniest bit lines of the film (many of which I can't state here and earned this film its firm R rating). In terms of acting history, Portnoy's follows similar terrain as that of Eddie Murphy in his fat suit films.<br/><br/>Brandon T. Jackson stars as Alpha Chino (need I say more? Yes? Okay). A rough, tough, black man with a gentler  shall we say  feministic side, Jackson battles his sexuality as well as his ethnicity.<br/><br/>Jay Baruchel (KNOCKED UP) comes on as Kevin Sandusky, the only ""normal"" guy in this cadre of demented and damaged actors. He envies their acting histories and has a bit of hero worship going on with one of them. He also turns out to be the glue that helps hold the gang together. Think Tom Hanks in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and you'll be close.<br/><br/>And saving the absolute best for last, we have bad-boy Robert Downey Jr. (IRON MAN) as Kirk Lazurus, a confused white man gone black, and lost amidst his multiple character personalities. Watching him peel back his personas toward the end of the film was sheer genius. Lazurus so immerses himself in-character that he doesn't come out ""until the special features on the DVD."" He's also tough to deal with. And he's an Aussie. And he's a great actor. Sound like anyone you know? Russell Crowe should rapidly come to mind.<br/><br/>The screenplay must get notice here, too. And mentioning that Justin Theroux had his hand in it. This is the same Theroux who starred in the sensational series SIX FEET UNDER. He seems to have understood how to come up with comedy that isn't DUMB AND DUMBER, and hits the mark head-on.<br/><br/>The dialogue is simply astounding, especially when coupled with these well-knowns in the comedic field. But Downey Jr. is the real star here, delivering his lines with flawless precision and in a voice that irritates the crap out of Alpha Chino, a real black guy who finds Lazurus' constant in-characterness to be grating and insulting.<br/><br/>This is truly a phenomenal piece of cinema, with action and comedy meshed so well together that there's not a single moment for the mind to rest.<br/><br/>Oscar worthy? Yes. But will it make it? Let's hope so."

Surprisingly, one of the strongest in the bunch was supporting player Jay Baruchel. Danny McBride manages to not be funny now for the second time this month after Pineapple Express. Why are they trying to make this guy a star?<br/><br/>Then there's Tom. Tom Cruise's role here would not have even been amusing as a cameo, but they go even further and stretch it out into an entire supporting role, and in all his scenes, he fails to elicit even a single chuckle. To top it off, he is featured in a pointless scene at the very end and over the credits that was so annoying and unfunny it was almost enough to make me dock its rating another whole star."

","Tropic Thunder is one of the best comedies ever!Period.I have to admit that i had a very high expectation's for this movie since some of my very,likable actor's are acting in it!Such as Nick Nolte,Ben Stiller,Jack Black,Robert Downey...Oh yeah,Tom Cruise and Matthew McConaughey too!Just take a look at the cast.Would those actor's really acted in some movie if they'd thought it's not worth it?I don't think so!The cast alone tell's you how good movie this is! I must say that i was really surprised by Robert Downey.If there weren't Heath Ledger,he would of won the Oscar.This is Robert Downey's best role so far.He was even better then in Chaplin.He acted this role better then Denzel Washington him self,would of! Nick Nolte was also great.As alway's of course an i want even speak of Tom Cruise,who was truly excellent.Too short the story,everyone was great! Another thing that's great,maybe even Oscar nomination worthy,is direction.Ben Stiller really did it this time.He really outmatched him self.<br/><br/>I must say that this is not the kind of movie everyone will like.This is a kind of an intelligent comedy.Don't get me wrong,i'm not trying to disrespect anyone or say that i liked it because i'm smart or something,it's just that some people want comedies too be simple.To be something like the way to relax their mind for an hour or two.<br/><br/>Now,i've noticed that some black communities were protesting about Robert Downey playing a black man.That is a white man playing a black man.Well i think that those communities are overreacting and that those communities are insulting their selves.What Ben Stiller tried to do by writing such a role where the white man is playing a black man is to make fun of Hollywood.To show how stupid Hollywood really is.I mean come on...Would you really be surprised if one day in some drama movie,a white man would actually be playing a black man.I sure wouldn't.That's Hollywood.A kind of a sick world in which nothing can really surprise you.<br/><br/>I also noticed that some war veteran's were protesting about how this movie is making fun of them.Well i must say 'wrong' again.It's not making fun of patriot's or anything like that,it's just making fun of all the people who make money by making a war movies and saying that they don't make them for the money but because they are patriot's.Like a tribute to the country.Well that's bullsh_t!Most of those guy's who make those movies haven't seen war.Not a piece of it.Most of them weren't even alive at the time.I mean,OK,maybe Oliver Stone.But don't think he's making those movies because of the patriotism either.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to judge some people with this comment or anything like that.Frankly,i don't give a damn since i'm not American but what i'm trying to say is that there are alway's some communities complaining about some movies in America.To those communities,no matter which,gay,black or veteran or any other communities,i just want to say that they should finally understand the fact that those are only movies.No point in complaining about 'em when they're gonna be made anyway! <br/><br/>Just one more thing.I've noticed that some people were complaining that this movie is insulting mentally challenged people.Well,once more 'totally wrong'!This movie is just showing how in Hollywood every second actor built's his career and win's Oscar's for those role's.I mean let's face it.Almost every actor who portrayed mentally challenged person won an Oscar or at least was nominated.Toma Hank's,Dustin Hoffman, and so on...Even Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar for portraying Christie Brown,who wasn't mentally challenged but sick.However he looked like he was mentally challenged.That brought him an Oscar.And he deserved it,definitely,just as both of those actor's i just wrote.But that's not the thing.The thing is that they haven't portrayed those roles out of charity but because of their own benefit.-----And that's just what this movie tries to show us,how really sanctimonious Hollywood is!----- <br/><br/>Anyway,to end with my comment.Tropic Thunder is a smart and brilliant movie that shouldn't be taken to easily.It's a movie that's very funny but still not just another comedy!

Anyone who has seen actual footage from Vietnam would have to be a sociopath to find this movie entertaining. My Lai, anyone? Regardless of whether U.S. involvement in Vietnam is considered right or wrong, it should not be placed on Hollywood's cheap comedy chopping block. Furthermore, before the ignorant masses decide to make fun of something so catastrophically large, they should seek to understand it. Try reading A Rumor of War or Dispatches. Just don't buy into the mindset that it's okay to make fun of whatever you choose! How would people feel if a parody of the Iraq War was made next year?

"harry_tk_yung","Null","3","7","25 August 2008"," Dummies' guide to Hollywood film making
","My summary line is probably a real title in the ""dummies' guide"" series of self-improvement books, but this movie is a horse of a different colour.<br/><br/>Through a brilliantly ridiculous plot of five actors' adventure (or rather misadventure) from stumbling into a real war zone while making a war movie is Indochina, this movie exposes all aspect of ""the ugly movie makers"", using the blackest of black comedies. On the simple fun side, it spoofs (but nothings like these cheap summer spoof movies) everything in Hollywood from the spilled guts in ""Saving Private Ryan"" to the famous landmark of Devils Tower in ""Close encounter of the third kind"". More importantly, all the manipulative, cold blooded, ruthless, loathsome, despicable aspect of the movie business is dressed up in such outlandish black comedy that they make you laugh where you should have flinched, get nauseated or gag with detestation. That is the exceptional achievement of this movie.<br/><br/>Visually, the cinematography of the spectacular, lush tropical landscape and the explosive (both literally and figuratively) action sequences are second to none. The script provide lively dialogues, some with real class, such as ""going from white dwarf to a black hole"" in describing an actor's rapidly declining career. But it's the performances that put this movie on the map of the memorables. Characterization is so rich that you may find yourself hardly able to notice anything else. And then there's the cast: principals, supports and cameos! The three main roles (3 of the 5 actors stumbling unwittingly into the territories of a drugs gang in the Indochina peninsular) display three distinct levels of characterization.<br/><br/>At the simplest level is Jack Black's portrayal a stereotyped funny guy  fat, farting fully drugs-addicted. These the rawest form of humour  nothing wrong with it, and Black is good at it. One level deeper is Adam Sadler as a different kind of idiot, a fading actor with an identity problem. But unlike some of Sadler's more standard fare, this one comes with a shade of ambiguity that is just right  it's never sure whether he is playing the fool or a real fool.<br/><br/>Best, however, is Robert Downey Jr. who has become the hottest property in Hollywood after his miraculous comeback in ""Iron Man"" (just consider the commotion caused by his mere 2-minute appearance at the end of ""The incredible Hulk"" (2008)). The audience would be looking for RDJ in the character he plays but they better not blink. First, he plays an Australian star actor named Kirk Lazarus taht was purportedly written to target Heath Ledger but with the great actor's untimely death, eased somewhat towards Russell Crowe. However, we are not witnessing so much Lazarus' ""real"" life, but rather him playing a character in the (war) movie in this movie. Having fun yet? Hang on. This Lazarus, a method actor who has achieved just about everything and wanting a new challenge, engineered a complete physical and ego metamorphosis to play a black guy in this movie-within-a-movie. I have lost count of the layers, but if you want to look for all of these in RDJ (and they are all there), better not blink.<br/><br/>The other two members of the lost actors/troops are played by Jay Baruchel and Brandon T. Jacksons, not big names (you may recognize them vaguely from ""Knocked up"" and ""8 miles"" respectively) but good actors who have nothing to be ashamed of in the company of the 3 stars. Talking about stars, in some of the key supporting roles are Nick Nolte, Matthew McConaughey, Steve Coogan and an all-but-recognizable Tom Cruise, all playing roles from somewhat eccentric to grossly exaggerated, as befitting this black comedy. As to star cameos that you may miss if you blink (another reason for not blinking), watch out for John Voight, Mickey Rooney, Tobey Maquire and Anthony Hopkins (who is not even credited).<br/><br/>While over-the-top at times (depending on the viewer's point of view), this movie is full of energy and fun, and not lacking in subtle sub-texts. While the cast is indisputably impressive, some hold the view that watching Robert Downey Jr alone is worth it all."

","I love Ben Stiller and totally loved Robert Downey Jr. in this movie and even (shock) loved Tom Cruise. Still. i didn't find the movie the move offensive (c'mon people, it's 2008 -- movies nowadays poke fun at everyone at some point and this movie was harmless stupid humor). What really bothered me is that I just felt it all fell flat. It had it's tremendously funny moments, but as far as laugh out loud moments, they were few and far between. And sadly, at one point, i found myself checking the time which is never a bad sign. Something seemed terribly disconnected and I find it unrelatable to audiences who don't get ""insider jargon"" in the movie business."

It was actually pretty funny. <br/><br/>I have been reading some comments on here, saying that the movie is racist and politically incorrect. While i do some what agree, i gotta say it's good to finally see a movie with some balls. Pretty much if you are easily offended by strong violence you most probably wont like this film.<br/><br/>The cast in the film were great. Robert Downey Jr was great as an Australian / African American and Tom Cruise was fantastic in his cameo, i didn't even recognise him until the end. Ben Stiller was, well Ben Stiller but he did a good job a writing and directing.<br/><br/>Over all the movie was solid and funny. It wasn't your average politically correct comedy, and thats what was so great about it. If you are looking for a fun action film I highly recommend it. If you are looking for something along the lines or meet the parents style comedy you will be let down.<br/><br/>it's good to finally see Hollywood make fun of them self for once."

There are plenty of reasons to get offended I suppose but it's not done with the intent of offending someone. For example Robert Downey taking his characters way too serious ""I don't leave character until I do the DVD commentary"".<br/><br/>Everyone in the cast is great, with the stand outs being Robert Downey Jr. & the surprise cameos especially from Tom Cruise. The rest do their jobs as needed to drive home the comedy.<br/><br/>Now the action is pretty funny as well, overly dramatic & overly graphic sometimes but never overwhelming.<br/><br/>A great directorial debut from Stiller & a wonderful reminder why some of these actors are as loved as they are.

"djsmith","3","3","7","18 August 2008"," The End of Comedy
","This is an adequate movie. It tries hard. But it can't be much of a comedy because I don't hear myself laughing. It tries to spoof other movies but the humor falls flat. For example, Jack Black is shown as an Eddie Murphy type star who plays all the roles in his movies, whose trademarks are flatulence and obesity. The problem is that the Eddie Murphy movies that are being spoofed are not funny. Neither is the spoof. Another attempted spoof is of the tendency Hollywood has to give Academy Awards to actors who play ""retards."" The joke is the observation that to play the role correctly (e.g. Rain Man) you have to play it as a ""half-retard."" Maybe a decent observation. But the setup and the punch line are not funny. As the saying goes, death is easy, comedy is hard. This movie is a living demonstration. As with other movies that make fun of other movies, there is little observational humor. As with other R-rated movies of late, bad language are substitutes for jokes. This movie is overrated. The only reason to see it, is that it is better than the competition. If you are waiting for a good comedy, you need to keep waiting."
"MartinHafer","4","5","15","8 December 2008"," Despite appearances, down deep, this film is extremely formulaic
","A group of idiotic spoiled actors are on location in Southeast Asia in order to make a war film. However, the project is running amok and the director has no control over the actors. Finally, in desperation, he takes just the actors, writer and special effects man into the jungle and dumps them--forcing them to act without the entourages, cell phones and the like. However, shortly after he does this, the group wanders into a real war zone and it takes some time for the hapless actors to realize the shooting is real as well as to get out alive.<br/><br/>I found much of the first 30 minutes or so of TROPIC THUNDER to be highly offensive but also clever, as the audience gets inside into the behind the scenes aspects of making a film. The language was unbearably crude as the film makers seemed to think that screaming long strings of obscenities was funny, but at least the idea of showing a problem movie being made was reasonably clever. However, after this decent (but crude) setup, the film floundered as it seemed to be pure formula. In other words, despite being set in the jungles of Southeast Asia, the audience knew exactly what would happen because this type of film has been made again and again. They knew that the group of idiot actors would somehow get it together and become a cohesive group--like REMEMBER THE TITANS and so many other films. And, they also knew that despite 100,000 live bullets supposedly being shot at our group, no one would die or even suffer a significant injury!! And, by the end of the film, all the actors will have resolved their life issues in the process--the gay guy coming to grips with being gay, the chameleon-like actor realizing he has no idea who he really is any more and the lousy actor finally getting it together and earning that Oscar. Puh-leeze!! <br/><br/>So, really, apart from a few jokes here and there and some interesting interplay between Robert Downey and Ben Stiller as two nutty method actors, this movie offered nothing that wasn't predictable--just film cliché after film cliché. Frankly, when all was said and done, I felt a bit gypped--I wanted a film that took risks and tried to be something more than just another buddy film. Apart from a couple prosthetic arms on Nick Nolte and black-face makeup on Robert Downey, I just felt the film was the same old Hollywood film formula recycled yet again--with a bit of RAMBO II thrown in to boot. Plus, to cap it off, some of the performances (like the one-note film exec ridiculously overplayed by Tom Cruise) were just awful. <br/><br/>How could this film have made so much money?! It's got a few good moments but also abounds with clichés."
"MairegChernet","10","4","11","31 August 2008"," Tropic Thunder is the best comedy of the year.
","Stiller, Black, Downey Jr. you put those three guys together and what do you expect other than a ridiculously hilarious masterpiece. And not to mention Tom Cruise's cameo as Les Grossman. <br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is a success for Ben Stiller and for all involved in the making. It's a great political satire and defines parody real well. The film is either making you laugh or providing you with mind-blowing action. It's a great satirical comedy that'll keep you laughing hysterically.<br/><br/>The movie of course is not all about the profanity and utter gore, it is more about the acting. Robert Downey Jr., after the success of Iron Man, makes a comeback with Tropic Thunder and boy was he great. Almost throughout the whole movie he is disguised as a black man not only by the way he looks but also the way he talked and acted. He did it in a somewhat of an exploitational manner which by the way was hilarious and even gets questioned by one of his fellow actors why he's still in character knowing that they are not making a movie anymore, for which he responds ""I don't drop a character till I done the DVD commentary"". Seeing this movie should make every movie goer realize that Robert Downey Jr. is a very talented man who handles both comedy and actions and about anything else that gets thrown onto him.<br/><br/>As far as the rest of the cast is concerned, all of them were thoroughly enjoyable, starting from the desperate actor Tugg Speedman(Stiller) to the drug addicted fatty Jeff Portnoy(Blcak), and the somewhat witty and young rapper Chino(Jackson). They were all irresistible. Not to forget the surprise cameo by Tom Cruise no one saw coming. His character is really irreverent and mainly laugh out loud funny, (especially the way he answered the ransom call). His character Les Grossman is very foul-mouthed and has short temper and is very hilarious.<br/><br/>The concept of the film is very simple yet smart. The goal is to poke fun at war movies which the film did very well and provide the audience with smart and dumb jokes at the same time. And one thing Very impressive about this film is that it wasn't self-indulgent. It knew whether or not the jokes hit their target, and if they didn't they weren't prolonged. They were quick and most of them hit their mark like a bullet. <br/><br/>Stiller is becoming more than an actor these days. He is displaying his intelligence by writing directing and acting all at once. We will look forward to his next project which I think is going be Night at the Museum 2. TROPIC THUNDER RULES. THE BEST ACTION/COMEDY OF THE YEAR."

Ever wanted to see Tobey Maguire and Robert Downey Jr. play gay priests? I honestly never thought I'd never see myself write that.<br/><br/>The storyline consists of exactly this: a director decides to make a war film, he doesn't like the way it's turning out so he accepts the advice to put the actors in the real situation. Soon enough, Ben Stiller is licking the blood from the director's decapitated head, unknowing that it is not corn syrup which he claims it is, Jack Black is obsessed with cocaine and Robert Downey Jr. is disguised as a black man for the entire movie.<br/><br/>There's honestly not much else to be mentioned. It's by far one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen and it has an A-list cast. Enough said."

","The first 10 minutes of Tropic Thunder are hilarious! I mean, it had a great start. The film also had a lot of brilliant and funny scenes scattered throughout, but they were rare, and ultimately the film was a huge disappointment. I got the satire, but I expected a more effective execution of it, and the parody as well. What I got was a surprisingly pretty mainstream comedy with a lot of action in it. The first half at least felt somewhat entertaining. The 2nd half lost me completely. I was just waiting for it to end. It was that dull. Downey Jr. of course held up many scenes, but there's so much he could do. I hated Jack Black in it as always, and Tom Cruise was not nearly as funny as some people (including himself) make out his scenes to be. Overall, a heavy disappointment, and pretty mediocre when it comes down to it. Why can't more comedies (which I am not a huge fan of) explore and dwelve into more complex events, like for example the far superior and deeply underrated Observe and Report? I do want to say that I really liked the final 5 minutes though."

","Unless this film is best watched under the influence of substances, I can't see how anyone with a halfway sophisticated mind would rate it higher than middling.<br/><br/>The intro ""trailers"" offered promise of similar clever gags to come, but it seemed like they soaked up more creativity than could be adequately spread throughout the remainder. It became clear about 30 minutes in that this was going to be sub-par. <br/><br/>The pacing gave the impression of trying to seem energetic, but it never got a solid rhythm going. Something was just off about the flow of the jokes, and timing tends to be critical when people are meant to laugh. I got the impression of different writers working on different scenes and not quite comparing notes.<br/><br/>The Tom Cruise fat-suit character was by far the funniest to me, followed by the Robert Downey Jr. black impersonation, then Nick Nolte's grizzled veteran. Stiller only provoked real laughter in the ""trailer"" scenes and a few intermittent moments. Jack Black just seemed over the top and obnoxious.<br/><br/>I kept taking note of the uneven pacing, and when you find yourself doing that, you know a film isn't quite working. I found it worth watching, but just barely."
"eric262003","7","2","4","1 February 2010"," Very Good Movie But A Tiring Plot
","""Tropic Thunder"" is very high up there as one of 2008's more entertaining films and also shows that comedies don't necessarily have to go overboard with slapstick silliness or stupid repetitive one-liners. One of the main weak points however, was that the story tends to lack in any original concepts that it gets very average to say the least. The actors and their performances are what carries the movie and successfully transforms a rather mundane story into something incredibly riveting to show that comedies do have places in the Academy Awards. It just needs to be handled more productively and the right people to direct them.<br/><br/>The story is about a group of thespians starring in a Vietnam War movie in hopes this bags in a few awards along the way. However, the director of this movie (Steve Coogan) decides to spruce things up a bit by putting his performers in the actual location where this alleged ""true story"" took place and the actors find themselves in a precarious situation where real adversaries inhabit the location of where the movie is being shot. The comedy depends on the actors who unconsciously don't believe they're in danger.<br/><br/>When you compare it to other comedies, like ""Zoolander"", and ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and whatnot, the comical elements have bee lowered down by quite a notch. Not to say ""Tropic Thunder"" wasn't funny, but not as funny as I anticipated. The one who stood out was Robert Downey Jr. as an Australian Caucasian playing an African American as he gets into character and delivers some of the best lines in the movies. For all you sensitive viewers, fear not. There is no ounce of stereotyping in Downey's character. So please, don't take any kind of offence towards the character. I felt more offended when Christopher Walken played an Asian in ""Balls of Fury"". Even though Ben Stiller is the man of the hour in this movie, he still plays the same roles he's played in the past decade. Sure the naive schtick suits better in low-brow comedies he's been in, ""Tropic Thunder"" just doesn't cut it here. Jack Black I like very much, but here he has little to do or say here which is sad because his comic antics could have been put to good use. <br/><br/>In an odd twist in the story and a very unforgettable scenes pits Tom Cruise as the mentally unbalanced Les Grossman demanding the key grip to clobber the director. It strange because in most films, Cruise is playing it straight and cool. Here as Grossman, he comes off as sympathetic character who just has an uncontrollable cursing problem. I thought the creepy dancing scene near the end lacked the coherency of the movie which was very pointless. <br/><br/>A wonderful movie overall, but I think the performers really poured their hearts out in giving us a comedy to look back and enjoy for many years to come. I just wished the writers found more comical moments instead of depending on the cast to carry the movie on their own. But I will say that it was brave of Downey to play a black man without trying to acting silly or even clichéd to the point where our ultra-sensitive viewers won't mash their teeth in anger. Go see it I assure you, you will be mesmerized."

Jack Black's character had one dimension and was annoying and boring. Nick Nolte was underutilized as was Danny McBride. This is a story not worth telling. Everything is predictable and boring.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller is an excellent actor and should stick to acting, not directing."

The movie has good acting and good actors but there is no script and no direction in this movie.

","Tropic Thunder is rather entertaining even if you haven't seen the movies which it's taking the mickey out of, really. I found all the war movie references hilarious and could relate them back to the original things. But it is not just a comment or parody on war movies but a parody of the movie business in general.<br/><br/>Even the false previews at the beginning made me laugh, because they seemed so ridiculous. But then I realised that some movie previews actually are ridiculous. Like the ones which are just another copy of the first movie you've seen. Like carbon copies of the first one.<br/><br/>In this movie, the storyline was a little bit implausible but still funny enough to let me into the world and I found the characters particularly interesting in their comments and reactions towards each other.They really made the movie though and they each had traits which made them easily identifiable, unlike some war movies where all the characters sort of mush into each other and become faces rather than people.<br/><br/>As a parody, I'd have to say that this movie is a success. It really manages to echo the film industry and war films in a way which shows the characters and without becoming too obsessed with creating too many different elements which become confused."

Plenty of stupid one liners, but it mixes in some terrific satire as well. The movie trailers in the beginning were PRICELESS. Robert Downey's character is one of the funniest I have ever seen.<br/><br/>However, this movie isn't for everyone. As with most Stiller movies, it will appeal to younger audiences MUCH more than older audiences as there is still plenty of ""childish"" humor in it. Still, everyone should watch this movie, because there's an excellent chance that you'll get some laughs out of it."

But the movie still sucks.<br/><br/>I'm very picky this way; if I'm going to sit for 1.5 hours and watch something, it has to do better than to amble from one comic bit to another. Without an overarching narrative/moral grain it eventually starts to feel like slow torture.<br/><br/>If you enjoy watching great comic actors do their professional thing, then you'll like this.

"michaeljharvey","4","2","4","28 December 2008"," If it's not funny, make it louder
","Tropic Thunder is a confused mess that left me greatly disappointed. First off, the intention of the writers is never clear as the film meanders quite a bit. Is this supposed to be a ""Hollywood insider"" movie, poking fun at the film industry, or is this a parody of Vietnam War films? The storyline goes back and forth, but never really commits to either concept. The combination of the two ideas doesn't work together at all.<br/><br/>There are some moments in this movie that are quite funny, but they're scarce. The funny stuff is drowned out by endlessly loud scenes of characters simply yelling obscenities and insults at each other. I suppose this is supposed to pass for comedic writing, but for me it just became annoying very quickly.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller, funny in many of his previous films (Zoolander, Meet the Parents, There's Something About Mary... to name a few) falls flat here. He doesn't know what to do with his vanilla character, a parody of a washed-up action movie star. Robert Downey Jr., an obviously white actor, is asked to play a black man, clearly poking fun at racism in the Hollywood casting process. The fact that many reviewers have interpreted his role as racist shows that the joke just didn't translate very well, despite a clever concept. Jack Black is purely along for the ride (and the paycheck) in this one. He's plays a slapstick movie star with a bad drug problem. That's about all there is to say regarding his poorly-written, poorly-developed, unfunny character. Tom Cruise offers a cameo appearance, which is unexpected and funny at first, but soon gets overly loud, obnoxious and repetitive (much like the film itself).<br/><br/>The concluding action sequence is way too long and unfunny. I realize the writers had intended to parody over-the-top action movie conclusions (imagine something from a Schwarzenegger film...). However, unintentionally, they created exactly what they were trying to mock. Too many explosions and tons of predictable ""one liner"" dialogue beat the viewer into submission.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of goofy, fun comedy, but somehow this one missed the mark for me. I wish I had re-watched Anchorman, Superbad or even Dumb and Dumber instead."

I generally don't find language in movies offensive, however, the language in this film was just unnecessary...and not too mention EXTREMELY crude.

Every scene had someone dropping F-Bombs. I mean non stop and even the song in the end was some rap garbage with non stop f-bombs. Why do people think that's funny?

The fake trailers at the start an the opening scene are extremely funny. But after a while the main running jokes end up wearing thin. Take Downey Jr's character for example. Sure at first his playing of the stereotypical black sergeant is funny but half way through the movie I was already tired of his shtick. Plus I found a lot of his dialogue hard to understand. Another example is Tom Cruise's turn as Lex Grossman. Sure it's hilarious to see him as a fat, bald exec with a foul mouth and a short fuse, but when all that comes out of his mouth is expletives then it becomes old extremely quickly. Same with his dance routine, funny at first but then they had to bring it back for the closing credits and run it into the ground.<br/><br/>I always enjoy watching Ben Stiller and Jack Black. I find them genuinely funny, but here it's almost as if I was laughing in anticipation of a joke that never happened.

I almost turned this off after about and hour, it wasn't funny, it was boring and just plain stupid. It did get better towards the back end however when there was a bit more action a some better jokes but it didn't make up for the boringness that was the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Jack Black hardly did anything funny and didn't really do much to be honest. Robert Downey Jr was annoying and I could hardly understand a word he said for most of the time. The rest were OK and Stiller was just above average. The whole film seamed a bit slow, it felt like an eternity before anything funny was said and even then it wasn't that funny and would only of been funny to the sort of people that found South Park funny just because they swore, I'm a bit more mature and didn't find this funny (apart from one bit but I won't spoil it for you).<br/><br/>Overall it was watchable.... once, I could never watch it again and would definitely not buy it on DVD.

"funkyfry","8","2","4","27 October 2008"," very funny -- Stiller's best work on film
","Ben Stiller has always been more interesting as a writer and director than simply as a comedy personality. ""The Ben Stiller Show"" was one of the sketch comedy gems of the 1980s although it got canceled right after I discovered it, and although also not hugely successful he showed with ""Zoolander"" that he could be irreverent and very funny on the big screen as well. I thought ""Tropic Thunder"" was even more irreverent, almost anarchic, and more entertaining than ""Zoolander."" The kind of ""laugh out loud"" moments that seem to elude him to some extent in ""Zoolander"" are peppered much more evenly throughout this film. And just as ""Zoolander"" was basically about the shallow aspects of celebrity culture in America, so too this film has fun with the pretensions of actors and their relative self-seriousness. For example the character of the agent (played by Matthew McConaughey, but written for Owen Wilson) is so absurdly dedicated to his job of getting his client a TIVO device that one would think that his life depended on it - then to throw us for a loop the scene towards the end is contrived where Stiller's character is actually saved by the TIVO.<br/><br/>The film is full of great cameo performances, such as Tom Cruise channeling Joe Pantoliano (I thought it actually was Pantoliano until the final moments of the film) playing an agent character somewhat similar to Jerry Stiller's character in ""Zoolander."" But it's really got a good heart in the primary group of characters played by Stiller, Robert Downey Jr, Jack Black, and Brandon Jackson. The fake trailers at the beginning of the movie were perfect -- they got the audience roaring with laughter and also introduced the basic differences between the 4 actors, or is that the character of the actors? Some of the lines are blurred here, as Downey's character in particular strikes us as a parody of his own actual career (in one hilarious scene we see him on a balcony with a bottle of tequila giving fans the middle finger). It definitely would not be the same movie with Downey Jr. and Stiller being so perfect for their roles and essentially spoofing their own careers.<br/><br/>McConaughey is the biggest surprise of the movie... I just have never found him amusing at all before in any of the chick flick comedies he makes. He was excellent here and really cut loose.<br/><br/>Just like with Zoolander's glamorization of bi-sexuality and tendency to mock even seemingly innocuous aspects of our culture, this is a film that will probably offend everyone. And that's fantastic. I can't stand how 99% of Hollywood comedies these days are basically ""safely offensive."" You can make any number of fart jokes and turd jokes, and people are happy to be offended by that. But this film is even more extreme than ""Zoolander"" as far as shaking up conservative culture -- the film mocks the acclaim that goes to actors who play ""retards"", for example, and the obscenely patronizing way that African Americans are often portrayed in film. Certain aspects of our culture just beg to be lampooned, but Stiller has a way of finding things like this that are hilarious but which make people far more uncomfortable. Most writers would not give themselves a character who murders a Panda Bear. It's not a conservative measure of ""irreverance"", it's more like Stiller's taking things into Monty Python territory. No one and nothing is safe.<br/><br/>My only slight or faint reservation about the movie is that for a film that mocks ""stunt casting"" so much, it sure indulges in quite a bit of it especially with Tom Cruise in all that makeup. And I even hear faint ""Oscar Buzz"" for Downey Jr. I don't think the Academy would touch this movie with a 100 foot pole, but it plays into the fact that the movie actually provides some interesting character acting in the context of a movie that seems to mock such pretensions. I'm still unsure if that's a brilliant aspect of the film or merely a casually inconsistent one."

Stiller, Jack Black are funny guys ??? ..who really don't act very well. Stiller has not learned to stop TRYING to act. Just be yourself Ben....you couldn't act your way out of a paper bag. Jack Black did not do a very good job either. He never appeared comfortable at any stage of the movie. Movie acting is easy (ask Al Pacino). The trick is ..don't try too hard. Downey Jr. and Cruise are ""just fine and dandy"", and looked like they had a ball making this. I have been hearing that Ben Stiller may stick to directing if his new movie ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is well received. He certainly is not a funny guy....so I hope Mitty does well.

","TROPIC THUNDER<br/><br/>I had seen this when it first came out and I was very disappointed with it. I remember it being not very funny, and all the funny bits were in the trailer. Now after a few years, I decided to watch it againÂ… I really liked it.<br/><br/>The movie is about a bunch of actors who are shooting a war movie called Tropic Thunder. The whole shoot is a disasterÂ… so the director decides to end them to Vietnam to shoot the movie in the real jungle. Everything sounds like it will make a good movie until they get attacked upon by a group of drug dealersÂ… but the actors think it's all part of the movie! It is a comedy, and there are some very funny moments in the film. I love the use of languageÂ… it is executed so well.<br/><br/>The actors do a great jobÂ… even the ones I don't like did really well. Tropic Thunder stars Ben Stiller (who also directed it), Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr. & Anthony Ruivivar. I quite like Ben Stiller. He has made some very good films, but in general he can be a little bit annoying. But he was very funny in this film. Jack Black is an actor that I am not very keen on. I think he is over the top and very annoying, but he has also made some good movies. I just don't really like his acting styleÂ… but again, in this he did a very good job and was not annoying at all. He was actually funny. I am a big Robert Downey Jr. fanÂ… I think he has made some amazing movies and plays all the roles with passion and really does a great jobÂ… especially in Natural Born Killers. Finally, Anthony RuivivarÂ… I don't think I have seen anything with him in before. He was very funny and really fit in well with the other actors.<br/><br/>There were a lot of other famous faces that had smaller roles, but really made their mark in the movie. Matthew McConaughey played Bens agentÂ… he was not in the movie a lot, but was still funny. Nick Nolte plays an ex Vietnam veteran, whose life story is what the film is aboutÂ… Nick has gone off of the rails, but he really is a good actor and it was good to see him in this. I hope to see him in more in the future. Steve Coogan plays the movies director. Steve is another actor that annoys me a little bit. I just don't find the man funny. He was not that bad in this. But the best character for me was definitely Les GrossmanÂ… played by Tom Cruise! The thing I love about Tom is he can play any kind of character. He doesn't normally play comedy roles, but when he does he is so funny. Especially his dance. His character in this was hilarious. He had some of the best lines in the movie and he delivered them perfectly. I was crying with laughter when he was on the screen. There were quite a few other famous faces that had cameos in the movieÂ… but if you have not seen it, it is more fun trying to spot them. Good luck.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie was brilliantÂ… at first I thought I pressed the wrong button on my DVD player. I pressed play and a load of movie trailers started playing. They are fake trailers for the movie, but they were really well made. It was a great way and a different way to start a movie. Very unique and entertaining.<br/><br/>The story is very good, the acting is very good and the comedy is outrageous in places but funny.<br/><br/>I will give this film 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>""I don't read the script, script reads me.""<br/><br/>For more reviews, please check out my Facebook page:<br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"

","From the moment I heard of Tropic Thunder I thought that this had the potential to be a film of real originality and zest. I was rather excited about the premise, a premise which if well executed could be a real satirical success.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder unfortunately does not hit the mark enough, or provide the kind of satirical or comedy impression that I was seeking. Tropic Thunder really revels in slapstick, over-the-top escapades and every so often gets it right.<br/><br/>Out of the named cast Jack Black is the least impressive. Black plays an uninspiring character that from the outset, that hideous film trailer does not bode well for Black, as he shouts his way through the film and grates rather too much to make his appearance enjoyable. Ben Stiller is the most impressive of the cast, and produces the most laughs that this film has to offer. Robert Downey Jnr is good, however it is sometimes hard to decipher what he is saying and rather surprising that he has been given an Academy nomination for his performance.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise cameo's as Les Grossman, the film magnate who only speaks in diatribes, is a character you will either love or find too offensive to enjoy, I think he just about gets away with it. If nothing else Les Grossman's dance moves at the end to Ludicrous 'Get Back' will put a wry smile on your face.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is over-the-top, and does push the boundaries with its crude and excessive language. Essentially, Tropic Thunder relishes its moment in the spotlight too the point where some may find it rather uncomfortable . It is not all that bad but it is not the comedy of laughs that I assumed it would be."

","This is a funny movie. If you enjoy some low brow humor then it is funnier. If you enjoy juvenile humor then you may fall out of your seat because it is so funny. Ben Stiller has done it again and done it well. Not only did he help write the movie but he directed it too. Then he added Jack Black who is on fire with a string of comedies. Then Stiller added Robert Downey Jr. put him in black face and in doing so almost secured a supporting actor nomination. Amazing.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is about a film crew in Asia filming a memoir about the Vietnam War. An accident happens and in a twist of comic fate the crew nor the actors realize they are being attacked by local drug dealers and not other actors in the film. The real actors band together attempt a rescue. <br/><br/>The film got into some degree of trouble when some groups came out against the movie claiming it unfairly was attacking challenged people. In the movie those type of people are called retards. So get ready to be shocked or disgusted depending on your level and limits of humor. The real jewel of the movie is Robert Downey Jr. Every second of him on film is comedy gold. The film is also a who's who from Hollywood. There is even some very funny moments from a scene with Tom Cruise. I doubt you will be able to name all the cameos. This is a funny movie and if you have any affinity for Ben Stiller then you'll love this film and want to own it. **/**** Â•<br/><br/>Â• As for the poster design they take their cues from what has come before them and try to make fun of it. I think the movie was a lot more creative than the campy poster and I would have liked to see the designer do more than just a Chuck Norris/ Schwartzenegger take off."

","Hysterical fun! I believe the intention of this movie is mainly to spoof Hollywood, and self centered actors, and not so much Vietnam War pictures. There was some great humor in and throughout this movie. The fake trailers at the beginning were particularly memorable, so be sure to watch all of the trailers on the DVD, as they are mixed in with the real trailers.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller as the straight man is great, especially to Jack Black's freaking out. Robert Downey Jr. was unbelievably funny and over the top, even just the premise of his character's character is funny in and of itself.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is a bit similar to the premise of Galaxy Quest where the actors end up fighting in a ""reality situation"", the traditional fish out of water scenario. But whereas Galaxy Quest meant to spoof the genre, Tropic Thunder is poking fun at the film industry and the vanity of many actors. It is a fun movie well worth the rental fee."
"Monotreme02","7","0","0","18 October 2008"," Above your average ridiculously stupid comedy
","A question of comparison almost as common as ""Pepsi or Coca Cola?"" that often arises asks to choose the favourite between Adam Sandler or Ben Stiller. Both have very different comedic styles that cater to different kinds of audiences: Sandler is more exaggerated and crude, while Stiller seems to be more sophisticated and gravitates more towards parody than grossing out, although in my opinion he is the less funny of the two. So while Zoolander was a very clever send-up of the male fashion world, it just wasn't that funny besides the uncanny number of celebrity cameos. Luckily for Stiller, in his most recent directorial effort, Tropic Thunder, which parodies every possible aspect and angle of Hollywood Â– actors, producers, directors, screenwriters, agents, genres, award shows, trailers, and everything in between Â– he brings along a crew of hilarious comic talents to help him deliver the laughs.<br/><br/>The film is, first and foremost, a rather clever parody of everything Hollywood, featuring washed-up action stars, prestigious Oscar-winning Australian method actors, overweight, drug-addicted comedic actors who appear in multiple roles in crude humour movies, rappers making the transition into film, actors who play mentally disabled characters for awards attention, crazed producers, British theatre directors making their film debuts, novelists who are exposed as frauds, crazed agents, and many more. The film-within-a-film, the Vietnam war epic Tropic Thunder, which appears prominently in the first few scenes of the film, is also a clever and more subtle prod at war epics, featuring over-the-top gore, exaggerated pyrotechnics and every clichÃ© in the book. These elements are no doubt the contribution of Justin Theroux to the screenplay. Theroux hasn't actually written any screenplays before, but as an actor he often plays these kind of slyly, subtly comic characters, and it seems to fit his style. Then again, the film also contains a scene in which a character wrestles with a panda bear, eventually kills it and wears its skin, so the movie's styles and levels of humour are evidently varied.<br/><br/>Most of the flat-out jokes in the film aren't quite as funny as they could be, but the film benefits from an exquisite collective of comic genius at its core. Stiller himself, although playing the main character, plays him as the straightest arrow in the group and in the least exaggerated manner, and thus puts himself really aside the comic limelight and lets his co-stars take centre stage. Each one has his shining moment, including Jay Baruchel and Nick Nolte, and Jack Black in particular has two or three scenes that he just lets loose and gives it his all. But there's no doubt about it that this is Robert Downey, Jr.'s show.<br/><br/>Downey, Jr. has, in the last couple of years of his comeback, shown superb acting virtuosity in both comedic (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, A Scanner Darkly) and dramatic (Fur, Zodiac) roles in small indie films, but 2008 will certainly go down in history as the defining year for him, the year where at long last the talented but troubled actor has hit A-list status and has become a bona-fide movie star, bringing in the crowd. Showcasing lighter fare in Iron Man and comic genius in Tropic Thunder, one can only wonder how he will fare dramatically in Joe Wright's The Soloist, out later this year. I have my fingers crossed for Downey, especially since he absolutely carried Tropic Thunder and delivered the funniest lead performance in a very bold feat of portraying a black man that worked off perfectly.<br/><br/>But with all due respect to Downey, Jr., even he is out-acted by the extended cameo role that totally steals the show. It took me quoting lines from Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia to my friends for them to realize that the actor portraying the hairy, bald, overweight film producer Les Grossman is none other than Tom Cruise. Off-screen persona aside, there's no denying Cruise's abilities in this movie. He is still one of the most talented, screen presence-commanding actors working today, and his show-stealing, profanity-laden performance in Tropic Thunder just further proves his ability at carrying a movie and stealing the show, even when he's only in it for a few scenes. Downey, Jr. carried the film, but Cruise was the highlight of the experience for me.<br/><br/>There's no tiptoeing around the fact that Tropic Thunder is a ridiculously stupid movie. But the fact that it's so over-the-top shows that, naturally, it doesn't take itself seriously. Combining clever lampooning of everything that signifies modern Hollywood with brilliant, all-cylinders-pumping comedic performances from the likes of Jack Black and Robert Downey, Jr., Tropic Thunder places itself above your average ridiculously stupid comedy."
"TheSeaLion","2","4","12","11 May 2017"," Good Idea Done Badly
","There are definitely better movies out there that I hate more than ""Tropic Thunder,"" and using the word hate is definitely too strong a word to describe my feelings, but I have to say it failed for me in almost every way.<br/><br/>I loved the idea behind the movie: a bunch of actors accidentally end up in a situation that mirrors their Vietnam War drama, but while the plot is funny the execution of it isn't. The story gets propelled forward by a number of coincidences that aren't comedic in any way, and would alert any of the main characters that something strange was going on. The only character who realizes there's something wrong is Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.), but he still ventures out into the jungle with the rest of the cast. There's also not enough humor fired at the parallels between the movie the actors are making and the movie the audience is watching.<br/><br/>There are some funny things in the movie, however. Robert Downey Jr. is terrific in his role and has some good back and forth with Brandon T. Jackson, and there's some genuinely funny stuff from every member of the cast, but most of the jokes were misses for me. There are a number of references to other Vietnam War films like Oliver Stone's ""Platoon,"" or the usage of the same songs all of these Vietnam War films have like ""For What It's Worth"" by Buffalo Springfield, but they're just references without anything comedic behind it. It's literally just the movie saying, ""Hey audience, do you recognize this?""<br/><br/>In short, ""Tropic Thunder"" is a lot of good ideas poorly executed. The cast is all funny at points, and Jack Black is the only one who is annoying, and the characters are all different, but the humor is not very funny and the poor story line shines above everything else."
"Quinoa1984","10","4","12","17 August 2008"," practically everything about this movie is uproarious; the satire/parody of the year!
","I read a review of Tropic Thunder that said it's satire, not parody, that there's a distinct difference and the film knows it. I'd agree that there is a difference, but I'd add that Stiller doesn't give a great big hoot about sticking to one or the other. Tropic Thunder does satirize its subjects: movie stars, movie moguls, ""dedictation"" to the craft of acting, the crap that churns out in Hollywood, and the Vietnam war. But there's parody running throughout the picture, if only in the first half of the picture and particularly in those incredible trailers that open the movie (all of them are fall-down laughing, and even give certain laughs for certain movie fans). It's one of the most deft mixes of parody and satire, where they sometimes run along with one another through the jungle and full of blood and guts and awesome one-liners. To give a higher compliment- it's some of the best since Mel Brooks.<br/><br/>It's simple to break down the premise, since it's right in the trailer: primadonna movie stars- one action, Tugg Speedman, aka 'Tuggernuts' (Stiller); one comedy, Jeff Portnoy (Black); one the ""acclaimed"" method actor Kirk Lazarus (Downey Jr)- are starring in a Vietnam war movie that is going haywire, and so the director (Coogan) gets tips from the military adviser/author of the book Tropic Thunder (Nolte) to send the stars out into the *real* jungle to film the movie. Then, of course, everything goes to hell, right even before they leave the drop point of where the helicopter drops them off (wont spoil it, but there's a great gag involving a severed head for a few minutes). Stiller goes close to overload as the movie goes on- mocking the brash studio executive (Tom Cruise- yes, Tom Cruise, and he's BALD!) and Speedman's puppy-dog agent (McConaughey), and the fact that the drug cartel who captures Speedman in the jungle are a HUGE fans of Stiller's ""retard"" movie, Simple Jack.<br/><br/>I might add, don't think because I put ""retard"" in quotes that it's offensive. Stiller's aim here is to completely annihilate ALL of the self-indulgent and self-righteous movies, so there are no prisoners taken in the course of Tropic Thunder. This scores it extra points, but above all else it's the fact that it's Ben Stiller as a ""retard"" (and at one point performing the entire movie at gun point to the cartel workers), Robert Downey Jr is a ""dude playing a dude disguised as another dude"", and Black as a, uh, heroin addicted star of stupid fart comedies (which, oddly enough, is to Black's credit that he pulls off a role I didn't think would work). It has that same overt and palpable ludicrous vibe of Zoolander, only even more focused on character and sharper at telling the story. For all the insanity and just continuous ""did he just SAY or DO that"" antics in Tropic Thunder, sometimes involving lots of violence or gobs of racism, Stiller doesn't forget to direct, and in fact it's maybe his best directing job yet. Pineapple Express might have gone to more extremes but, frankly, this is funnier.<br/><br/>How funny may depend on how much you can take of each characters' ""shtick"". Frankly, I couldn't get enough, and loved just the surprise cameos and bit parts (Tobey Maguire is one real notable) that revealed how in tune they were with the rest of the project. Only in recent memory is Walk Hard comparable in going so far to deliver joke after joke that just connects either due to great dialog (""I'm the rooster illusion""), great rapport between the actors, some of which are just the drug dealers at the prison camp like the kid Brandon Soo-Hoo, and a finite ability to tap into how shallow and amazing movies can get. Did I mention Tom Cruise is in it?"

","I didn't go into this movie with many expectations. In many ways it exceeded them and in many ways it fell flat. There is a lot of the usually stupid make funny faces, Ben Stiller kind of comedy, but there were moments of very clever and hilarious comedy. To stay on the positive side, there were great comedic performances by Danny McBride, and Bill Hader, these two did not disappoint and were very funny in every scene they had. Ben Stiller and Jack Black had their moments and Robert Downy Jr. was not too bad, he played the movie in blackface which would of been very racist accept it is brought up in the film and is portrayed as a bad thing and they were in no way promoting the idea. The best part of this movie was Tom Cruise, believe it or not, this was not his cheap small role in Austin Powers, he went all out for this one. Picture Tom Cruise 40 pounds heavier and bald and dancing to hip hop (the end was the best part) Overall I would great this movie a C++"

","Believing all the reviews about how funny this movie is, and how it's a parody of all previous war movies, I went to see it. Perhaps, because I'm not a Hollywood insider, I didn't find 'Tropic Thunder' to be all that funny. It appeared to me to be more stupid and moronic than hilarious. For me, it's likely to be the worst movie I've seen so far this year.<br/><br/>I thought Robert Downey, Jr. did a great job as a black infantryman and his performance was certainly the best in this movie. However, this aside, the movie is not worth the price of admission. On the other hand, I did see the opening of Woddy Allen's ""Vicki Christina Barcelona,"" without a doubt one of Allen's finest works."
"thebengalimafia-1","10","3","8","17 August 2008"," Great Movie!
","Tropic Thunder is one of those comedies where it helps if you have some prior knowledge of Hollywood as an industry (it's really just a big business after all) and war movies. SO if you've never seen Apocalypse Now, Heart of Darkness, Platoon, First Blood, or Rambo, you're unlikely to get the fact that this is the ultimate ""war movie"" movie (thank you Roger Ebert). War movies are just one side of the coin. On the other side of the coin we have the tall tale of the Hollywood machine; actors, directors, producers, agents, key grips, pyro guys, and endless re-writes. This is Tropic Thunder.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that I have been waiting for this movie since high school. I've always wanted to see someone make a movie about all the inner workings of Hollywood and turn it on its head. ""Tropic Thunder"" ends up being a light hearted tribute and scathing satire of the American film industry, its excesses, and its stereotypes.<br/><br/>And so the adventure starts by introducing the three type casts of cinema; the action guy, the funny man, and the prestigious award winner. The take on each and every one of these is dead on. Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) with the action one liners. Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) with the fart jokes and playing multiple characters in a film about an obese family a la Eddie Murphy. And finally, we get Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) as a multiple Academy Award winning Australian actor. The only things surpassing his critical acclaim are his ""bad boy"" antics. He inhabits every character he plays, and according to him, doesn't leave character until after they record the DVD commentary.<br/><br/>Like most action stars, Speedman takes a stab at more serious acting work in a film called ""Simple Jack."" Now we all know that playing the role of a person of lesser intellect is a one way ticket to an Academy Award, right? But like Lazarus explains, you never go ""full retard"" if you want that Oscar. Dustin Hoffman was autistic in ""Rain Man"" and Tom Hanks was a little slow in ""Forest Gump,"" but no one ever goes full retard and wins an Academy Award. Unfortunately for Tugg, he went full retard for his portrayal of Simple Jack, a retarded farm boy that can communicate with farm animals. In the end, it would be Jack that saves his life.<br/><br/>I don't want to go any further into detail with the stereotypes but let me say that this movie had it all. There was a great balance between taking pot shots at Hollywood and all the war movie-isms. The make believe Viet Cong, the poppy farms, an almost unbearable jungle to trek through, hostages, saving hostages, and my personal favorite, the scene where everyone is ordered to get to the ""bird"" but somehow one guy gets left behind. This is one comedy that was genuinely funny and really delivered. It's the best movie since The Dark Knight. Go see this one now!"
"tomrito","9","3","8","15 August 2008"," Tropic Thunder is funny
","I found this movie to be very funny. More than a few times I had to laugh out loud being unable to contain myself. I know there are people who feel offended by this movie and are calling for it to be banned and yada yada yada. But the last time I checked we still had freedom of speech, so if I find this movie, which is a comedy, funny, then in a free society, I should be able to enjoy it without all this political correctness being shoved down my throat by the comedy Gestapo. Ben Stiller has made a smart, entertaining film that showcases the comic prowess of a multitude of today's Hollywood stars. Robert Downey Jr. as an Australian actor playing a black character, Jack Black, as a comedian with a heroin addiction, Brandon T Jackson as a rapper turned actor, and Tom Cruise as the film's producer, are all insanely funny while lampooning the true nature of the people that make up the movie industry today. There are references to Hollywood scandals, and actors playing handicapped roles, there is very bad language throughout and Matthew McConaughey's dilemma of letting a client die for a G-5 aircraft. If these things are offensive to you, then please stay home, you know what this film is going to contain from all these reviews, let the rest of us have an enjoyable summer evening at the movies."

Plus, you can tell everyone enjoyed working together. Second;the action scenes. there flippin' great. normally a comedy would not have as many good or realistic scenes. so as an action comedy it really thrives. Third; stiller just made a good movie. the writing is quite good and is crammed with jokes that are quite witty (or in some cases the opposite) The bottom line is that this is quite an entertaining and funny movie that everyone is sure to enjoy."
"junkmail-385","8","3","8","13 August 2008"," Way Better than that OTHER summer flick!
","I have to say it. ""Tropic Thunder"" has so much more of a message for the real world than that big blockbuster film this summer (you know, the ""dark"" one). Fakery, self-righteousness, egotism, you name it--they all take a whooping in this film. The script is smart and consistent. It has a few surprises that come out of nowhere, hit you out of rhythm and, consequently, lend a sense of authenticity. The acting is good. Downey and Cruise are marvelous. A few times, though, I felt the acting+script were going to explode (figuratively speaking), but they quickly resumed a more normal height of inspiration. The level of criticism aimed at this film over retard (""never go full retard"") is unwarranted. IMHO the movie makes a valid point, in that people don't go to the movies to see complete incompetence--there has to be redemption or no one cares. In acting, just as in ""real life,"" it's possible to try too hard. And if you're not genuine, it's perfectly fair for people to call you on it--and then you move on. Over all, ""Tropic Thunder"" was great fun."
"jdesando","Null","3","8","13 August 2008"," A Summer Breeze
","Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey, Jr.): ""I know who I am! I'm the dude playing the dude disguised as another dude!"" <br/><br/>Finally this summer, a chance to belly laugh at the super-hero syndrome. Ben Stiller's Tropic Thunder satirizes just about every self-absorbed actor who has ever played a hero, including Robert Downey, Jr., this summer's Iron Man, playing a five Oscar winner dying his face to look like a black man and acting all the clichés. His comment above synthesizes this film's irreverent attitude toward an entire industry of phonies and narcissists.<br/><br/>While making the war picture to end all war pictures, a movie production is lost in the jungle, only to find themselves in real combat with narco-terrorists. The crew includes some over-the-hill heroes such as Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), a Sylvester Stallone knockoff, Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), a parody of his fat/farting self, and Lazarus. At home, Tom Cruise does an impressive take on a balding, bloated financier, who could be a type of Sumner Redstone, Cruise's nemesis in real life. Matthew McConaughey as Rick Peck, Speedman's faithful agent, also plays the laughs and satire just right.<br/><br/>The current flack over the film's treatment of mentally challenged people is not without merit""You never go full retard""but loses thrust when you consider most of the movie makes fun of most everybody. Criticism could be leveled at performances that garble words, such as Downey's when he tries to mimic stereotypical Black dialogue patterns. Too much of the film's dialogue is lost in the frenzy of blasting and blathering.<br/><br/>Last year's Wild Hogs came at the right time in the summer; Stiller's titillating Tropic Thunder is a summer breeze of laughs, base humor, and biting satire of an industry that can make money making fun of itself."
"ChiEfsFBpLaYa52","7","4","13","12 August 2008"," I had such high hopes for this film and it let me down
","As the title says, my aspirations for this comedy we're very high mainly because of the hilarious trailers and the mixture of three actors who have the potential to make a legitimate comedy. The facts are though that this movie did not nearly live up to the trailers that it sent out. The funniest movie for summer 2008 is pineapple express. I thought this movie would possibly live up to the same hype as well as the hype that it was letting off itself but it didn't. The acting was simply just OK not legit. The funniest man in this movie was Robert Downey Jr. but without him this movie would be an almost complete total waste of your time and money. Jack Black wasn't in very many scenes, and Ben Stiller could have done a much better job directing this film in general. I'm not saying the film was a total bust it did have some funny parts and some parts that we're hilarious like tom cruise...Black's line about ""gravy""....the beginning trailers and RDJ overall but in general I probably won't see it again. As I said this movie is a let down of my expectations."
"TOMNEL","8","3","9","30 August 2008"," Clever, original and funny, Tropic Thunder lives up to it's expectation.
","Many reviews of this film have called it a mean shot at Hollywood. That has been used in both a negative and positive light, but either way, I didn't feel that was very true at all. Sure there is some references to Hollywood and actors in general, as there should be in a movie about that. The only Hollywood aspect shown as a negative is the heartless producer, played by no longer surprise guest Tom Cruise. I felt I'd get this out of the way first, but whether or not you find the biting satire of Hollywood to be plentiful, I'm sure you'll find the laughs are.<br/><br/>A new huge budget movie, Tropic Thunder is currently being directed, by newcomer filmmaker Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) none the less. The actors in the movie include aging action star Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), method actor Kirk Lazerous (Robert Downey Jr.), comedic actor Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) and rapper Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson). After a series of expensive blunders, the movie producer Les Grossman (Tom Cruise) becomes very angry. The writer of the book that the movie is based on, Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte) decides how to solve the problems and suggests they shoot the movie guerrilla style, with hidden cameras in the trees. Take the boys to the action for authenticity. What we end up with is a small group of actors stuck in the jungles full of men who are ready and willing to torture and kill them.<br/><br/>The jokes in this movie come at fairly fast rates, though not so fast as to stoop to lame crotch hit gags or typical fart jokes. The acting is usually perfect to the characters. Robert Downey Jr. plays a ""black man"" and gives an over the top, but believable performance. If I shut my eyes and just listened, I could swear Brandon T. Jackson is Wanda Sykes with a sex change. Despite that he was a nice addition to the cast. Tom Cruise was a little too much at times, but he has a screen presence, so even when he was acting like a moron, it was fairly enjoyable. Jack Black was amusing in his drug addicted state and was normally funny, as was writer/director/actor Ben Stiller.<br/><br/>The direction worked very well. It was mostly tight cuts and fast paced, but many scenes spoofed other war movies, and they are filmed how the other movies are. Ben Stiller has these war movies down, too. From the direction, to the lighting, to the acting, he obviously has seen many of these types of movies.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a funny, enjoyable movie. It's violence doesn't make the tone any darker, either, which is good in this case.<br/><br/>My rating: *** out of ****. 107 mins. R for language, violence and drug content."
"DKosty123","7","3","9","29 August 2008"," Vietnam gets treated to a revisit by UFOs
","Ben Stillers effort at making a comedy about Vietnam is OK. It is a noble effort at moving comedy to a different dimension. Bringing Unidentified flying actors (UFA's) into the Vietnam War is kind of the basis of this film.<br/><br/>The film opens with apparent previews of other movies done by the luminaries of the cast. Then it kicks straight into the Tropic Thunder movie set in Vietnam. In typical Hollywood fashion, the set is over budget and out of control. The movie then veers in the same direction.<br/><br/>At 107 minutes, it is in the ideal length range of a comedy film. The difference is that there are moments where action dominates the comedy. There are moments where drama is attempted, With a cast like Jack Black, Nick Nolte & Robert Downey Jr along with Stiller, the film seems more comfortable doing funny stuff than drama.<br/><br/>Luckily Stiller realizes this and leans more towards the humor. This movie is OK but would be better if it stuck even more to humor. Jack Black only gets a few sequences."
"darkcrow007","8","3","9","14 August 2008"," Creative, Funny, and Raw
","SPOILERS AHEAD From the opening ""trailers"" to the end credits, very well done. The opening trailers are basically open shots at Hollywood and the satire is done to perfection. It basically takes the stupidity of Hollywood and puts it front and center. The one that resonates the most with me is Jack Black's characters' trailer for ""fattyz"" absolutely and without a doubt taking a direct shot at the Eddie Murphy franchises, which garnered the most laughs in the audience, second being ""Satans Alley"" with Robert Downey Jr's ""Kirk Lazarus"". What this movie had was what most movies sorely miss good actors playing good roles and good jokes. Robert Downey Jr. is obviously on another level of acting than every other actor in this movie, it shows, but with Stiller and Black doing their normal schtick it was all tied together in a nice little package. The utilization of the characters in this movie was so nice to see, if there was a line from a small role, it still had some punch to it and gave a laugh. Tom Cruise should seriously think about doing comedy after seeing him in this movie, i can hardly wait for him and Stiller in ""The Hardy Men"" to see how Stiller opens him up. Great movie, great laughs and i would recommend this movie to anyone. Some language is not for the easily insulted, but if you're easily insulted, you should be watching Golden Girls reruns. I would say this is Stillers best movie to date, hands down, my projection is this movie makes $70 million in its first week, at least."
"maian_magus","9","3","9","14 August 2008"," Excellent Comedy
","This movie really shone to me as well-done and amusing. I came in with somewhat low expectations, since it came out in a month with two other big comedies (Pineapple Express and Step Brothers- both of which are also amazing and hilarious), but left satisfied.<br/><br/>Jack Black especially stuck out to me as having done excellent in this film, very convincingly (read: amusingly) portraying a drug addict going through withdrawal. Ben Stiller was good too, but he didn't really seem to stick out as extraordinary. Robert Downey Jr. stole the show as I expected, with his character being a hilariously confused actor stuck in all the roles he had played.<br/><br/>All in all, the action and comedy in this movie (including the un-Tom-Cruise-like character Tom Cruise plays) makes it worth the trip to the theater. You won't be disappointed!"
"Ric-7","9","3","9","13 August 2008"," Surprisingly funny
","I had not read much about this film before seeing it, and basically was looking for a pleasant way to kill 2 hours. I'd seen Stiller films before, and Jack Black films before, and they were mildly funny (at best) but often seemed a bit self-indulgent.<br/><br/>This film is their best work to date. No doubt about it. The opening was a bit off-putting, with some really gross cartoonish violence. But by the time of the first ""Cut!"" a few minutes into the film, the laughter had started. The story is a bit scattershot, but there are some comic scenes in this film that rival anything I have seen in many many years.<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey was perfect in his role--extremely funny, and not trading on his image as a movie hunk--for example, he did not take off his shirt in this film, something that cannot often be said of him. There are two leading actors who are unrecognizable in this film, Robert Downey and Tom Cruise. Absolutely inspired.<br/><br/>The film is not perfect, but its imperfections are completely consistent with a film this outrageously funny. I absolutely loved it and I intend to see it again soon."

","Well I just got back from a sneak preview (benefits of managing a movie theater). I was not impressed.<br/><br/>It starts off vulgar and stays that way throughout. Vulgarity has its place in films but on this one it felt like it was going a tad overboard. I think my husband laughed out loud once or twice and he is very easily amused so that says a lot. <br/><br/>I was bored, my 20 year old son was bored and we both said ""I thought it was going to be better than that."" Ahhh another case of good trailer/not so good movie.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr was great. I loved seeing him play a black man. He did mumble a lot though and many times was just plain incoherent.<br/><br/>Jack Black is quite funny as a drug addicted fattie.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise could have been so much more awesome if he had disguised his voice but he didn't so it was just Tom Cruise in a fat suit. That fell flat. His dancing was kinda cute though.<br/><br/>The best thing about Ben Stiller was his arms. Even next to Robert Downey Jr who is probably the hottest guy in movies I was still admiring Stillers arms. Other than that it was just Ben Stiller in a movie. Same ol Same ol.<br/><br/>The best part was this kid that is like the leader of the Viet Cong. He is a total badA22 and a pretty good actor for a kid. I enjoyed him. He was actually kinda scary. lol<br/><br/>Conclusion: Not for kids. (I let my kids watch some R movies but not this one, just an extra warning for parents). There is a lot of cussing and a few homosexual references including a very detailed description of a bj. 20-30 something guys will love it. Your girlfriends may be bored. I wouldn't shell out over 5 dollars to see it. Wait for it on video."

When the movie tried to be funny it was so strained and very awkward, like it was constipated. The only thing that might have been funny, if seeing this movie in the theater, was the fake ads at the beginning. Otherwise, fart jokes, a druggie going through withdrawls running around in his underwear, a gay man in denial, Morten Downey Jr's character thrown in for controversy sake, I thought Downey would at least be funny, what a let down!

To me, one of his best lines in the movie was when he was mentioning other movies: Check it out. Dustin Hoffman, 'Rain Man,' look retarded, act retarded, not retarded. Counted toothpicks, cheated cards. Autistic, sho'. Not retarded. You know Tom Hanks, 'Forrest Gump.' Slow, yes. Retarded, maybe. Braces on his legs.

"peepzcallmerob","8","2","5","20 September 2008"," Tropic Thunder rumbles with laughter!
","http://entertainmentblur.wordpress.com <br/><br/>Back to back weekends of highly anticipated comedies, Tropic Thunder rumbles pass the hype and looks like it will be the last notable film of this summer (unless somehow the teen flicks Disaster Movie and The House Bunny are well-received which will then lead to flying pigs). Ben Stiller takes charge on the screen, and behind the camera, to this extremely funny satire of Hollywood actors and the people behind the movies. He plays Tugg Speedman, an action star that resembles Sylvester Stallone. In his attempt to prove he can actually act, Tugg starred in Simple Jack and played a mentally challenged young man who talks to animals. Of course, the film flopped and has since made his career a mockery.<br/><br/>Tugg teams up with Jeff Portnoy (Black) and Kirk Kirk Lazarus (Downey Jr.) in an epic war movie retelling the heroic tale of Four Leaf (Nick Nolte). They all have something to prove. Jeff, known for his film The Fatties that imitates Eddie Murphy in The Nutty Professor, wants to show the world he's more than just a man who makes fart jokes. Kirk Lazarus is an Australian actor who won five Oscars and is known for his commitment to method acting by falling deep into the film's character. He continues this with a controversial procedure to make his skin darker to play the role of Sgt. Lincoln Osiris who is an African American officer. Downey's character pokes fun at actors such as Daniel Day-Lewis who lose themselves in their role. His consistency in character annoys the other actors, especially African American, hip-hop turned actor Alpa Chino who finds his mannerisms insulting.<br/><br/>The plot is similar to 80's comedy Three Amigos in the sense that they're both about actors who are thrown in a real life situation but think they're acting throughout. And once they find out, they're already neck-deep in trouble there's nothing left to do but stick it out and act like true heroes. Of course, this shtick provides a lot of humor throughout, with most of the laughs coming from Robert Downey Jr. His performance is so knee-slapping funny that he completely outshines his funnymen co-stars Ben Stiller and Jack Black. The supporting cast and cameos are the icing on the cake of Tropic Thunder. With fake trailers in the beginning that serve as much enjoyment as the Grindhouse previews, and then add Tobey Maguire, Danny McBride, Bill Hader, Jay Baruchel, Matthew McConaughey, and the scene stealing Tom Cruise as a crazed studio executive, you have the funniest movie of 2008.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is daring at times as it pokes fun at the mentally challenged, terrorism, child soldiers, and color barriers. Some will find these jokes as tasteless or crude, but in the context of the film, the ignorant and spoiled actors are so numb to the world it's a portrayal of how they're simply full of themselves. It's not a cheap shot to insult the disabled, it's merely a showcase to laugh at actors.<br/><br/>I felt Ben Stiller did a great job all-around acting, directing, writing, and producing this film. In my opinion this is Stiller's best and funniest film in his career. It's bold, funny, and explosive with non-stop laughs at a neck-breaking pace."
"mp697","4","2","5","20 September 2008"," What is it really about?
","First of all, Tropic thunder does have some funny moments, mainly thanks to Robert Downey Jr., which makes an exceptional performance here. However, the movie is just plain ridiculous. First of all, it attacks many movies and actors in Hollywood. Which sometimes is justified and, quite frankly, funny, but when you're making a movie using Ben Stiller in an over the top comic performance, and, quite honestly, using a lot of easy jokes, you really should know better than to make fun of movies that do exactly the same... first, because it just looks arrogant and damages your film. When I was watching the beginning of the film I did found it funny that they made fun of the kind of ridiculous movies that just use the same ideas once and again, but as you go in to the movie, you start seeing that you're watching exactly the same kind of movie... And just have this desire to leave the room. Let me put like this: My date was sleeping halfway in it, four people left. And leaving a comedy that lasts less than two hours can't be a good sign... Then, the movie doesn't focus on being a comedy, it just goes all over the place. It's action, it's drama, it's funny, it's apocalypse now turns platoon, it's just too much. And sure, there are movies that are not only comedies but also dramas (""as good as it gets"", for example) but those movies focus on being a comedy and then evolve to other stages, they don't mix it all up, trying to be funny while trying to be serious. I actually wanted to see this film, and I wish I could recommend it. But my good taste just says different. It's a bad film. Bad jokes, no humor. Now, i'll be honest: If you're a hardcore fan of Ben Stiller, you'll probably still like this. But people who actually like good comedy, it's just no worth the ticket. Just rent on DVD, if you wanna take that risk."

","I always find movies and actors that are willing to lampoon themselves and their own business to be a breath of fresh air, and ""Tropic Thunder"" is nothing but Hollywood lampooning itself.<br/><br/>If you've found this comment, you likely already know what this movie is about, so there's no need for a summary from me. I'll just say that I thought it was very funny, and proof that Hollywood is capable of making a comedy that can be enjoyed by adults. The principal male cast gels wonderfully, even if Robert Downey Jr. completely steals the show as a dude dressed up as a dude playing another dude, with even the big name actors in cameos (I'm talking to you, Tom Cruise) doing their material justice.<br/><br/>If Hollywood is going to insist on making disposable formula films, at least it's a comfort to know that IT knows that it's making disposable formula films.

","The movie starts off very funny and then loses a bit of its overall story-steam. In fact, the most fun to be had is with the ""trailers"" of coming attractions that starts the show. These are short, humorous takes on the portentous trailers of portentous Hollywood movies. <br/><br/>As for the movie itself: Very funny scenes pop up throughout, yet things get boring because the whole thing is never really more than a parody -- there's nothing remotely real about the story or characters. Downey is absolutely fantastic; the other actors, competent, but never anything more than a foil for his abilities. Stiller gets old and annoying in many of his scenes, but hats off to him for attempting something above a Will Ferrell comedy. There is something really sublime in the way Downey's argument with the real black actor points out the posturing involved in all racial stereotyping -- including that done by the ""stereotypes"" themselves. <br/><br/>Best enjoyed as a DVD, or Tivo-ed, where the annoying POW scenes can be FF-ed through and the bits with Downey enjoyed."
"tnrcooper","5","2","5","24 August 2008"," Clever Hollywood parody but Downey's role was poorly thought out
","Ben Stiller's satire on the movie industry is a very entertaining, if somewhat troubling movie. I say somewhat troubling because I do find the famous decision to have Robert Downey Jr.'s character (typically excellent as high-minded Australian actor Kirk Lazarus) be made-up to appear black. This does not seem right to me. While the intent may have been to parody the pretentiousness of actors who believe there is no role which they cannot depict. Perhaps Stiller intended Downey Jr.'s part as mocking arrogant actors, but many viewers will see simply broad satire by a white man made up to look black and which might bring to mind the idea of minstrelsy. I do not think it was a good idea while I don't believe that Stiller really intended offense.<br/><br/>This major reservation aside, the film itself is quite a well-directed parody at many sacred cows of Hollywood, including self-important, rather strange agents (Matthew McConaughey having a great time playing against type), egomaniacal, profane studio moguls (Tom Cruise also enjoying mocking the power of which he is a prominent symbol), dopey movie franchises (don't miss the fake trailers at the beginning of the film, they are hilarious), drug use among stars (Jack Black's character, Jeff Portnoy is a serious drug addict and star of some very dopey films and whose habits lead to some very inventive, funny, scenes relating to his effort to beat the addictions), the extravagant demands of stars on shoots, stars sad efforts at serious movie roles, and many other Hollywood institutions ripe for satire. <br/><br/>There are quite a few pointed, self-mocking cameos which elicited some of the biggest laughs of the film. I found Cruise quite funny in his role but I am perhaps not as impressed at his turn parodying power because his role in ""Magnolia"", nearly 10 years ago, was not terribly different. That said, the parody of the many elements of Hollywood directed by Stiller is very well-done. Jack Black is funny as the aforementioned irredeemably drug-addicted action star. Downey Jr. is, as mentioned, typically excellent, in spite of the offensiveness of the material. Nick Nolte also enjoys his part as the soldier whose exploits the crew were attempting to bring to the screen before the movie production, to the ignorance of some of the cast, became a real battle."
"brettchatz-1","7","2","5","22 August 2008"," Great Fun
","Tropic Thunder sports a stellar cast in this summer's blockbuster spoof movie. Ben Stiller stars as a mega-action hero in what is supposed to be a jungle warfare film.<br/><br/>When the production studio threatens to pull the plug on a big budget action story, the director takes his film to a new level. The actors are suddenly thrust into a real-life story - fighting groups of merciless bandits and narcotics traffickers in Asia.<br/><br/>Led by a young boy, the rebels take the actors hostage - demanding $100 million for their release. But the actors soon step up to the challenge. A series of terrific pyrotechnics displays erupts, followed by a glamorous Hollywood ending.<br/><br/>For all its flaws, Tropic Thunder is a non-stop action adventure. Robert Downey Jr. is particularly convincing in his role as an African American fighter. Ben Stiller toned up and toughened up as he took on a Ramboesque role as the platoon's head honcho.<br/><br/>A great film; lots of fun"
"filmbuff101","8","2","5","20 August 2008"," Stiller's first complete film?
","I really do enjoy Stiller's sense of humour, but until now I really thought that he wasn't capable of making a complete film. Usually the humour dies out half way through, the plot becomes boring, and I just want the film to end - having not regretted seeing the first half.<br/><br/>While this new film doesn't achieve anything ""great"" (think Dr. Strangelove, Annie Hall etc.) it is, finally, a complete film that succeeds from beginning to end. The characters are portrayed very well, the direction was obviously open ended enough to get a lot of good work out of the actors... the plot, while not spectacular, provides a good vehicle for the humour from beginning to end.<br/><br/>As a satire the film succeeds better in some areas than in others... near the end there are some particularly difficult scenes that are reminiscent of Apocalypse Now and The Prisoner that actually succeed somewhat. It is in this area that I find that most modern comedies fail completely, but Stiller and Co. manage to pull it off - just enough.<br/><br/>If you like this film, I also recommend ""The Party"" as they are very similar in some ways (though The Party is more subtle) and I can't help but think that The Party was a bit of an inspiration for this film."
"bobertdos-1","6","2","5","17 August 2008"," The acclaim this film is getting is understandable, but I don't completely agree with it.
","Note: This may or may not be spoiler-ish, but I like to check the box just to be safe. Let's get the controversy out of the way first. I have worked with cognitively impaired individuals a lot in the past, and I will say that Tropic Thunder did go slightly overboard with that. The jokes were mostly unfair and rather condescending. It was made worse by the fact that the whole aspect was used as a plot device.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I just read another review here that raised a good point about Hollywood's precarious relationship with that demographic, and I can see how this movie maybe intended to make fun of that more than anything else. I just feel the role it played in the plot could have been just as easily (and probably more humorously), accomplished by some other means.<br/><br/>Now to the rest of the review. Given the cast and Stiller's level of involvement with the movie's performance AND production, this movie should have made me laugh more than it did. I'd still call it a lot of fun. Robert Downey Junior did a remarkable job, in my opinion. I suggest we leave it to the African Americans to judge whether or not that was an appropriate portrayal, people! Now, I may be alone here, but I also think little Brandon Soo Hoo's performance was a highlight. He convinced me he belonged with his cast-mates, and given the big names, that's an incredible feat for a kid that age!"

","It is hard to imagine anyone giving this movie anything more than a 4 or 5 since it falls on its face in the second act and pretty much runs out of steam.. except for the fact that it has a stellar crew of star actors that do a great job with this sad script. <br/><br/>Most of the best laughs of course are in the trailer..and there are some great performances esp from Tom Cruise but not enough to make one glance at their watch and wonder what on earth Ben Stiller was smoking but kudos for getting so many stars attached to it.<br/><br/>Wait for the DVD which surely will become a cult classic because of so many over the top small vignettes but you'll be happy to be able to fast forward thru most of it.<br/><br/>4 for effort and acting.."
"ferguson-6","7","2","5","16 August 2008"," You People ...
","Greetings again from the darkness. Viewed as a spoof on Big Hollywood, this is pretty darn funny! Of course, we live in the time of political correctness when Eddie Murphy and Tyler Perry and Wayan brothers can make fun of people all day, but let Ben Stiller try, and we are subjected to outrage and protests from multiple self-interest groups. By age seven, most of us can tell the difference between a funny movie or comedian and the President or a Senator saying or doing something tasteless. If you can remember that this is only a movie ... you will probably laugh out loud a few times! <br/><br/>Writer/Director/Actor Ben Stiller delivers his best work to date. The screenplay was co-written with the amazingly underrated Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen. Starring as actors in a movie that ends up being a movie about a movie that almost got made, we have Stiller, Robert Downey Jr, Jack Black, Brandon T Jackson (as Alpa Chino ... say it fast) and Jay Baruchel. These guys are all terrific and funny and are joined in support by Nick Nolte, Steve Coogan and Matthew McConaughey.<br/><br/>As good as the overall comedic performances are, I must point out the two standouts. Robert Downey Jr is truly amazing as the high profile actor who undergoes a medical procedure to turn himself from an Australian into an African-American. Always a talented actor, Downey reaches an entirely new level with this flawless performance ... effortlessly bounding between a take-off on Russell Crowe to his tribute to Jim Brown. Just great stuff and worth the price of admission. Also a surprising treat is offered up by Tom Cruise, who leaves nothing in his bag of tricks playing an eccentric, plump, foul-mouthed, soulless, big shot studio executive. He does everything from scream obscenities to lay down some very uncomfortable dance steps! A real hoot!!! <br/><br/>Sure, the story is a bit lame, but as in many outrageous comedies, the story is merely a backdrop for the jokes ... and there are MANY here. It will probably require a second viewing to pick up all the punchlines and visual effects, but don't miss the early ""trailers"", especially featuring Christine Taylor (Stiller's real life wife) and one of the most memorable ads that you'll wish you could forget ... complete with jingle by Brandon T Jackson."

The premise of Downey Jr. playing a black actor is funny enough. It was about the only bright spot in a rather boring film. Too bad they just didn't have a script that kept things rolling.<br/><br/>I have to say that this year is the re-birth of Downey Jr, and perhaps the end of Stiller's reign in the comedy genre.<br/><br/>Only die-hards of Stiller or Downey Jr films should see this. Barely a rental."

You have to see this movie now in the Theater before word gets out about the Tom Cruise character and being able to have a movie theater full of laughing fans makes it even better, it was so good I went to see it again and I laughed just as hard the 2nd time, and oh yeah make sure you see the previews for this one and enjoy your bust a nut bars!!! Good job Mr. Stiller for having the guts to make fun of all those who rule your industry."
"the_pooge","9","3","10","22 August 2008"," The Ultimate Satire of Hollywood
","At first glance, you would think this is just a screwball comedy with no substance. But in a rarity in his career, Ben Stiller has managed to create an extremely funny and satirical stab at Hollywood by combining vicious amounts of gore and lovely touches of black humour. A few down and out prima donna actors sign up for a war film to reignite their careers. But there is more to shooting this film then the actors realise.....<br/><br/>Stiller plays a down and out action hero named Tugg Speedman who has come out of a very unsuccessful film role playing a retarded farm boy, thus tarnishing his reputation. Jack Black is hilarious as an overweight, drug addicted comedy actor who's only seen as funny when he farts in his famous film franchise (I won't give further info, you have to see for yourself).<br/><br/>The stand out of the film is Robert Downey Jr who plays Kirk Lazarus, an Australian method actor who is so lost in his roles that he forgets who he actually is. I have never seen such a funny role in any comedy film I have seen. Supporting roles by Matthew McCoughney as Speedman's manager and Brandon T. Jackson as rapper/actor Alpa Chino also add fuel to the fire. A surprise inclusion in the film is an extended cameo by Tom Cruise, who plays an overweight Diet Coke loving studio executive. I have more respect for the man after seeing him in this film, and you will find out why if you have not seen it.<br/><br/>'Tropic Thunder' is surprisingly one of the funniest comedies I have ever had the pleasure of seeing, blending graphic violence with humour with the right measurements to give this film such a unique status. This film should definitely not be missed. 10/10"

I am sensitive to this issue, so at first I thought that I was the only one shocked and slightly offended. That is, until I listened to the silence in the audience.

"RainDogJr","10","3","11","26 August 2008"," Before the ThunderComes the Madness
","In my case the film summer started with ""Iron Man"" and just the following week with ""Speed Racer"". On 10 May 2008 I wrote my comment for ""Speed Racer"" and in it I wrote this to finish it: ""I think this film and ""Iron Man"" will be my favourites of this year's summer, just waiting to see what ""The Dark Knight"" and the new stuff of Jack Black (""Tropic Thunder"" and ""Kung Fu Panda"") will offer"". I really was waiting to see this movie, which release was going to be last Friday on my city yet and I don't know why it wasn't released. Today I went to a pre-release screening (the official release will be this Friday) together with my uncle, my cousin and a friend really hoping to see the funniest movie of the year. We laughed a lot, truly a lot; ""Tropic Thunder"" is the funniest movie of 2008, until now of course, so definitely will be one of my choices for the best movies of 2008.<br/><br/>Probably everyone knows what ""Tropic Thunder"" is about but if not let's write something about it: the memories of some Vietnam veterans were turned into books but only one was sold to Hollywood, the book Tropic Thunder written by the hero John ""Four Leaf"" Tayback (Nick Nolte). He is there on the set seeing as the hero he was and still is and everybody respect that but not when is time of business, not when he tries to say what to do to Hollywood producer Les Grossman and less when Grossman knows that his production is being a complete and really expensive mess. The director (Steve Coogan!!!) is British and for sure is new in Hollywood and is working in a set full of stars, even Oscar winners. Ben Stiller, Robert Downey Jr., Jack Black (C*ck), Brandon T. Jackson and Jay Baruchel play Tugg Speedman, Kirk Lazarus, Jeff Fats Portnoy, Alpa Chino and Kevin Sandusky, respectively. In their habitat these actors can't enter in their characters, they need something more they need a more realistic environment and Tayback knows where is that place.<br/><br/>Downey Jr. has the most unique part; basically everything that Downey Jr. did to portray Kirk Lazarus is what Kirk Lazarus is doing to portray Sgt. Lincoln Osiris. Jack Black's character is the one who miss more Hollywood but Ben Stiller's character is Hollywood. Speedman was a star but now he has been losing the respect in Hollywood, he portrayed a character that went beyond Forrest Gump or Raymond Babbitt, that film is now considered as one of the worst ever but he found a place where his work is appreciate, sure in that place that film is the only available but is a fact that in that place Speedman is still a star, now that place is his home, far away from Hollywood. But before Speedman found his new home he was the only one who still trusted in Hollywood, still trusted in a script and that eventually will take him to the drug dealers. He is the classic hero, convinced in making the film yet in Hollywood his own life is not an important issue. Here, for me, Tom Cruise steals the film as that mentioned Hollywood producer. Is hilarious because after all he is a businessman and business is all he has in mind so when drug dealers treat him to make a pay since they have Speedman our producer ends like a hero and not because he saved Speedman. You have to see Cruise, just memorable. The ones that saved Speedman were the ones who had many problems, insecurity with themselves. After all they are just a bunch of actors lost not only in Hollywood but also in the jungle still they knew quickly what was all about but these actors had that issues that in the jungle will be exposed. Basically one is gay and he almost come out of the closet, other is a drug addict so you imagine him sober with all the anxiety and stuff and the other is pretty much just confused. The only one who is not a star is the only one who knows the script and the only who can command a bunch of Hollywood stars. After all nobody was expecting to find some great persons in those stars and nobody was expecting the truth of a hero, a man who probably is the best actor, a man who had never left the United States, a man who's full time character's name is John ""Four Leaf"" Tayback. But also every problem can be fixed and look at them, specially at Les Grossman, he was being the producer of the most expensive war movie never made and he ended dancing of happiness with a bunch of Academy Awards! Cast: this is a really familiar cast, Stiller and Black leads the gang but is Downey Jr. who steals the show. Just yesterday I saw ""Knocked Up"" so I quickly recognized Jay Baruchel and Bill Hader but anyway and as I wrote before is Tom Cruise who steals the entire picture! Maybe his best role since Frank T.J. Mackey or since John Anderton but anyway it is his funniest appearance ever, just behind his cartoon from South Park of course.<br/><br/>Conclusion: this is a hilarious movie; you will remember Oliver Stone, Francis Ford Coppola and some others even Ruggero Deodato. This is a movie about an unfinished movie that ends not only as a unique experience but also as an Academy Award winner documentary. I loved it, simply, and I want it's DVD!!!"

","Ben Stiller is possibly even more obnoxious than his buddy Adam Sandler. Yes, it's hard to believe, I know.

And if you are not stupid enough to enjoy it, it is designed to make you a little more stupid so that next time around they serve you a film this bad you might find it enjoyable.<br/><br/>This attack on people's IQ's and the conditioning to vile kitsch that has been launched by Hollywood is so systematic that I am beginning to wonder if its deliberately planned.<br/><br/>I should perhaps address the film more directly, but what do you say about a film with no real plot, some pathetic attempts at humour, and a bizarre shift of tone designed to alienate anyone with half a brain.<br/><br/>This film simply should not exist.<br/><br/>Zero stars."

"Reef-Shark","9","2","6","16 December 2008"," Great fun; Best American Parody in Recent History
","This is a very funny movie that should tickle the funny-bone of fans of any war films, and any other comedy fans. Ben Stiller proves himself as being a better director than his previous attempt with Zoolander and Tropic Thunder is one of the best comedies of 2008.<br/><br/>We have a solid primary cast between Stiller, Black, and Downey Jr., but good old Robert Downey Jr. manages to steal most of the scenes from his co-stars as the white actor playing the black platoon sergeant (""I don't drop character until the DVD commentary"").<br/><br/>There are plenty of star cameos, but the best (and most unexpected) comes from Tom Cruise, who plays a foul-mouthed, fat corporate executive. His cameo was originally intended to be kept a secret, but it was impossible to keep this appearance from leaking to the internet. Let me tell you, this man may want to move into comedy considering his current negative status among the public. He was SOLID in this movie. I would have never expected Tom Cruise to pull a role like this, but he did and he actually was incredibly funny in most of his scenes. The audience at my theater applauded when the credits showed his name.<br/><br/>Other notable appearances are by Nick Nolte, as a Vietnam Veteran, and Matthew McConaughey as the Ben Stiller character's agent. Tobey Maguire also makes a humorous appearance at the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>Overall I was tickled, and surprised by this very well-balanced cast of notable actors. Every actor in here gets off some good jokes, and in different styles of comedy. This film had lots of different types of jokes, ranging from parody, satire, drug addiction, slapstick, and just plain silly antics. This film had everyone in my audience laughing at one point or the other, through its many references.<br/><br/>I felt this redeemed a long string of horrifically bad American made parodies. I never liked the work of Matt Stone and Parker with their shows such as 'South Park', and don't even get me started on this 'Disaster Movie' nonsense. Only notable films I could spot were made by the Brits, with such brilliance as Shaun of the Dead, and Hot Fuzz. Tropic Thunder isn't as good as those two films, mind you, but it certainly beats out all recent American made parodies. I never felt offended, or attacked by this film. It set out to entertain, and it entertained me from start to finish.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is great fun!"

","Three spoiled Hollywood actors, one is a action star Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), the second is a comedian Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) and the third is a five-time Oscar-Winning over-talented actor Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey, Jr.). These three actors are making an Vietnam film, based on a true story. Which it is written by a Vietnam veteran Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Notle). But the director (Steve Coogan) has problems with these over-demanding actors that the film's producer (Tom Cruise) wants these problems solved as soon as possible. Since it's already over-budgeted, just shooting for four days! The novelist tells the director, he wants to sent these actors in the jungle with the real enemies close by. Along with the novelist, the director, prop man (Danny Mc Bride), the three lead actors and the two supporting players (Brandon T. Jackson & Jay Bunichel) to be sent in the darkest heart of the jungle of Vietnam. But they find themselves way over their heads too soon and having trouble with the notorious Vietnamese drug-lord (Brandon Soo Hoo).<br/><br/>Directed by Ben Stiller (The Cable Guy, Reality Bites, Zoolander) made an very enjoyable satire about the way of film-making in Hollywood by making Big Budget movies seem always overblown in the process. Director Stiller also makes this fun for the audiences by adding action and some truly funny memorable moments. For me, this is the most enjoyable Stiller performance since ""There's Something about Mary"". But Stiller does have an great cast surrounding him. Downey, Jr. and Cruise have all the best comedic moments. Matthew McConaughey appears in a supporting role as Tugg's dedicated agent/friend. <br/><br/>The original theatrical cut DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an hilarious commentary by Stiller, Black and Downey Jr. (Still in his character from the movie). DVD also has featurettes with interviews with the cast & crew.

"Robert_duder","8","2","6","1 September 2008"," Silly, stupid and yet fits together for a hilarious ride of a bunch of guys having fun and making fun of themselves and their craft
","Why does Tropic Thunder work? Well I think first and foremost it just happens to be blind luck that the chemistry between the actors seems amazing and the wealth of cameos that all seem to just let loose and have a wild and hilarious time certainly helps. The comedy is raunchy, four letter words are everywhere, and the silly slapstick moments are mostly satirical in nature and completely poking fun at movies, their own characters and themselves in a sense and it happens to work out with a very stupid story. In fact the entire story, co-penned by Stiller is very weak. I mean it exists only to vehicle all these crazy characters and moments. It was like the star studded cast got together first, created characters and then built a story around them. It's only fortunate that the cast drives the film and makes it very watchable. I don't like Stiller usually but he is a talented comedian and writer and everything just fits into place. This movie probably has more explosions and gunfire than most summer action blockbusters and yet it was all done in farce.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller co-stars as action super star Tugg Speedman who is on the down side of his career. Stiller fits in well and I even think he toned down his over the top comedic performance in order to let the other actors stand out. He is good as Speedman and funny in a more subtle way than his usual characters. Robert Downey Jr. proves his comedic talent as the serious award winning actor Kirk Lazarus who actually changes his skin color to become African American for the war film. Some reviewers are calling his performance racist but they are of course missing the entire point of satire. I won't get into that right now but Downey Jr. gives an awesome performance as the actor trying to be as black as he can be much to the chagrin of his real African American co-star. Brandon T. Jackson plays that co-star, rapper turned actor Alpa Chino...get it? Jackson is terrific and really balances out Downey Jr.'s potentially offensive performance by being a strong black character who always gives him the intelligent answer. Their banter together is classic and proof of how intelligent a satire this actually is. Jack Black plays drug addicted comedian playing serious Jeff Portnoy. His entire performance focuses on completely poking fun at himself and the comedy world in general in Hollywood. His role is dumb, and ridiculous, and insulting to himself and therefore works perfectly in the cast. He is awesome in the role. Jay Baruchel is good as the straight man to the other three's performances. He kind of gets buried in the crazy performances because his is much more subtle. So this is your main cast, now let's talk about the heart and soul of this picture...the cameos which are all fair sized for cameo roles. Matthew McConaughey is terrific as a stunned a little bit sleazy agent to Stiller's character. McConaughey always lights up the big screen and his cameo is no exception. Nick Nolte does a decent job as Four Leaf Tayback, the veteran whose life the film they are making is based on. Nolte kind of flounders in the film and doesn't really find his place amongst the cast and he doesn't really fit into the satire aspect. Tyra Banks, Jon Voight, Jennifer Love Hewitt, Jason Bateman, Lance Bass, Alicia Silverstone, Mickey Rooney, Kathy Hilton, Tobey Maguire (very funny mock trailer with him and Downey Jr. as gay Priests), and finally we come to the true highlight of Tropic Thunder...Mr. Tom Cruise. I really do love Tom Cruise as an actor. He is powerful and very talented and he proved it hilariously as loud and foul mouth film executive Les Grossman. When he turns on ""Low"" and starts gyrating with his bald head and slightly portly belly and loads of body hair I was completely awe struck and laughing hysterically. He was awesome. I would watch this film again just for his role. Also worthy of a mention is newcomer youngster Brandon Soo Hoo who plays the leader of the enemy drug dealers...yes this little boy plays a very ominous and disturbing killer and leader. He is truly awesome and likely has a long career ahead of him. Stiller would be a fool not to cast him again in future films.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is getting a lot of flack of course, the same flack many films got this summer for inappropriate content in our post 911 world where feelings get hurt when a toe is stubbed. Yes Tropic Thunder is inappropriate...just as much as National Lampoons was back when they were good, or Naked Gun movies, or Airplane, or any other satirical comedies only Tropic Thunder tried to pretend to be serious and not make outright statements. The politically correct crowd wouldn't see this movie anyways and for anyone with a brain if you look hard enough you will find the satire in the film. Yes unfortunately the word ""retard"" is tossed around a lot because Stiller offensively portrayed a Handicapped character in a movie that bombed within this movie but when you look at it from a satirical perspective Stiller's character isn't exactly a genius. Most of the main characters in the film are kind asses...so them using that word or Downey Jr.'s character becoming black and then playing it stereotypically is supposed to make you go...wow those guys are ignorant and kind of stupid. Don't get your undies in a bunch until you think about the movie a little...no matter how stupid it is. That being said Tropic Thunder actually turns out to be secretly smarter than it looks and is a good time, with a great cast, all made worthwhile by an incredible performance by Tom Cruise.

","Tropic Thunder is an interesting experience to say the least, because we get to see all of these different ""chops"" of actors who have an acting skill set playing roles that are not usually shown, but are on display in this movie. Ultimately we see an experiment that is somewhat hit or miss at times, but more often than not it is a hit. Though the movie's story, jokes, and what not are fairly decent, what makes this movie shine are the actors turning in these performances that are just so out what they would typically play.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. for beginners, who starred earlier this year as Iron Man and is having an incredible comeback into the film business, now puts his sites into playing an Australian character actor Kirk Lazarus, who goes so into character he turns himself into an African-American. The best way to gauge if you'll find this funny or not is to just watch the trailer, if anything gave you the slightest smile, then his performance throughout the rest of the movie will no doubt sell you on him as a great comedic actor. As far as those who are actually naive enough to believe this is a racist gesture? Swallow your pride and pull your head out if your back door; though also you people who feel this way, shouldn't even be watching the movie in the first place.<br/><br/>As for the other two great performances in this movie they come from Mattew McConaughey playing out of his typical chick-flick character as Ben Stiller's agent, who has few laughs throughout the film. Perhaps though the best surprise in the movie is Tom Cruise, who is covered in prosthetics to become the hairy business mogul that is financing the movie. This character is so vulgar, and disgusting it's enjoyable. If anyone else played this character it wouldn't have been the same, but the fact that it is Tom Cruise, Maverick from Top Gun, playing him just makes it so precious. Jay Baruchel (from Knocked-Up), Brandon Jackson, and Steve Coogan (Hamlet 2), not memorable, but still solid supporting performances to round out the celebrity filled cast. Oh yeah, and Nick Nolte is in it, and is decent too (just thought I would throw that in there). Then you get characters like Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Danny McBride, who play the typical characters that they play in every other movie, which really doesn't make them all that memorable. On another note Danny McBride, who was not too long ago in Pineapple Express, I personally deplore this guy, he's not funny and is stupid, much like Dane Cook... and like Dane Cook, will probably end up with an undeserved career.<br/><br/>Perhaps though the weakest point of the movie all together, aside from McBride, is just the concept of the movie. It doesn't know what kind of movie it is. It's not silly and funny enough to be an excellent comedy movie; and while the action and special effects for the most part are excellent, the action is just too silly (which I know it is trying to do), to be a good war/action movie. Which can fall flat at times because it just feels like a half-hearted attempt at being a good comedy movie, and a good action movie, but not an exceptional of either. Though, it is obvious what kind of attention they were trying to accomplish.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller, definitely has some ability behind a camera and for writing a script. Even though he did make Zoolander, and the underrated Cable Guy, neither of those were as good as this movie. For the most part the movie looked polished, the script flowed well, and the characters were fantastic. I would love to see him turn more movies out, and possibly try his hand at a dramatic movie.<br/><br/>Pros: Downey Jr., McConaughey, Cruise, all deliver stand-out performances, and are well written characters. Tons, of little celebrity cameos make it worth watching just to recognize throughout the movie. Has good polished Hollywood charm to it that you can't quite put your finger on. Also kind cool to see what Ben Stiller is really made of behind a camera. Faux movie trailers at the beginning were funny also.<br/><br/>Cons: Stiller and Black turn out regular performances that aren't bad, but aren't anything new either. Danny McBride is a talentless bore. Isn't a really good comedy movie, isn't a really good action/war movie either.<br/><br/>Overall: Definitely worth the theatre, just so you can nudge your friend during the movie and point out a certain celebrity cameo, and also the explosions and action should warrant some big screen attention. Better than Step-Brothers and Pineapple Express."

","""Reality Bites"" director Ben Stiller has not only made a rambunctious R-rated parody of Vietnam war movies with his audacious, big dumb action comedy ""Tropic Thunder,"" but he also has ridicules Hollywood's obsession with such fare. Take all the ""Rambo"" sagas with Sylvester Stallone and then toss in George Hickenlooper's superlative documentary ""Heart of Darkness"" (1991) about the complications that Francis Ford Coppola faced on his magnum opus ""Apocalypse Now,"" and you'll have a good idea of what to expect from ""Tropic Thunder."" Although Stiller and his top-notch cast play everything for belly laughs, ""Tropic Thunder"" contains moments when it could pass for a genuine, straight-laced adventure outing. ""Iron Man"" sensation Robert Downey, Jr., overshadows everybody as five-time Oscar winning Australian actor Kurt Lazarus who has dyed his skin black to play an jive-talking, George Jefferson-type, African-American U.S. Army Sergeant. Superstar Tom Cruise makes quite an impression as a sleazy, gutter-mouthed Tinseltown producer whose favorite word starts with the sixth letter of the alphabet. Matthew McConaughey, Jack Black, Nick Nolte, Tobey Maguire, Mickey Rooney, and young Asian actor Brandon Soo Hoo in a bravura performance as the vilest little villain ever flesh out the cast of this imaginative, memorable, and sometimes controversial insanity.<br/><br/>Stiller opens ""Tropic Thunder"" with hilarious trailers for fake movies that headline his stars. Stiller plays action hero Tugg Speedman in a series of ""Scorcher"" movies that ridicule franchises like Bruce Willis' ""Die Hard,"" except that Tugg has run his course as a hero. Robert Downey, Jr., appears alongside ""Spider-Man"" star Tobey Maguire as a pair of promiscuous priests at a remote monastery. Jack Black mimics Eddie Murphy's ""The Nutty Professor"" movies with his own bowel-humored comedies about an obese family called ""The Fatties."" Black plays each family member in a fat suit and delights in breaking wind at the least provocation. If these faux trailers don't offend you and you find yourself laughing until your sides split, what follows is even funnier. <br/><br/>Essentially, ""Tropic Thunder"" unfolds as a movie-within-a-movie about Hollywood movie makers. Freshman director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan of ""Night at the Museum"") plays a witless helmer who gets dressed down by action movie mogul Len Grossman (Tom Cruise of ""Top Gun"") for not having his cameras rolling on a million dollar fireball explosion like the one that ignited ""Apocalypse Now."" Damien wants desperately to redeem himself in Grossman's eyes, and burned-out Vietnam veteran Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte of ""48 Hrs"") concocts a scheme that will help Damien win back Grossman's support. Ostensibly, Four-Leaf's memoirs inspired Damien's Vietnam extravaganza, and Four Leaf suggests that Damien take his cast into the jungle, rig up surveillance cameras to film them and then turn the guys loose. Not only will Damien be able to shoot the movie guerrilla-style for the least amount of money possible, but he also will get realistic performances from his pampered, soft-living cast. <br/><br/>Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller of ""Meet the Fockers"") likes the idea because he hopes that Damien's Vietnam epic will boost his career out of the doldrums. Earlier, Speedman had starred in a ""Forrest Gump"" style movie called ""Simple Jack"" where he impersonated a mentally challenged, buck-toothed hayseed who claimed that he could converse with the livestock. ""Simple Jack"" crashed and burned at the box office, and Damien's movie represents a reprieve for Speedman's career. No sooner have these nitwits hit the jungle than everything goes haywire. What our heroes have no clue about is that the part of Southeast Asia where they have chosen to film is the bailiwick of ruthless Asian drug producers. A cigar-chomping, 12-old year tyrant, Tran (first-time actor Brandon Soo Hoo), and his heavily armed henchmen operate a secret factory where they manufacture massive quantities of heroin. When Tran's goons spot Tugg and his fellow thespians on cinematic maneuvers, they mistake the stars for the D.E.A. They capture Four Leaf and later Tugg and imprison them, while Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey, Jr. of ""Iron Man""), heroin-addicted Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black of ""King Kong"") and hip-hop wannabe Alpha Chino (Brandon T. Jackson of ""Roll Bounce"") decide to imitate Rambo and spring their comrades.<br/><br/>""Tropic Thunder"" qualifies as a goofy, gung-ho action comedy until our heroes encounter the villains and their heroin factory. Indeed, Tran and his trigger-happy thugs take themselves seriously. They prefer to shoot first and ask questions afterward. Nevertheless, it seems that these Asians loved Tugg Speedman's portrayal of retarded farmhand Simple Jack, and they coerce him at gun point to perform a one-man version of the movie while our dim-witted heroes plan an attack. Stiller and scenarists Justin ""Strangers with Candy"" Theroux and Etan ""King of the Hill"" Cohen spare nobody and nothing in their outlandish depiction of Hollywood gone wild. Robert Downey, Jr., and Tom Cruise steal ""Tropic Thunder"" with their whacked-out characters, and Cruise skewers his ""Risky Business"" origins with a goofy dance as the end credits roll. Be prepared either for the worst or the best of everythingdepending on either your tastefulness or tastelessness with ""Tropic Thunder."""

","It's actors making fun of actors. There is nothing offensive in this film. It is a laugh riot. Ben Stiller deserves a nomination for directing. Robert Downey Jr (the greatest actor alive today - with the exception possibly of Kenneth Brannaugh) deserves a nomination for best actor.<br/><br/>I laughed so hard at this movie that my face hurt for the next hour after I left the theater. When the director bites the dust, I laughed for 10 minutes straight. In fact, I don't think I will ever think of corn syrup the same way again.<br/><br/>The movie is genius. America needs a sense of humor, and this film is the injection the doctor has prescribed. God bless Ben Stiller and may Robert Downey continue in his recovery!!"
"Vic_max","Null","2","6","26 August 2008"," Wow - Funny and Interesting!
","Comedy is pretty subjective and I generally wait for comedy movies to come to DVD or TV before viewing them. However, the high critical ratings caused me to go see this one in the theaters. It was pretty darn impressive. There are several levels of humor going on and to boot, the story is actually interesting all by itself.<br/><br/>The basics: The movie is about a group of actors who get stranded in a Vietnamese jungle while making a war movie. They find they have to fend for themselves and look for a way out. It sounds simple enough - but there's danger, a crazy studio boss, kidnapping, Tivo and more to contend with.<br/><br/>Performance-wise, Robert Downey Jr. is brilliant. As is said in the movie, he's ""a dude, playing a dude, disguised as another dude."" He gets a little too deep into his role as an African-American soldier ... and he's just amazing to watch. It's hard to imagine that he's NOT actually who he's portraying. Jack Black and Tom Cruise are also fun to watch.<br/><br/>The story is engaging and there lots of types of humor (situational, comic pop references and a variety of funny exchanges) - so this movie is pretty good bet as far as entertainment. All in all, you're bound to find something to enjoy."
"actionartist","6","2","6","18 August 2008"," Better laughs can be found elsewhere.
","Tropic Thunder is not a film you need go out of your way to watch. While undoubtedly humorous at first, the movie becomes rather lame halfway in, leaving the viewer hoping for some sort of comedic uplift or exciting plot-turn that never really comes.<br/><br/>The person watching Tropic Thunder will find themselves laughing occasionally throughout, yet progressively feeling more and more disappointed in what little it has to offer. It's the sort of film that begins as something promising, but ends as something indifferent.<br/><br/>Time will show that this comedy, while somewhat original, is nothing more than mediocre."
"PaulEBManc","10","2","6","18 August 2008"," Comedy Of The Year
","Tropic Thunder is a film-within-a-film, a spoof-within-a-satire. I am afraid that I cannot comment on the 'political correctness' of the film as I was too busy almost wetting myself with laughter throughout.<br/><br/>On the note of the supposed offensive nature of the movie, I feel as though people who were offended by the movie probably didn't watch the entirety of its running time (just as with the Catholic Church and Monty Python's Life of Brian back in the 70s). Two of the reasons that these so-called 'moral crusaders' say Tropic Thunder is offensive is due to Robert Downey Jr. playing a black soldier and Ben Stiller playing a severely mentally handicapped person in his woeful attempt at drama, 'Simple Jack'.<br/><br/>Firstly, these two roles are not devised to make fun of black people or handicapped people, they are used to poke fun at over-the-top method actors (in the case of Downey Jr's character, Kirk Lazarus) and at lame attempts at playing roles for Oscars (in Ben Stiller's case, he is poking fun at people such as Sean Penn for making movies like 'I Am Sam'). And, even despite this wealth of satire that runs throughout the film, I have to stress that, after all is said and done, Tropic Thunder is simply a very funny movie.<br/><br/>Reason for this is the number of small parts and cameos that the actors involved make the most of. That is not taking anything away from Ben Stiller and Jack Black, who both produce very funny turns as the action guy searching for something more and the comic with a dark secret, but the smaller parts, such as Matthew McConaughey and Nick Noltes', are very funny turns (yes, that's right, Matthew McConaughey made me laugh! Wonders never cease).<br/><br/>And, finally, special mention has to go to Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise. Cruise's role as Les Grossman, the company executive with a mean streak, foul mouth and penchant for all things gangsta, is an absolute joy to watch. It was a very shrewd move on Cruise's part to take the role, and his part in the end credits is probably the funniest end credits I've seen on a film since Toy Story's fake outtakes.<br/><br/>But as with every single review of this film that I've read, Robert Downey Jr. absolutely steals the film as Australian 5-time Oscar winner Kirk Lazarus (Russell Crowe, come on down) and Sergeant Osiris. His is one of the finest comic performances I think I've ever seen, right up there with Peter Sellers' multiple roles in Dr. Strangelove and the guys from Spinal Tap. The Academy Award doesn't give out Oscars for comedy, because they have some misguided notion that somehow drama has more right to a place in the canon of art than comedy, but if they did, Downey Jr. should get one. The man is a revelation and one of the most chameleon-like actors working today, due to his uncanny ability to try his hand at so many different genres of film and types of role.<br/><br/>A top-class comedy that I urge anyone and everyone to see. Ten out of Ten."

","Where do I begin on this movie? From the second it opened, I just had a feeling that the $9.50 that I sort of reluctantly spent on the movie was going to FINALLY be put to good use. Right from the get go we are thrust into the comedic side of the movie (which is probably 98% of the movie) and it just never really dulls down from there. A good mix of action and comedy, Tropic Thunder finally delivers a movie which all people can enjoy. We don't have the typical comedy movie that has a lot of funny stuff and then a lot of dull moments nor do we have an action movie that has action at random times and a lot of serious stuff in between. No. We finally get a good mix. We get the action premises, with like said random action and then downtime, but the downtime is all comedy!! How could you not be entertained? Honestly, Robert Downey Jr. STOLE THE ENTIRE MOVIE for me. Every scene he was in he was absolutely hilarious and I enjoyed every second he was on screen. And Tom Cruise, despite all the crazy stuff he has done outside of acting, gave an awesomely hilarious performance as the crazy boss of the film industry. Not a typical Cruise role, but him stepping outside of those roles went to good use in this movie. Jack Black and Ben Stiller gave very solid performances as well, but Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise made the movie that much more enjoyable to watch. Seriously, one of the best movies I have seen in a long while."
"jdkraus","8","2","6","17 August 2008"," Great characters make a great comedy...
","I had no idea what to expect from this movie. Was it going to be horrible? Hysterically good? Or just lukewarm? For starters, I'll say ""Tropic Thunder"" is not a movie for everyone. It contains a substantial amount of swearing, some unpleasant gory images (used for comic effect like Monty Python), and even contains some material that people may find indirectly offensive, but I like it.<br/><br/>The reason why I like this movie is because of the characters. Stiller, Black, and Downey Jr. lead an ensemble cast of Hollywood big shots trying to make a Vietnam War picture. Nothing seems to go right, so the director, with the advice of a Vietnam veteran (Nick Nolte) decides to take the actors out into the middle of the jungle so they can face the ""real deal"". However, things get out of hand, and what the actors thought of as a movie really isn't.<br/><br/>As you can see, the story isn't that special, but each character is unique and funny in their own ways. Ben Stiller is the action hero, a complete spoof off of Sylvester Stallone, Arnold, and even Willem Dafoe (from Platoon). Jack Black is the comedian, a satire off of cheap comedies that Eddie Murphy would star in. And Downey Jr., is the award winner, a spoof of all the great actors ranging from Russell Crowe to Marlon Brando.<br/><br/>In addition to these guys, there are many excellent cameos, including: Tobey Maguire, Jon Voight, Matthew McConaughey, and Tom Cruise (strangely dressed up as an obese, bald, Hollywood producer). Every actor in this movie is great and funny. They turn an okay plot into something worthwhile. In addition, there's also a lot of action and nonstop satires against other movies and Hollywood itself.<br/><br/>The one thing I have to note, is that people have criticized these movie because of the multiple uses of the word ""retard"". It is used, but not as an insult to the mentally handicapped, but aimed at one of the characters.<br/><br/>I enjoyed every moment of this film, from the opening trailer satires to the closing credits. 8/10"
"griffolyon12","6","2","6","17 August 2008"," Crossed the line a few too many times.
","Tropic Thunder is a movie that is at times very funny, but at other times was blatantly offensive. For nearly the first half hour of this film I was hysterically laughing my head off, thinking that it was well on its way to being the comedy of the year, but then began the offensive jokes about people with mental handicaps. I completely felt that these jokes were totally out of line, and just showed poor taste on the filmmakers behalf. You can say that it was all in good fun, but they took it way too far and never tried to redeem what they said. Yes, they made fun of many things in this film, most notably other Vietnam war movies like Platoon and Apocalypse Now, and I loved how they made fun of the Hollywood studio system; and if the film had stuck to those type of jokes, I wouldn't have had a problem with it, and would've thought it was the funniest movie of the year, but instead it traipsed into territory that while may be funny to some, is blatantly offensive for others. Now everyone has their own opinion on this particular issue, so if this issue doesn't bother you you'll love this movie, but if you are offended by this sort of thing you should skip it.<br/><br/>Overall Tropic Thunder is a movie with plenty of laughs to be had, but the offensive jokes took me out of the viewing experience and I just never really came back to it after that point. This simple fact lost Tropic Thunder a good number of points in my book.<br/><br/>I give Tropic Thunder a 6 out of 10!"
"treeskier802","6","2","6","16 August 2008"," Unique Comedy With Funny Moments
","Tropic Thunder is not your typical comedy. From the previews you may venture it is merely a spoof on war films, but really it laughs at Hollywood itself. The jokes are obviously from Stiller, with his style firmly attached to the script. And, for a comedy, there were some beautiful filming locations; the filmography was top-notch.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr.'s performance is simply amazing, feeding off two different cultural stereotypes (african American and Australian). The true scene stealer, however, was Tom Cruise in his disturbing portrayal of movie executive Les Grossman. Stiller also was very good and Black and Nolte had their moments.<br/><br/>As with many comedies, this one had its funny moments. Perhaps it could have hit the belly harder with laughs, but it was okay. While I enjoy Matthew McCaunaughey, his performance was not noteworthy, and the film sorely missed Owen Wilson in that role.<br/><br/>My recommendation is to wait for the DVD, which will surely be filled with a lot of fun bonus material. In a packed house, this film might be a lot of fun with contagious laughter. I watched during a matinée with practically nobody else in the theater. With that said, I would rate this movie a 6.5 out of 10 stars...no half points in IMDb, however, so a 6 out of 10 stars."
"Huntressyk","5","2","6","16 August 2008"," Went way over the top for that ""R"" Rating...
","I loved the whole premise of the movie and particularly the cast they had assembled... My problem with the film is the intensity with which they use obscenities, particularly f**k, d**k, c**k... pretty much every four-letter word there is plus all the rest. Now I swear and cuss as much as anyone, but to make me wince, it was really bad. At one point, I turned to watch the audience to see if it was just me, and pretty much the 25+ year olds were doing the same thing. Late teens and early 20's were down with it. The drug use was blatant and almost appeared to say ""hey, it's okay... it's your problem, not mine."" Blatant isn't the word for the in-your-face description of fellatio one character shares with the viewer. Tom Cruise's portrayal of the greedy, power-hungry movie mogul is great and disgusting at the same time. He spews obscenities, threats, violence, and enticements like a cobra spits venom and dances like he's spent some time in strip clubs as a male go-go dancer (and I'm not talking Chippendales). This movie promotes tolerance (in not okays) drug use (heroin, LSD, etc), selling out friends, selfish adoption, ridiculing the disabled, a hooked on visual media mentality, racial stereotypes, homosexuality, and much much more. This is definitely an 18+ year-old movie.<br/><br/>Did I laugh? Yes, a lot! Did I feel good about it when I left the theater? No. Will I buy it on DVD? No. This is a sad commentary on what U.S. values are coming too. And with each movie Stiller does, he sinks lower into the crap hole. I wonder how proud his mother is of this film. And how old will his daughter have to be before he lets his own daughter watch this?"
"foxface","8","2","6","15 August 2008"," Edgy/Funny
","This film is a great satirical spoof of action films, Hollywood, and pop culture. The trailers are hilarious and are a good barometer of what is going on in pop culture at this moment.<br/><br/>The movie takes awhile to get going, because of all the set up that is needed to explain the movie within a movie. Once the boys are on a mission, the parodies start rolling and things get funny.<br/><br/>There is a lot of controversy surrounding Robert Downey Jr.'s character and the character of Simple Jack. I think Simple Jack shows up Hollywood's tendency to award Oscars to actors who play people that suffer from mental retardation to a certain degree (Dustin Hoffman-Rainman- Tom Hanks-Forrest Gump). At one point in the movie, Downey's character advises Stiller's character that Forrest Gump wasn't too mentally retarded, because he played ping-pong with Nixon. He states Sean Penn didn't win an Osacar for Sam I am, because he went all the way in his portrayal. The irony is Downey's character went through surgery to be black, when a black actor could have just been casted in the first place. The film keeps itself in check through conversations like these and other characters who give other characters a reality check, like Alpha Chino constantly calling Downey's character out on talking black gibberish. The film is spoofing the fact that some actors take on specific roles in order to win an Oscar, even if their portrayal is offensive. I don't think this film is derogatory toward anyone who is mentally challenged, but is referring to someone who is foolish or does things considered socially ridiculous, like a white actor portraying a black actor. <br/><br/>Downey Jr as an actor in make up to make him look black, was a risky move, but his character is somewhat reminiscent of black actors in action films, especially the one from the 80's (see Commando, Action Jackson, to name a few). What keeps the character from being unacceptable to the audience, is Alpha Chino acting as the Greek Chorus, who constantly calls Lazarus out on his silly ""black"" sayings. Lazarus thinks quoting the Jefferson's theme song as a dramatic actor's monologue(which is totally hilarious) will earn him an Oscar. <br/><br/>The spoofs of ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Platoon"" area funny. Tom Cruise gives a nice turn as a greedy, egocentric agent. You do recognize him, I'm not sure why some people don't know it is him until the end of the film. There was something disturbing about Cruise's character's use of rap music as a background to his represent his cold anger, where as ""Alpha Cino's"" commercial spot did emphasize the blatant misogyny (perhaps to cover up the fact Alpha Chino is possibly gay) in some aspects of hip hop music and people got the joke right away. Stiller's character as a take on Brando from Apocalypse Now, which is a take on a character in the novelist Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" is great and that fact that unlike the book, Downey and Stiller kind of bounce back to a reality and understanding of themselves in a new way.<br/><br/>The comments on celebrity adoption, celebrity cover up's, homophobia, and excess is not lost on anyone, due to the prevalent culture of celebrity in our culture at this time, with shows like TMZ, Access Hollywood, ET, just to name a few. Go see the movie."

"PWNYCNY","10","2","6","15 August 2008"," This movie is great! This movie is a classic!~ This movie must be watched!
","This movie is brilliant. It's more than a comedy; it's about actors who are forced to face the truth about themselves and in the process experience personal growth and achieve personal happiness. Also, Brandon Soo-Hoo's performance is outstanding. He should have won all kinds of awards. However, the strongest performance was Jack Black's. He shows what a truly great actor he is. The four principal characters are a composite of humanity. They use acting to cover up their insecurities and avoid dealing with their issues. One actor believes that nobody cares about him; another, that he is personally inadequate; another, that he is worthless; and the fourth, that he is a hypocrite. How these characters deal with their issues is what this movie is about.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the greatest comedy movies ever made in the history of Hollywood and all of movies. This movie rocks! This movie has it all. The laughter is nonstop! Ben Stiller is at his very best. He is hilarious. Jack Black as Jeff Portney is incredible. He proves once again that he is among the top comedy actors. His skit, Fatties II, is a classic. How can one not laugh at that? But the highest and most extravagant accolades must be reserved for Rbbert Downey Jr. He lifts comedy to new heights of laughter. His take off on method acting is uncanny. His performance is amazing. Of course, let's not forget Tom Cruise and Mathew McConaughy. If these guys aren't meant for comedy, then what are they meant for? Tom Cruise's take off a the pushy, arrogant Hollywood producer is a classic. No one could have done that role better than him. THIS MOVIE IS GREAT!!!!!<br/><br/>This movie has an interesting premise. What happens when the movie becomes real ... and the actors don't know it? It could work as a comedy, and here the results are mixed, but that is not surprising because it is primarily an action movie interspersed with some comedy scenes. Ben Stiller is quite amusing in as Simple Jack, which is a parody of Rain Man, but it is Robert Downey Jr. who steals the show with his incredible performance as a white guy playing a black guy who gets so caught up in the role that he is on the verge of a having a mental breakdown. This movie is further proof that Robert Downey Jr. is one of Hollywood's great actors. Give him a role, he will make it happen. What's next for Mr. Downey? Perhaps a musical? If so, you know he will be great. Jack Black was also wonderful and the rest of the supporting cast, particularly young Brandon Soo Hoo, give excellent performances. If you're looking for a comedy with lots of laughs, this may not be the movie for you. But if you want to watch an action movie with some excellent and at times amusing performances then this movie is for you.<br/><br/>Additional comments: I am revising my rating upward from 6 to 8. This is a good movie, with interesting performances, and with moments of humor that add to the movie without detracting from the action. The three lead actors are excellent and the story is unique.<br/><br/>This is not the first movie from the movie-turns-into-real-life genre. Three Amigos, The Purple Rose of Cairo and the French Lieutenants's Woman also have similar premises."

","Seeing Robert Downey Jr. play a black dude as an Australian was just a tad too much ridiculousness for me not to go see this.

Well, if you're looking for laughs and violence, this is your movie.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder was consistently funny, and moved at a pace that left you with zero lulls. Some of the jokes, like the dancing was a little out of left field and didn't do anything for me or the audience I saw it with, but besides that, the majority of the jokes hit their mark, and every character brought something to the table. Maybe a tad more gore would have been nice, since they showed some great promise early on in the flick. But again, Tropic Thunder delivers exactly what the trailer promises; fantastic over-the-top performances (especially by Downey and Black), and lots of silly humor (even some fart jokes for good measure)."

","Tropic Thunder is an action comedy that features Ben Stiller,Jack Black and Robert Downey,Jr. The story is about a group of actors with prima donna attitudes who were making a fictional Vietnam War movie that were taken in the middle of the jungle.Tom Cruise,Matthew McConaughey and Nick Nolte were among the other stars that appeared in the star- studded cast.It was directed by Stiller,who co-wrote the screenplay together with Justin Theroux and Etan Coen.The film takes a satirical look at Hollywood.<br/><br/>A Vietnam War film is having difficulties being completed due to the problems encountered by the director among its stars - Tugg Speedman,Jeff Portnoy and Kirk Lazarus - that have attitude problems.The director of the film,Damien Cockburn is under very hot water with producer Les Grossman as he is unable to complete the film in time.In order to gain control of the set,Cockburn follows the advice of a Vietnam War vet - Leaf Tayback - and took his cast into the jungle and plans to film the movie with hidden camera unaware that they are in real danger.<br/><br/>This is a film that is easy to enjoy.While many of jokes I did not find really funny considering that they are over the top and grossly offensive,it still manages to be appealing and entertaining.It did well on picking on Hollywood with regards to the issues in it with the characters of the film particularly the actors who themselves have issues with their acting careers from Tugg Speedman,an action star trying to move away from action films;Kirk Lazarus,a multi- awarded actor who wants to totally immerse into the character that he portrays; and Jack Portnoy,a comedian who has a drug problem.Added to that,the fictional war manages to effectively allude to popular war film like Rambo,The Bridge Of The River Kwai,and Platoon.Overall,it still was a manageable film despite is flaws."

","It's obvious that ""Tropic Thunder"" was made by a marketing committee. It is a large Ben Stiller comic vehicle. This one is better than most, as is usual when Ben Stiller's name is allowed on the directors chair. I still think it would be funnier just to maybe turn the camera on and watch Ben Stiller have sex or talk to his mom. I'm sure this movie cost a lot to make.<br/><br/>The first time I saw this movie in theaters I cried laughing at Jack Black's fake trailer. As the years go by the movie stays as a well-paced and edited execution.

And the idea for the movie have probably sounded good, well better, than the result was. At least Clooneys gang makes real good movies when they get together! I think most of the jokes have come from the actors real world job situations. Thoughts that need little edging to be hilarious. Why can't we just say this is based on true story? Why can't white actor apply for a role of a black man? Who can tell when were acting and when were not? There's lots of jokes that usually are played in sitcoms. And some of them are real good, so that you can laugh your ass off. Their good 'cause it's based partly on the actors status we think they got.

"btm1","8","1","2","13 August 2009"," Ben Stiller blossoms: A great take-off on war movies and Hollywood in general full of tongue in cheek humor
","Although Tropic Thunder is a take-off on adventure films, and maybe of reality TV, perhaps some commenters didn't realize it is a comedy. I don't think it is among the greatest comedies of all time, but it is at least at the top of the next tier.<br/><br/>This is not a comedy to take your children to. It is a true adult comedy. Despite being chock full of violence and special effects, it is not a slap-stick comedy. There is a scene of farting, but it is not the farts that are intended to titillate; instead it pokes fun at the concept of people finding farts funny. Most of the humor comes from Ben Stiller (who wrote, directed, starred and produced Tropic Thunder) exaggerating the violence, blood and gore of war films. (If someone should watch Tropic Thunder thinking it an adventure movie, they won't be disappointed by the pyrotechnics.) He also pokes fun at the movie industry's political correctness regarding racial stereotyping, retardation, and homosexuality.<br/><br/>I thought the opening ""previews of coming attractions"" were very clever and had me fooled at first. I watched ""Tropical Thunder"" on HBO and was at first uncertain whether the previews were part of Tropic Thunder or real HBO ads.<br/><br/>I never was a fan of the string of highly successful but somewhat juvenile comedies (""Meet the Parents"", ""Meet the Fockers,"" ""Night in the Museum,"" ""There's Something About Mary"") that Ben Stiller has been cast in. But I got the idea that he probably had a lot more than that to offer when I saw him in ""Keeping the Faith"" (although this came out before all but one of the others I've mentioned, I didn't see it until later.) Kirk Lazarus tells Tugg Speedman (Stiller) that Hollywood gives Oscars to films about retarded people who are not totally retarded (""Rain Man,"" ""Forrest Gump"") but shuns films about pure retardation (""I Am Sam"").<br/><br/>I recommend not reading too much about ""Tropic Thunder"" before you see it, or you will miss one of the treats at the end when the cast is disclosed. Without advance information you'll never believe who played some of the roles. As a director, Stiller must have inspired his cast because he got nothing but great performances from them all, although only one received an Oscar nomination."
"Sirus_the_Virus","9","1","2","4 August 2009"," Obnoxious but mostly brilliant.
","Tropic Thunder has a good story idea and plot. The film is sometimes obnoxious, mostly because of Jack Black, of course. Black is funny in this film, but he is very gross also. The film is hilarious, but obnoxious at times. The Plot: All of these girly-ish actors filming a war movie, are sent out to an actual war-zone, and are still under the impression that they are filming. Ben Stiller plays the lead character Tugg. Who I actually think could pull off a really stupid person. Robert Downey Jr. had his best year ever last year. With the amazing and awesome Iron Man and his Oscar nomination for Tropic Thunder as an Australian actor who did a reverse Michael Jackson procedure. He went black. Tropic Thunder is a hilarious film. It is also partially an action film towards the end of the movie. Tropic Thunder is offensive, gross at times, and incredibly funny. I liked every character in the film, besides Jack Black's character. Black plays Jeff Portnoy, who is kind've an Eddie Murphey type actor. I mean that because he's in movies like The Nutty Professor. Tropic Thunder is an awesome comedy. That is far from disappointing and has in your face action. Tropic Thunder will blow your mind."
"Benjamin_Cox","7","1","2","27 July 2009"," Nearly but not quite - 72%
","I've always maintained that Ben Stiller has only ever made one great film, the increasingly dusty ""There's Something About Mary"". But given the amount of hype and good press behind this movie, maybe this was one that broke the mould. However, I wasn't so sure. You see, the whole 'actors-doing-their-parts-for-real' movie seems to come around every ten years or so - remember ""Galaxy Quest"" and before that, ""Three Amigos""? So in truth, this is still a good movie but not the great side-splitting comedy I was expecting.<br/><br/>Stiller plays Tugg Speedman, a fading action movie star drafted in to play the lead in a big-budget Vietnam war epic alongside low-grade comedy actor Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) and multiple-award-winning method actor Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr). After being dropped into the jungle by rookie director Damian Cockburn (Steve Coogan), a series of accidents leaves the stars together with rap star Alpa Chino (Brandon T Jackson) and up-and-coming actor Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel) to fend for themselves. Convinced that they are still shooting a movie, they soon find themselves in real trouble when heavily-armed irate locals arrive.<br/><br/>Given that Stiller is the brains behind the screenplay and the camera as well, it shouldn't be a surprise that the humour in ""Tropic Thunder"" can get a little close to the knuckle at times. Whether it's the trouble with acting ""full retard"" or scratching your head at Downey Jr blacking himself up, I sometimes felt a little uneasy. Not to say I didn't laugh because I did, though it isn't a riot from start to finish. The problem I had is that it's a film within a film that later becomes a film within a film within another film! The other problem is that Stiller isn't as funny as his co-stars - even a heavily disguised Tom Cruise is funnier, given that he's not known for his comic timing. It also badly loses its way towards the end plot wise and although the action scenes are exaggerated, there still isn't anything original in there worth getting excited about. ""Galaxy Quest"" was funnier and more entertaining and that was back in 1999.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm being unfair but I just felt that this wasn't the laugh-a-minute, all-action blast everyone was talking about. It's good for a night in with the lads and a few beers but seasoned movie-goers probably won't get much out of it. It ain't difficult to spoof a war movie and yet somehow, no-one has done it really well yet. This feels more like a loving tribute to the likes of ""Rambo"" and ""Platoon"" instead of the barbed parody it would like us to think it is. It even spoofs ""Heart Of Darkness"", the documentary about the making of ""Apocolypse Now"" but if you haven't seen that then what's the point? So has Stiller made his second great film? No but at least he gave this his all. It's good but hardly a classic but it will go down as another ""Dodgeball"" or ""Starsky And Hutch"" - a wasted opportunity if ever there was one. Try harder!"

","Let me set up some stats first. I'm a girl, and I found this movie to be hilarious. I don't get why people keep saying that this is just a guy movie. Sure, the only speaking part for a woman in this movie is Ben Stiller's wife, but it doesn't matter. The movie stands as a hilarious take on Hollywood actors determined to change their images or win an Oscar.<br/><br/>I loved it the first time I saw it, and the second time (24 hours later). Since then, I've seen it over 10 times (bought the directors cut - which is totally worth it) and it's STILL funny. It's a true gem of a comedy in this period of truly awful spoofs. This is satire going back to the days of Mel Brooks, but tweaked. Ben Stiller worked on this movie for over 10 years, and his hard work shows. The editing and directing are fantastic, as well as lighting and sound. The tech and acting aspects are all here to create a wonderful comedy that is not clean of fun for the whole family.<br/><br/>Downey - impeccable as usual. Spot on without being distasteful, and funny beyond reason.<br/><br/>Jack Black - His role is so understated in this film. He's funny in every scene he's in. He deserves more credit.<br/><br/>Stiller - You can see his passion for this movie and his role in every scene he's in. He acts everything with care and consideration for his character.<br/><br/>Jay Baruchel & Brandon T. Jackson - Two unknowns who really shined in this movie as the unknown theater school grad and multi-franchise rapper respectively. They're hilarious actors that have moved on to bigger comedies, but this is by far their break out movie.<br/><br/>Go see it. Rent it. Steal it from a friend - just watch it. A fantastic comedy in all of its gore and profanity. This is one of my favorite films, and I don't use that term lightly."

","Recap: An inexperienced director is stuck between his starstudded cast that won't do as they're told and his rich but abusive producer. In a final attempt to make his film before he is shut down he tries something drastic. He leaves his actors in the middle of the jungle telling them he has put cameras and explosives all over the jungle, and now it's up to them to act it out. Unfortunately the next thing he does is stepping on a landmine and therefore can't explain that the villains (and their guns) that appear are real and not part of his movie.<br/><br/>Comments: It's not easy trying to do many things at the same time, often ending up doing each part half-hearted. But here Ben Stiller is writing, directing and acting (watch the extra material on this) and doing each part very well. In special he has put together a script (with the help of others i.e. Justin Theroux) that is a little daring but mixes action, comedy and parody at a level that I haven't seen before. It is a risk to diversify too much but Stiller's script allows him to do it and the result is great actually.<br/><br/>It does help that Stiller has gotten a good cast to work with, and that stars have turned up for cameos giving the movie an edge you can't write or act.<br/><br/>However, it may well be Robert Downey Jr that steals the movie with his performance as Kirk Lazarus, or Sgt Osiris, whichever persona he is in at the time. The line ""I stay in character until I've done the DVD commentary"" is really telling. His competition might be Tom Cruise, aka Les Grossman, the abusive producer. The best Cruise I've seen in many years.<br/><br/>Well, I liked it very much. It's not often you get a movie that can combine own jokes, obvious and hidden spoofs, and a lot of explosions in a balanced way that Tropic Thunder manages to do. I got a lot of laughs out of it. My hat is off for Stiller, please do another one? 8/10"

","""Tropic Thunder"" just isn't that funny. The start is good - funny fake movie trailers for the three leads (Stiller, Jack Black and Robert Downey jnr) and a huge, expensive screw-up on the set. But the main plot of the movie - the actors are dropped off in the middle of the jungle and filmed with hidden cameras and recording equipment to capture their authentic reactions - is just too stupid for words. What kind of movie studio would throw away a truckload of money by having its actors spend most of their time wandering around a jungle, only stopping occasionally to follow the script and deliver their lines? With nobody to direct them? And how did the production team place all that recording equipment around the jungle without ever running into the villains that the actors eventually encounter? Some may think I'm taking this too seriously, but the goofy plot put a big dent in the movie for me. They should have continued with making the war movie the way they did at the beginning. <br/><br/>Apart from some comic bright spots - Stiller's ""Simply Jack"" moments and his encounter with the thing he loves most in the world are hilarious - there's just not much else that is funny. I'm not a huge Jack Black fan, but I think we can all agree his characters was a weak link and a giant waste of space. Downey's white turned black actor was moderately funny, and I think Tom Cruise's performance is just one of those things people think that they're supposed to love - to me, it just highlighted how unsuited to the role he was. Heck, he showed twice as much viciousness and intensity in 'Magnolia.' A pretty lazy, unfocused and corny romp in the jungle. ""Tropic Blunder"" indeed."

","Although, this is quite amusing and very well made, I can't say that I laughed that much. Ben Stiller shows that he knows show business very well which is pretty obvious since basically everybody in his family are in it. It's just hard to figure out what his aim is. Does he think that method actors go overboard? Does he think that it is the industry or is he just putting everybody on saying he think everything he does is not to be taken seriously? As a straight forward action-comedy the movie sort of works. The actors all do great, especially Robert Downey Jr. and Jack Black. Like Ben Stiller, Jack Black can go totally overboard with cynical characters but here he is actually funny as a bumbling stooge. Robert Downey Jr. once again shows that he is a man willing to do anything for his craft (sort of ironic considering the subject matter). By mocking himself he is pretty much telling us that he's a good sport and who doesn't like that.<br/><br/>A whole other matter is the portrayal of the Asians. It's pretty clear that we are a pretty easy target. What can you say? It's pretty much what you would expect. If I actually saw an intelligent portrayal of a single Asian person in a Hollywood blockbuster I would be surprised. I guess it wouldn't be funny.<br/><br/>Of course, this is entertainment. Not to be taken seriously but then as I started by saying, what is the point."

Jackson, Jay Baruchel) are having spoiled-rotten-actor issues while filming a cheddar-cheesy Viet Nam war movie with their frazzled director (Steve Coogan) - until their military consultant (grizzled Nick Nolte - that's kinda tautologous nowadays) suggests they be air-lifted into real jungle in Southeast Asia to man them up, whereupon Tugg is captured by real guerillas (whom he thinks are actors), with his platoon forced to use their cheese chops and fake props to save him.<br/><br/>We sometimes mistake Stiller for a mediocre talent when we see him as Actor Only in drab dishrags like MEET THE FOCKERS and ALONG CAME POLLY, or mediocre milestones like MYSTERY MEN and DODGEBALL - but we need to separate those acting-only jobs from his personalized writer-director-actor projects.<br/><br/>This is the same man who brought us the brilliant - yet too-quickly-canceled - THE BEN STILLER SHOW (1992) and after getting his directorial feet wet with the GenX throwaway REALITY BITES, his subsequent writer-director-actor output is from stellar left field: THE CABLE GUY (1996), ZOOLANDER (2001), and now TROPIC THUNDER.<br/><br/>THUNDER is a tribute to the poo-kicking industry of movie-making; self-effacement, narcissism and irony girds the script and fuels the characters: Stiller's Speedman is everything that Arnold and Stallone were, with ten times the hyperbole; Jack Black is heroin junkie Portnoy, with the fart-driven comedy franchise THE FATTIES; Brandon T. Jackson is hip-hop superstar Alpa Chino, with a soft drink line called Booty Juice; Jay Baruchel is the naive youngster starstruck just to be around legends; and under-used Steve Coogan is the flustered director who cannot control his movie stars.<br/><br/>Plucking references from APOCALYPSE NOW, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, PLATOON, the RAMBO series, THE DEER HUNTER, BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI, the cinematography sometimes brushes up so close to those classics it is eerie.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is the callous movie producer, who sees more profit in Tugg being M.I.A. than rescued. And he's very funny, in a very scary way. But it will take awhile to see through the heavy bald makeup and fat forearm prosthetics to recognize him. Matthew McConaughey, on the other hand, is the same surfer dude and Tugg's agent.<br/><br/>But the movie belongs to Robert Downey Jr. For once that comedic force of nature known as Jack Black does not steal the show. That award must go to Downey for, ironically, playing a black. He is simply astonishing as an Australian, Kirk Lazarus, an actor so immersed in Method that he undergoes ""skin pigmentation"" to play the role of an African-American, in a nod to that Hollywood idiocy of placing white movie stars in non-white roles.<br/><br/>At first it's seems like a joke - but Downey goes deep. And never lapses. He IS The Black Man. He inhabits the skin of Lazarus so fully that most of his lines are ad-libbed - and sound authentically black! He lives the black vernacular, the black swagger, the black inflection... I'm sure African-Americans would pick his slipups (as I pick his fake Australiana when he lapses into that character) - and the actual black guy on set, Alpa Chino, continually lambastes him for racism - but the completeness of Lazarus's transformation is magnificent and gutshock hilarious.<br/><br/>When Tugg accuses Lazarus, ""You people are always complaining..."" he counters with ""What do you mean 'you people'?"" To which Alpa retorts, ""What do *you* mean 'you people'?"" <br/><br/>Tugg's previous, Oscar-tilting role was in SIMPLE JACK, a starring role where he played a retarded man, yet lost the Oscar. Lazarus advises Tugg he shouldn't have gone 'full retard': ""Check it out: Dustin Hoffman - RAIN MAN, look retarded, act retarded, not retarded. Counted toothpicks, cheated cards. Autistic? Sho'. Not retarded. Tom Hanks - FORREST GUMP. Slow? Yes. But he charmed the pants off Nixon and won a ping-pong competition. That ain't retarded..."" <br/><br/>In an inspired piece of screen writing, the SIMPLE JACK subplot, the classic war films and this film's opening scene itself all come together to create a satirical yet somehow tear-jerking climactic scene.<br/><br/>If Hollywood could make more movies like this one, maybe movies lambasting Hollywood like this one wouldn't have to be made.<br/><br/>--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania)."

Yet in the biggest way it's nothing serious as the film really just boils down to a parody and skit mock of other films. You have well known stars as Ben Stiller, Jack Black, and Robert Downey Jr. who all portray big Hollywood stars. And all of them have agreed to help their struggling careers to get together and do a war picture a friendship type film that is mostly funny a comedy that mocks fun at many others really just a big film parody. In the scenes you see films like ""Easy Rider"", ""Platoon"", and ""Apocalypse Now"" portrayed and mocked. Like I said the film has good performances from big name stars the most notable one was Downey Jr. still it fell short on my list because of it's lack of drama and seriousness. Still if you want a good laugh and like film parody check it out."
"ram_dhanush","9","1","2","21 February 2009"," Brilliant!
","I hardly even bothered to consider this flick at the first place because I literally thought this will be yet another over-hyped comedy, knowing that almost all of the big-budget comedies (Zohan, Dollitle to name a few) of the past year have been in truth middling films. But 'Tropic Thunder' may have just earned my earnest respect as being the best comedy I have seen in a really long, long time.<br/><br/>Whats good about Tropic Thunder is that the plot is not dumb or laughable. Its the actors and events within the plot that makes you laugh. The thought about having five real-life actors caught in a real-life war situation sounds serious, and Ben Stiller treats this both seriously and also with comedic panache. Not to mention the sight of Steve Coogan saying 'oh oh' and being blown to pieces after stepping on an old-mine freaked me out even more than horror movies in recent times, but how Ben Stiller tries to lick the blood mistaking it for a prop hilarious.<br/><br/>The fake trailers was a masterstroke, especially Kirk Lazarus' 'Satan' Alley' fake trailer and the music which appears when Tobey Maguire touches Robert Downey Jr. That said and done, it is Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise who really steal the show in this film. I have become a big fan of Robert Downey in recent years (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang being the main reason), now he will go down as one of my utmost favorites with his performance here. His performance as Osiris and absolutely weird comments such as 'I don't read the script, the script reads me' gives you a 'wtf' reaction to boot with. Don't to forget his Chinese interaction with the terrorists where he mixes a 'paddy field' and a 'poppy field'. Cruise, surprisingly, has earned my utmost credit as an actor through this film. I never doubted Cruise's ability to act, but the downside is that Cruise has not taken up enough films to show off his flexibility as an actor. Weirdly enough, a superstar like him taking up a role like Les Grossman's in a film like 'Tropic Thunder' is good news for Cruise critics. Cruise was absolutely convincing in his role, and his satirical dancing and incessant bad words spurting out of his mouth in novelty (Cruise has probably cursed more in this film more than his entire career put together). That toned-down 'Go F*** yourself' is notorious.<br/><br/>Jack Black and Ben Stiller follow up with good performances, but not actually excellent. Stiller instills brilliant laughter at times (the panda scene), but is pedestrian in most. Jack Black meanwhile is an actor whom I personally thought would be better off doing serious roles (he was convincing in King Kong) rather than comedic roles, where he comes across a tad too self-conscious, forced humor. But in this film, Jack's style of humor comes across as a perfect suit, him being the absolute nuisance who distracts the whole unit. The 'I'll suck your dick' comment after learning of Alpa Chino's sexual identity is brilliant timing. Jay Baruchel is good and fits his role to the T but Mathhew McConaughey seems a little out of place with his role.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller's brilliant direction and some great artwork and action direction makes Tropic Thunder the most epic comedy I have seen in my life."
"varundelpiero","8","1","2","17 February 2009"," Hilariously brilliant...
","TROPIC THUNDER is the movie that all the horrendous EPIC MOVIEs, DATE MOVIEs, SCARY MOVIEs, etc. wanted to be. It is perhaps the best and funniest spoof of Hollywood made thus far. The manner in which it is done is technically brilliant, as there are very few outright/direct spoofs; much of the humour comes from the subtext. Everything from movie trailers to awards nominations are tackled head-on, but done with taste and intelligence (something comedies of this ilk lack) and not catered to derive cheap laughs from brainless morons.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller knows enough of Hollywood to know how the system works, and in his directorial role, he uses almost every bit of that knowledge to poke intelligent fun at Hollywood's operations.<br/><br/>The film's cast is star-studded, as expected, and there are enough cameos to keep the avid viewer alert. Ben Stiller himself is hilarious, as is Jack Black. To me the real standout is Robert Downey Jr., who continues his career revival in one of the funniest roles seen in a long time. Another standout is the almost unrecognisable Tom Cruise (in fat suit), who steps out of his comfort zone, and shows his willingness to poke fun at himself, to deliver a memorably hilarious performance. It is worth the admission price by itself. I must admit here that I was unaware that it was Tom Cruise until the ending credits rolled. Needless to say, I felt a bit embarrassed and shocked at the same time, and immediately saw the movie for a second time. The only out-of-place actor is Nick Nolte, who seems to take his role a bit too seriously.<br/><br/>My only complaint here was the running-length of the film. Comedies that stretch over the 95-100 minute mark usually overindulge or include material that seems superfluous. This is the case here, but it's only a small gripe, given the overall quality of the film. 8/10, 3 stars (out of 4). Should garner a place on my Honourable Mentions list. Highly recommended."

","Tropic Thunder: (n) A Ben Stiller film starring himself, Robert Downey Jr. and Jack Black. Intended to spoof all war films ever made and entertain all viewers. Contains disturbing images and thematic moments, including rough humor and sexual references. Unique in starting out in a series of bogus trailers introducing the main characters (many viewers actually went to rent the movies advertised). A very controversial film, it was blasted by some for making a mockery out of war and veterans, and praised by some who focused more sensibly on it's ridiculous side.<br/><br/>All in all, Tropic Thunder was a very good movie. If anyone lost a relative during the Vietnam war, possibly it's best that you don't watch this, though. This movie does spoof veterans and the war in general, so you might be outraged. Otherwise, this movie is a fairly successful comedy in the style of 'Top Secret': spoof everything in sight.<br/><br/>The acting was astoundingly good. Robert Downey Jr. in particular must be noted for his portrayal of a foul-mouthed but intelligent African-American Platoon Sergeant. (His accent is another spoofing the movie... anyone see it?) Also, Jack Black in the role of an addicted actor with a successful 'Fatty' franchise (pretty self-explanatory) was hilarious. His line 'OOOHH, I f***ing hate movies!' was improv, and so were the more witty conversations. Brandon T. Jackson was also a gem in this movie, contributing non-stop laughs in the campfire scene and the confrontation with Osiris. Ben Stiller, while not as outstanding as the others, was very convincing as a rather perfectionist and thick-skulled actor.<br/><br/>The theme itself is quite unique (I only saw the theme of actors in a real life situation in one movie: 'the man who knew too little', which. by the way, was a great comedy), and the directors are quite adept in making the most of it. Tropic Thunder is indeed a good start to the new year (yes, I know it came out last year, I only watched it today.) <br/><br/>PS: watch the movie with commentary later. it's like another comedy in itself: the Black-Stiller-Downey Jr.-Baruchel quartet is hilarious! Should you watch this movie? Definitely. But get ready for a lot of swearing and rough humor."
"davideo-2","7","1","2","15 February 2009"," So absurd and clever you can't help but laugh at it
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>Mega stars from the world of action, Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), comedy, Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) and serious drama Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) have come together to make Tropic Thunder, a big budget action picture set in the jungles of South East Asia. Unfortunately, the director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) is having a terrible time of making it, and Les Grossman (Tom Cruise), the studio head financing it, orders him to take his three stars on a tour around the volatile area without the cameras and crew following them around so they get a feel for the real danger they need to portray. However, after Cockburn's unfortunate death, the team realize this may not be as safe a learning experience as they thought.<br/><br/>I've never been a massive fan of Ben Stiller, but Tropic Thunder is probably his best film since Meet the Parents. Not that that's any great shakes, as even that was only awarded ***, but in terms of Stiller and his brand of comedy, this is another big hit (as opposed to something like, say, Zoolander which flew right over me.)<br/><br/>This is a film obsessed with being clever and taking the p!ss. From the trailers at the beginning, sending up big budget, no brainer action films, the low brow humour of American comedies, and Robert Downey Jr, who appears to be sending up Russell Crowe, Mr. T from The A Team and, er, himself. Quite how Stiller managed to get all these big name stars involved (many of which in roles they'd never normally do) for something that, while funny is hardly the most hilarious idea ever, is anyone's guess, but do it he has. The sheer absurdity of it all is what generates most of the laughs, from Stiller's mentally impaired farmboy act that amuses those who come to be his captors, Black's obnoxious fatty with a secret drug problem and, of course, Cruise's bumpin' and grindin' studio exec. The break-through role though, is that of child star Brandon Soo Hoo, as a high pitched, angry, kung fu kicking child commander of the Asian army. The film's problems, though, are a disjointed plot and being at least ten minutes too long, but with all those egos wanting to hog all that screen time, a lot more probably ended up on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is not the greatest comedy ever. It's not even really good. But it's an undeniably clever send up of Hollywood and famous actors that gets by on how absurd it all is as well. ***"
"ts_error","8","1","2","13 February 2009"," A really funny, but sometimes really over-the-top film
","Okay, I'll have to say this first: I am not a big fan of Hollywood comedies. Last year, Tropic Thunder caught my attention because of promising trailers and good reviews. Now that I've seen it, I can say that Tropic Thunder was and wasn't the film I expected it to be.<br/><br/>The film focuses on a turbulent movie project called Tropic Thunder that has been hit with plenty of bad luck and bad movie making. The makers of the film want to make drastic changes to the way the movie is made. The director decides to put the main cast in the middle of a jungle and make a more realistic film in an environment that the actors will have a hard time in.<br/><br/>There was a lot of good stuff in the movie. The easily best part was Robert Downey Jr. His performance as Kirk Lazarus, the Australian method actor and winner of multiple Oscars was fantastic. I didn't realize he had such great comic skills! It's great that Downey Jr. has been nominated for a supporting actor Oscar for the role, because he really deserves it. The rest of the cast - apart from Jack Black - was also really good. The second best thing about Tropic Thunder was the comedy itself - which is rare nowadays. It throws some great punches towards Hollywood, especially in the beginning in the form of fake trailers, which are hilarious. Technically, the film is also very good. The cinematography is the high point here, but the pyrotechnics and intestines don't come too far behind.<br/><br/>But now, onto the cons. My main gripe with this film was that the dialogue was too reliant on genital jokes and f-words, instead of wit and pacing. Okay, maybe it was meant to be that way for reasons of parody, but frequently the dialogue went over the top. Another thing that I didn't especially love about the film was Jack Black. I admit he was great in School of Rock, but I felt he was almost useless in this one as a comedian. He didn't act in the whole movie - unless you call shouting and being stupid acting. The last thing, albeit a minor one, is that the plot itself wasn't all that memorable, but maybe it was like that for a reason...<br/><br/>In the end, Tropic Thunder is definitely a well-made comedy. The script is really funny and it has very good acting. It is not for everyone, though, because of filthy language and sometimes quite disgusting scenes. But if you like your comedies that way, you'll most likely love this one."
"jhpstrydom","8","1","2","13 February 2009"," This is a truly good comedy.
","With all negativity aside, I thought this was truly a good comedy, sure it was crude and offensive, but its not the first and definitely won't be the last, and I'll let in on a little secret, you get people complaining that this movie is offensive because it uses the word retard a lot for example, now take those very same people put them in a bar, give them enough booze, and then observe at how many times they use a few words over and over, my point is people sometime just look for an excuse to be full of it.<br/><br/>The movie itself is funny as hell, and boast a lot of likable characters like Kirk Lazurus (Robert Downey Jr.), Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), and the dweeb of a director who fancies himself Oliver Stone (Steve Coogan), Just naming a few, and for Ben Stiller a guy I figured I don't like for some reason I can't place my finger on, did a great job as director, and Tom Cruise, this is probably the first time I've seen him change his appearance, I think, because every film I saw him in that I can remember, he pretty much looked the same, this time he actually has a bold head.<br/><br/>Overall, go see this movie, and if you don't like it for some reason then too bad, just move on and find something else."
"bburns","8","1","2","2 February 2009"," Ben Stiller's funniest movie yet
","I have never been much of a Ben Stiller fan. I have always thought that when he succeeds, it was more due to the people surrounding him than any actual talent. This has been true from his earliest days on MTV (Janeane Garafolo, Andy Dick) through his late-'90's commercial peak (Cameron Diaz, Robert De Niro) up to today (Will Ferrell, Owen Wilson). ""Tropic Thunder"" does not change my opinion. What sets ""Tropic Thunder"" apart is that this time one of his more-talented collaborators is cinematic genius Ethan Coen, who co-wrote the script.<br/><br/>The plot of ""Tropic Thunder"" is fairly thin, so I won't go into much detail except to say that it is about the filming of a Vietnam War drama, and fans of ""Platoon"", ""Apocolypse Now"", ""Born on the Fourth of July"", ""Hamburger Hill"" and ""Full Metal Jacket"" will see scenes from these movies all spoofed surprisingly well.<br/><br/>I should say something about the characters. Ben Stiller plays Tugg Speedman, a cross between Tom Cruise and Sylvester Stallone, a middle-aged, washed up action star trying to go back to playing the sorts of roles that got him nominated for Oscars back in his twenties. Jack Black plays Jeff Portnoy, a cross between Eddie Murphy and Robert Downey Jr, a drug addict trying to break out of slapstick comedy roles. Downey himself plays Kirk Lazarus, a cross between De Niro and Russell Crowe, an intense Australian method actor who has undergone surgery to make himself black for the role. Brandon Jackson plays Alpa Chino, a gangster rapper with a secret, whose sole purpose in the movie is to point out that Lazarus's attempts to be black are offensive. And finally, there's Tom Cruise as Les Grossman, the amoral studio head who has all the best lines (all written--I am convinced--by Coen).<br/><br/>As a director, Stiller falls into the usual trap: There are way too many close-ups of him making a not-that-silly face and speaking in a not-that-silly voice. I didn't find the ""Simple Jack"" stuff offensive so much as just annoying.<br/><br/>But I will give credit where credit is due. Downey actually deserves his Oscar nomination for this one. Jack Black has never done a comedy in which he wasn't funny or gave less than 100%, and this is no exception. And Tom Cruise steals every scene he is in. Each time he was on screen, I nearly died laughing.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Tropic Thunder"" is the funniest movie of 2009. It is Stiller's funniest work to date, even if it doesn't live up to Ethan Coen's previous comedic standards (""Raising Arizona"", ""O Brother Where Art Thou""). 8 out of 10."
"poe426","10","1","2","4 January 2009"," A real blast...
","It's a fine line, indeed, the one between comedy and drama. Or between unintentional comedies that would be dramas. First and foremost, there's Robert Downey in blackface and Ben Stiller in whiteface; and then there's Danny McBride (he of THE FOOT FIST WAY, another comedy I would recommend), whose pyrotechnic expertise proves pivotal (though he labors under the misconception here that he has ""blinded Jamie Lee Curtis"" somewhere along the way)- and the kid, Brandon Soo Hoo, who is spot-on as the terrible Golden Triangle tyke. First rate in every respect (Stiller proves himself a director to be reckoned with), TROPIC THUNDER gets under the skin of the Hollywood Blockbuster like nothing I've ever seen- and does it with just enough of a mix of drama and humor to make it effective. (Would a drama have been half as good? We've seen funny war movies before- TOP SECRET!, the Chuck Norris and Sly Stallone films, to rattle off but a few-, but when was the last time that a comedy took us so deeply into the Heart of a FILMMAKER'S Darkness...?) McBride's rescue of his fellow filmmakers could be viewed as a metaphor for the way fx guys have been ""saving"" movies in Hollywoodland for years, now. Even funnier than the movie itself is the DVD commentary with Lincoln Osiris. Checker out."
"nikki-folwell","8","1","2","3 January 2009"," FINALLY, a smart, funny movie!
","While his most recent credits don't really do this comparison much justice, this is undoubtedly Ben Stiller's best for quite some time. Quite apart from the fact that I think it says a lot about Ben Stiller as a person that he directed, co-wrote and starred in this film while still graciously giving all of the best lines to somebody else, TT gives every actor of the piece a chance to have a blast with their characters and is undoubtedly a wicked career high for everybody involved.<br/><br/>The three fake trailers at the beginning of the movie immediately tip you off as to what you're in for, and are a nice touch: it's cool to see a film biting the hand that feeds it and taking a dig at hackneyed Hollywood prototypes, paying no attention to the kind of backlash that it might get in response. Scorcher VI is just the kind of big-budget rubbish that Tinseltown wouldn't hesitate to produce (""Here we go again...AGAIN"" lol) while Jack Black's vehicle The Fatties is particularly amusing because it looks so authentic - I think we can all agree that it's very much the kind of movie which could so easily become a real franchise, of which Jack Black could VERY easily become the real star. And I mean that in the nicest possible way.<br/><br/>But of course it's no secret that the whole film just belongs to Robert Downey Jnr., and not just because of his audacious decision to take part in something that could inevitably bring him controversy. His wonderful execution and priceless one-liners are so pitch-perfect that you'll be too busy laughing to worry about how un-PC it all is (and let's face it, when have PC jokes ever been funny?). Furthermore, the role is clearly not meant to be a swipe at black people; it's more of a swipe at that breed of over-confident dramatic actors who take their work so seriously that they're usually willing to do whatever it takes to become a character, even if it means absorbing themselves into the role in such a demoralising and over-the-top way. I dare say that we can all think of an actor along these lines. So hats off to Robert, who handles his part with such silliness, bravery and - dare I say it - heart that you've just got no choice but to love him. The scene in which Kirk and the others go to rescue Tugg from the POW camp (""HERE'S MY MOTHERF**KIN' FARM!!"") has got to qualify as the coolest movie moment of 2008.<br/><br/>All of the other cast members are equally impressive and milk what they've got to offer for all that it's worth. Jay Baruchel does a great job with his role, while Brandon T. Jackson is awesome as the typically cocky rapper who actually has a brain underneath the hood (""There's no S in Viet Cong. It's already plural. You wouldn't say 'Chineses'!""). As a plus, one of the most notable things about this movie is the fact that the secondary characters are given just as much to do as the frontrunning ones - somewhat of a rarity in cinema these days, movies in general and comedies in particular.<br/><br/>Anybody who doesn't watch this because of its subject matter is missing out on a great time. What can I say, each to his own, but I think that TT nicely caters to all of the areas which its target audience would be hoping for; comedy, action, suspense, intrigue and good acting. Even Matthew McConaughey, somebody who I can normally take or leave in movies, manages to be appealing in his character, while Tom Cruise is wildly outstanding as the sleazy executive producer whom he probably had great fun playing.<br/><br/>It loses two stars for its pacing, which does suffer a little in places (occasionally scenes drag on) and I'm saving my ten-star rating for something really spectacular, but ultimately TT is a slick, fun and hilarious ride that definitely deserves multiple views. Mr. Stiller, PLEASE give the romantic comedies a rest and do more films like this."

","""Topic Thunder"" seems the perfect title for a war movie parody, certainly better than ""Hot Shots, Part Deux."" ""Tropic Thunder"" also suggests a kind of suntan lotion spread on imagined hard bodies lying around the Olympic size pool of fictional movie mogul Sid Grossman (modeled on Joel Silver, perhaps?). Sadly, like most suntan oils, ""Tropic Thunder"" does not live up to its promise to protect the delicate skins of those buying the product.<br/><br/>Tug Speedman (Ben Stiller) is an amalgam of shallow action movie heroes, bulked up like Stallone, but more clearly modeled on Tom Cruise. Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) is a blend of Chris Farley and Eddie Murphy and Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey, Jr.) is certainly the method-obsessed Aussie, Russell Crowe. What could be more hilarious than Sid Grossman being played by Tom Cruise, who, once again, demonstrates he is not only a good sport but also a terrific supporting actor? Cruise and Downey are both pitch perfect and well deserving of their Golden Globe nominations.<br/><br/>""Tropic Thunder,"" on the other hand, is a disappointment. What, in my opinion, the three best movie parodies (""Young Frankenstein,"" ""Galaxy Quest"" and ""Hot Shots, Part Deux"") shared in common was heart. With its excessive grossness and mean-spirited take on all its characters, including its target audience, ""Tropic Thunder,"" has, beneath its hard surface, a heart as cold, cynical and shallow as the movies it parodies. I give ""Tropic Thunder"" a ""6""."

By now, the premise of the movie is fairly well known...a group of actors (including soon-to-be has-been Tugg Speedman, overly-dedicated method-man Kirk Lazurus, and an obnoxious junkie/comic played by Jack Black) get trapped in a guerilla infested area of Laos, but think it's just another day on the set of their big-budget Vietnam flick, ""Tropic Thunder"". ""Three Amigos"", anyone?

Great dialouge, interesting characters , and action scenes better than most ACTION movies make ""Tropic Thunder"" an ass kicker...would've liked to see more Tom Cruise (as Les Grossman, a comically frightening producer/studio head) though....It's good to know that Hollywood heavies like Stiller, Downey Jr., and Tom Cruise can laugh at themselves.

Most of the lines were not at all funny and kind like ""hey I am Ben Stiller being ridiculous so laugh"" nothing clever or witty. If you have watched the trailer its pretty much all you are going to see in this movie. I have to say though, that Tom Cruise's character was the funniest and most unexpected one in the movie!"

I was in no way going to draw a comparison with Zoolander and then I realised that that is exactly what I ended up doing. Tropic Thunder is a satire of Hollywood egos, making movies, the motivation for making movies (Oscars), and the war film (Platoon in particular). Now there are some genuinely funny moments in this film but I'm at pains to remember what they were. All I can remember is another terrible performance from Jack Black, playing a drug addled fat guy. Ben Stiller played his usual stupid guy. Think Derek Zoolander without Magnum. Robert Downey Jr was a guy playing a guy pretending to be a guy.<br/><br/>The premise was good - a real life war film with actors flung into a jungle being filmed on hand-held cameras. For me it all fell apart when they came to the 'Pow Camp'. At that point it just became a sub Rambo 3 action film with bad jokes. I mean great, so it had a happy ending, and great, it was as violent and non-lethal as The A-Team, but very gory but it all felt so... forced.<br/><br/>That said it gets an extra point for Tom Cruise's fantastic performance, especially his telephone putdown which was a real treat."

Tom Cruise.. Well this is a complete change of pace for Tom, I just couldn't have seen Cruise play a character like this even 2 years ago, this just might see his career take an upturn just because he has shown he has the balls to do something completely out of the box.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller plays the main character who leads a team of actors through the Vietnam jungle believing that they are being filmed. The film pokes fun at so many war films you find yourself listing them in your head for instance:- Full Metal jacket, Apocalypse Now, hamburger Hill & even Forrest Gump to name just a few.<br/><br/>The film is very near the knuckle on several occasions, so you are either going to love it or hate it."

The comedy is hit-and-miss, but comes so fast, and in such quantity, that you never need to dwell on the dull moments. Audiences will be discussing their favourite lines for years to come. Personally, pretty much everything that came out of Robert Downey Jr. as a method-obsessed Aussie star (taking the pish out of Russel Crowe may be the bravest decision Stiller made in this film) was a gem, but ""I don't read scripts, scripts read me"" takes some beating. Stiller is always better when reacting than acting. Here, he tries to be the funny one too often, and so gets little chance to do what he does best. Jack Black is a disappointment, the over-acting that served him so well in School of Rock is cringe-inducing here.<br/><br/>It is not as cynical as The Player, or as playful as Bowfinger, but TT finds its niche in the genre of Hollywood parodies based on its shotgun approach. The comedy works best when it comes from the interplay of characters - Lazarus and Alpa Chino especially. It is less funny when parodying well-known scenes from Platoon, Apocalypse Now and bizarrely, Close Encounters. Tom Cruise does outstanding work as the ego-maniacal producer, but that particular archetype is slightly too well-worn. Cruise does well with a familiar type, rather than breaking new ground.<br/><br/>TT needs more than one viewing to appreciate all the gags. I for one will go back to it."

But the riffing on film clichés and conventions,as well as the union of four Showbiz archetypes:the action her(Ben Stiller,also directing)who wants dearly and desperately to be taken seriously,the Award-winning Australian bad boy actor(Robert Downey Jr.,who,depending on your tolerance fro big bold character,will either be doing his most impressive or most annoying performance of his career here)whose form of ""mehtod"" acting has now crossed into racist territory;the comedic actor(Jack Black,mocking his work or his peers?You be the judge)whose unbridled success has fed his worst demons to the point of implosion;the rap star(Brandon Jackson,maybe the coolest acting here),an ambitious kid with plenty of his product to hock and an image to protect;and the low-end,up-and-coming actor(Jay Bauschel),who clearly understands the craft,script,subject material(etc.)MUCH better than his much higher paid co-stars. They go off course of the Vietnam movie they're cast in and end up being the prey of Vietnamese Meth runners.<br/><br/>Caught in this net are a juicy(and possibly most interesting)assortment of side characters featuring: a back-slapping Charlie of an agent(MAtthew McConaughey,does he EVER act?) for Stiller's action hero,the crippled lone survivor Vietnam Vet(Nick NOlte)who wrote the book and provides script material,the jacked-up Demolitons expert(Danny McBride,almost picking up where he left off in Pineapple Express)who almost worship's Nolte's character,the harried Brit director(Steve Coogan)who probably has no business directing this project and a callous Mo-Fo of a Studio exec(Tom Cruise,receiving no billing at all and darn near stealing this show!)who regards his stars and filmmakers the way many people regard toilet paper.<br/><br/>As alluded to before,this is hardly a perfect movie,but it does have plenty of memorable lines and a savagery of the film industry that it so richly deserves. The unmitigated chutzpah of this film(it seems to have utter contempt for practically ALL of its characters)makes this alone worth catching. Worth a look,though one better know EXACTLY what they're getting into before seeing it,big screen or small."

","Some people seem to forget this is a comedy. It has it's tongue in cheek when it talks about going full retard (hilarious speech) for a movie. It is merely mocking the Hollywood lifestyle when they argue over Tivo. This is a fun look at a crazy world with an outstanding performance from Robert Downey Jr.<br/><br/>The start seems a bit patchy but it manages to pull it off, just. If there was one more trailer i think it would of been too much but due the quality of content in the trailers i wasn't too fussed.<br/><br/>It's far-fetched, it's quickly paced and it doesn't run as smoothly as other comedies.

","Hilarious! Most of the big points are pretty well spoiled by the discussions that have already gone around word of mouth and mediated, the whole ""Half-retard"" thing and Robert Downey Jr. in blackface (both profound and vulgar at the same time), plus respect given out to Tom Cruise (he did well), but yeah, good times all around. My particular favorites were the small asides, such as the take-offs of such things as celebrities adopting third-world orphans and having to work with the crew (as someone who has now managed to find his way onto a few sets, can I just say that I've met these people? Even on the tiniest of sets, you will find the special effects guy from this movie there.

I expected it to be fun but I didn't expect it to be THAT good... but it was particularly biting and profound.<br/><br/>Oh, and though everyone did a good job, Downey Jr. stole the show, here. I was absolutely mesmerized by his performance... especially once he gained the Australian accent. Hot damn that guy can act.<br/><br/>And, once again, a lot of the things that people were offended about were purposefully made fun of as offensive within the movie itself. Somehow I still manage to be surprised when people criticize something without actually making sure it actually states what they mean.

"vip_ebriega","8","1","2","25 October 2008"," The funniest movie of the post-DARK KNIGHT season.
","My Take: A hilarious and satirical affair. The best in acquired taste has to offer. <br/><br/>After a couple of fake trailers have graced the screen to start the film, I knew I was in for, not just a different comedy, but a different movie-going experience. Although the mention of Ben Stiller and Jack Black are quite like warnings to stay away and the film is released much later than it should have, TROPIC THUNDER is a riot, and that's a surprise despite all the red-herrings. This not just Ben Stiller's funniest to date (In acting or directing) or the funniest comedy in a while, it's also, so far, the best movie ever to be released in the post-DARK KNIGHT season.<br/><br/>For those who has been living under a rock for a long time (or just so recently), THE DARK KNIGHT is, undoubtedly, the biggest movie in a long time. Critics and local audiences have dug into the film (sometimes more than once) and devoured the film until after a month or two. This paved way to a series of rescheduling for many other movie releases, most of which rescheduled for next year. In the meantime, this so-called post-DARK KNIGHT season (or so I call it) is the time studios dump in most of the features they couldn't release to compete with THE DARK KNIGHT's big numbers. Regardless of a few anticipated releases (a big screen adaptation of Stephanie Meyer's TWILIGHT will be around your multiplexes by November), most of the movies released at the time are just minor efforts, meaning their not 'event' pictures. Even Hollywood needs its rest you know! So don't be so surprised not to see much long lines after opening nights and the night after. Despite a few hits, none of them are truly real 'big' movies. You can expect those sometime next year. But, in the meantime, TROPIC THUNDER will satisfy your quench for entertaining movie-going experience. It may just be the funniest movie of the summer, with one of the biggest laughs I ever had since...well, a very long time. That's because TROPIC THUNDER isn't some ordinary summer comedy. It's a clever and biting satire of the Hollywood tycoon. Although the main targets are the challenges of making war movies, it takes on apparently anything about the movie-making business. You name it: narcissistic actors, rookie directors, Hollywood's obsession with explosions and violence, event pictures, celebrity scandals, the Oscars and everything you can dig up on your Entertainment Weekly magazine and more. TROPIC THUNDER is not the first film attempting to do this job, but the good thing about it is that it doesn't do the job lazily. It doesn't just display the references, it attacks them directly. From referencing movies, quotes and celebs, TROPIC THUNDER doesn't chicken out in its assault at the Hollywood movie-making business.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller and Jack Black are at their best playing two big-shot actors in desperate need for a career change. They do so, and so much more. Steve Coogan is hilarious as the rookie film director incapable of handling the big-named actors and the heavy demands of his production studio (including Tom Cruise's effectively hilarious performance as the raunchy film exec). But in the end, Robert Downey Jr. steals the show in yet another talked-about performance as Australian Oscar-winner Kirk Lazarus, who receives dozens of controversies when he underwent surgery to play a black character in his next movie. Playing what might be one of the most offensive character ever put on screen, Downey proves once again that he's one of the screen's finest actors today. He's capable of any character that demands him to be a complete oddball.<br/><br/>I'm quit sure not everyone will apply to TROPIC THUNDER. I'm sure some might find that Stiller has pushed it too far. But to everyone else (and I mean everybody), this is the moment they've been waiting for. It's all clear folks, it's safe to be a Ben Stiller fan again.<br/><br/>Rating: **** out of 5."

Tom Cruise added some humor in the film and it took me a second to realize it was him who was playing that burly bald rich guy. It was one of his most surprising performances I've ever seen. Props on both of them. It was also a pun on making fun of themselves in a way on how spoiled some self absorbed actors actually are in real life when it comes to playing their parts in a movie. Not bad. I'll even remember some of Downey Jr's punch-lines. I'll give this an 8!"

","A few reviews of this film had said the funniest part of it was the ""mock"" trailers at the beginning, used to introduce the main characters. I thought they weren't THAT funny and began to think I mightn't enjoy the film that much. Thankfully I was wrong. The first half hour is pretty slow as the completely ridiculous plot is set up but once the action gets into the jungle it rattles along. Jokes come at you at a frequency not seen since the Naked Gun movies. Obviously they aren't all funny but I thought that most of them were.<br/><br/>I have to mention the ""re-enactment"" by Stiller's character's of one of his film roles at the ""request"" of the Thai drug gang. I was doubled over with laughter.<br/><br/>I really like Ben Stiller. You have to admire someone who makes himself look utterly ridiculous in nearly every film he's in. Jack Black and Robert Downey Junior follow Stiller's example by not having a problem looking silly. The supporting cast are also excellent. Tom Cruise goes so far against type as the movie executive you wonder is he in on the joke!<br/><br/>And even if you go to see a bald Cruise in a fat suit doing ""that"" dance during the closing credits you'll think it was money well spent.<br/><br/>There are a few comments going around that the film could be seen as offensive to African Americans of people with mental disabilities. I have a family member who is mentally disabled and the film was in no way offensive to me. I'd be surprised if African American found the Downey's character offensive as that joke is aimed the acting profession.<br/><br/>Definitely a must see!"

","Ben Stiller does terrific work as director, co-writer, co-producer, and star in this hilarious send-up of past Hollywood films dealing with the Vietnam War as well as a send-up of Hollywood in general. There are jokes in this script many movie lovers will get as well as ones only hard-core film buffs will laugh at, but it is all in good fun and it is obvious that all the actors are having a great time.<br/><br/>Stiller plays Tugg Speedman, a former action star on the downside of his career, Jack Black is a heroin addicted comic star famous for his fart movies, and Robert Downey Jr. gives the film's best performance as Kirk Lazarus, an Aussie actor who completely immerses himself in his roles, this one being an African-American platoon sergeant. Other supporting roles include Matthew McConaughey as Speedman's agent, Steve Coogan as the exasperated director, and Tom Cruise giving one of the best cameos I've ever seen as a foul-mouthed studio executive in charge of production.<br/><br/>All cameos aside, the real treasure of this movie is the huge number of jokes and spoofs being shot out left and right. They come so fast at some points it is hard to get them all. However, if you listen closely, you will get some of the big laughs and there are quite a few here. So, all in all, I think this is the funniest movie of the summer with some great acting, a lot of action, and a skin-changing performance by one of the best in the business, Robert Downey Jr. Get some."

","Ben Stiller is just an awful actor, and in this movie he demonstrates that he is an equally incompetent writer. <br/><br/>The movie is unfunny, bland, trite and poorly shot. The story makes no sense, the unraveling of the plot defies credulity, the characters are poorly developed (though they would have NOT been remotely believable even if they were fully developed) and the action sequences are boring. The Hollywood jokes don't even rise to the level of the most hackneyed cliché. Robert Downey, Jr., and Tom Cruise act as if they are cursing themselves for having agreed to do this turkey of a movie. <br/><br/>It is truly cruel and unusual punishment to sit through this ""Zoolander goes to war"" movie.

You can guess what happens next: they are suddenly faced with real problems, in the form of a Southeast Asian drug army whose bullets aren't rubber.<br/><br/>Except they are, in fact, rubber. The group magically overcomes adversity, faces their fears, and triumphs, all by virtue of that great inner strength Hollywood has given them to deal with the real world. Uh huh, sure. By halfway through the movie I had lost any inkling of sympathy for any of them. By the end I actively wanted them all to die.<br/><br/>I'm horrified and ashamed that this movie was made, presumably with a budget to match the one spent by the fictitious producers. I'm even even more aghast that it was nominated for awards. The movie is a slap in the face to anyone who has ever had to deal with real problems - tortured and killed by real death squads, been molested or abused as children, lost family members to violent crime.<br/><br/>The only way I could see this movie salvaged is if, in the final scene, Ben Stiller had actually lost the hands he only pretend-lost in the beginning.

","Considering the talents of Stiller, Black and Downey, I thought maybe this would be a movie I'd enjoy. Instead it starts off with the lowest form of early Eddie Murphy type vulgarity and proceeds downhill from there. Too many people seem to think that the use of vulgar, offensive and totally unnecessary words and phrases, is humorous, simply because they themselves get off on being morons. Downey plays the role of a black soldier to perfection, but unfortunately he plays it at the lowest level of morality, and almost reduces himself to the level of the other two scumbags, who apparently think they are above the laws of common decency. The people who allowed this movie to be made should be made aware that not all movie goers are lowlife morons of questionable character who find gutter humor attractive.

"Matt_Stevens","7","2","7","12 September 2008"," ""Tropic Thunder"" is satire of powerful and shallow Westerners--not racially stereotypical
","Having just seen ""Tropic Thunder,"" I'm surprised at the notion that it was crafted with a bias against African-Americans or Asians. In fact, it's aimed at the pretensions of a certain class of powerful and shallow people in American cinema. They've been lampooned before--the schmoozing agent, the crude type-A studio exec, the intellectual dilettante actor. This movie effectively sets 'em up and plows 'em down.<br/><br/>In ""Tropic Thunder,"" all of these characters are white, and are portrayed by white people. Robert Downey, Jr.'s Australian actor, a five-time Oscar winner who specializes in ""arty"" films, is the white-masquerading-as-black. The script makes him look like a fool at the hands of the film's one major genuine African-American character (one of the two level-headed major characters in the film), while hosing the sorts of bad token roles that African-American actors tend to get in films like this. In the end, as part of the serio-comic growth in the film's characters, Downey's actor discards his lame disguise and embraces his, uh, Australian-ness.<br/><br/>As to the Burmese in this movie, they're mainly foils. They're depicted as competent warriors (as opposed to the Hollywood poseurs). The one ridiculous aspect is their respect for Ben Stiller's character's lousy work as a mentally disabled man in a previous flop film--which is par for the course in a ribald spoof like this. The few Vietnamese in the film are hotel workers who are saddled with Hollywood prima donnas and drunken Western package tourists."
"gregmovies","7","2","7","7 September 2008"," Very fun and original
","One of the most original comedies I've seen. The basic plot sounds bizarre, and frankly, I didn't think it would work well. Thankfully, I was wrong. Tropic Thunder is one of the funnier movies of the year, and the best spoof of war films I've seen. The dialogue is hilarious and the acting is fine, with Downey turning in a particularly good performance. This movie is funny, if not hilarious, throughout. The trailers in the beginning (one of the funniest parts) felt like a great tribute to Grindhouse, rather than a rip-off. Nick Nolte, an almost unrecognizable Tom Cruise, and Mathew McConaughey are all funny in their supporting roles My only complaints with the movie are that Ben Stiller plays the same character he always does and Nick Nolte was underused. <br/><br/>Definitely a film all comedy or war fans should go see. I give this film a strong 7/10. If you liked the spoof nature of the film, try Hot Fuzz."
"jmaxstadt","8","2","7","3 September 2008"," Not just a slapstick spoof - a witty, wicked Hollywood satire
","Over-the-top movie parodies have become a genre all their own, and they come with standard expectations. You expect broad, lowbrow, mostly visual comedy, and you hope that all the big belly-laughs weren't in the trailers. You expect plenty of T&A to fill in the gaps between gags (or between gags that work) and also plenty of good times to check your watch.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is much smarter than that. It works on the movie parody belly-laugh level if that's all you want, but the gags have other gags hidden inside and budding off in all directions. There's the broad spoof that you paid to see, and there's the ""serious movie"" that's even funnier if you pay attention. Every time Tropic Thunder starts to get ""serious,"" watch for the really clever bits of satire. If a scene or an exchange between characters seems completely zinger-free, it's just barely possible that the movie is making fun - of you.<br/><br/>Because everything is fair game for satire in this comprehensive razz at Hollywood and showbiz, including the audience and its expectations. If Half-Squat and his twig Oscar got an awww out of you - they gotcha. They got the actors, they got the directors, they got the studios, they got the writers, they got every target in sight, and they got them all good. This is a movie where the more times you see it and the more you think about it, the funnier it gets.<br/><br/>I suspect this movie is even funnier to showbiz insiders. Some of the gags-within-gags are a little inside, like the discussion about how Blue Ray beat HD-DVD. But in the first place, lots of people are media-savvy nowadays, and in the second place common sense and a little thought will demystify a lot of the inside stuff. For example, it's not hard to imagine that desperate directors who risk the health and safety of their cast and crew because they're behind schedule and over budget are not beloved figures in Hollywood. It's also not hard to imagine that movie-makers don't particularly love TiVO.<br/><br/>Anyway, Tropic Thunder so well-conceived, well-written, well-directed, and well-performed that everything works whether it's inside or not. I don't care if Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey) is supposed to be Russell Crowe or a composite of several well-respected method actors. He's hilarious either way. I don't need to know which studio boss Tom Cruise is sending up to love his portrayal of a big shot whose entire job, apparently, is telling people to go f*ck themselves. I love the way the movie avoids the easy stereotype for something funnier (as with Matthew MacConaughey's agent) or plays dueling clichés one against the other (as with Nick Nolte's writer).<br/><br/>This is not an important movie. This is not a movie that will change your life. But it is a smart, well-made Hollywood satire that will keep you laughing from before it even starts (hint: don't blow off the previews when you see it) through the closing credits."

It is that kind of movie that at first sight you say that it is some other stupid spoof movie, The difference with this one is that it has an original story, and interesting plot and an all-star cast. It has lots of action and adventure and you will laugh for almost two hours. Maybe the first part of the movie is kinda slow because of all the introductions but when the real war, the movie takes a very good rhythm . The performances are great from everyone. Ben Stiller and Jack Black hilarious as always, Robert Downey is excellent, the best character of the movie.

"Movie Steve","9","2","7","30 August 2008"," A hilarious send-up of Hollywood and film-making
","This is a stark-raving hilarious film that I highly recommend. (And I may have MILD spoilers here, so be warned.) Stiller is, as usual, funny in an almost unintentional way. He fills out his character outrageously, and manages to make us forget all other characters he's played - even though a similar outlandish, Zoolander-like thread runs through them all, including this one.<br/><br/>But Robert Downey, Jr. steals this show with his portrayal of a black-face actor who is VERY into his character. The irony is that when critics first got hold of photos of him in black-face, they were outraged. Ironic, because the real black character is outraged IN THE MOVIE that the actor-portraying-actor-portraying-black man is in black-face (you'll see.) The only downside is that some of the sound is quite bad here. Downey's character whispers a lot of his lines - either that, or the sound was ""off"" a bit. Other characters are at times hard to understand. Then again, they are shouting against gunfire sometimes.<br/><br/>Jack Black was a bit weak, sadly, but he does manage to get a few great lines out while portraying a drug-addled actor going through withdrawal (though in a movie-like, almost cartoonish way, by detoxing almost immediately.) <br/><br/>The opening battle scene is almost awe-inspiring in its realism, up to a point. Some have said the movie's set-up in the beginning, and the first few minutes, are like, in a way, Saving Private Ryan and the D-Day invasion scene. Again, up to a point, when humor takes hold after ""cut"" is called on that opening scene, letting the audience in on the fact that this is a movie set, and not another fake trailer.<br/><br/>The one-liners throughout are classics. The fake movie ads that intro the characters at the start are jaw-droppingly funny."
"A_Roode","7","2","7","30 August 2008"," Fun in the Sun
","To give due credit, Tropic Thunder is reaching for the stars. It tries to satirize as much of the movie business and the Vietnam-War-film genre as it can. There are high points, such as Robert Downey Jr.'s method actor Kirk Lazarus being so wedded to the character that he can't break free -- even when it has become clearly obvious that they are no longer filming a movie -- or Matthew McConaughey's super agent Rick Peck and his obsession with TiVo. I won't mention Tom Cruise's guest role as a foul-mouthed, iron-fisted dictatorial studio head other than to wonder loudly how things are going over at United Artists.<br/><br/>Why then did I feel so unsatisfied with the movie? I liked it. I enjoyed and laughed heartily through most of the jokes. It was as if the individual jokes were all greater than the sum -- a collection of funny punch lines that are a pastiche of laughs but not a satisfyingly funny routine. Part of it is the unwieldy blending of high-concept satire and lowbrow profanity-laced rants. Swearing can be used to high effect and it plays to perfection at times in Tropic Thunder. The best example (and my favorite line from the film) is from Robert Downey Jr. who, after being asked what kind of farm he works on, mows down the bad guys with his gun and declares that ""I'm a lead farmer, mother--"" well, you see where I'm going. Initially, Tom Cruise's profanity-ridden rants are funny too. But then you realize that there isn't anything else to the character. His character, Les Grossman, just throws tantrums and screams profanities, a paper-thin joke that works through audacity but wears out after the first rant. After a while the swearing starts to sound like a group of little kids who've just heard their first bad words and think it is funny to yell them over and over again.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I loved the performances. Jack Black's focused insanity was pointed in the right direction and he got a great part that he's well-suited to. Stiller manages to play Tugg Speedman with enough vulnerability that you can buy his need for the fictional movie to be a big hit. The scenes from his critical bomb Simple Jack are priceless, as are Downey's explanation of why Speedman would never have won an Oscar for it. Nick Nolte (good to see him again) has a strong supporting part, as does Steve Coogan as the overwhelmed first-time director. The picture is Downey's, though, and wherever Redd Foxx is, I think he would be proud. Scene-stealing, scenery-chewing and utterly priceless, Downey looks like he's enjoying every minute on screen. If you see Tropic Thunder for any reason, watching Robert Downey Jr. should be it."

I've never scene him play such an over the top comic role & this was an eye opener. <br/><br/>There had been some criticism of the movie based on supposed insensitivity to mentally handicapped people, but that criticism misses the point that the offending scenes were largely a parody of how Hollywood depicts mentally handicapped people in the movies, vis-a-vis ""Forrest Gump"". Along those same lines, there was plenty for everyone to be offended by, including Vietnam Vets, Blacks, Asians, Gays, Catholics, among others.

","Tropic Thunder is a great movie for a lot of different reasons and there it is not offensive or racist, as people have been claiming. It is certainly ridiculous and over the top but I think it has to be. There are so many laugh out loud moments in this movie but it also very well thought out and intriguing.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller does a good job of acting and maybe even a better job of directing. I loved the entire cast. Jack Black is hilarious, and Robert Downey Jr. amazed me with his ability to do so many different voices and characters. I think this may actually be the only movie I've ever like Tom Cruise in but I was almost rolling on the floor laughing at most of his scenes. I also thought the story was top notch and very well thought out, especially for a comedy. This is one you won't want to miss! <br/><br/>I know the summer is almost over but you should check this movie out before it comes to a close. It is the perfect summer popcorn movie and a lot more!"

"dfranzen70","7","2","7","16 August 2008"," Sly Thunder, despite Tom Cruise
","Here's the big difference between Ben Stiller and Tom Cruise: Stiller possesses self-awareness, and Cruise does not. Oh, Cruise may attempt self-parody, but he never gives you the impression that he is aware he's making fun of himself - he seems to be saying, ""Hey, I'm an actor, look at me act!"" I've mocked Stiller many times. The guy's a ham, he's a bad actor, and his whiny, petulant behavior in almost every movie is annoying. But he does have a sense of what's funny. For example, when I popped Night at the Museum into the DVD player, I was sure it was going to be full of inept jokes and overexaggerated characterizations, and I was happily surprised, because he was the normalized center of a chaotic maelstrom.<br/><br/>And I will further admit that I had reservations about Tropic Thunder as well, since Stiller directed, co-wrote, and coproduced it. This can't end well, I thought, even with Robert Downey, Jr. and Jack Black along for the ride. But it IS good, and for an entirely different reason from Night at the Museum: Stiller, playing an overmuscled action hero, sends up not only the Rambos of the world but also his own high-maintenance, tightly wound on screen (and off) persona. He points and laughs at himself so that we may join in, and that's a level of self-awareness that only those with impeccable comic cred can pull off.<br/><br/>The story of Tropic Thunder goes like this. A director (Steve Coogan) of a big-budget Vietnam War movie, tiring of dealing with his prima donna stars (Stiller, Black, Downey, Jr.), allows the grizzled veteran (Nick Nolte) who wrote the book on which the movie is based to move the film shoot to the jungles of Vietnam, where the actors will be dropped to fight the real North Vietnamese in a prime, and punny, example of guerrilla film-making.<br/><br/>Apologies for that run-on sentence. Let me put on my Movie Voice-over Guy hat: ""They came from a world in which they held all the cards. Now they find... they're all jokers."" You can't beat Movie Voice-over Guy for plot summaries.<br/><br/>Everyone is perfectly cast. Stiller's character is coming off a series of action-franchise movies of declining quality and popularity. Black plays an Eddie Murphy clone in that he's best known for playing multiple characters in flatulence-embracing comedies. Downey, Jr. is an Australian superactor who's won five Oscars and who prepares for this movie by getting controversial pigmentation surgery to look like an African American. I know, I know, it sounds like he's dressing in black face, which is obviously and patently racist, especially in this day and age. Downey, Jr.'s Kirk Lazarus is known as a Method actor, a guy who gets deep, deep, deep into his roles, so he doesn't just walk the walk, he also talks the talk. Dude never breaks character.<br/><br/>But this isn't just a high-octane movie with pithy punchlines; it's a raunchy ensemble piece peppered with perfectly knowing, crisp dialog. Black, Downey, Jr., and Stiller all work very well together, and since they're essentially playing actor archetypes, you can easily buy what they're selling.<br/><br/>On a hugely positive note, check out the fake trailers before the actual movie of the most recent films completed by the lead actors's actors. On a hugely negative note, check out an almost unrecognizable Cruise as a studio head. Well, unrecognizable until he opens his fat (you'll see) yap. It's a completely pointless cameo that adds nothing to the film, instead distracting and detracting. I don't know who okayed his appearance here, and maybe he thought it would rejuvenate his image a little, but I hope we never have to see Tom Cruise in a fat suit again.<br/><br/>But. Leave that aside for a moment. The movie does rock out loud, as the kids used to say, and there's plenty of mayhem, and profanity, and yes, drug humor. I like movies that don't flinch, comedically, from envelope-pushing topics. Each actor plays his role to the hilt - including Matthew McConaughey as a laid-back agent - and, working in unison, they churn out a respectable, clever war comedy. Ignore the critics who say the movie is racist toward black people - it isn't - or that it's hateful toward the mentally challenged - it's not. It's easy to step over the line separating parody from mockery, and this movie dances on the line but never crosses it."

","Tropic Thunder is a 2008 action comedy film directed by Ben Stiller and starring Stiller, Jack Black and Robert Downey Jr. as a group of prima donna actors filming a Vietnam War film when their fed-up writer-director decides to abandon them in the middle of the jungle, forcing them to fight their way out.<br/><br/>What I expected from this movie was to have a good time laughing my ass off. Fortunately, it's funnier than most comedies I've seen in quite awhile. I didn't even find ""Superbad"" as funny as people made it out to be. Maybe I don't laugh as much as normal people. Unfortunately, the film didn't exceed my expectations. I expected more laughs but what can you expect? I'm just a non-laughable person.<br/><br/>But who cares if I didn't laugh as much as I expected to. I actually laughed, which must count for an accomplishment the film did. The beginning of the film starts off with faux trailers, like the ones shown during ""Grindhouse,"" so don't worry if you're not seeing the movie, even though you are seeing it. It just gives you what movies the protagonists are in.<br/><br/>Most of the laughs are close to the beginning and end and a little in the middle. The movie works as an action movie and a comedy, each actor seeming to have a fun time in their roles. I also like the fact that this movie has a lot of cameos (and when I say a lot, there is a lot) but I won't surprise you, even though there is one apparent name that is sticking out to you already.<br/><br/>Well, if you don't already know, I won't say it but if you do, you must know that after people see this movie, people would start to respect him as an actor, even though I never lost respect for this man. People will start to see him as a cool man. Like Morgan Freeman in ""Wanted,"" you'll hear and see things that this man has never done before and it's quite funny because his performance is so over-the-top.<br/><br/>It's not only him that may be the highlight of the movie, so the other is obviously Robert Downey Jr. How is he? He's very good and funny but all of you should know that by now. Everyone else in the movie also give off a few laughs, although the first two actors I've mentioned are probably the most memorable.<br/><br/>With some decent action scenes and very funny scenes, ""Tropic Thunder"" is the comedy to see this summer. One of the reason might be because of the cameos and over-the-top performances in here. Another is that this film actually made me laugh, which is an incredible feat for comedies to accomplish this year. For those reasons, I think it's a worthy admission to see it in theaters."

"MiamiHEATfan777","7","2","8","31 August 2008"," Ben Stiller Pulls It Off
","Twenty years ago, ""Tropic Thunder"" would have been too much of an insider comedy, accessible only to the most knowledgeable of Hollywood devotees. But as writer/director/star Ben Stiller has pointed out in interviews, nowadays everyone's an insider. The inner workings of show business are displayed on the Internet for the whole world to see. Savvy movie fans know about Oscar campaigns and tyrannical studio bosses and self-absorbed actors, and a movie like ""Tropic Thunder"" -- which hacks Hollywood to pieces more astutely, mercilessly, and hilariously than any satire in at least a decade -- can emerge as one of the year's best comedies without going over everyone's heads.<br/><br/>It begins with fake trailers introducing us to the fake actors in the movie. Tugg Speedman (Stiller) is an action hero who recently made an ill-advised grab for Oscar glory by playing a mentally handicapped man in ""Simple Jack"" (think Sean Penn in ""I Am Sam""). Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) is known for his flatulent family comedies in which he plays all the roles (think Eddie Murphy in everything), though his personal life is a heroin-flavored mess. And Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) is a five-time-Oscar-winning Method actor known for fully immersing himself in his characters. ""I don't read the script, the script reads me"" is one of the pretentious, nonsensical things he likes to say.<br/><br/>These three Hollywood airheads are the stars of a big-budget Vietnam epic being directed by Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan), who quickly finds that their egos and pampered lifestyles are interfering with the production. (We're told that the film is ""one month behind schedule after only five days of shooting."") The studio head, Les Grossman (Tom Cruise), a vulgar despot with hairy arms and a gold chain around his neck, is furious, demanding that Damien get the film back on track or heads will roll.<br/><br/>As it happens, Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte), the battle-scarred Vietnam veteran whose memoirs the film is being based on, is on the set as a consultant, and he has an idea for Damien: Drop the actors into a real Vietnamese jungle, with no cell phones or other comforts, and shoot the movie with cameras hidden in the trees. The Hollywood phonies' reactions to all the deprivations of war will seem a lot more real, and the actors will be forced to focus on their work.<br/><br/>Did you guess that once they've been put in the jungle, the stars encounter actual bad guys who they think are fellow actors? And that they're surprised when the villains seem to be firing actual bullets? Yes, that's the initial concept, but thankfully it isn't long before the reality of the situation becomes obvious to them and the film shifts to its new direction: the actors have to rescue Tugg from an Asian heroin factory run by a ruthless teenage warlord (Brandon Soo Hoo).<br/><br/>""Tropic Thunder"" (that's the name of the Vietnam drama they're making, too) is packed with ingenious running jokes skewering the behind-the-scenes stories that movie fans know so well. Tugg Speedman is a well-meaning but vain idiot (an area of expertise for Stiller), while Jeff Portnoy is suffering from heroin withdrawal during much of their jungle trek. Kirk Lazarus, the Method actor, is playing an African American soldier, so he has had his skin chemically darkened -- which means, yes, Robert Downey Jr. is in black-face for most of the film. And not just black-face, but black-voice, too, because Kirk Lazarus never breaks character. Heightening the tension is the fact that there's an actual black guy in the movie with them, a rapper-turned-entrepreneur named Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson) who's trying to break into acting. You may rest assured that he and Kirk Lazarus have some conversations about race.<br/><br/>The fifth member of their team is an eager young actor named Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel). Without a gimmick, this character appears to be superfluous, until you realize it's his normalcy that makes him important -- he's the straight man surrounded by crazies. Stiller and his co-writers, Etan Cohen (TV's ""King of the Hill"") and actor Justin Theroux, know comedy well enough to appreciate the importance of such a character in a loopy scenario like this one.<br/><br/>All of the supporting characters are fantastic, too (up-and-comer Danny R. McBride scores again as the production's pyrotechnics expert), and the casting is perfect. Nick Nolte as a grizzled veteran who sleeps in a tent (""Beds give me nightmares)? Matthew McConaughey as Tugg's tooly agent Rick Peck, who calls everybody by nicknames, including himself (""the Pecker"")? And Tom Cruise as the terrifyingly foul-mouthed studio head? Genius, sheer genius -- especially for Cruise, who might wipe away all the negative impressions people have had of him over the last three years with this single performance.<br/><br/>This is the first film Stiller has directed since 2001's ""Zoolander."" He's acted in some bad comedies since then, but ""Tropic Thunder"" is proof that he hasn't lost his edge, neither as a filmmaker (he's impressively disciplined here) nor as a performer. It's no surprise that Stiller, the son of Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara and a Tinseltown insider since birth, should have such keen insight into the vanities of Hollywood. His short-lived sketch series, ""The Ben Stiller Show,"" had glimpses of it. ""Tropic Thunder"" feels like it represents everything he and Downey and Black have learned in their years of making movies -- and it shows that they're self-aware enough to realize how silly the whole profession is."

","From the fake promo's at the start of the movie, I was giggling like a school girl. I even snorted at one point.<br/><br/>Stiller does the character he does best - stupid - with gusto. I love the theatric gun shooting. Jack Black plays the loud, never funny, Tom Candy character that he seems to have typecast himself into.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jnr is a true crackup and a little confusing as an Australian acting as a stereotypical black guy. Its like they put a costume on him and told him to talk like Dave Chappell impersonating Samuel L Jackson. Masterpiece stuff.<br/><br/>This movie really satires its own industry depicting drama-queen actors, yuppie agents, and ego driven typhoon movie producers against the darker, deadlier world of arms bearing drug manufacturers in a very remote dare-we-not-say-it Asian nation.<br/><br/>And if the script wasn't funny enough, a ton of action was thrown in too. Call me simple, but I love explosions.<br/><br/>Refreshingly, the movie lacked a token love interest. Thanks. Though they really made up for it with a certain repeatedly flogged product placement.<br/><br/>I didn't understand the prominence of Tom Cruise's role as the producer. I feel most of his scenes were supposed to be funny simply because he is Tom Cruise. Anyone could have acted that role. And it's not just me - I didn't hear one laugh during the end scene.<br/><br/>Movies don't get much better than this. Even my missus loved it, and she's a sook."
"dobbin-4","9","2","8","23 August 2008"," Best Comedy Of The Year And Maybe The Decade.
","Lets face it, this decade the movies are not up to the standards of the 90's, especially with comedy's, but who could expect 2 decades in a row of great films. While the 90's helped make a lot of cult teen classics, most of the straight to DVDs are just rip offs with smutty humorand the threatrecal ones are usually remakes or sequels.<br/><br/>But this film is one HELL of a relief for the movie industry. It makes fun of it with the right type of vulgarity and makes fun of themselves with a healthy porportion as well. It is a joy to see EVERY SINGLE actor playing their role with a lot of energy and bounce (Especially Tom Cruise). The movie accepts Hollywood but also makes fun of it at the same time, and the film is written so cleverly and funnily that you not once get bored through the middle of it. It really is that good.<br/><br/>To once again praise the actors, I must say this is one of the better comedy's of many of the acotrs in the film. Ben Stiller as the stuck up action guy who is convinced he is still in the movie is extremely funny, and Jack Black was funny in bits as well, but the best bit of the movie was the relationship between Alpa Chino and the Australian Actor who had a medical procedure to turn into a black man for the movie. The nerdy platoon members is good as a stand in cameo as well. As for the cameos, Tom Cruise is the best, he is offensive, crude, fat, bald and is a Jewish Movie Producer and Matthew Mcounoughey was also pretty funny as Tugg Speedmen's (Ben Stiller) Agent.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is very funny and well worth a watch. It is the first downright hilarious film at least this year (We have had funny ones don't get me wrong) and this stands far over the rest. I wish we had a comedy like this every year or so. I rate this film 87%."

","This is the kind of film where you either get it or you don't - you either are open to the maniacal absurdity of the proceedings or you're not, in which case I recommend you slink home and watch the director's cut of ""Atonement"" instead. For those who are on board, this movie will render you obscenely giddy during more than most of its running time, perhaps even levitating above your seat but you'll be laughing too effin' hard to actually notice that.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller and his co-writers manage to pull off the near-impossible here. The premise of the film is great, the movie-within-a-movie, but in the wrong hands, or rather in less inspired, less hell-bent-for-leather hands, the execution could have easily been its downfall. But Stiller & Co. are crazed enough, willing enough, and most importantly, savvy enough, to make it work from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Take the performances: everyone rocks his role, with the obvious standouts being Downey Jr as 'the dude playin' the dude disguised as another dude' (he doesn't break character, he brags at one point, until he's done the DVD commentary, you gotta admire that kinda commitment, mate); Tom Cruise, barely recognizable and absolutely hilarious as the corrupt studio clown (Cruise chose to play the part bald and paunchy, looking like a cartoon version of Jeffrey Tambor - you know, the 'hey now' guy from ""Larry Sanders"") and Nick Nolte, who just has to be on camera to illicit giddy laughs, and when he speaks, fuggedaboudit. Plus Stiller himself scores major big time here, especially when he's captured by the Viet Cong (led by Tran, played by teenager Brandon Soo Hoo, who is a riot) and forced to act out in its entirety his flop of a film, ""Simple Jack"" over and over again for their demented pleasure.<br/><br/>Can't wait to see what he comes up with next, the Stillernator, but for the time being it suffices to say that he has most definitely redeemed himself for the two overstuffed turkeys that were ""A Night at the Museum"" and the ""Heartbreak Kid"" remake. It'll do for now."
"stefanbe","8","2","8","15 August 2008"," A funny, smart action comedy from Ben Stiller.
","Ben Stiller is a funny actor who manages to create likable characters, even when playing mousy, irritable types. This reviewer's reaction to Stiller's directing efforts, however, have been less than positive. The Cable Guy was an un-even film that, despite a couple of interesting moments, started to get much too ridiculous and creepy in the third act. Meanwhile, I found his 2001 ""comedy"" Zoolander, a riff on the male model industry, to be a complete disaster failing to release a signal laugh from me. With Tropic Thunder, he finally succeeds in making a film that is smart and gives talented actors some worthy material. While Tropic Thunder is nothing more than a fun summer diversion, there is still plenty to like about it, despite its occasional flaws. Unlike Zoolander, it does not take itself too seriously or nor does it spend more time on its visual style rather than its humour. Stiller intelligently relies on more than just a one-joke premise and actually manages to make the audience care for a bunch of whiny actors. As long as he doesn't butcher this rare success with a poor sequel, Stiller the director remains on my good graces.<br/><br/>Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) is a popular action star whose attempt at dramatic acting becomes such a massive failure, he decides to star in Vietnam war epic Tropic Thunder to get back on top again. Award-winning Australian method actor Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr) is also hired to star in the film, but as a black character, leading him to have plastic surgery to make himself be the character even when the cameras aren't rolling. They are joined by Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), a flatulence obsessed comedian with a strong heroin addiction, rapper-turned-actor Alpa Chino (Brandon T Jackson) and aspiring young actor Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel). After a disastrous day on set that infuriates the film's maverick producer Les Grossman (Tom Cruise), director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) decides to shoot the whole film guerilla style in the real Vietnamese jungle. Not surprisingly, however, chaos ensures as the actors are mistaken for real soldiers and they finally have to put their wits to the test.<br/><br/>Due to his high-standing status in Hollywood, Ben Stiller has managed to procure some major actors for the film and except for one occasion, he does not rely on stunt casting as each actor does well in each part. Stiller himself is fine in the lead role, playing his usual self while still managing to poke fun at the typical action star. Jack Black manages to be his funniest here, not necessarily when parodying the obvious Eddie Murphy influence in Portnoy, but more in his random rants as a result of the lack of heroin. Brandon T Jackson and Jay Baruchel round out the troop by playing more the straight men in the house of wackos and intelligently not going too over-the-top. The stand-out in the cast is Robert Downey Jr, who parodies both the problems of extreme method acting and ethnic stereotyping that one might see in a film. Downey Jr does so well in the part of Lazarus, that once the character reverts back to his normal self, it comes as such as a shock due to how well he portrayed the African American soldier in the previous ninety minutes. Other actors would have completely gone wild with the character, yet Downey Jr is subtle enough that we start to forget that he was Tony Stark earlier this summer or Charlie Chaplin back in the early 1990's. Like his character, he truly disappears into the role.<br/><br/>Steve Coogan is a delight as the director trying to keep himself under his control and the funniest moment in Tropic Thunder involves him in a dark, but wonderfully comical way. Matthew McConaughey is also enjoyable to watch as Speedman's incredibly loyal agent. After a slump in poorly written roles, his work here becomes his funniest role since the aging hipster in Richard Linklater's Dazed and Confused. If there is a disappointment in the cast, it's Tom Cruise as Grossman. Tom Cruise is a very talented actor, but Stiller gives him material that is designed more to be funny simply because it's Tom Cruise as a balding, fat wanna-be hip-hop dancer. What could have been an interesting take on the typical studio executive mogul is wasted away on stunt casting and lousy writing. The watch-ability of his scenes are elevated thankfully because of the presence of McConaughey and Bill Hader. While watching those scenes, I wanted the film to just get back to the jungle-deserted actors. The more action-oriented scenes also lack much humour, but the performances from the actors are enough to make up for it, particularly in one moment when Lazarus has a truly worthy revelation.<br/><br/>Yet, despite the lack of humour in the aforementioned scenes, there are enough funny scenes to make for it. The fake trailers that start before the film has even started are all well-handled and truly hilarious parodies of the previews of major action sequels and serious dramatic fare vying for awards gold. The way in which Iron Man and Spider-Man are put together is a pure comedic delight. Yet, the fake previews also work well in establishing who the characters are. Celebrity scandals, perfectly placed product placements, the questionability of the ""true story"" label and actors playing handicapped roles are also skewered with intelligent vigor and done in funny ways. Overall, Tropic Thunder is nothing more than a funny action comedy aimed at making people laugh and it certainly succeeds in that regard."

Are there no ethical and moral sensitivities in Hollywood? Having a white Jewish actor in black face (like Al Jolson) is just so out-of-step with today's world, although writer/director Benjamin Stiller obviously thought that it was hilarious. Are Americans suppose to settle for this kind of abusive entertainment, while the offenders become wealthier and more brazen? Blacks should be particularly outraged.

","Back when ""Tropic Thunder"" came out, it was part of the press that Robert Downey Jr. was playing a black man - that, is, playing an uber-serious actor submerging himself in the role of a black character (complete with skin pigmentation surgery). And that brand of multiple abstractions kicks up my admiration for that guy. What wasn't part of that press was who was playing Les Grossman, the sociopathic studio boss who hijacks the movie with his foul-mouthed douchebaggery. He's the movie's secret weapon, and everyone (myself included) did a double-take when they realized it was Tom Cruise in bald cap and padding. He's completely against type here and so buried in the role that believing who that is feels like a tall order.<br/><br/>That's what makes this movie so funny: it goes there. Always out-of-bounds and going for broke. And the humor is constantly riffing on the movie industry (I imagine all the tropes are covered); it's always absurd but feels so spot-on in its satirical jabs. There's just something deranged about all of this. There's a lot of shaking your head in disbelief at what goes on here, but it's also more fun than it probably should be.<br/><br/>7/10"

I recommend not watching it around/with kids or (grand) parents because of the language but other than that this is a must watch!Even Robert Downey Jr playing an AA man is forgiven because the content in which is was done. It's obvious his character is an insult to Hollywood in relation to who they assign roles to, regardless of essential details taken into account.

","If you don't know anything about Hollywood then this film is poor. American over the top gags are lost on a sophisticated English audience.

Quite unnecessary bad language and pyrotechnics when what was needed was real humour, decent script and more typical Ben Stiller comedy.

","This movie is brilliant and funny on many levels, and its one of the few comedies i can watch over and over and not get bored of. For one, i'm not usually one who likes Ben Stiller movies but he was actually pretty good in this one. The best acting by far was Robert Downey Jr. who's practically unrecognizable but a riot all the way through. Playing an Australian actor who's playing a black soldier, who's criticized by the other black actor for being far too stereotypical who can't recognize he's basically a walking stereotype himself. And then there's the whole identity crisis he and Stillers characters go through, just great. The characters in this movie are awesome, especially Tom Cruise who plays a character so off the vein of his typical roles but totally nails it. I think he should play corrupt assholes more often, it may be my favorite role from him yet. The dysfunction between everyone is just comedy gold, and they fail to make a movie so perfectly that it just spirals out of control.<br/><br/>Oh and did i mention this is all happening in the middle of Asian territory run by heroin growing drug overlords? Trust me, just watch it. You won't be disappointed."
"Horst_In_Translation","8","1","3","6 October 2013"," Never go full retard
","Let me begin by saying that I'm usually not the greatest fan of Robert Downey jr. and Jack Black and never really cared much about Stiller either. Of course I knew that Downey was nominated for an Oscar for this one, but my expectations really weren't too high. Which definitely proved a great approach as I was completely surprised by how funny it all was. Of course, it's politically incorrect (drug addicts, gays, blacks, mentally disabled all get their fair share) all the time, but that was the basis for some of the best jokes this film delivered. Having grown into quite a fan of Steve Coogan recently, the first 25 minutes or so were the highlight for me. It went a bit down afterward, but was still really good. If it had stayed that way till the end, I may have given a rare perfect score even. Most of the supporting cast gave pretty decent performances as well, most of all Tom Cruise as a ruthless TV magnate or Nick Nolte and Bill Hader who made the most of the little he had to work with. Admittedly I'm not so sure how Cruise's performance holds up on rewatch as it was really more shock value than brilliant acting, but nonetheless his attention to detail created quite an iconic character.<br/><br/>I usually like motion pictures that can be described as ""film on film"" and if they have so many spoof references about famous movies, it can make for a damn fine watch. My favorites were for example the scene very early about the ""death"" of Stiller's character and Downey is right above him mourning. Completely hilarious. Another highlight were Jack Black's werewolf references, especially when he's tied and all the stuff he says to get somebody to free him and, last but not least, Stiller as Simple Jack. Okay, the final scene at the Oscars could have been funnier, but at least they got a nice cameo out of Jon Voight.<br/><br/>I would disagree with the Academy Awards that Downey was the big standout from the film and the only aspect worthy of a nomination. It was an incredibly smart and, on many occasions, hilarious screenplay and included an ensemble cast performance that did it justice. Very much recommended and easily one of the best comedies, if not films, from 2008."

","Ben Stiller directs and stars in ""Tropical Thunder"", an unfunny comedy which undertakes the pointless task of parodying poker-faced Vietnam and Reagan era war films (""Platoon"", ""Hamburger Hill"", ""Rambo"", ""Commando"" etc), most of which have already been rendered unintentionally silly by time.<br/><br/>The only member of Stiller's cast to elicit giggles is actor Robert Downey Junior, who has fun playing an Australian method actor tasked with becoming an African American grunt (most of the jokes in the film are similarly self-reflexive). <br/><br/>The rule for comedies is, the higher the budget and the more prevalent the special effects, the lamer the comedy. Few super expensive comedies break this law.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, mega-star Tom Cruise has a bit part as a balding, fat man. Like all the ""comedy"" in the film, it's a one note joke which aims low and overstays its welcome. Bizarrely, the film is guilty of exactly that which it parodies, Stiller's film far too long-winded, too preoccupied with plot, cinematography, star personas and special effects.<br/><br/>3/10 â€“ Worth no viewing."
"gigan-92","9","1","3","30 December 2009"," Possibly One of the Best Comedies of 2008!!
","Damn, 2009 has two contenders for best comedies of the year!! This is surprisingly pulled off largely due to Ben Stiller, who wrote, directed, and yes, duh, starred in a leading role. What we get is somewhat a parody of Hollywood and its stars today, especially with the first few opening scenes; which includes the film's highlight (lol), a advertisement for a energy drink vividly named ""Booty Sweat"". Effin hilarious!! The entire time this movie is rolling you will be dying with laughter. It's just that funny.<br/><br/>Though is also due to the fact that we have mainstream actors, who usually see in dramas and action flicks, starring in rather ridiculous roles. Such as Robert Downey Jr. ""who's playin' a dude pretending to be another dude who's actually another dude."" Lmao, but still, he's an Australian actor who went as far as to get surgery in order to play a black character, a gig he holds up till near the climax of the film. Others such as Tom Cruise, Matthew McConaughey, and Nick Nolte also star. This is one of the most star studded comedies you'll ever see.<br/><br/>The comedy regulars also appear, of course, what would the film be without Jack Black, in the film a crack addict of all things. Also is Danny McBride, who also starred in ""Pineapple Express"". This film is nowhere near as violent as Seth Rogen-and-James Franco duo but nonetheless has some decent action in it. It seems these days directors believe audiences would like an overall mixing of action and comedy, which to me is all good. And the audiences don't seem to mind either. In the end I seem to favor ""Pineapple Express"", but don't get me wrong, this film is definitely not one to miss either."
"dromasca","5","1","3","28 September 2009"," when the director dies first
","Funny things can happen when the director dies first while filming a movie. One thing for example would be that nobody believes the death is real, as it happens with the gang of failed actors parachuted in the South East Asia jungle while filming a Vietnam war action film, which will have to face real nowadays drug traffickers with their dubious acting skills as only means of survival. The result can be as in real cinema a blessing, a catastrophe, or something in the middle.<br/><br/>'Tropic Thunder' is that thing in the middle. It's a funny idea.The film starts with a previews-like generic which is one of the best I have seen recently. It gathers a team of comic actors (Stller, Downley Jr., Black) that would each be able to carry a comic film by themselves. It includes one of the best cameo appearances that I have ever seen.<br/><br/>And yet ... it is the supporting stuff that does not really work and does not connect well. The too many cinema associations and quotes are lost in the sound of explosions and gunshots. The irreverence of the politically incorrectness is expected. The too many changes of face and faith of the characters result in eventually having us not caring really too much about them. It's still a fair entertainment, not too funny but not completely failing easy. For Ben Stiller the director, if he wants to cross the line and stay behind the camera more often he needs to design more carefully the emotions of his other characters, or he simply needs to get even more crazy."
"tomcantwell","9","1","3","26 September 2009"," The next level
","This is a brilliant piece of work. A comedy/parody that actually emulates at the level of its source material. Ben Stiller has clearly done his homework and here recreates many epic battle scenes. The photography is stunning and the direction is nothing less than awesome, for the first twenty minutes or so. Although the movie loses direction a little in the second and third acts it has enough great script and sheer momentum that it never falls below excellent. This really is a stunning piece of work. Look at what else is out there. This is constantly funny but also technically brilliant and very artistic. There are no 'longeurs' and every scene moves the action forward. The performances are spectacularly good. Tom cruise still looks slightly too 'Tom Cruise' but his lines are almost perfect. As a whole his part is 1000 times better than in that defecant Magnolia. Robert Downey Jr is almost embarrassingly good. He plays Bill Cosby playing an actor in a movie, but then he slips into a stereotype of all 'our favorite' Black actors. He is challenged by the one real Black guy and this scene serves to show that he is an actor, playing an Australian actor who is trying to play a Black American. Ther are too many other outstanding features to mention, such as the child general and Jack Black's best work in years. All in all, this is not a mainstream movie. It is Something Else."

Why they all appear in this piece of crap is anyone's guess; I think Stiller probably paid them well. Obviously a huge budget here. It will appeal to the same crowd of morons who still think Saturday Night Live is hilarious. Boring plot, tired jokes, lukewarm satire and run of the mill slapstick run rampant through this turd.

"Boba_Fett1138","8","1","3","21 March 2009"," Really one of the best and most original comedies of this decade,
","Modern comedies are starting to get a bit tiresome and it's often simply too much of the same. ""Tropic Thunder"" really is not like that and takes an original approach to the genre, with a great original story and a dream-team of actors.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller movies are often too much Ben Stiller movies, which means that the movies focus and rely too much on him. Not that he's bad, on the contrary really but it's also a bit tiresome, especially now days, when he appears in in the main role in comedies, two times a year, or so. Thank goodness that in this movie he is being supported by some truly fine actors, of which some of them really aren't that likely that appear in a comedy. I'm of course talking about Robert Downey Jr., who simply is just brilliant in this movie. It wasn't just for nothing that he received an Oscar nomination for his role in this movie. He really deserved it. Also unexpectedly great is Tom Cruise. He once proofs to be more than just a great actor, who can handle different genres easily. The movie further more stars fine actors such as Jack Black, Nick Nolte and Matthew McConaughey.<br/><br/>It's a movie that's simply greatly being written and directed. It more picks the approach of a serious big multi-million Hollywood production, which enhances the movie being an Hollywood-satire even more. If you're a bit familiar with movie-making and everything surrounding it you'll find the movie to be even more funny and amusing that the average person.<br/><br/>It's also not a lame comedy, with lame jokes and such but it's actually a quite clever movie, that is greatly written. It's not a comedy that constantly tries to make you laugh but it's being more subtle with its humor but yet not without it's typical modern comedy touches to it. Some people might find this movie to be less funny than if got advertised as but its humor is simply just more in its little things and the pompous and over-the-top way this movie got made in.

"TxMike","Null","1","3","18 February 2009"," A silly Ben Stiller movie with lots of vulgarity, but funny if you are in the right mood.
","Let me admit up-front that I am tired of movies which feature non-stop vulgarity and dirty sexual references, and this movie has all that. In my opinion that keeps it from being a superb movie. But if you can ignore that, there are some very entertaining parts.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller is the writer, director, and star, but the best performances are by two other actors.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. is award-winning Australian actor Kirk Lazarus. For his role in this movie, Tropic Thunder, which relives the daring rescue of soldiers in the 1960s Viet Nam, he underwent a controversial skin coloration procedure which made him look like a black man. So within this movie Downey plays several roles in fake trailers which introduce the character at the beginning of the movie, then he plays a black soldier, and then he plays a blue-eyed, blond Australian. He does all of it well, showing why he is one of the best actors today.<br/><br/>In a definite supporting role Tom Cruise is bald, slightly portly, and irreverent producer Les Grossman. Back in the states, while the movie crew encounter cost overruns in Viet Nam (actually filmed in Hawaii), Les is on the video phone reading them the riot act. At one point, angry at the director for having the cameras off during a very expensive jet bombing run, he tells one assistant to go over and punch the director in the face. He does! Matthew McConaughey is also good in his supporting role as Rick Peck, one of the agents. When his man, who he also considers his best friend, gets captured by real Viet Cong and imprisoned, he has to weigh the cost of rescuing him against the promise of a new airplane that Grossman made him.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller is Tugg Speedman, who has had some flops recently and needs to get back in the public favor with a hit. He is depending on this movie.<br/><br/>Jack Black is Jeff Portnoy, sort of a white parody of Eddie Murphy who makes the fat family movies and plays all the parts. Portnoy makes fat family movies where everyone passes gas.<br/><br/>Nick Nolte has a good role as Four Leaf Tayback, who wrote the book that Tropic Thunder is based on. Only later the actors and crew find out that Tayback never served in Viet Nam and his whole story was a fabrication.<br/><br/>So the whole movie is about their trying to make the movie after the director is blown up after stepping on an old French land mine. While they think they encounter Viet actors with guns shooting blanks, they actually encounter Viet enemy running a large scale drug business, shooting real bullets, and trying to kill or capture them."

This is almost as bad as 'Night of The Running Man', and believe me, you do not want to go THERE... Not even remotely as funny as it is purported to be. Ben Stiller maybe the new Steve Martin, but not in a good way. Don't get me wrong, Ben has talent, as witnessed - in my humble opinion - in 'Meet The Parents' and 'Meet The Fockers'. Robert Downey Junior is on extremely dodgy ground here, although strangely enough he is the best thing in the movie by a mile, which is saying something, and Jack Black - what the heck was he thinking. Come on guys - you can do better than this - how about reading your scripts and not just assuming, 'cause it's written and directed by a comedian, it will be funny..."
"Baldrick44","8","1","3","20 December 2008"," A perfectly fine comedy that does the job.
","Tropic Thunder is not your regular comedy. Nor is it your regular Ben Stiller comedy. Sure, it is crass and offensive at times but it also is massive and dripping with pyrotechnics and an all-star cast.<br/><br/>The basic plot revolves around three Hollywood archetypes- the fading action hero ( Stiller ), the comedian whose looking for some dramatic cred ( Black ) and the critically adored method actor ( Downey Jr. ) who are all participating in one of the most over budget and bloated productions- so much so that the production company threatens to shut the director ( Steve Coogan ) down. Said director though gets an idea from the eccentric author ( Nick Nolte ) who inspired said movie and takes the cast out into the jungle to shoot the footage 'guerilla style', inadvertently tumbling across the Golden Triangle in the process.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder could have been a real controversial flop- the film alludes to people with learning difficulties and blackface makeup, but the film manages to tread a line between bad taste and satire that works OK for the most part. Stiller and Black offer up performances that are not particularly new, but are suited to their parts. But it is Robert Downey Jr. as Kirl Lazarus, the Australian Award Winner, who really makes the film come alive. Some of his lines are truly hilarious and he delivers them with such verve that you can't help but laugh. Couple this with great cameos from Tom Cruise as a studio head Les Grossman and Bill Hader as his sycophantic assistant and you can forgive Black and Stiller for acting a little flat.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is by no means a perfect movie but it is highly entertaining and fun."
"gregopego12","9","1","3","16 December 2008"," incomplete but clever
","For starters, the movie starts out really well, and I won't say any more about that. However, the story starts to drift about forty minutes in, and it seemed like a long movie. I actually fell asleep during the climax but did wake up in time to see the end. And, I did not see any of the extras. There were pacing problems, and, at times, you wonder if the production had a director with a single vision. Ben Stiller and company kind of improvise a story around the making of a war movie based on a soldier's experience in Vietnam. When the actors start fighting, and wreck the director's schedule and budget, the technical adviser (Nick Nolte with a couple of years of grit on him) suggests they move production to a part of 'nam infested with real drug traffickers and shoot the movie ""guerilla style."" The director agrees, and drops the crew off to ""act"" against real danger. Unfortunately, the narrative isn't strong enough once it leaves the confines of the broken Hollywood production.<br/><br/>It simply isn't strong story telling. If this movie had been released during the height of Vietnam war movies, that problem would be incredibly obvious. So, without a strong story, the acting alone must sustain the comedy, and, sometimes, it doesn't. Also, some parts are downright disgusting. Tom Cruise's bombastic producer character and Robert Downey Jr.'s character are given too much to do, and Jack Black is sort of left in the background. Sure, they're funny, and they are given some really good material. There are good cameos, and the ""bad guys"" offer some brief moments of humor. There are some good digs at the ""actor playing soldier,"" but few of them are truly funny. Most of the problems could have been fixed if Jack Black's character had as much depth as Downey Jr.'s. Maybe, he should have been the ""butt kickin'"" sergeant. There's a lot of byplay (usually involving Downey Jr. against anybody). It has it's moments, but it does leave you wanting more. Perhaps, the extras can fix that."

","As an actor, Ben Stiller is a disappointment. Every movie he has starred in is simply a clone of his previous works (""Something About Mary"" & ""Meet The Parents"" being perhaps the most obvious ones). Even his numerous cameo appearances share this trait. So what can you expect from a movie that not only stars Stiller, but is also directed, written and produced by him. And, as if the bar isn't already set low enough, he even got Jack Black involved. Well, as expectations weren't too high, I'd have to say I was pretty convinced. ""Tropic Thunder"" isn't all that bad, and at times, it's even good.<br/><br/>""Tropic Thunder"" is clearly a parody and a satire, but not in the traditional Scary Movie/Hot Shots-sense, where every scene is a cheaply done comic version of a previous blockbuster hit (although there are a few clear references to earlier Vietnam movies here). And neither is it a cleverly done Hot Fuzzish parody. It's rather something in between, where the movie itself is just so ridiculous, silly and cheap that, at times, it works. And while most of the elements are perhaps a tad bit overdone or overused, some steal the show completely. I'd say the saving grace here is Robert Downey Jr. and Nick Nolte, two guys who generally said, really deserve credit for their works. ""Tropic Thunder"" may not be the first movie featuring movie-within-a-movie elements (faux product placements, actors and trailers), but it does bring out some new focal points and laughs. It's not a clear winner, it's not Movie of The Year, but it does fulfill it's primary mission: it's two hours of fun."

When will the game come out? I gave this an ""8.5"" because I laughed at something in every scene. Be sure to watch the special features on the DVD for some great background on the film."
"rparham","8","1","3","27 November 2008"," Tropic Thunder a hilarious satire of Hollywood
","Ben Stiller is a pretty funny guy, in case you weren't aware of this. Whether working on his own short-lived sketch comedy series to starring in films for the Farrelly Brothers to directing and starring in his own theatrical productions, Stiller does not disappoint. So, it is no surprise that his most recent directorial turn, Tropic Thunder, is a pretty funny movie. A satire of Hollywood and war movies, Tropic Thunder delivers the laughs in spades and proves to be one of the funniest movies of 2008.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder features a film in production based on a true life story by ""Four Leaf"" Tayback (Nick Nolte), the survivor of a major Vietnam war battle who lost his hands in the process. The film is being headlined by down-on-his-luck action star Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), method actor extrordinaire Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey, Jr) and drug-addled comedy star Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), each of which is proving intolerable to work with for director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan). <br/><br/>After being threatened to be shut down by a studio executive, Cockburn is given a bit of inspired advice from Tayback: take the actors into the jungle with just the director and shoot the film documentary style. There is one problem with this plan: the jungle they land in is controlled by drug growers who take some of the actors hostage, leaving the others to formulate a plan to save their comrades, while fighting their own lack of real world skills and prima donna attitudes.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is a film that, for the most part, isn't afraid to skewer some major Hollywood troupes. The ridiculousness of some method actors, the sense of entitlement by major stars, the desire for directors to make a major ""statement"", the willingness of agents to go to extremes for their clients and finally, the over-the-top, do my bidding attitude of ""mega"" producers, Stiller and fellow screenwriters Justin Theroux and Etan Coen leaves few stones unturned in their search for things to satirize. Most of the jokes hit home, providing an abundance of laughs.<br/><br/>The screenplay is helped in large measure by it's actors, especially Robert Downey, Jr, Jack Black and Tom Cruise. Downey, Jr's turn as Kirk Lazarus is absolutely hilarious, portraying a man who gets cosmetic procedures to darken his skin so that he can portray an African American member of the original military squad. Like behavior that is reported about many method actors, Lazarus refuses to break character at all, always acting as if he is an African American. The results are side- splitting at times, and Downey, Jr, experiencing a resurgence in his career, delivers a knock out performance. Black uses his usual manic energy to good effect as Portnoy, who finds himself trapped in the jungle with no drugs and quickly going through a rather tough withdrawal. But, the show is completely stolen by Tom Cruise as producer Les Grossman. Covered in makeup and a fat suit, Cruise brings the foul-mouthed, hip-hop dancing producer to life to great comic effect. While Cruise has a smaller part, when he is on the screen, you largely can't help but crack up laughing.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is not for everybody: it is filled with a decent amount of violence and gore, and is laced top to bottom with vulgar language, so if you are easily offended, Tropic Thunder is not going to be for you. But if you appreciate a smart satire of modern Hollywood, you don't have to look any further than Tropic Thunder."
"the-ortivator","8","1","3","3 November 2008"," New original comedy
","Do not expect it to be better than Zoolander. Tropic Thunder has, still, great humorous scenes, great acting and a nice script. It guarantees to raise some new laughs and keep you interested in the plot.<br/><br/>Despite of a (in my opinion) misuse of Jack Black's skills as a comedian (I think he was put on there just to get some more attention on the film), the acting is marvelous. Robert Downey Jr. takes most of the acting credits with a great performance (actually it's like a triple or quadruple performance) although Ben Stiller keeps his popularity and main role. I expected this movie to be full of dumb typical jokes and the same old comedy-like character disposition, but it really surprised me, right from the beginning. Funny scenes just come up naturally, not forced nor absurd. I believe it could set some new kind of comedy standard. Worth watching."
"david_ben_park","Null","1","3","18 October 2008"," Not Funny - A Fair Appraisal
","Behind Hollywood's cameras are legions of underpaid helpers doting on pampered mega-celebrities. Egos and budgets have become so inflated that much of the screen time once devoted to the dynamic relationship between an actor and his role have been replaced by product ads, staid repetition and computer generated doo-dah's. As such, much of the grittiness of early cinema is being gradually reduced to a strict regimen of movie-making by numbers. And, by now, what the average member of the public is often exposed to upon an innocent trip to the cinema is the mass-market mass-murder of an entire art form  at a cost of £8 a go! To determine who is responsible for this you need look no further than the mega-celebrities themselves. This is partly why I found Tropic Thunder so detestable. I enjoyed this expose on the vanity & shallowness of Hollywood by those who are perpetrating it as much as I would a lecture on cultural diversity as conducted by a member of the Third Reich.<br/><br/>Those who haven't yet seen the film and merely want a light, comical romp written by and starring a few funny guys will also be disappointed. I'm afraid the film fails to deliver even on this front. The scenes involving Tom Cruise go beyond being simply unfunny or cringe-worthy to the point whereby funnier men, perhaps those long since dead, would be sickened by or turning in their graves as a result of them. I would suggest that even the stars of the movie should, by all rights, have made themselves feel a little queasy.<br/><br/>It's not that there are no funny jokes in the film  it's just that all 3 of them get lost in a jumble of film making where the ability to suspend belief just isn't enough. Ben Stiller is OK in the movie, as is Jack Black. They are too eminently likable to deride and seem more like they belong in this movie than the others. Although this is coming from a man who never saw 'Envy,' which may be so awful as to nullify my generosity towards them.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the character played by Robert Downey Jr is catastrophic - despite Downey's valiant effort at making the rotten role work. For those who don't know, he is essentially a modern day minstrel (white guy 'blacked-up') who has grown proud of his elective-surgery-altered skin colour - rather unconvincingly so to those who are of that skin colour by birth. This is a mechanism often used in films for some cheap comedy, and a technique that worked rather well - for a time. It was hilarious in Airplane when the old lady talked jive, for example. But the art of it 'being funny when a white person spoke like a black person' died a horrible death, or at least was beaten to a bloody pulp, when Steve Martin starred in the reprehensible 'Bringing Down the House.' And if there was any doubt as to the damage done by Martin, then watching Tom Cruise also decide to dance like a black person is where that debate draws to an emphatic close. It just isn't funny.<br/><br/>Nor, for that matter, is Steve Coogan, who should know far better. Nor is Matthew McWhoever  who's odd, surplus character is a vacuous Hollywood agent who goes to a war-zone over a Tivo dispute (and somehow escapes on foot where the leads of the film barely made it with a head-start and a helicopter.) Nor is the explosives expert who comes across as a caricature of a caricature of a Kevin Smith/Napoleon Dynamite style 'dude' character who's role would be cut-down to one line during the editing process. Nor is the guy playing the rapper who isn't a natural comedian and seemingly shouldn't be an actor. Nor is the joke about Booty Juice - and even less so it's continual usage. Not even comical is the laughable choice of casting a child as the main 'bad guy.' Just after his miniature silhouette arrived on screen I was plunging two fingers down my throat in a vain attempt to purge the newly-acquired badness from the pit of my soul.<br/><br/>But on a lighter note, there are two things about this movie I do like. 1/ The bit where Jack Black says, ""Ouch, my ass!"" 2/ The fact that next to running time it didn't say 'Eternity.' In conclusion, if a friend asks you to go see Tropic Thunder with him, just look at him, dead in the eyes for as long as it takes - ignoring his appeals that you look away or respond - until he becomes so uncomfortable with the morbid atmosphere that he will be left with no choice but to eventually mutter under his breath, in a defeated whisper, ""guess not then"""
"RResende","Null","1","3","14 October 2008"," Acting actors who act actors
","I must confess i'm not a great admirer of Ben Stiller. Even though sometimes he finds interest concepts to explore in the films in which he is more actively involved (as writer above all), his own performances strike as relatively ordinary, despite effective, and that passes me the impression of being watching a minor actor.<br/><br/>Well, not here. Not at all. Here he embraces a reflection and a deconstruction of what an actor does, and essential what may mean to be an actor. A film about acting, where actors act several roles, one over the other in some cases. I like this material. In this ride to the jungle of actor constructions, he takes Downey Jr. Casting him is one of the most intelligent things here.<br/><br/>So we have a group of actors who move to the jungle to shoot a film. Along the way, due to a series of events, they eventually take 'real' locations for sets, and 'real' people for actors. They keep on acting, even when they know they're no longer in the reality of the film within the film we are watching. Maybe they're acting for us.<br/><br/>The writer of the film within the film is himself an actor performing a role he invented for himself. We come to know that as we find out he is a fake, and invented the whole plot of the film within. What everybody in the film we're watching takes as real events is in fact fiction the fake supposedly handless writer creates. So he also creates the places every actor on the film within will perform. In that film everybody acts differently and over posed roles: Stiller is trying to outdo himself, so he tries to grab the main role which would naturally (in the reality we are given) belong to the 'star' Downey Jr. Eventually he comes to find a star role in an improvised stage. Stardom is his theme, and the motivator of his acting.<br/><br/>Downey Jr is the most interesting and more complex character, for the own construction in the screenplay and for his own deepness as an actor. He is an Australian actor, blond and blue-eyed. We know Downey Jr as a public figure and he is not like that at all, so we get him acting right here. In the film he dies is skin black, changes his hair and eye color to look black, afro-American urban black. This is another role, representing a certain stereotype who actually acts all the way, whenever they perform they're urban character. The plot also has a real black guy who has frictions with Downey Jr for him to act like a black guy without being one when in fact they both act that part, latter on we'll have a glimpse at the real sensitive gay personality of the real black guy. The comedy is in this contradiction between both characters.<br/><br/>Jack Black is the most straightforward character. Also the most uninteresting to me. That's because his acting is only as a 'public' personality in the reality of the film we are watching. An idol to child and teen audiences who actually is an addict to drugs, and a fully uninteresting character in his real life. It's a version of Groening's Krusty, the clown. Black has a great potential for comedy and for playing interesting games with it, petty that couldn't come out here.<br/><br/>A discreet yet interesting character is the one Baruchel performs. That's because he is the only one who doesn't perform in the mad reality of the jungle. He knows where he stands, he doesn't enter the hallucinating world the others embrace to the point of mixing they're own personalities, and probably that's why he is, in the film, the weakest actor. He acts to get laid, no special relation to it.<br/><br/>All this mad, beautiful playing with actors who play characters who play characters who... is well framed in the beginning and in the end by the 'celebrity' reality of those actors. This is underlined by the Oscar ceremony where the film we watch ends, and for all the gossip and past lives of those actors we come to enter to a certain extent. The beginning gives us a number of false trailers of films where the actors have starred. Cameos like that of Tobey Maguire establish the credibility of this. The film starts with no credits, and we are given those trailers as if they were in fact part of the trailers we see in theaters always before the film we're expecting. I loved the detail.<br/><br/>For the first time since Magnolia, Tom Cruise acts. He was not announced, or very little mentioned in the promotion of this tropic thunder, and that was intended for us to be surprised. Double surprise. Not only he is there, he is also 'not' there. He is acting... that's a surprising little account on the 'actors who act' theme. He is vibrant, he really is funny because we wouldn't expect him to do everything he does. It was a pearl.<br/><br/>I suppose American audiences will appreciate the fun made around goofing with australians and English characters. i'm out of it.<br/><br/>I mark this with my higher mark, though it may change based on future viewings of the film and, mostly, how it will accommodate in my mind. I just found it so intelligent and well executed, i think it deserves the place.<br/><br/>My opinion: 5/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"
"Dysania90","9","1","3","11 October 2008"," Look at the cast...
","Well first of all as you can see in the title just look at the cast. The reason for this is because it has a brilliant cast. Top actors having small parts, and nails them. I'm not going to point out all of them but Tom Cruises character, which haven't much screen time but despise this is a brilliant character and Cruise is perfect for the role.<br/><br/>I felt this movie is a dear movie to Ben Stiller and this is because he has put so much effort in to it. He is the director, writer, producer and so on. I can honestly admit i find his kind of movies extremely fun to watch, although some of them are very shallow. This however has a little dept to it, and intelligent humor well hidden under childish humor. This you just have to love.<br/><br/>I looked very forward to see this movie, because of the fuzz, trailer and most of all crew and actors. And when you see a movie with high expectations its easy to be let down. This movie did everything but let you down. It is hilarious. And I have to say Robert Downey Jr. does an excellent part and I'm afraid he outshine the other actors being that this is unlike him, and the part is hard to do. This shows a totally different side of him which is fun to watch.<br/><br/>Now to say it all very easy. Extremely fun movie with a brilliant cast. If you want to see a good comedy where you'll laugh a lot this is definitively for you. And if you like to make fun of Hollywood then you HAVE to see the movie. Comedy is hard to make good, but Ben Stiller did this job good. See the movie 8/10"
"TheTwistedLiver","6","1","3","24 September 2008"," Decent comedy, a couple of laughs.
","Perhaps I was expecting too much from this comedy. Ben Stiller films can be funny when done well, ""The Cable Guy"" ""Zoolander"" ""Reality Bites"" etc. but this one tried to beat the same jokes over and over. Pretty predictable and kind of boring towards the end. The best laughs came in the start of the film with the Mach previews, but then the jokes form the beginning were recycled over and over. I'm not sure if this film was trying too hard or not hard enough. Tom Cruise has a comedic turn as ""Les Grossman"" the billionaire backing the film, and the scenes with him dancing were pretty funny. All in all, not worth ten bucks, but probably worth renting on Netfix or watching on cable if you are really stoned."

","I don't want to give to much away about this movie, I know that sounds weird about a comedy but in this case it's true. Some of the films most laugh out loud hilarious moments are surprises, things you wouldn't have expected just from seeing the trailer. I am so glad that is the case because so many comedies lately have been ruined by their funniest moments being in the trailer. With all that out of the way, this is a entertaining movie, a lot of that is due to the quality of Robert Downey Jr., he is without a doubt the most underrated actor in the main stream today. Sure this movie does not really give him a chance to really stretch his legs but he does bring his quality of acting to a genre that most dramatic actors dare to go. At times this film is really aimed at movie buffs, so of course I love that, all the little references or shots stole from other movies. Sometimes it takes movies like this to realize how overly dramatic certain other movie moments really are. Bottom line on this one is this, this film was not all I had hoped it would be but maybe my hopes were a little high, it's not often that I am excited to see a new comedy in theaters, so when I was maybe I expected a little to much. This film has many hilarious moments, many memorable lines, and some great surprises. Compared to most straight up comedies this is definitely a step above all the rest."

","A critic's life is fairly simple, honestly it is. You complain about something that everyone else likes, support your opinion with more opinions, be the louder individual, boast the fact that you have seen more movies, then call it a day. Repeat process for all eternity. Hollywood needs to be ridiculed right about now with all that is going on in terms of its business, politics, beliefs, and decisions, and this movie pushes all the right buttons, becoming a movie for the critics described in the first epic sentence. Nobody in Hollywood is safe as movies, celebrities, decisions, and all aspects of Hollywood are dissed, spoofed, and is the subject of all the smaller inside jokes that movie critics would understand while the general public would pass off as mere dialogue. Meshing in the smart-aleck anti-Hollywood humor is enough action, visual gags, and one-liners to entertain the wider audience. Tropic Thunder is hilarious, and the more you've seen from Hollywood, the funnier it shall be. This movie exposes nearly all the silly shenanigans of Hollywood.<br/><br/>The story in the movie is its biggest downfall whiles the entire cast, spillage of cameos, and visual jokes more than make up for the pratfall of a tale that is delivered. While some roles were not written well, the actor portraying him saves it from being a total meltdown. Whatever directing miscues by Stiller become apparent, the cast is right there with the next witty one-liner. It is a wild ride from start to finish.<br/><br/>A group of actors, the action star trying to regain fame (Ben Stiller), the Oscar hog (Robert Downey Jr. in an Oscar-worthy role), the prankster trying to break out of typecasting (Jack Black, underused), the rapper-turned-actor (Brandon T. Jackson) and the film buff (Jay Baruchel), are sent to a secluded part of Vietnam so they can save the filming of a true story. However, in a series of freak events, they are forced to become the soldiers they are becoming in the flick. The five of them have to team up to survive the onslaught of enemies, despite their differences in personalityand acting. Yes, the movie sounds a little bit like Three Amigos, except its grittier, nastier, more violent, and has more commentary undertones.<br/><br/>As previously stated, the acting is definitely what runs this movie. The main five characters (among others) throws so many lines at you, you won't be able to catch every single awesome quote (""It was a long flight"" was missed by all). Robert Downey Jr. deserves at least an Oscar nod for his performance, he steals the show at almost any moment in which he speaks. Everyone else does a grand job (with Jack Black even doing decent despite having little material) but Downey Jr. and a certain cameo propel this movie from decent to surprisingly good. This is definitely the comeback movie for an actor, but its not one you'd expect.<br/><br/>Wall-E was a tough pill to swallow as it was slow, yet mystifying. Tropic Thunder on the other hand hurls so many little pills at you; you might not be able to take them all. The pacing was fast, at times way too fast; and then sometimes the movie slows down to almost a halt. Ben Stiller has the right idea, but a better director could have definitely improved the movie. This is a better effort than The Cable Guy, but Stiller needs a little more work. The pyrotechnics enhances the warfare aspects of the movie, and some of the make-up and special effects added to the absurd over-the-top humor that Ben Stiller is known to possess.<br/><br/>It may require a second viewing to catch all the jokes because there are layers upon layers of jokes patched throughout. Hollywood is insulted, so are war movies, so are many celebrities. Sometimes a scene is so entertaining the major joke(s) of the entire moment flies over your head (Pay close attention to the final shoot-out). Don't expect this movie to win any Oscars, as the Academy Awards are even made fun of in Tropic Thunder. There is a little bit of something for everybody, and this is definitely one of the best Stiller flicks he's even been caught up in. Stiller possesses the Sandler syndrome, in which the best movies of Sandler involve him not hogging all the attention but sharing it with the cast. Stiller has his moments, but so does everyone else.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: One of the funniest movies in a while has arrived here. With plenty of action, humor, and randomness possessed, Tropic Thunder is a high and mighty spoof with very little slowdown and very little unfunny scenes. Robert Downey Jr. yet again proves why he is one of the more underrated actors of the past couple of decades and Stiller proves that he can step out of his quick-buck comfortable humor and dip into something darker and much more vulgar. Expect silliness, expect cameos, expect left field humor, but also expect some smart jokes flung in there to throw you off. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the humorous carnage."

","Hollywood is hilarious. They've got agents ready to cover up dead hookers upon demand and actors with mandatory Tivo in their contracts. They've even got heads on the ends of rifles and people biting into live bats. Wait. That isn't funny. It's just plain dumb. There's a fine line between crazy funny and scalping a panda you just killed to wear on your head. TROPIC THUNDER never figures out how to walk that line, falling on either side of it for some pretty uneven results. <br/><br/>In his first directing gig since the, and I can't believe I'm writing this, infinitely more cohesive, ZOOLANDER, Ben Stiller takes a bunch of pampered actors and drop them in the middle of Vietnam so that they can shoot the greatest war movie ever (as if APOCAPLYPSE NOW would just crawl into a ditch with a live grenade or something). It's funny in theory, sure, but even Stiller drops the concept early in. With the plot left behind, the men are left to trip over each other in the jungle, which is occasionally cool given that Robert Downey Jr. and Jack Black are fine company to keep but mostly it's just meandering. I think they're trying to make it home but who cares really when we keep cutting back to a bald headed, furry- chested, Tom Cruise as a Hollywood executive who just loves telling people to (bleep) themselves whenever he feels like. (Seriously though, he's pretty funny.)<br/><br/>Thank you, Ben Stiller, for showing me just how hilarious Hollywood likes to think it is and for reminding me just how far out of step it is with the rest of the world. One minute, you're laughing hysterically at them. The next, they're the only ones in on the joke and they're laughing all by themselves. Lucky for them, most of their laughing happens all the way to the bank."

","This film is carried greatly by the performance of Robert Downey Jr., who has done an amazing job in recent films such as this and Ironman. However, Downey is a man alone in this film. None of the other actors help him out. Jack Black has done a great job recently in more serious roles but in this film turns right back into the nacho libre of old. Ben Stiller disappoints as he miscast himself in his own film. He was absolutely wrong for the role and failed to create humor. There were some decent appearances such as MM as the agent and Tom Cruise as les but there were minor roles and could do nothing to overcome the failures of the rest of the actors. Nick Nolte even disappoints in limited work. However, the movie does deserve somewhere about a 7, maybe a 6.6 because Robert Downey Jr. does the job of providing laughs for all. The racist jokes are, well, racist, but both the African Americans and the Caucasians seemed to find them funny and not offensive. He is the sole reason this movie is worth watching- just not for $9.50 at the theatre."

Standing out are Robert Downey Jr's trumped up controversial turn as an extreme method actor who undergoes a pigment-altering surgery in order to play a part written for a black actor is solid, while supporting players Jay Baruchel and Brandon T.

","Three bankable stars are hired to work on a war movie, based on a book, based on the experience of a former U.S. soldier who served in Vietnam. Stiller is a former A-lister whose career has stalled, Black is a would-be comic with a serious substance abuse problem, and Downey is a five-time Oscar-winning method actor known for going to extremes to perfect a role. Despite their versatility, the film's production is way behind and members of the media wonder whether or not they can complete the project. Out of good options, their desperate director abandons them in a real life 'hot zone' hoping they can learn to work together, but instead they end up fighting for their lives against deadly drug smugglers.

The film is clever because it makes fun of actors and pop culture in general. Robert Downey Jr. background as a dramatic actor taking his 'craft' seriously and going over board with the role and becoming a black character in the film is beyond hysterical. Jack Black playing a drug addicted actor looking for his next hit was hilarious. Jay Baruchel played the straight man role well(the smart/normal one), the conversational scene between Baruchel where he is plotting out a plan to rescue Stiller and finding out that none of the other actors Downey J., Brandon T.

The movie isn't about making fun of the handicap. It isn't about so-called ""black-face'. It's about actors, filmmakers, producers, its about fun. All the performances were entertaining and all of the main roles were fleshed out well. Each character feels as though he could (more than likely not) be real. Robert Downey Jr. does a great job as an actor who gets a little too far into his role. I usually dislike movies with Jack Black in them. There are a few that are tolerable but most are just not for me. He portrays and makes fun of himself pretty much, a guy he could be and maybe is similar to himself (minus the addiction). Ben Stiller plays a confused action star whose career may be at close. But my favorite of all was Tom Cruise. You have to see it. Best comedy of the summer IMO."

","Be prepared to laugh, and laugh, and laugh etc...............<br/><br/>Every aspect of this movie was funny, from the fake previews to the closing credits it was a comic masterpiece. Not one of the actors was off the mark and every gag was amusing if not belly laugh provoking! Stiller really hit a home run with his script and every aspect of the acting was excellent! I am not a huge fan of Jack Black and up until now have considered him a very one dimensional actor, but in this film he showed a range of comedic ability which impressed the crap out of me.<br/><br/>This is without question the BEST comedy I have seen in a very long time! Way to go guys!"

","Tropic Thunder follows a group of actors trying to recreate the events of a war in a movie, but ultimately are sent out into a real war, only they think they're still filming a movie. <br/><br/>The plot is, as you probably have already noticed, pretty hilarious. Of course, that alone isn't enough to make a funny movie. Tropic Thunder manages to pull that off, thankfully. The beginning of the movie is quite hilarious, and the ending is too. Unfortunately the middle portions weren't as funny, and they were a little confusing and slow at times. I think that that was mostly due to the fact that it wasn't what I expected. Nevertheless, it wasn't horribly boring, and the final act more than makes up for it. <br/><br/>The characters are pretty decent. They aren't super deep or anything, but you still get a good idea of who they are, and you feel like there's more to some of them. All the rest are either unimportant or just there to be really goofy. <br/><br/>Overall Tropic Thunder is a solid comedy. While it can be a bit slow in the middle, the beginning and end more than make up for it. I'll certainly be seeing this one again, and in the end I'd definitely recommend it."

","This movie is supposed to be a comedy but it is not funny at all. In fact I never laughed during the whole vision. Besides the bombastic scenes and images and the usual special effects it is a succession of stupid and meaningless episodes and dialogues of a story that can be summed up in few words: A team of actors (!!??) is in Vietnam to film an episode of the war which had occurred there. They are dispersed here and there in the middle of the jungle engaging in interminable discussions and arguments among themselves about this and that inclusive because some of them don't want to stay in the film anymore and want to go away. Some of them end up by being captured by a ridiculous gang of local drug producers and traffickers. Intermingled with this there are scenes back in USA with discussions and insults among the members of the movie team of producers and directors all in appallingly mean language. A movie to forget in all senses."

","I was surprised by how much I liked this movie. Most modern Hollywood comedies leave me cold; they barely seem to have more than one or two decent laughs each, but this one had me chuckling throughout. The story is complete tosh, but of course it isn't supposed to be taken seriously, and most of the biggest laughs are found in the interplay between the five hapless heroes anyway.<br/><br/>Director and co-writer Ben Stiller stars as Tugg Speedman, waning star of six Scorcher movies, who finds himself abandoned in the middle of some Asian jungle with the co-stars of his latest flick, Tropic Thunder, after the movie's director (Steve Coogan) takes exception to their prima donna antics on set. Unfortunately, their location happens to be slap bang in the middle of territory controlled by a vicious gang of drug smugglers although, as Coogan has told them they will be filmed by hidden cameras as they make their way out of the jungle, it's a good while before they realise the danger they are in is genuine.<br/><br/>The film takes humorous swipes at Hollywood, its movers and shakers and its product with a sure footing and an insider's knowledge. It also has a refreshing awareness of its own precarious position as it adroitly avoids descending into the crass juvenile humour of spoof movies. I liked the way it wasn't afraid to point a finger at the absurdity of its own profession (check out that spoof trailer for Kirk Lazarus's monks-in-love movie in which he is hailed as five time Oscar winner, and Toby Maguire is introduced as winner of MTV best kiss scene of the year award winner – and, of course, Speedman and Lazarus's infamous discussion about the pitfalls of going 'full retard' – to see what I mean), while never turning snide or cynical as it does so. Stiller and his co-writers are extracting the urine for sure, but there's no doubt they're doing it in an affectionate way.<br/><br/>While everyone gives great comical performances, Tom Cruise, somehow getting away with playing an instantly recognisable foul-mouthed megalomaniac movie executive, steals the show in his relatively few scenes. He's got the moves, and he knows how to sell a G5. Where Cruise is over-the-top hilarious, Downey's Kirk Lazarus, barely recognisable under his altered skin pigmentation, is consistently funny in a low-key way as one of those irritating actors who insist on going deep into character. I was still chuckling over his scene with the black guy late in the film ('so are we cool now?' 'No, not really.') when Tom danced us out over the end credits.<br/><br/>This is honestly one of the best Hollywood comedies I've seen in years so even if, like me, you usually steer clear, give this one a go – you won't be disappointed."

From the wily-minded executive to the desperate measures of stereotypic actors, this film has it all.<br/><br/>Stiller and Black play their parts well and pull it off being funny at the same time, Stiller playing a stereotypic actor so desperate he went ""full retard"" on a film that almost sank his career; Black playing another stereotypic comedy actor whose basis is only on fart jokes, and so desperate he takes some you-know-what. But it works too.<br/><br/>The main attractions, however, are Downey and Tom Cruise. Downey is remarkably hilarious in his role, the method actor Lazarus, playing as if he was born a black man. Cruise is also as excellent as the foul-mouthed Grossman, a somewhat sharp poke at The Weinstien Brothers. Really, it's all good.<br/><br/>The film is mostly filled with satirical jokes that are all spot-on. From the starting fake trailers we have a rap star promoting consumerism, an action hero in way too many sequels, a gross-out comedy that appeals to today's audience, and a highly potentially controversial art film. Nothing is spared as Stiller and company proceed to jab at all of Hollywood and movie-making's faults, and their proud of it. The dialogue is sharp tongued and hilarious.<br/><br/>So, if you are looking for a funny film with a sharp satirical message, you must watch this film.

I've kinda come to expect that from Jack Black, but hey, if you're gonna go there, at least be funny about it...think back to Blazing Saddles campfire scene.<br/><br/>Cruise was very funny in his campy overdone role, and Downey showed once again he can act. But Jack Black was a very unfunny ham, and Ben Stiller seemed more enthralled with himself and his facial expressions than putting a script together that would give genuine yucchs.<br/><br/>Look, I loved ""Something about Mary"", and generally have a good (and offbeat) sense of humor. But the Farelly Bros. made Mary's retarded brother and the rest of the cast's reaction to him (especially Matt Dillon) really funny. Here, we just get a guy acting dumb, evoking no sympathy and just being flat out boring.

"Michael_Elliott","Null","1","4","2 December 2008"," Great Spoof
","Tropic Thunder (2008) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Hilarious spoof of Hollywood and war movies has a group of actors making a Vietnam film when one of them are kidnapped by real terrorists and the rest must try and save him. This here is without question one of the best comedies in recent decades as the screenplay hits all the right marks and the spoof of Hollywood is just downright hilarious and more truthful than any actor would probably have you believe. I guess you could also call this movie brave on the part of many of the actors and that includes Downey who is playing a black man and probably gets the most laughs of anyone. The constant jokes of him acting and trying to speak like a black man are priceless as are the countless jokes at Stiller's character who played a retard in an earlier movie that critics hated. The comedy goes even further to make fun of just about everything in Hollywood from actors taking drugs to getting caught in the tabloids. I really loved how Stiller kicked off the movie with three fake trailers making fun of the type of movies being made in Hollywood today. The movie Grindhouse used this joke to great success but I'd say it's done even better here. What really sells this movie are the great performances from the entire cast with Downey stealing the film as the Australian actor who had his skin dyed so that he could try to win an Oscar playing a black character. The politically incorrect nature of this is always done in good taste so no one should worry about being offended. I'm not a fan of Jack Black but he too shines here as the heroin attic fat man who made a career out of farting. Then there's Stiller who really gets to have fun as the washed up action hero who tried to do something more dramatic with the role of a retard. Finally you also have to mention the supporting performances by Matthew McConaughey, Nick Nolte and Tom Cruise. All three give their best performances in many, many years but it's Cruise who really stands out as the evil, rap music dancing producer. His performance here is so incredibly crazy and out there you can't help but wish he'd get an Oscar for it. There are countless other cameos by famous people, which get some nice laughs as well. There have been countless spoofs of Hollywood but this one here certainly ranks as one of the greatest just because of the balls it shows in doing anything for a laugh."

And with an all star cast with Robert Downey Jr. (one of his best performances recently), Jack Black, Nick Nolte, Brandon Jackson, and Tom Cruise who puts in one of the most surprising and almost show stealing performances, you can't go wrong. Must see for any fans who have a decent enough sense of humor.<br/><br/>And Tom Cruise is still the man. Love him or hate him, one cannot deny that he is still an incredibly talented actor on the stage. I don't pay too much attention to his personal life because I don't look up to the man, but I respect him and still feel he is one of the finest actors in the 90s and he is still putting out great performances these days."

","Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) is an action movie star who hasn't had a hit in awhile, Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) is a comedy actor, and Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) is an Academy Award winning actor. Together they join forces in one of the most expensive action movies ever made, and it seems to be a dud. They travel to Vietnam, and, unbeknownst to them, become entwined in a war that's actually reality.<br/><br/>With hilarious cameos by Matthew McConaughey and Tom Cruise, ""Tropic Thunder"" is one of the most creative comedies to come around in awhile. It's very anti politically correct, and Ben Stiller (as producer, director, writer, and star) doesn't hold back the punches. Truly a daring, hilarious film that shouldn't be missed."
"MaxBorg89","9","1","4","13 October 2008"," Apocalypse Whoa!
","Satirizing Hollywood is one of the oldest habits in the movie-making industry. Now, with Entourage and Extras doing a fine job on the small screen, is a bigger, meaner film version really necessary? According to Ben Stiller, writer/producer/director/star of Tropic Thunder, the answer is a resounding yes, and his gamble seems to have paid off, given his fourth directorial effort is one of the craziest, funniest comedies ever made on the subject.<br/><br/>Stiller claims he got the idea for the film the moment he made his debut in movies, playing a supporting role in Spielberg's Empire of the Sun. Not that he has anything bad to say about Spielberg: the inspiration for Tropic Thunder is rather to be found in the troubled makings of Coppola's Apocalypse Now and Michael Cimino's ill-fated Heaven's Gate, which were delivered way behind schedule and went severely over budget. Coppola's film, and war movies in general, are the pretext Stiller uses to point out how messed-up the film-making system is.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder recounts the attempt to complete the eponymous picture, a true story set during the Vietnam war (a brief scene from the film-within-the-film spoofs Platoon's signature moment). After four days, the production is already a month behind schedule. The reason seems to be the bitter arguments between the pompous British director, Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan, who may have modeled his performance on co-writer Justin Theroux's work in Mulholland Drive) and the big-name cast, introduced through fake trailers before the actual movie begins: Tugg Speedman (Stiller), an action star whose one shot at serious acting, the Forrest Gump-like Simple Jack, was a massive flop; Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), a foul-mouthed, heroin-addicted comedian, famous for the Fatties franchise (think The Nutty Professor with Portnoy replacing Eddie Murphy and playing multiple roles); Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.), a five-time Oscar-winner whose Method madness makes De Niro look like an amateur (he undergoes a surgical operation to become African-American for the sake of a role); and Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson), a talentless rapper-turned-actor. <br/><br/>Since the frictions between Cockburn and the actors are damaging the picture, the film's screenwriter (Nick Nolte) suggest the following: dump them in the jungle all by themselves and place cameras in the trees to capture their ""performances"", guerrilla-style. The director complies, only to abandon his spoiled ""disciples"" in a zone controlled by a drug cartel. Naturally, Speedman assumes the criminals are just extras, and at this point it's too late to go back: the proverbial thing is about to hit the fan.<br/><br/>Stiller's previous film as a director, Zoolander, was a PG-13 send-up of the fashion world. With the movie business, such a tame approach will never work, and that's why Tropic Thunder is a comic triumph: it goes for the full, R-rated madness and excess. How else can one depict the overblown ""achievements"" of Hollywood? Nothing is sacred in the universe imagined by Stiller: alongside the usual ""troubled shoot"" gags, everything else gets blasted as well: Method, Oscars, franchises, studio megalomania, Blu-Ray vs. HD-DVD - you name it, you'll find it. It's all there, in a mix whose appeal lies in its explicit, fearless absurdity.<br/><br/>The excess in style (there are more explosions in one scene than in Tony Scott's entire filmography) is complemented by the same ingredients when it comes to dialogue and acting: obviously helped by his Emmy-nominated self-deprecation in Extras, Stiller has no problem coming up with the most outrageous things for his characters to say, yet, given the context, everything sounds so alarmingly true (""I don't read scripts. The script reads me"" Lazarus says). As for the performances, the leading trio couldn't have been better: Stiller, Black and Downey Jr. are always at their best when faced with larger-than-life types, the latter especially enjoying his career resurrection after Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Zodiac and Iron Man (the ""never go full retard"" sequence alone should get him an Oscar nomination). Nolte and Coogan deliver the expected goods too, but the best stuff in Tropic Thunder comes from those who appear less: as Speedman's moronic agent (imagine Ari Gold from Entourage and sweeten him just a little), Matthew McConaughey is really entertaining for the first time in I don't know how long, and then there's the icing on the cake, namely a certain Tom Cruise, whose four-scene appearance as a bald, overweight, sweary producer (""I will massacre you! I will f*ck you up!"") almost immediately qualifies as his best work since Magnolia.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is loud, overstuffed and rude, which might turn off some viewers. But hey, that's exactly the point: between the fake blood, Black convulsing, Stiller going bonkers, Downey playing an African-American and Cruise, in a fat-suit, cursing and dancing, there's not one dull moment in its 107 minutes. It's the most fun, politically incorrect comedy of 2008 - a live action equivalent of South Park."
"Otoboke","Null","1","4","6 October 2008"," A successful but not entirely memorable production.
","The all-star cast comedy has become somewhat of a relic over the past decade, and yet despite the reasons for this dwindling output, it would seem that Tropic Thunder, long-lost brainchild of lead star Ben Stiller, in turn adopts both the positives and negatives of such movies. Featuring a wide array of talents and styles, as well as an explosive mix of action, comedy, satire and ironic drama, Stiller has done well to create an extremely silly, but strangely effective comedy blockbuster of sorts that, well, rocks. However, too many cooks it is said, spoils the broth, and that's more than evident here. Spending too much time driving the plot forward rather than devoting much needed time to each of the main characters, Tropic Thunder feels stunted and rather disappointing in regards to the opportunity that it had at its feet. Although we have an array of talented actors, who all give wonderfully original performances of their own, nobody sticks out and all feel underused. Despite this major misstep in the writing process however, the majority of the feature remains entertaining, thrilling and fun to watch; given a little extra padding and depth (not to mention a little more Coogan) to pad out the flamboyant story, Stiller could have created a stellar piece of comedy, but instead ends with a successful but not entirely memorable production.<br/><br/>Taking place mostly in the woodlands of Vietnam, just outside of a movie-set in which four big-name stars are shooting an epic war movie, Tropic Thunder tells the story of how these four actors end up in a hilarious battle for their lives that some believe is all part of the movie they are shooting. At its core, the satirical edge of Stiller's script isn't subtle; poking fun at Hollywood throughout the entire proceedings, watching Tropic Thunder is essentially a two hour tour-de-irony in which the movie industry is taken as lightly as can be. From the pampered movie stars to the passively aggressive producers and inept, meek director, there's hardly a stone left unturned here, and there's plenty to laugh at if you love and in turn love to laugh at the industry. This is not to say that there isn't a story present here; weary of their uncertain predicament, the actors turned soldiers find themselves on the end of gunfire and conflict not just from local druglords, but from within their own group. Driven by ego, the big shot actors don't necessarily enjoy each others company, and as such some of the movie's most comical moments occur when this rivalry boils to the brink. There's never anything remotely shocking or new present here, but it's evenly paced and of decent enough quality to satisfy any need for silly entertainment.<br/><br/>Although the plotting and thick crust of satire is potent however, the sense of character and the personalities which deliver all the moments of conflict and irony aren't quite as well rounded. Being portrayed by a fine cast of actors, who incidentally are playing actors, the main cast are great to watch interact with each other, yet their own individual selves are never given any real moments to truly shine. As a whole, each of the individuals feels more like a gimmicky façade; a caricature that never gets to play around with what makes him inherently comical or interesting. Sure enough each character has his own thing, and each gets to play with it a couple of times, but in attempting to focus on all five leads plus a few extras, Stiller too often neglects his palette and forgets to take advantage of what he has in front of him. Nevertheless, on pure face value, Tropic Thunder can at least be said to have some naturally amusing caricature characters; Black is Black as overweight crack-addict gross-out comedy star Jeff Portnoy; Stiller is Stiller as cocky and obnoxious action-hero star Tugg Speedman; and Downey Jr. is perhaps the most entertaining as Oscar-monger Kirk Lazarus who went as far as to change the pigment of his skin to fit his role for the shoot.<br/><br/>With supporting members such as Steve Coogan, Brandon T. Jackson and an almost unrecognisable Tom Cruise, the mix of Hollywood names here is potent enough to dispel the sour taste left by the underwritten nature of their respective characters. In the end however you get the feeling that all of this could have merely been a small piece of a much larger pie; Tropic Thunder is loud, dumb and indulgently ironic, plus it has enough big names to pull in the audiences, yet it also feels a little underwhelming. Such is the problem with all-star cast movies in general, if it's not the severe imbalance of pace and characterisation against plotting that a director may have trouble with then it's the hype that is garnered prior to the screening. To be fair, all involved do a brilliant job here, and the performances are lively enough to sustain the script's sometimes lumbering pace, yet lacking somewhat in the rich characterisation that such a film requires in order to satisfy, Tropic Thunder isn't quite as impressive as it could have been. Regardless of its flaws however, there is no denying the simple entertainment value inherent in the movie; fun, abrasive and downright hilarious on quite a few occasions, Tropic Thunder may not be the best comedy of the year, but it's certainly worthy of your attention.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"

I am not a big fan of Ben Stiller and he doesn't do anything different from his usual style here as well, but is well overshadowed by the performances given by Jack Black and Robert Downey Jr.<br/><br/>The opening scene of Downey and Toby Maguire is hilarious and there are no dull moments from there on. Downey plays an actor playing a part of a black soldier in a movie and is living his character. He does this weird ascent and his subtle style of comedy is fantastic. I haven't seen many of Downey's comic roles so far but i bet after this performance there are a lot more on their way.<br/><br/>To make the experience all the more pleasurable was Tom Cruise's performance as a shrewd, hairy and a cranky old businessman. Though his part is quite small but he's done something very different here which is not a typical Tom Cruise style. Certainly a good comedy after a long time."

","Java Man Reviews ""Tropic Thunder"" (Rated R) Directed by Ben Stiller. Written by Justin Theroux, Etan Cohen & Ben Stiller. Starring Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr., Nick Nolte, Steve Coogan, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, Brandon T. Jackson, Bill Hader, Matthew McConaughey, Brandon Soo Hoo and a surprise actor. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com September, 2008.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW:<br/><br/>A troupe of actors (Stiller, Black, Downey, Jr., Baruchel & Jackson) are led into the jungle by pretentious director Damien Cockburn (Coogan) to make a Vietnam war movie. Along for the shoot are cynical screenwriter Four Leaf Tayback (Nolte), explosives expert Cody (McBride) and a full crew of Hollywood tech types. When a mishap sidelines Cockburn, Stiller's character takes over and stages the scenes as if the cameras were still rolling (he thinks there are hidden cameras filming their every move). As they blunder further into the jungle, the extras playing the enemy are actually a gang of drug runners who are returning fire with real bullets, led by the scariest 12-year old drug lord you will ever see (Hoo). As the rumble in the jungle heats up, Hollywood heavyweights back home are trying to figure out what's happening. An agent (McConaughey), a studio executive (see if you can guess), and his obsequious assistant (Hader) fret over the possibility that the cast and crew may die . . . or, worse yet, the studio may lose money.<br/><br/>REVIEW: 3 1/2 out of 4 Java Mugs<br/><br/>The film opens with three fake movie trailers and a concession ad featuring several of the lead actors. These little comic gems help establish the characters while also revealing the filmmakers intentions... to satirize Hollywood movies, Hollywood culture, and yes, Hollywood's audiences (us). The fact that many in attendance at our preview screening actually thought these were trailers for real movies only proves the point that many movies are ridiculous, yet we pay to see them anyway. Some even said they wish the movies they advertised were real. Jack Black in an Eddie Murphy-like fat suit? Why not? The movie satirizes all things Hollywood, from self-important actors and outrageous executives to nearly every war movie ever made.<br/><br/>Six of this film's actors are big-name stars who have had leading roles in their own successful movies, yet they work as an effective ensemble under Stiller's inspired direction. You may not recognize one of them, and you will swear another is not who the credits say he is. But that's all part of the fun!<br/><br/>Perhaps the best of the group is Downey Jr. as a Russell Crowe-like Australian actor who takes ""The Method"" so seriously that he actually becomes his character--a streetwise African American (complete with surgically altered skin color). Of course the troupe also includes a real black actor-rapper named Alpa Chino (Jackson) who becomes hilariously aggravated by the Downey character's outrageous blackness.<br/><br/>There are plenty of gory scenes, but even they are part of the satire, and are exposed for what they are--blood & guts special effects. Hawaii is used successfully as a stand-in for the unnamed location that itself is masquerading as Vietnam.<br/><br/>Getting back to fake movie trailers, this film, along with Quentin Tarantino's and Robert Rodriguez's Grindhouse (2007) has helped spawn The International Fake Trailer Festival, part of the International Film Festival of Catalonia in Spain. You can upload your fake trailer to teaserland.com."

I don't know about any of you, but I have never scene a movie run trailers for its ""movies"" at the start of a film. All of those trailers were great spoofs in themselves and personally I would have rather cut the actual movie trailers and just watched 10 of those before the film (I am a person who loves watching movie trailers before a film). That started to movie on a high note for me and it really only went uphill from there.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is just one of those movies that I will remember for a long time. To me its one of those movies that I can bring up with friends and we can take maybe 10 minutes reciting lines or events that took place in the film and we would still have a good laugh from it, no matter how terrible our renditions of the film were. This is just one of those movies where the trailer does it no justice, even though the trailers for it were pretty damn good if you ask me.<br/><br/>Every time I think of Tropic Thunder the first thought that comes to my mind is, damn I want to see that movie again.

","""Tropic Thunder"" is one of those movies that you either like or dislike, there is no middle. I liked this movie and it's one of the better Ben Stiller movies but here Stiller, as director-actor-writer-producer, turns center of attention away from him. In many scenes there is no Stiller, which makes stars like Downey Jr., Black, Cruise, McConaughey and others their share of time on screen. Stiller imagined this one to be a parody of every war movie and that's what this movie is all about. If you expect to see something other then plain jokes about everything (church - Maguire & Downey Jr., mental retardation - bothered me little, war, war heroes - Nolte, movie makers, movie stars - behavior of actors on the set before they were put in the jungle, studio head - Cruise, Oscars...) just don't waste your money to see this movie. But if you're in for fun this will be a great ride. Connoisseurs of war movies will easily recognize classic war movies like ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Platoon"", ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" and if anyone felt offended about spoofing them, I say don't be. Although I am a big fan of those movies, this is a comedy, where everything is allowed. The whole movie also gets big plus in amount of very well known faces skillfully combined together; so we've got comedy genius Jack Black, very good Tom Cruise (not the best role like someone said), solid Jay Baruchel & Brandon T. Jackson (Alpa Chino :D), Matthew McConaughey as Stiller's agent, Nick Nolte as fake movie veteran, and cameo appearances of Maguire, Voight, Love Hewitt, Rooney, Banks... I purposely left out one name that really stands alone and raises above every single actor in this movie (at least in my opinion): Robert Downey Jr. He is such a brilliant actor, neglected because of his drug problems and in need for big blockbuster that would put him on A acting list. His hit blockbuster was ""Iron Man"", just like Johnny Depp's world popularity with Pirates; although they were brilliant before those movies in eyes of a true movie lovers. His performance as Kirk Lazarus, Australian, winner of 5 Oscars, that turned black for his new role, is one of the funniest roles in comedy ever. His appearance, attitude, accent and style is amazing and he should be the only reason why this movie should get a passing grade in eyes of those who disliked it (although I don't see the reasons why). To sum it all up, here we've got a great comedy coming from Ben Stiller, with memorable Robert Downey Jr.'s interpretation of Kirk Lazarus that will stay with you long after you finish watching this movie."
"isabelle1955","Null","1","4","23 September 2008"," I Admit I was Surprised..
","at how funny this film is. I would never have gone to see it had my (grown up) children not suggested it when we thought about a family movie outing a couple of weeks back. I was aware of the controversy and felt a bit dubious about how offensive it might be, and, let's be honest here, I'm not a huge Ben Stiller fan. So my reaction was a resigned ""Must we.?"" But I freely admit I was wrong. This is a satire, it's genuinely funny and as a satire, probably works better than Burn After Reading, which I saw last weekend. It's the best spoof I've seen in a while.<br/><br/>A bunch of diva actors are cast in a Vietnam war epic based on the story of an heroic vet, Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte hamming it up wonderfully). There's Jack Black as Jeff, with his cocaine habit, Robert Downey Jr as 'serious' Australian actor Kirk Lazarus, so into The Method that he darkens his skin for the part and once spent 6 months working in a Beijing textile factory as preparation for a role. Brandon T Jackson is Alpa Chino, Hip Hop star, Steve Coogan is a posey British director, Tom Cruise is an obnoxious producer and of course Stiller himself stars as Tugg Speedman, star of a never ending series of dire action movies. All want in their various ways to be taken seriously, in what's hoped will be the Vietnam war movie to end all Vietnam war movies. As their demands become increasingly hard to deal with, the director sends them off into the real jungle, away from their Blackberries, Tivo and luxury hotel to film out in the backwoods, hoping to get some gutsy performances. The plot has them getting caught up with local drug warlords and dodging real bullets and mines. And it's funny.<br/><br/>Contrast the death by landmine of Coogan's director (funny despite - or maybe because of - the flying head) with the death by shooting in Burn After Reading of Pitt's gym bunny at the hands of George Clooney. I'm not quite sure why, but the former works, the latter really doesn't. Downey and Stiller are fabulous in this, pitching the humour at exactly the right level, and whilst I appreciate the arguments of the disability groups who have objected to this movie, I think in this instance, they are wrong.<br/><br/>The conversation in question, about Stiller's previous role as Simple Jack, discusses how disability is usually portrayed in film in Hollywood. Namely, that audiences seem happy to watch disabled people as long as they have some exceptional gifts in compensation because it makes everyone feel better, the ""Feel Good"" factor. However, when a disability is portrayed accurately, then audiences aren't interested because it makes them too uncomfortable. And who wants to be confronted by anything remotely uncomfortable in a movie? Is this not actually a very relevant point being made? I know there will always be some members of the audience who don't get the subtlety of the satire, but surely they are in the minority? Or am I over estimating the audience here? <br/><br/>I thought the spoof trailers at the beginning were just classic! I challenge anyone not to smile at 'Kirk' and Tobey McGuire as two gay monks. Almost worth going just for the first five minutes alone. Anyway, Tropic Thunder entertained this family for a couple of hours. Good value, a good piece of Friday Night Fluff."

","Of course, I was drawn to this movie (as I'm sure many others were) by the big name actors; I'm a fan of both Black and Stiller, and thought that the premise of the movie looked absolutely hilarious. Thank GOD that I was right! Tropic Thunder is incredibly funny, full of jokes, scenes and lines that you can't help but laugh at. The actors do marvelous jobs, especially Stiller and Downey Jr. And, surprisingly, the action scenes were actually quite intense and thrilling, because, after the sudden and unexpected death of the director (Steve Coogan), you really don't know if someone's gonna die, unlike in some movies where you know deep down that everyone will be fine.<br/><br/>Although some parts are a bit corny, and others very gory, the movie really pulls it all together for an enjoyable, hilarious, and very very excellent film.<br/><br/>10/10!!!"
"Putzberger","8","1","4","21 September 2008"," There's Something About Hollywood
","As a comedy, ""Tropic Thunder"" works just fine -- it keeps the laughs coming in that gag-a-minute, gag-reflex-inducing manner of the Farrelly brothers or other current masters of the form. As a satire, it's just okay. Sure, it takes good shots at some deserving targets, like narcissistic young actors, crass movie studio execs and Hollywood fatuousness in general. And much to Ben Stiller and co-writer Justin Theroux's credit, they call out lots of war-movie clichés that you felt too guilty to notice, like the blustering machismo, the Christ-like posing, and the tendency to toss in some hackneyed classic rock song when the action slows down. But self-effacing Hollywood product is still Hollywood product, and if you want depth or darkness in your insider attacks on the film industry I suggest you rent Robert Altman's ""The Player"" or Blake Edwards' Altman-esquire ""S.O.B."" instead. But you'll get more laughs out of ""Tropic Thunder,"" and that's probably what Stiller wanted.<br/><br/>The comic scheme is delectable: a bunch of pampered, pompous actors and a clueless director (Steve Coogan) are stranded in the jungles of Vietnam trying to make an Oscar-bait movie based on a war memoir by a rasping, profanity-spewing blowhard vet with hooks for hands (Nick Nolte in an excellent self-parody). Of course, things go horribly wrong (the director dies in the movie's only genuinely uncomfortable joke) and this quintet of dilettantes winds up battling a cartel of heroin smugglers led by an evil preteen. It's a brilliant scenario, but Stiller & co prefer to milk it for the easy laughs -- fortunately for us, they get most of them. Stiller isn't much of an actor, so his washed-up action hero character is kind of bland until he winds up getting abused and tortured, where Stiller always shines. Jack Black is on hand as Jeff Portnoy, a fat, Farrell-style lowbrow comic actor with substance issues. It could be a very mean or very moving part, but Black plays it for sympathy, which makes him more amusing but less disturbing. Jay Baruchel and Brandon T Jackson pick off more low-hanging fruit as, respectively, an earnest young actor and a poseur rapper trying to get taken seriously, and Robert Downey Jr. has the movie's best role and lines as Kirk Lazarus, who seems to be the lovechild of Robert DeNiro and Russell Crowe. All the controversy over the used of the word ""retard"" is a bit overblown, since it's obvious from the scene between Stiller and Downey that the intended target of ridicule is not the mentally challenged, but the patronizing Hollywood jerks who exploit them for cheap pathos. That's the sort of movie idiocy that ""Tropic Thunder"" name-checks but does not really explore, and the entire thing seems like a brilliantly produced in-joke than a blistering satire. Please note: you're trying to have it both ways when you ridicule dimwitted actors and then cast Matthew McConaughey and Tom Cruise in bit parts. McConaughey seems to be enjoying himself, but way, way too much ink has been spilled in praise of Mr. Cruise. He's perfectly adequate as a sociopathic film mogul, but Jack Nicholson would probably get yet another Oscar for the role and any semi-decent comic actor (say Will Ferrell or Steve Carrell) would have been much funnier. People only think Tom Cruise is good in the role because he's Tom Cruise, who has benefited more from lowered expectations than anyone this side of George W. Bush."

","Sunset Boulevard make have broke ground in that it shows writers and actors/actresses are only as good as what they've done in the last year, but Trophic Thunder makes it all look absolutely knee slapping funny.<br/><br/>We can thank Ben Stiller for this madness because who if not him could have got it made? Well, maybe the Farrelly Brothers, but that's not so much the point as the fact that Ben Stiller conceived and acted it with help from his own sympathetic brothers-in-arms - literally! From the fake advertisements and trailers before the film to the last lampoon with Tom Cruise it never lets up in it's look at the superficiality of all things that make up the industry. Check out the ""full retard"" monologue by Robert Downey Jr.'s character and the fixation with perks involving the ubiquitous Tivo which the agent played by Matthew McCounahey is determined to secure. They're inspired and hilarious to the extreme. Speaking of Robert Downey Jr., he's simply able to pull off the ""Tootsie"" of the last 20 years as he plays his over the top roll here. This guy can act in any role as evidenced by this role being added to an already impressive cannon.<br/><br/>If you love comedy, especially that which easily dispenses with a bit of reality to actually lampoon reality SEE THIS MOVIE.

"kunalkhandwala","8","1","4","14 September 2008"," Outrageous entertainment
","Tropic Thunder disgusts you, tickles you, pricks you, entertains you and exhausts you all at the same time. Comedy is the underlying theme with an unlikely star cast that gets together on a film shoot in Vietnam. This film is a satirical comedy on Hollywood's immoral acts, a spoof on war movies, an insulting drama of co-actors within the film, a disgusting look at the gruesome aspect of war, crude, merciless and yet, outrageously funny. Unlike most Ben Stiller and Jack Black movies, Tropic Thunder is wickedly smart at being nonsensical. That itself is a rare combination. <br/><br/>The smaller the hint, the better it would be so just make sure you watch the previews before the film. The opening scene is a parody of war films like Platoon, only a lot more guts spilling around combined with amputations. Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) lays wounded with over 100 bullets in him with Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) splashing his spit and tears all over Speedman in a scene so tragic that the director calls 'cut'! This of course is a location shoot for Tropic Thunder, which is a film based on a memoir by an odd Vietnam veteran. <br/><br/>Speedman is a dimming movie star with his retarded role in 'Simple Jack' claiming ridicule rather than an Oscar. Kirk Lazarus is a methodical Australian actor with a handful of Oscars and his commitment to his performance shows as he undergoes pigment therapy to get into the character of the black soldier with a lame accent that only infuriates the real black soldier, Apha Chino (Brandon Jackson). Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) has played a spoof on Eddie Murphy's disgusting comedies of farts and fats but has a real, massive drug addiction during the shoot in Vietnam. Apart from Downey Junior's riotous performance, where he gets so deep into the character that we forget he played the Ironman, Tom Cruise as an obscene and nefarious producer is striking. With a bald wig, hairy chest, pot belly and a tongue that lashes at everything that comes his way, Tom Cruise is not only unrecognizable but also unbelievably good at his comic role that makes him one of the boys in this ultimate showdown of witty humor and nonsensical gibberish. <br/><br/>The writers and director ensure enough bombardment of ridiculous ideas, blasphemous dialogue, racist jokes, unpolitical behavior and offensive nature of Tropic Thunder to keep the audience hooked on. The film is mindless and how! Slapstick humor that is mostly over the top and a true example of the spontaneity in the director's mind must have been the scene where the film's director gets blown up to pieces while the cast thinks it's all part of the plan of live film making! Disgustingly funny.. <br/><br/>Such scenes along with R-rated dialogues based around some witty comedy make Tropic Thunder a unique fun time at the cinema. Tom Cruise's cursing abilities and wickedness turns so nasty at one point that he even scares the murderous rebels in Vietnam over the phone! Robert Downey Jr.'s performance is laudable simply because you forget that it is him! Even when Tropic Thunder's camera is off, he is still into that character and we see him as the Australian for only a few seconds. With a heroic Rambo style climax, Tropic Thunder blasts at you with this concoction of bluntness, blasphemy, slapstick, gruesomeness and absurd humor that is sure to make you laugh inspite of all that it makes you go through in Vietnam.<br/><br/><ul><li>8.081 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"
"jpschapira","9","1","4","14 September 2008"," ""I'm a lead farmer, ...."" - Kirk Lazarus
","The only reason I didn't value ""Zoolander"" so much is because I didn't think it was a difficult thing to achieve; a parody of the world of male models. Yes, it was originally presented and the script made a good use of the predictable character descriptions, but nothing else. I don't intend to make a comparison because both share a signature (Ben Stiller's) and in both this is established from the beginning: with a flash about Derek and how being a male model is like in ""Zoolander"" and a few trailers that mock the film industry with audacity in ""Tropic Thunder"".<br/><br/>The film industry? Well, actually ""Tropic Thunder"" only messes with Hollywood, and it has no mercy. Stiller, intelligent as he is (although I don't like him as an actor very much), makes the wise choice of not taking on any political or religious issues, reducing everything down to the world he knows best; the world he lives in. After this decision, he elevates the risk by giving his comedy multiple dimensions and getting them all right. <br/><br/>Essentially, Stiller's movie (co-written by Stiller, Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen) is a superproduction that parodies superproductions; a film inside a film. It has all the special effects and things blowing up, the epic sceneries and score (this latest one is a great work by Theodore Shapiro) and the superstars; the key-and this is all product of Stiller's intelligence- is how it uses them. It would be sufficient to say there's a big moment for the score (you could perceive it at the beginning or the end of the film; it involves Stiller in slow-motion), a huge one for the special effects and many for the sceneries (as we see helicopters flying and watching a 'jungle' from above in scenes that seem repeated but are different every time in a plot that never looses its frenetic nature).<br/><br/>However, the stars of the show are, wellthe stars. Stereotypes are all over the place: Jack Black (crazier than ever) plays an actor who has only done comedy involving farts and has drug addiction problems; Robert Downey Jr. is Kirk Lazarus, a 'methodic' actor, committed to his work and awards (""Second Globe, third Oscar"", he says after he mentions a role he once played); Brandon T. Jackson personifies Alpa Chino, our typical music megastar that does everything and has to try acting because it can't hurt; and Ben Stiller is Tugg Speedman (or the same old Ben Stiller, but very measured and not at all out of control), the action movie man who has played the same role a thousand times but has also spent his whole career trying to be acknowledged as a 'serious' actor. <br/><br/>When all of this characters find themselves immerse in this 'jungle' where they were once shooting a movie, it's fair to say anything can happen; and it's also fair to clarify that everything happens. Stiller lets loose and everything he keeps measured as an actor, he unloads it in the tone of the production and in every other performer, letting each and every one of them to explode. Nick Nolte and Steve Coogan deliver two short but unforgettable performances, Matthew McConaughey plays Matthew McConaughey and it doesn't bother, we have countless minimal appearances by famous and renowned individuals and there's a little- and brilliant-surprise (at least it surprised me). The film never takes itself seriously, but it's not stupid like, for example, most of the ""Scary Movies"" and films alike, which also try to mock genre pictures.<br/><br/>Us, as viewers have to be thankful for that. As I said, Stiller doesn't intend to mock a particular genre; his target is the Hollywood industry. I also said he has no mercy, which leaves the fact of being brave or not out of the question. In terms of audience response, he could have been brave; and in a way he is because I'm almost sure that he did his best effort to make the most accessible movie possible. <br/><br/>It's clear that there are references (yes, most of them are very funny) that not every viewer will understand (I personally missed the essence of some) and refer to the actual state of the Hollywood Stiller lives in and knows by heart. But if you don't get any reference, there's a plot that's eventful enough to keep your eyes focused on the screen and jokes that are just pure (innocent or disgusting-but intelligent-, because Stiller doesn't care which one is better) comedy. <br/><br/>People laughed, and the biggest laughs came in those moments of original, crafted comedy that is funny without the need of mocking something. This is a little balance, courtesy of Stiller who knows that any superproduction should be made to be watched by anyone. If you like the approach towards the natural comedy, it means the film works; and it means the same if the references employed, developed (sometimes even detailed) at least make you smile: I liked both ends. <br/><br/>It's difficult to direct a movie like ""Tropic Thunder"", which involves parodying something that's not as blatant and basic as the male model world. It's even more difficult to succeed in every expectation generated and fulfill every ambition presented. What sometimes is simply impossible is to set a bar; to function as an inflexion point in movie making; in this case with the comedy genreMark my words: it will be long before we experience something like ""Tropic Thunder"" again."

","In order for a spoof to be a good spoof it has to be aware that it is a spoof.

I am not going to name names here and I am pretty sure that I don't have too.<br/><br/>""Tropic Thunder"" is a spoof that finds itself on the good side of that line and that basically means it works are a stand alone movie. It is not a 90 minute string of pop culture references. It is more a spoof of the war/action genre (a la ""Commando"" with Schwarzenegger) than a group of movies. The opening scene does include a direct parody of a tragic scene in ""Platoon"" (which makes it hilarious), but the pretentiousness of non-stop simple gags is never felt. The film has its own storyline and characters and takes you on its own little film experience, rather than a re-run of previous films. In fact, as far as spoof movies go, this film does for war/action macho flicks what the brilliant ""Hot Fuzz"" did for cop action movies. It is funny by itself and is a real treat for genre fans.<br/><br/>""Tropic Thunder"" in an interesting move also makes fun of the business of making big action movies as story here is about people making a film called ""Tropic Thunder"" only to find out that it becomes a reality. Tom Cruise has what is one of his best roles as a profanity spouting executive frustrated over the lack of progress in his ultra expensive epic production. And this is not just a cameo, this is a full fledged supporting role that is right by Robert Downey Jr's hilarious turn as a token tough talking fearless platoon sergeant (like the one in Aliens). In fact, virtually ever character and story element here is a stab at the genre and that is why it all works. --- 8/10<br/><br/>BsCDb Classification: 13+ --- violence, profanity"

At first I thought the film was just a comical parody of all the movies made documenting the Vietnam War period. How could Jack Black and Ben Stiller be serious about near death situations and meaningful relationships with colleagues? But when the sound effects faded away, the film became suddenly awkward and I was watching a movie of a crew making a movie about a book. Besides poking fun at Vietnam era war films, ""Tropic Thunder"" went to town on its satirical view of Hollywood; agents, attitudes, priorities, career decisions, thematic trends in movies, and acting methods. After you laugh about something, you say to yourself, ""that's so true."" With absolutely no expectations, I was greatly pleased and laughed the entire way through.

Who would think that a movie with so many people I hate would be so damn funny?! Tom Cruise seems to do his best in roles that do not require his glibness to be in every frame of every shot (ie ""Magnolia"", for one).

"Buddy-51","8","1","4","13 August 2008"," outlandish spoof of movies and movie-making
","""Tropic Thunder"" wears its political incorrectness as a badge of honor. With one white actor appearing in black face and another portraying a drooling, buck-toothed mentally retarded man, this big budget spoof of big budget movie-making is guaranteed to raise the hackles of a sizable chunk of the movie going public. Yet, my suspicion is that an even larger segment will be laughing right along with this loony satire that also takes on Hollywood values, movie industry insiders and action movie clichés at the same time.<br/><br/>It seems that every time a movie is set in an exotic locale, we are treated to stories about how the actors took part in some sort of movie ""boot camp"" to ""toughen them up"" for the ordeal ahead and to add a note of authenticity to their performances. ""Tropic Thunder"" has fun with that practice by dropping five pampered movie stars, dressed in full army fatigues and regalia, into the jungles of Vietnam as preparation for the mega-budget war picture they are currently appearing in. Unfortunately, make-believe quickly turns into reality when the quintet runs into some dangerous drug dealers who don't much care for these warlike intruders suddenly invading their turf.<br/><br/>Out of this setup, writers Ben Stiller (who also stars in and directed the film), Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen have fashioned a lively and frequently hilarious tale of clashing egos and comic misunderstandings that isn't afraid to cross over the line into tastelessness and vulgarity if that's what the material calls for. Robert Downey, Jr. steals the show as Kirk Lazarus, an Australian actor from the Lee Strasburg school of method acting, who has gone so far as to employ pigment-altering treatments as a means of fully immersing himself in the character he is playing, a bad-ass black man replete with fro wig and jive accent. Stiller is Tugg Speedman, a once sure-fire box office attraction whose recent career downturn has forced him to take roles in small, independent productions like ""Simple Jack,"" in which he plays the part of a mentally retarded farm boy in the most offensive way imaginable (this has caused the film to be picketed by a number of anti-discrimination advocacy groups). Jack Black appears as Jeff Portnoy, a drug-addicted actor who goes into serious withdrawals after his secret slash of blow is swiped by a frenzied bat. Jay Baruchel and Brandon T. Jackson round out the thespian five-some as, respectively, a conscientious actor (he's actually read the script and the book on which it's based) and a rapper hoping to make it big in the movies.<br/><br/>Other noteworthy performers include Tom Cruise, barely recognizable beneath a scruffy beard, bald plate and prosthetic fat suit, as a manic, cutthroat producer who's more than willing to sacrifice his own actors if doing so will help to insure the bottom-line for the studio; Matthew McConaughey, as a frantic agent fully dedicated to fulfilling every wish of his demanding client; Nick Nolte, as a disabled Vietnam vet whose alleged personal experiences in combat serve as the basis for the film being made; and Danny McBride, as a special effects engineer who's finding it increasingly difficult to distinguish between a squib he planted and an actual explosion set off by the heavily armed dealers.<br/><br/>Though ""Tropic Thunder"" is primarily an actors' picture, the performers would not have been able to pull it off without being handed such solid material to work with. In spite of a few inevitable dry spots and the occasional joke that simply doesn't work, the script deftly mixes sophisticated satire with lowbrow buffoonery. Not surprisingly, given its pedigree, the film is very knowing about the whole Hollywood scene, managing to parody war movie clichés right along with all the behind-the-scenes insider stuff related to the industry, particularly the demands and pressures involved in high stakes movie-making.<br/><br/>And it is a tribute to the makers of ""Tropic Thunder"" that they've not only refused to buckle under to those pressures, but that they've made attacking those pressures the very purpose of their movie. There is no doubt that many viewers are not going to be quite as charitable in their assessment of this film as I have been, and that is certainly their prerogative. But when so many Hollywood comedies these days are forced by the demands of bottom-line corporate interests into being as bland and inoffensive as possible, it's nice to come across one that is actually willing to take some risks once in awhile. In this case, at least, it would appear as if those risks have finally paid off."

I could honestly see a good deal of the humor going over some heads (which probably accounts for some of the bad reviews here), as well as foreigners, who probably just don't understand this type of humor at all.<br/><br/>Either way though, its definitely my opinion that Tropic Thunder is one of the best films of the 21st century thus far. Watch this movie."

","There was a lot of talk about Tropic Thunder before hitting theaters, especially the crazy controversy. Putting all the talk aside, I thought the movie looked hilarious from the trailers and it was even better when I saw the movie. Everybody was hysterical in the film, especially Robert Downey Jr.<br/><br/>The story is about a group of actors, who end up in the jungles of Asia while filming a war movie. While there is more to the story than this, I thought I might not spoil anything for you. The story is simple and it is not so hard to understand when you see the whole film.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller was great as Tugg Speedman. I thought his performance was really funny. I was a little bit surprised on how funny Jack Black was since I'm not a big fan of his movies. He plays Jeff Portnoy and also known as Fatts. Robert Downey Jr. transformation was totally insane, but hilarious at the same time. I never thought he would have been this hysterical. I think he stole the show in the movie. He certainly has a comic side that I haven't seen before. As I was watching the movie, I was trying to find out who was Tom Cruise in the movie. Then I noticed a fat guy with glasses dropping the f-bombs like crazy and there was Cruise. The dance was funny too.<br/><br/>When I saw the movie, I was surprised on how much action the film has. I almost felt like it was an actual action flick. Now the comedy in the movie was one of the best of 2008. Everybody in the movie was hilarious and I couldn't stop laughing until the end. The movie was so funny that I couldn't even hear the dialogue at times because the entire theater was laughing like crazy.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is one of the best comedies of the year. It's non-stop laugh until the end and I mean it. If you really want to laugh your heart out, I think Tropic Thunder is the right movie for you. You will not be disappointed."

","This movie is quite terrible. There were maybe two funny parts in the whole movie. Basically it was trying to be Rambo. Which isn't a good thing in my opinion. At some point they forgot that it was supposed to be a comedy.<br/><br/>While watching this I had a hard time determining who had the worst performance in the movie. Robert Downy Jr. and Jack Black were the finalists. I enjoyed Stiller's previous directorial/actor/writer movies in Cable Guy and Realitiy Bites but this was just a ""i have no brain"" type of movie.<br/><br/>I wonder what Robert Downey Jr has on critics for them to praise his movies. First the disaster that was ""Iron Man"" and now this."

","This movie is very refreshing, because it's a spoofing comedy but not a ""common one"" as SCARY MOVIE, HOT SHOTS, or the awful recent spoofs like DATE MOVIE or EPIC MOVIE. No, this one is original and very well done, because it mixes great jokes (some of them are excellent black humor), good action scenes and critics to the own movies' industry (and also the music industry). All this inserted in a real plot. It's not an amount of pasted spoofing scenes, as some spoofing movies use to be.<br/><br/>I liked the story, the acting, the jokes and those trailers at the beginning (in spite of that idea not being so innovative like that. We had seen it before on PLANET TERROR by Tarantino and Rodriguez).<br/><br/>About the acting I enjoyed the performances of Ben Stiller, Jack Black (He's completely crazy!...) and Tom Cruise (nice make up)."

It is totally hilarious! Lots of cameos, lots of funny bits. Robert Downey Jr. steals the movie for me.<br/><br/>I like the take-offs from ""Platoon"" and ""Apocalype Now.""

"dtucker86","Null","1","5","6 September 2008"," Well done Mister Stiller
","I had the pleasure of seeing this fine film today and wanted to set my observations down while they are still fresh. This film has been getting a little bit of ""flack"" for not being politically correct. Actually I find a lack of PC in a film quite refreshing. Yes some are offended by Robert Downey Jr. playing a black man and by the hilarious conversation he and Stiller have about playing a retarded person in a film. My advice is simply leave your brain and conscience at the cinema door and just relax and have a good time. Stiller has been a favorite of mine ever since I saw meet the parents. He has this goofy, everyman quality about him that is perversely appealing. He is wonderful at comedy and I would like to see him do drama. He has had a bit of a turn-down in his career recently and I hope this gets it back for him because he does an awesome job in this film as actor and a very fine director as well. This film is really sort of a satire on hypocrisy. The actors playing macho soldiers who cannot do without their cocaine and cell phones, the so called hero who was a cook in the Coast Guard etc. I also wanted to give kudos to both Robert Downey Jr. and Jack Black. Jack Black has also been a favorite of mine since I saw Saving Silverman. He is talented at both comedy and drama, just look at the great job he did in Shallow Hal. Downey is a true Hollywood comeback story. I am so happy he conquered his personal demons and found its best to get ""high"" in your work. Oh heck, everyone here does such a great job that its hard to tell who steals the show from who. Oh and last but not least lets not forget Tom Cruises hilarious cameo as a foul mouthed studio executive. All in all this is a great film and I give it four stars and two big thumbs up."
"caressque","8","1","5","3 September 2008"," Great comedy, but had some slow parts..
","First off, this movie was hilarious. Everyone in the movie theater was laughing hysterically. Especially when Tom Cruise did his dancing. Yes. Tom Cruise dances in this movie - with his crotch. Is this funny? No, but since it is Tom Cruise, we find it hilarious. Tom Cruise has been on the receiving end of a lot of crap from the media and the mob lately and to take on a role like this was brave. I believe he pulled it off with flying colors.<br/><br/>Second, everyone in this movie did a great job. The acting was solid, and some awesome lines were delivered by every one of the actors. Downey Jr. was so convincingly funny as the actor who naturally becomes who he is portraying and has an identity crisis. Jack Black plays an incredibly obnoxious character, but that's what makes him great. Jack Black can do anything.. just compare this role with the one he took in The Holiday. Polar opposites! Lastly - Ben Stiller. When does Ben ever disappoint? Never, from what I remember. He did great. Although I should point out that he isn't my favorite actor (maybe it's his demeanor.. voice, movement, etc.), I think he did great.<br/><br/>By the way, Matthew McConaughey plays a supporting role and was hysterical.<br/><br/>Other than that, I found some parts to be a bit slow. Some of the jokes were tired and a bit cliché. I also didn't like the fact that the main villain was a child. Why? I don't know, I guess I thought it was asinine.<br/><br/>Overall, I think it's the best comedy this summer. I recommend it!"
"riffran","8","1","5","1 September 2008"," Overall wonderfully inappropriate
","From the opening all the way to the end, this movie makes fun of darn near every genre of ""war"" movies, and a few other things as well.

If you are easily offended by anything related to race or physical or mental handicap,or even sexual preference don't watch the movie. If you can laugh at yourself as easily as you can laugh with others, and realize that they are spoofing many cultural,historical and ethical themes frequently used as movie fodder by Hollywood, then get the pickles and popcorn, and soda..be prepared to be grossed out, and snort soda out of your nose. The characters in the movie really outdone themselves..Robert Downey Jr. a white American playing a Austrailian, playing a American Black Male, was brilliant!

"Matt_Layden","8","1","5","28 August 2008"," Ben Stiller Should Direct More Films
","After a big movie explosion goes wrong (they didn't even film it) the director is talked into taking his actors of the new film tropic thunder, into the real gritty war world. What the actors think are scenes being filmed for the movie is actually drug criminals and real war.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is a fresh dose of comedy during a time when we have been overloaded with Apatow produced films. Not saying his films are bad, but they do follow a certain path and they all have the same feel. I wanted something different and not something that The House Bunny or the next ""Epic Movie"" could offer. Enter Ben Stiller, who has had some trouble as of late with the films he has been in. Tropic Thunder isn't a big change, but it's a refreshing change and one that I welcomed and enjoyed.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller's previous directing effort was Zoolander. That film is really hit or miss. I found it to be stupid, yet in a funny way. It knew it was stupid, unlike other films that try to be funny and completely miss the tongue in cheek aspects. Where that film made fun of models, Tropic Thunder makes fun of Hollywood. Frm the hilarious trailers at the start to the way people like agents and producers act behind the scenes. I loved the look of this film, it is almost the total opposite of what and how war films are shot. It's too pretty to be a war film and it works with how these characters live in this world. They are oblivious to most things...even when there is a dead body.<br/><br/>The film starts of strong and ends strong as well. It's the middle act where it has most of the problems. Even if you can see the joke coming, you still laugh because of the delivery, good job for the actors on that one. Sure Ben Stiller is paying the same character again, but it works in this film. He manages to make it a little more fresh then stale. I wasn't too impressed with Jack Black, but he does get one of the best jokes in the entire film. (The bit when he is tied to the tree). Robert Downey Jr. is getting the praise here and he deserves it. Being in both Iron Man and Tropic Thunder, in which he steals the entire show, this is his year.<br/><br/>The film is more vulgar and violent then I thought it would be. Most of the gore happens in the opening of the film during the filming of the war movie. It is over-the-top and pokes fun at how blood filled war films are. But it may catch peple off guard who are put off by that sort of thing. There is also quite a bit of swearing, but most of it is from a character who isn't involved in the 'war'. While I found both of these aspects funny for the film, others may not. <br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is decent, I enjoyed it, was expecting a bit more on the parody of war films, we get Platoon, but where's Deer Hunter? I probably enjoyed it more because it pokes fun at Hollywood and the go around of it all. I tend to gravitate towards that style. All the cameos are great. I don't want to ruin any of them because that would ruin the joke. I can see why some people may not like it, it has been done before and may offend some people. I didn't find any of the Simple Jack bits that funny. While you may not think the film is up to par with more intelligent comedies, it is a nice breath of fresh air."
"mjhalta","9","1","5","26 August 2008"," Controversial but exceptional comedy!
","Ben Stiller has done it again with this comedy, he has once again moved to the top of the comedy heap. This movie will become a cult classic it is that good. I have read several of the reviews for this movie some good some bad. It's usually that way for exceptional and groundbreaking movies, some people love them some hate them. This comedy makes fun of a lot of things such as washed up actors that appear in really bad movies, and actors that have to prove that they are great actors by playing a mentally challenged person, and war movies that try to be ""so realistic"". In the end people should wise up and realize that at the core this is a spoof on Hollywood, it is not trying to make fun of blacks or mentally challenged people, it's poking fun at Hollywoods portrayal of them. Example: In the 50's white guys used to play Native Indian roles in Western's. That has since stopped and Natives are used in Native roles as it should be. So why do Hollywood actors and critics and the public still think that it's OK to have the mentally challenged portrayed by normal average people trying to prove that they are great actors. Some have even won Oscars for their performances, this movie pokes fun at that!! Jack Black, Downy, Cruise, and Stiller give great performances and the laughs never stop coming."
"zetes","7","1","5","18 August 2008"," They really need to cool down with movie trailers! Felt like I'd already seen the movie!
","Very amusing big budget comedy about a bunch of superstar actors who think they're making a movie when they're really lost in the jungle and being pursued by machine-gun wielding members of a drug cartel. Ben Stiller plays a huge action star trying to break into drama. Robert Downey Jr. plays a method actor who goes so deep into character that he doesn't break it until the DVD commentary. And Jack Black is a star of fart-themed movies who is addicted to heroin. I laughed a lot at Tropic Thunder, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd hoped I would. Part of it is that they've had so many previews and commercials for the movie, and they've been airing them since April or so, and I've pretty much seen the whole movie. But that might not really be the whole reason, because even the jokes that I hadn't seen - and there were plenty - weren't always making me laugh. And even when I was laughing, I never laughed big. And maybe it's because two other comedies released in the past month, Step Brothers and Pineapple Express, both made my sides split. Yes, even Step Brothers, as stupid as I will admit it was. While I would recommend those two even more, I would also say Tropic Thunder is well worth seeing."
"whoisfletch","7","1","5","17 August 2008"," Almost very clever
","If Ben Stiller never existed, Tropic Thunder could have been a masterpiece. I'm fairly certain it's entirely fair to pin Thunder's failings entirely on Stiller's mainstream comedic sensibilities. After all, it's his character whose arc is the least...(read more) self-aware. In Stiller's mind, he is still a hero in Tropic Thunder, but the actual hero is clearly Jay Baruchel who pulls off a very funny and incredibly likable performance as the only not-yet famous actor in the film within the film. He's put-upon, but delightfully earnest.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, there's some truly great stuff here. I found myself laughing hard and loud more times than I can count, but there would also be gaps where I wouldn't even giggle. If the gags - which are plentiful - aren't working, it's because they are one tweak away from perfection or one toke over the line.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is getting most of the hype here, and it's well-deserved. As Les Grossman, the overweight, bald studio head, Cruise is hilariously crude. It's a great cameo. But then it stops being a cameo, as Cruise just keeps coming back, even dancing to a Ludicrous song over the end credits - a prime example of running a brilliant joke into the ground, something Stiller knows a a lot about.<br/><br/>Still, I have no problem enthusiastically reccomending Tropic Thunder to anyone. When it does work, it can be pretty damn funny."

Robert Downey Jr. really did a hilarious job as Kirk Lazarus and Tom Cruise as well did a fantastic job as Les Grossman. You have so many well known actors like Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr., Jay Barchurel, Nick Nolte, Bill Hader, Tom Cruise, etc. that the entire thing put together just entertains.

"Anonymous_Maxine","9","1","6","28 August 2008"," Never go full-retard!
","Like many movies these days, Tropic Thunder starts with a few previews. One is an advertisement for an energy drink called ""Booty Sweat,"" another is for a belligerent action movie called Scorcher (so good that it commanded five sequels), then there's a low-brow comedy about hugely fat people that communicate entirely through flatulence (lampooning those intolerable and endless endurance tests where Eddie Murphy or Martin Lawrence star as every character in the movie), and finally a religious drama involving homosexual priests. The soundtrack, of course, is by Enigma.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is so overflowing with farcical ideas that they had to include a few theatrical trailers just to get the ideas in there, and what follows is exactly the kind of movie that you would expect to exist in a world that featured such previews.<br/><br/>The story is about three Hollywood movie stars making a dramatic Vietnam film together. Jack Black is the drug addicted Jeff Portnoy, Robert Downey Jr. plays Kirk Lazarus, the token blackface guy, and Ben Stiller plays the curiously named Tugg Speedman, an overrated actor hoping to save his suffering career with this latest cheesy war movie.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a scene on the set of the movie within the movie, including one of the movie's two spoofs of Willem Dafoe's frightening death in Platoon (a tasteless joke that is one of Tropic Thunder's few blunders). Mortally wounded, Tugg is given the obligatory dying words speech where he gets to finally tell Lazarus his true feelings. Unable to get the words out, he calls for a cut. The director wants to keep rolling, Lazarus is getting irritated, and in the ensuing confusion, the pyrotechnics guy (Danny McBride, stealing the show again) accidentally wastes a $4 million explosion. Given that the Director, the also curiously named Damien Cockburn, managed to fall a full month behind schedule within the first five days of shooting, his producer is unimpressed.<br/><br/>Enter Tom Cruise. Oh. My. God. YES.<br/><br/>Cruise plays Les Grossman, a big shot Hollywood producer with no fuse. Lately I have been of the opinion that Cruise's acting career was in genuinely dire straits, given his bizarre behavior in his personal life, but this movie restored my faith in him 100%, he is absolutely brilliant in this movie. He is one of the most watchable characters in the film, even though he is meant to be such an unsightly presence. Someone should win a make-up award just for what they did to his hands!<br/><br/>But, strangely for an action/spoof/comedy, Tropic Thunder is an actor's movie and a writer's movie. The script is loaded with gems and homages that manage to generate laughs without being belligerently perverse and tasteless like the Scary Movies etc.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller deserves enormous credit for his part in the writing and directing, although his performance is one of the only real let-downs in the film. He goes through the motions of his limited repertoire, giving us essentially the exact performance he has played so many times before. It's Zoolander in Vietnam.<br/><br/>Thankfully, Jack Black goes to town with his role. It's clear that he was having a blast making the movie, and it's hard not to join him. But the real show-stopper is Robert Downey Jr, who is so brilliant as the white Australian actor in blackface (the movie's most famous Hollywood jab) that I found myself hoping for a spin off sequel for his character.<br/><br/>More than once, and in true Zoolander fashion, Speedman gets into a deep conversation about how to most efficiently perfect his acting style. Robert Downey Jr. steals every scene it is CLASSIC.<br/><br/>Once in the jungle, the cast gradually realize the reality of their situation, as they become inadvertently involved with a deadly drug ring. We don't learn much about them and they are a confusing bunch, since they are located in Vietnam but look Korean and speak Chinese, and they're headed by a little kid. And what a little kid, man. Holy crap. This kid is like a cross between that child emperor from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and, say, a Tazmanian devil. Oh, and he has lots of guns and a war face that would make Stonewall Jackson cringe. You may find yourself wondering where they found this prodigal psycho- killer. A quick glance at his miniscule filmography will solve that little puzzle. Sesame Street!!<br/><br/>Matthew McConaughey, proud owner of the most difficult last name in Hollywood, has a meaningless bit part as Speedman's airy agent. I don't expect brilliant character depth in a movie like this, but his character is just too obviously thrown in as shock value, which the movie surely doesn't need. He is unconcerned, for example, when Speedman calls him afraid for his life, but flies into an uncontrollable rage when he learns that his client is without access to a working Tivo machine. What the hell?<br/><br/>Then again, Tivo plays a pivotal role in the final act of the film, and not just as product placement, of which Tropic Thunder has prodigious amounts, and which it also lambasts along with a whole slew of other b-movie clichés.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder has the funniest beginning to any movie that I've seen in recent memory, and also the funniest ending. I wanted to cheer as the movie opened, and I left the same way. It's a comedy the likes of which rarely comes along. Pineapple Express is another similarly outstanding comedy currently in theaters, I recommend that you don't miss either of them!"
"meeza","7","1","6","26 August 2008"," Downey Jr. and Cruise are the thunder and the lightning of ""Tropic Thunder""
","Comedy, Tragedy, Parody- ""Tropic Thunder"" does encompass the aforementioned three elements to certain degrees. <br/><br/>Comedy- Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr., Jay Baruchel, and Brandon T. Jackson portray Hollywood thespians who are acting in a ""Platoon""-type war film entitled, what do you know, ""Tropic Thunder"". Stiller is Tugg Speedman, the Hollywood action hero whose latest action film franchise has recently run out of speed. Jack Black plays Jeff Portnoy, the comedic chunky actor who starred in a flatulence-induced comedic franchise called ""The Fatties"" and is trying to prove he has the acting diversity to also do le drama. Robert Downey Jr. is Kirk Lazarus, the acclaimed Academy Award winner whose method acting runs in his blood so much that for his lunatic role in Thunder he goes to the dark side by going through a procedure that pigments his skin color and wants it to quote the Stones ""Paint it Black"". Jay Baruchel plays the youthful rookie actor Kevin Sandusky who has been an avid fan of the aforementioned, but is more level headed than his mentors. And Brandon T. Jackson plays Alpha Chino the rapper turned actor who made his claim to fame by promoting an energy drink called ""Booty Sweat"". When the film's director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) has numerous troubling challenges in working with these prima-donnas, the Hollywood studio bosses take notice and desolate the thespian Thunderous group into the isolated jungle fighting a real war against some Asian drug-ring soldiers. What does not strike thunder to these egomaniacs is that they are no longer shooting a film but in fact are really shooting at them! There are certain mundane misfires to that aspect, as it does get monotonous after a few scenes. But fiery comedic turns by Robert Downey Jr. as Lazarus and an unrecognizable Tom Cruise as an authoritative Hollywood studio boss Les Grossman does salvage ""Tropic Thunder"" to thunderous laughing explosions that are strictly the bomb! <br/><br/>Tragedy- Nick Nolte portraying a former war veteran named Four Leaf Tayback who is also the film's technical adviser was not the four leaf clover ""Tropic Thunder"" needed. It was quite a tragedy to observe Nolte playing the same old anger-induced egomaniac character which he has overkilled in many previous Nolte roles. I also did not observe any relevance to the plot in Danny McBride's performance as Cody, the technical effects guru whose clumsy acts were just a failed effectual effort for laughs that were not special in any comedic technicality. Ben Stiller also directed and co-wrote ""Tropic Thunder"" and somewhere along the way it was a tragedy to watch Stiller get lost in the jungle with the script and direction of the film by sidetracking it with irrelevant scenes that should have been fired out. <br/><br/>Parody- Even though I pulled in a few hard knocks for Stiller, I do commend him for his efforts in deriving the premise of ""Tropic Thunder"". The self-obsessed nature of the film industry were presented to the viewers as messaging that it is part of the fabric nature of making films, and at the end it should not be taken too seriously as long as the cinematic end-product is of above satisfactory material. ""Tropic Thunder"" never reaches the jungles of above satisfactory material but it does land us with some classical parody delights in the work of Downey Jr. and Cruise. *** Average"

But then TT runs out of steam, it's clever concept and it's actors foibles paraded to the point of comedic fatigue and, aside from a remaining handful of insultingly un-PC jabs, the laughs devolve into a declining pattern of chuckles.Regardless of TT's inability to keep the laughs cranked up from beginning to end, Robert Downey Jr flexes chiseled comedic chops that harken back to his priceless supporting work as Wayne Gale in Natural Born Killers. While TT may be the best comedy of the summer, it is far from being one of the best comedies ever, yet in a movie-going comedy desert, TT is a tantalizing mirage worth seeing for RDJ's work alone. It should also be noted Stiller and fellow screenwriter Justin Theroux spent 10 years writing TT and, in true Stiller fashion, they take the pi## out of everything Hollywood deserves to be hated for and never stop to consider how hard they bite the same hands they've been eating out of for years. I might not love TT, but I definitely enjoyed it and have no problem advising friends to do like the TT tagline says: Get Some.<br/><br/>http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/"

","I watched Tropic Thunder (2008) ten years after it came out, so it's certainly possible I was just not viewing it in the right time period or context. That being said, Casablanca still works for me; Tropic Thunder is quite uninspired.<br/><br/>The cast was one of the only redeeming qualities. Ben Stiller was fine in the lead role, everyone else did well. Robert Downey, Jr. was one of two standouts, playing the ""dude playing a dude disguised as another dude"", but the true underrated performer in this film is Tom Cruise. Les Grossman was the most perfect thing about this film. Real quick though, I'd like to point out: gender diversity is a real problem in this film. <br/><br/>The writing was lazy. There are so few jokes that land and the story isn't intriguing. You don't feel anything but distaste for these characters, which isn't supposed to happen.<br/><br/>The direction was somehow lazier. It starts out being meh, but near the end it transforms into ""the opposite of Hitchcock"" territory... I'm saying it's really really really bad. There's no intent or intelligence exhibited, it just feels like a mess.<br/><br/>There are a few moments that land in Tropic Thunder (2008), but ultimately it's plain stupid and lacks proper comedy. A bad piece of satire. (4/10)"

","A spoof within a spoof, within a spoof.

The central topic of a film production is a great idea. The makeup and costuming is absolutely phenomenal here specifically for Tom Cruise and Robert Downey Jr. While on the topic, this movie gets a lot of hate because of Downey's black face which I feel is not fair considering he is not playing an African American but instead playing a character using black face to play an African American.The movie does have funny moments into the movie and the interactions between these very different characters is entertaining. It is a comedy and in that realm I do respect it because it is funny. However I feel like most of the humor doesn't hit me the way I could see it hitting others."

I would've like to have seen more moments when the cast actually thought they were shooting a fight scene, but it was actually a real fight scene; that would've made the movie more intriguing and probably more funny to me.

","For the first time I can recall, Tom Cruise attempted to visually get into a character rather than be the Top Gun pretty boy, as it took me a while to be certain it was him as a balding and stocky chap. This movie kicks off with the filming of a big budget war movie. They are over budget and there is strife on the set. So the director and producer decide to take a new approach a toss the actors into a real world war scenario with hidden guerrilla cameras around the area to get an authentic feel. Turns out the actors encounter actual drug maker vigilantes. Will they break character or figure out the other guys with guns aren't actors? Will the movie actually get produced? This is a slapstick satire on many famous war films over the decades yet it only brought me light smirks rather than hefty chortles. Choppy pacing and average gags didn't help it. Overall, it was a fairly unique slapstick movie with effort put forth with the core story yet many characters were annoying or too strange aside from Jack Black who had some crazy and funny scenes."

","I don't include plot synopses in my reviews as one can find that information elsewhere. Instead, I concentrate on the all around artistic merits of a film, and the quality of its production.  This was a movie I had to make two passes at.  Normally not a huge fan of silly comedy and instead choosing a more cerebral examples of the genre, I started this movie once in 2008 only to put it down for 8 years until I recently pulled it back off the shelf. While I'm not as frothy in my enamor of this movie as many - and certainly not the buddy with whom I finally watched it on its entirety - I will say that I'm glad I stuck with it this time. And I may not have again has I not had an insistent watching partner. It was obvious quickly both the reason why Robert Downey, Jr received a nod for an Oscar nomination and why he was uncomfortable playing his part in the 21st Century version of blackface. But he pulled it off without, I think, being offensive by poking fun at the type of actor who goes to ridiculous lengths to reach the depths of a particular character. Cruise was brilliant, and I'm nobody who usually gushes about Cruise, though when he is ""on"" I find him terribly difficult to ignore. Stiller is typical Stiller. One always knows what one will get from Stiller, who directed as well. Jack Black was uncharacteristically under- the-top while still playing his guy large. The rest of the cast is rounded out by reliables like Bill Hader, Jay Baruchel and Brandon T. Jackson (hysterically as rapper ""Alpa Chino"".) What struck me over an above the sight gags was the budget they dedicated to the project. Nothing was done inexpensively, a sign of respect for the body of work Stiller is beginning to amass. Not only that but at a 1:47 runtime for the theatrical version and another 16 minutes for Stiller' cut, it's long for a film of its ilk. Look for: a hysterically funny scene in which Stiller has a run in with a Panda, the interaction between Jackson and Downey, Jr., and again, Tom Cruise' priceless parody of film producers...absolutely brilliant. In particular look for the subtle yet unmistakable over sized prosthetic arms on Cruise, as well as the redistribution of his hair from his head to his arms and chest. Again, small things making huge differences.  I'll say I thought it a bit long for my taste - a little slapstick goes a long way for me. But other than that it was hard to complain here."

"Gideon24","8","0","1","8 April 2015"," A Triumph for Ben Stiller
","2008's Tropic Thunder was a scathingly dark and roll-on-the-floor funny satire and an on-target look at behind the scenes Hollywood that was a triumph for its director, co-writer, and star, Ben Stiller. This film is on the surface a satire of the film Apocalypse Now and the subsequent documentary Hearts of Darkness and if you watch closely, you will also notice affectionate winks at films like The Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket, Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan, and even Scarface. I love when films make fun of Hollywood and let us in on the joke and Stiller has let us in on the joke with a vengeance here.<br/><br/>The film has a brilliant opening which shows trailers and music videos of the various stars before they begin work on the movie-within-a-movie of the title. The film is then joined on location where it has gone millions over budget, forcing the director to take a new tack and flying the five principal actors to a remote Vietnamese location, at which time the director is accidentally killed, but the lead actor is convinced that it is a hoax and that the director wants them to continue the film on their own. Filming is complicated as the lead actor begins a descent into madness while being kidnapped by a group of Vietnamese drug dealers who he thinks are actors. Things get even messier when the villains mistake our hero for the mentally retarded character he played in a previous movie.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller plays Tugg Speedman, the lead actor whose career has been primarily manufactured through an action franchise called Scorcher. Robert Downey Jr. plays Kirk Lazarus, a five-time Oscar winning Australian actor who has had an operation to alter his pigmentation so that he can play an African American character in the movie. Jack Black plays Jeff Portnoy, a drugged out comic actor making his first foray into the action genre. Brandon T. Jackson plays Alpa Chino, a rap star making his film debut and Jay Baruchel plays Kevin Sandusky, a struggling actor appearing in his first major role.<br/><br/>Watching the interplay between these five characters had me rolling on the floor from opening to closing credits, particularly the exchanges between Lazarus and Chino, as Lazarus seems to be descending into his own mini-madness where he almost forgets that he is Caucasian and how it annoys Chino to no end. Robert Downey Jr. is nothing short of brilliant and just about steals the movie as Lazarus, in a characterization that is so off-the-wall yet steeped in enough realism that the performance earned Downey an Oscar nomination. I lost it every time Chino felt the need to remind Lazarus that he wasn't black. Baruchel made an appropriate voice of reason among the group and Jack Black's character gets funnier as he starts jonesing for drugs. <br/><br/>Mention should also be made of a trio of supporting turns from Danny McBride as the maniacal special effects director, Matthew McConaughey as Tugg's fast-talking agent and especially Tom Cruise, almost unrecognizable but hysterically funny as the producer of the film who thinks Tugg's kidnapping is a hoax and is willing to throw him under the proverbial bus (or rice patty if you will). There's even a classy turn from Nick Nolte as the author of the book the movie is based on.<br/><br/>Stiller's direction is detail-oriented and immediately conjures up the images of the films that are being saluted here. His screenplay with Justin Theroux is brutally accurate in its cynicism as well as its realism and is brilliantly served by a perfect cast. One of the funniest movies I have seen in years that will demand repeat viewings."

","Take a group of coddled, spoiled, self-righteous, over-hyped, and plain dumb actors, stick them in a situation they're not prepared for, and you get Tropic Thunder. While the premise is nothing new, the execution is fast and funny more often than not. Standouts among the cast are Robert Downey, Jr. who literally gets into the skin of the people he portrays, Matthew McConaughey as Ben Stiller's agent, Nick Nolte as a fake military adviser, and Tom Cruise as maniacal--and frightening--producer, Les Grossman. Danny McBride as a half-crazed demolition special effects man and Bill Hader as Tom Cruise's yes-man also score.<br/><br/>The only drawbacks are really Ben Stiller and Jack Black. Stiller is best seen when backing someone else up, while Black is best taken in small doses. When he's called upon to carry a scene, he can't deliver anything but a manic performance.<br/><br/>Still, the cast gives it their best shot and the result is obvious and often very funny. Tom Cruise's dance at the end is the highlight. Worth seeing for the individual performances and the sheer lunacy of it all."

","In many respects Tropic Thunder is merely your average action movie parody. It has lots of pointing and laughing, over-played clichés, over-the-top acting, lampshade hanging and general goofiness. It's also very meta with most of the best jokes being played at expense of actor stereotypes, instead of action ones. And it's this last point which makes this film work. That, and a really good cast of talented actors.<br/><br/>Because deep down this movie is nothing special. It is just as aimlessly random and offensive as most parodies. It never really surprises you or offers you anything new. Still, if you like comedies, it'd serve even without its best parts. What elevates it above mere average, however, is how well the jokes are told. And this is largely thanks to the actors. Robert Downey Jr. especially has received a lot of praise for his portrayal of Kirk Lazarus, an extreme method actor that never breaks character until the filming is completely done. And it just so happens that his character plays a black guy in the film within this film. It's offensive and more than a little awkward, but also extremely funny. The way he speaks cracked me up every single time he opened his mouth. Add in Tom Cruise, Jack Black and so many other A-list names and you start to realize why this film managed to rise above its peers.<br/><br/>Not that the writing is weak either. It's nothing special, as stated, but it has a good sense of timing, the premise is imaginative enough and allows for some good jokes, and it strikes a good balance between character moments and general silliness. Not every joke hits a bullseye, but quite many of them do.<br/><br/>Easily recommended for all fans of action comedies."

The premise of this film is a bunch of actors stuck in a real life warzone and there are some good dialogue exchanges which are funny and carry this film. However, there isn't any moments in this film where you really laugh and nothing happens occasionally where you want either the funny exchanges or the great action. But this film is truly improved by the appearance of Tom Cruise as the businessman in this film he absolutely kills it with his attitude to every situation plus his dance moves are great.

","A rollicking romp-ride that parodies a number of war classics over the course of its runtime and also offers an inside look at Hollywood productions in its own amusing manner, Tropic Thunder is a fabulous blend of brilliant direction, skillful writing & charismatic performances that easily ranks amongst the finest comedies of the past decade.<br/><br/>The story of Tropic Thunder follows a group of actors filming a Vietnam-war memoir on site where the production has already gone over budget & is behind schedule. Things are set in motion when the rookie director, who's unable to control his actors, decides to drop them in the middle of the jungle where the cast continues its act thinking that they are still shooting a movie.<br/><br/>Co-written, produced & directed by Ben Stiller, Tropic Thunder introduces its characters in an incredibly fascinating manner for it begins with a brief ad, which is then followed by faux trailers that introduces each main character in their upcoming flicks, and after that the main feature presentation begins. And from that point onwards, it's simply an unabashedly funny ride to the very end.<br/><br/>The film derives its parodic elements mainly from Platoon & Apocalypse Now and although it's hilarious as hell, it isn't just around for the comic effect only for it also moves the story forward. The dynamic camera-work injects its own energy into the swiftly unfolding storyline but there are still a couple of moments this film could've done without. But the real highlight is the contribution from its cast.<br/><br/>Featuring a star-studded cast in Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr., with additional inputs coming from Brandon T. Jackson, Jay Baruchel, Nick Nolte, Steve Coogan, Matthew McConaughey & Tom Cruise. Stiller is as good in front of the camera as he's behind it and plays the role of a fading celebrity pretty well while Black is very much in his comfort zone and does nicely as a drug-addicted comedian.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr., however, is the best of them all and plays the role of a 5-time Academy Award winning, immensely talented, Australian method actor and his performance as a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude is definitely amongst his finest. The rest of the supporting cast is no slouch & do a good job in their given roles while Cruise simply steals every moment he's in & is quite unrecognisable as the ill-tempered, foul-mouthed studio executive.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Tropic Thunder is a stinging satire on Hollywood that promises loads of laughs over the course of its runtime, brims with creativity, passion & charisma for the most part, and is at its best when the screen is occupied by either Downey Jr. or Cruise. One of the genuinely impressive examples of its genre that's wildly enjoyable, mindlessly entertaining, ingeniously witty & sufficiently satisfying, Tropic Thunder comes delightfully recommended."

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","9","0","1","30 May 2013"," A fun action comedy
","Ben Stiller isn't clueless when it comes to comedy. Stiller is a veteran in this genre and has the experience of directing going back to the late 1980's. So it is no surprise to me that this Platoon (1988) parody of sorts works out really well. The comedy is strong, the actors have an impressive script and the action is definitely there. Out of that, I found only a couple things I didn't like particularly but it shouldn't be that much of a problem to others.<br/><br/>It seems a little confusing but the plot really isn't all that hard to follow. A small group of actors best known for playing their own various roles come together in another movie taking place during the Vietnam War to show the power of human drama. But, they never get to that point - why? Because all of them can't seem to work together. Frustrated because the director's wasting his time, effort and money and, is being harassed by a rude business mogul, he decides to take his uncooperative actors into Vietnam itself and continue filming from there. Little do any of them realize that they are headed to an area filled with real gorilla fighters. That's where things get crazy.<br/><br/>So what kinds of characters do the actors play in this movie? Jack Black plays a drug-addicted actor who can get really delusional if he doesn't get what he wants. Ben Stiller plays a troubled actor who can't seem to get his feet in the right movies. Instead he ends up playing the Hollywood game of sequel after sequel after sequel or in just really bad movies. Last but certainly not least is Robert Downey Jr. who plays multiple roles in one shot. I consider this role (in real life) his most impressive because of how concentrated a person would have to be to perform like this. And it's not like the roles are close to each other either - he's playing Australian, who's playing an African American! That's a controversial step in acting.<br/><br/>The action was nice too in this parody. It may not have been as frequent as the comedy but that's proportional since this is a comedy more than it is an action film. The script written by Etan Cohen and Justin Theroux did a great job. There are so many references to other films like Platoon (1988) and Forrest Gump (1994) that'll make people recollect with nostalgia. And because it is executed in the most hilarious manner, it will also generate a lot of laughs too. Not to mention that the 4th wall is broken a couple times too and Theodore Shapiro's score wasn't too shabby either.<br/><br/>However I did find some parts of the movie a little unrealistic. For example, how can someone survive multiple stabs to the back and shoulders but still be able to move them so easily? The human body can only take so much punishment before it hurts too much to even try to move. And although Jack Black did have some rather funny moments, his character made me more annoyed with him than liked him. He just came off as always in the way. Other than that this movie is a rock solid comedy.<br/><br/>Because Ben Stiller knows how to director a comedy, his direction on this movie propels it far higher than what people might think. Also see it for Robert Downey Jr.'s impressive acting performance."

","Watched movie a dozen times. 1st time, on a date's couch. Needless to say, I wasn't impressed and did not make it through the movie. The lasting impression of the movie was blah. A year later, I was gifted the DVD; I humbly find it pure genius. With the exception of T.C. and Nolte, the performances are each actor's best and among T.C.'s and Nolte's best. Making fun of Hollywood via war film satire (think Platoon meets Monty Python) should, at minimum, interest the socially conscious. The delivery should tickle the funny bone of any person with a pulse. Along with most viewers, I was astonished at what R.D.J. did. I think Downey Jr.'s role stole the show. He played an Aussie actor playing an African-American role. Later, we get treated with a 3rd layer, albeit briefly. R.D.J.'S PERFORMANCE WAS ABOVE THOSE OF MOST GUYS WHO HAVE AN Oscar ON DISPLAY FOR BEST-ACTOR. Period. I think the film is so wonderful in part thanks to the character depth and development being superior to that of those in any comedy. For that, T.T. is my favorite flick regardless of genre, and why the movie seems like a new film almost every time I press play. Note: the commentary is worth watching. Lazerus stay's true to his word on dropping character!"

","This is a type of movie you would watch again after the first time. whether you pop it back into your DVD player or catch it on TV, but you will watch it. this is a out of the ordinary comedy as it features many comedic heroes such as Danny McBride, Ben Stiller and Jack Black. Even though it is a comedy the action played throughout the movie was superbly done. the idea of having actors in a jungle trying to make a movie and yet they are in the real jungle/fight is pretty funny as Ben stiller's character is very stubborn and still believes that the cameras are still rolling. all characters in this movie have their own background and tragedies and they are all struggling to reach a goal."

","Tropic Thunder is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding comedic cast. It is hilarious from start to finish, filled with memorable quotes and ridiculous characters, it's a very satirical movie that isn't afraid to make fun of the film industry. There is a superb cast, with actors ranging from Ben Stiller, to Robert Downey Jr., to Jack Black, to Tom Cruise, but because of this it also felt like some great comedy actors weren't really given enough time to shine, this goes for Steve Coogan, Danny McBride, Bill Hader, among others, they just have such big personalities that I think their characters should have had as well. Robert Downey Jr.'s performance is one of the most unique and clearly challenging roles I have ever seen an actor delver, it's hard to describe but you'll see it when you watch the movie, it's breathtaking and there is no surprise he got an Oscar nomination for it, himself and Tom Cruise stole the show. Packed with big laughs and tons of adventure, I would recommend Tropic Thunder to anyone looking for a good comedy or action film. <br/><br/>A group of prima donna actors are forced to become the war soldiers they are portraying when the main cast member is kidnapped. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Robert Downey Jr."

","I watched this film for only the first time since seeing it in the cinema on TV the other day and had to say I roared with laughter at various points. It is a very clever comedy although it may be a tad too clever for some. Really great to see Nick Nolte (a much underrated actor) on the screen in an ideal part. Shame that Steve Coogan could not have been used longer or better. But for the real star of the film has to be Tom Cruise. Cruise is such a good actor, not that you'd guess that from the parts he has played recently. I really think he should have got a best supporting actor nomination for his portrayal of a cut-throat Hollywood mogul. Worth hunting out the short scene available on YouTube where he deals with ""Yellow Dawn"". If you don't hurt yourself laughing you haven't got a sense of humour. Highly recommended even if you have to rent for an evening."

And by gum, I think it's a work of art, Monet-style. Robert Downey Jr. as an Aussie-turned-dark-skinned hothead actor, Jack Black as an accent-confused pale eel, and of course, the lovable Jay Baruchel as himself, but with a gun! There's an awesome cameo as well, but you probably know that by now. <br/><br/>If you asked me, the ending TiVo scene was too much of a stretch, but that hardly affects the movie at all.

","A celebrity-soaked Ben Stiller comedy that sends up sentimental, over-dramatic war epics and the pretentious Hollywood elite that make their bank on them. Stiller, Jack Black and a blackface-wearing Robert Downey Jr. share the center of the stage as hopelessly detached superstar actors who are unceremoniously dumped into the bush but still believe they're on the set. Each gets their homerun lines and the primary story is lots of fun, but the real stars are the unchained phony movie trailers, advertisements and celebrity cameos that speckle the picture. Tom Cruise in particular is a major scene stealer as the hairy, chunky, balding movie exec with no filter - every single one of his all-too-brief appearances left me aching with laughter and yearning for more. Who knew he had such an intensely funny side? It's among the rare breed of comedies that never stops being hilarious, even for a little while, and one of the most unabashedly funny films I've seen in a long time."

Robert Downey Jr. is hilarious in the first hour, but then you've pretty much seen it. Ben Stiller and Jack Black, same thing. The movie doesn't really have that many jokes, it just thrives on its outrageous atmosphere that you've guessed it, fades after an hour or so.

","When Ben Stiller writes and makes his own stuff it works out well, Zoolander being a prime example. When he works as an actor for hire the results are far more patchy.<br/><br/>Thankfully a couple years ago Stiller had a brainwave that he managed to turn into Tropic Thunder, and while it isn't quite at the level of Zoolander it holds up very well.<br/><br/>Stiller's directing style is quite odd, his films tend to be almost overstuffed with peripheral characters and short scenes that don't seem to move the plot forward that much, thankfully to date this has not clogged his films up too much, but it might be more noticeable in less funny films.<br/><br/>In Zoolander Stiller poked fun at celebrity, the public's obsession with appearances, how clueless the people in front of the camera were, and how easy they were to manipulate. Tropic Thunder might seem like a very different film but in essence it is basically poking fun at actors, how clueless and self absorbed they actually are, and how easily they are manipulated by power brokers behind the scenes.<br/><br/>A massive nameless Hollywood production company is making another Vietnam War movie in the same vein as Platoon and Hamburger Hill, the opening scenes show a pretty close approximation to what anyone who has seen a couple of those movies is used to. Lotsa bullets, explosions and rough and tough soldiers opening up on the ""damn VC"". The film plans to tell the ""true story"" of a small group of soldiers fighting against seemingly insurmountable odds, and was penned by one of the survivors named Four-Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte), who lost his hands in the war, which must have made typing his memoirs an absolute bitch.<br/><br/>The film is extremely big-budget, but it is also running behind time and over-budget even in the early stages. The rookie director Damian Cockburn (Steve Coogan) is having trouble juggling egos and unwanted ideas from his cast of coddled prima-donnas and the bumbling of many of his staff, on top of this he has the studio bosses breathing down his neck in the form of Les Grossman (Tom Cruise), a loud and obnoxious power mad little man who demands results.<br/><br/>After a conversation with Four-Leaf Cockburn decides to shake things up and shoot the film guerrilla style, away from the luxuries and pampering that the film set offersto the night. So with a skeleton crew of basically 5 actors, Cockburn, Four-Leaf and an effects guy they take a helicopter into the deepest jungle.<br/><br/>Now once in the jungle things don't go according to plan, after Cockburn gives the actors their brief and explains how hard things will be he promptly steps on a discarded land mine and explodes. The actors initially don't know if it is real or a trick so they argue for a few minutes before deciding to press on. Unfortunately the explosion did not go unnoticed and the other locals in the area happen to be a vicious drug cartel hell bent on defending their turf.<br/><br/>When the drug gang attacks initially the actors go along with thinking it is simply another scene for the film, except one by one they realise that not all is well, except Lazarus who is 100% method 100% of the time.<br/><br/>Meanwhile back in the US of A the production company have decisions of their own to make, whether to leave Speedman for dead and claim insurance for the entire botched film or to try to find him. In between is Speedman's semi-loyal agent Rick Peck (Mathew McConaughey), who is initially steadfast but open to bribery.<br/><br/>The finale is well made and superior to many actual action films, there are perhaps too many jokes, or at least some of them fall flat, and the truth comes out regarding many of the combatants which in some cases is more unexpected than others.<br/><br/>The film isn't overlong at a tick under two hours but could definitely use some trimming, the US production company scenes seem extraneous but I guess if you can get Tom Cruise to sacrifice his good looks you make the most of it! (Damn right I'm being sarcastic.) All in all a very funny film with some excellent characters that are enhanced by the quality of the actors behind them, Robert Downey Jr earned justified praise for his Lazarus character, I just can't help wondering how he would go with the drug-crazed Portnoy role, but that might be the bitch in me.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is by no stretch the best film ever but if you're looking for a comedy with some solid action scenes you could do a hell of a lot worse.<br/><br/>P.S. I dunno if the beginning or end of the review suits more but just like the Grindhouse films there are some hilarious fake trailers and ads at the start of the film, and just like Grindhouse they are some of the best bits in the film.<br/><br/>Final Rating - 8 / 10. Stiller should stop being a monkey-boy actor for hire and stick to making his own films. They turn out so much better."
"Eternality","7","0","1","23 December 2010"," Tropic Thunder has many rough edges to be smoothened out, and Stiller's direction could have been more polished. Nevertheless, this is still the spoof film to beat.
","Tropic Thunder is director Ben Stiller's third feature length film after The Cable Guy and Zoolander. More popular in front of the camera than behind one, Stiller earns his dough mainly from doing hit comedies such as The Royal Tenenbaums and There's Something About Mary. His films can range from the really funny to the not-so-funny-that-it-is-funny; which is not much of a difference actually since his acting chops are limited to only one genre. I have observed that since the start of last year Stiller's acting output has been on a decline, making increasingly low-value comedies like The Heartbreak Kid.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder in which Stiller also stars keeps him afloat for the time being. It is a box-office success in America. That is unsurprising because it is also arguably the best 'parody film' in recent years. Tropic Thunder erases the cinematic nightmare inflicted by hopeless spoof flicks such as Disaster Movie, Epic Movie and Meet The Spartans that have been populating our screens. Despite the critical stigma that surrounds these kinds of films, Stiller has been mostly successful in attempting to make fun of the war genre. Oliver Stone's Platoon, Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, and most notably, Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now have become the latest movies to get the spoof treatment.<br/><br/>Stiller's inexperience as a director shows in Tropic Thunder. There are scenes which could have been left out, including two supposedly funny song-and-dance sequences in the middle and at the end, which in addition to being jarring in a (spoofed) war film, remains unnecessary to the film's objective. Tropic Thunder's screenplay is not tight enough; narrative transitions are filmsy and apart from Robert Downey Jr., the other actors' characters remain thinly developed. That being said, Downey Jr. gives an excellent performance by playing Kirk Lazarus, an Aussie method actor who undergoes facial surgery to transform into a black African-American. Because of this, there was a controversy during the film's initial release as it was seen by some as a pro-racism stunt. Nevertheless, Tropic Thunder survived the backlash.<br/><br/>There are disturbing images of bloody decapitated heads and limbs which are almost mandatory in a war picture. Tropic Thunder plays on this and viewers' expectations, deliberately upping the gore and ""eww!"" factor with sprinkles of black humor added in. Don't miss the start of the film because there is a farcical pre-movie trailer segment which although is separate from the actual film, helps to introduce the main players of Tropic Thunder and set the mood for a rollicking good two hours ahead. Tropic Thunder has many rough edges to be smoothened out, and Stiller's direction could have been more polished. Nevertheless, this is still the spoof film to beat.<br/><br/>GRADE: B- (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"

","When I got this I wasn't sure what to expect, I only bought it because it was very cheap. I'm glad I did get it though as it was hilarious. I was a little unsure at the start when the characters were introduced by showing trailers for the characters previous films although in retrospect it did serve to quickly introduce them and let us know the sort of performers each of them were; Ben Stiller is a Hollywood leading man who has fallen out of favour after a string of superhero sequels, Jack Black is known for films where he dons a fat suit and plays an entire family and Robert Downey Jnr. is a method actor who is willing to go further than most to get into the character he is playing.<br/><br/>When the film proper starts we find the characters playing parts in a big budget Vietnam war movie directed by Steve Coogan; unfortunately he blows that budget on a pyrotechnic spectacular which he didn't even catch on film. Threatened with having the project shut down he decides to turn it into a low budget more realistic film shot on hand held video and cameras hidden in the jungle. To this end he takes the cast into the jungle and explains to them what he expects them to do. He then treads on a old land mine and is blown to bits. Most of his cast think this was just a special effect and to Stiller even laughs and plays with his head thinking it is a fake. As they go off to make their film they don't realise that area of jungle is run by a drug dealer's private army. So sure is Stiller that everything is part of the movie he doesn't realise what is going on even when he is captured and they start to torture him.<br/><br/>This film was littered with hilarious moments although some may offend some viewers. Of the main cast Robert Downey Jnr. stands out as an actor who went so far as to get his skin darkened so he could play a black man... much to the understandable annoyance of a real black actor who thought blacking up had ended years ago. It was a pity that Steve Coogan's character got killed off so soon as he was very funny. Tom Cruise was also impressive as the producer, he was almost unrecognisable in a bald wig and heavy make up. Talking of make up credit must go to that department for the work the did on Tom Cruise and Robert Downey Jnr. as neither looked like themselves. The film is obviously full of clichés but that is all part of the kind of films they are spoofing. Over all I thought it was a very funny film which got close to going too far and causing offence without quite doing so, although different people will have different views on that."

"daryl42-1","8","0","1","9 April 2010"," Dumb gags, over-the-top violence, and a straight shot into Hollywood's heart.
","7.5<br/><br/>When I was in my early teens, I was fond of war movies. I would watch any war film I could get my hands on. I couldn't get enough of it. It didn't matter how old they were, or in what setting the films took place in. Just as long as I could get my adrenaline fix. I enjoyed the atmosphere. Twentieth century Europe and Asia all looked vaguely familiar. Perhaps because I have seen it portrayed so many times. But it wasn't until the fireworks show started that things got interesting. As soon as the combat began, as soon as the shells started to land, the grenades started to go off, the rounds were fired, that's when I knew I was watching a war film. And they were really all the same film. Sort of like episodes of the same drama. They took place in different locations and times, and the opposing sides were often switched around, but it was the same thing every time. Men in conflict using (usually) ballistics and explosives to suppress each other. <br/><br/>But, why was it so appealing to me at that age? I felt empathy and sympathy towards the characters, both people and groups of people, such as nations. However, I also really wanted to see them blow each other up. I knew that it was fake, and I also knew that I never really wanted to see something like that in real life. Or did I? Maybe I just didn't want to see it happen to someone I knew. The matter is, Hollywood is permeated with war movies. People of all ages (especially younger ages, I believe) are attracted to these films. After seeing so much violence, one becomes immune to it. He no longer feels any empathy, and soon loses even sympathy. He does not really lose the excitement anymore, but it is toned down. He might start to feel like the violence is fun, or even funny. And in order to gain the former level of excitement, the violence needs to be toned up. Until that reaches the extent of its power.<br/><br/>Cue Tropic Thunder. Ben Stiller, who directed, produced, co-wrote and starred in the lead role, first found the idea for Tropic Thunder while working on Empire Of The Sun, which was released in 1987. He found it funny how actors and artists like to portray war in movies, but that they will probably never understand what true war and combat is like. Tropic Thunder is exactly that. A parody of Hollywood itself, specifically in terms of war movies. In this aspect, it excels. It is funny, yes. Is it violent? Very. Does it successfully paint a picture of Hollywood and its obsession with violent spectacles and combat? I think so. The cinematography in the film is excellent. It looks, sounds and feels like a true war film. It might even be mistaken for one.<br/><br/>However, it's worth nothing that Tropic Thunder is good, but not great. Yeah, I know, anyone can sit here and say that about anybody's hard work. And I admire the hard work of all people involved in film-making. The camera sometimes turns around on the crew itself and films the actual crew of Tropic Thunder, who is supposed to be filming ""Tropic Thunder"", the film that is being filmed in the movie. This is only mildly ridiculous compared to some things in the movie. Tropic Thunder's plot is very predictable. What you expect this movie to offer you is probably very close to what it actually does offer. It has dumb gags, over-the-top violence, and a straight shot into the heart of Hollywood. <br/><br/>One thing that disappointed me and kept me far away from the film for two years, and also managed to get me to skip the theatrical release, was that the film takes the violent jokes too far. In my taste, probably because I have become so conditioned by my early teen years that what I should be feeling towards the portrayal of war in any medium is empathy and sympathy, it is taken too far. I saw the unrated version, where they take it just a little bit further, apparently. It was a turn off for me, and I really didn't find myself laughing until later on in the movie. This is very important if you are the type of person that is affected by the realistic (in terms of special effects) portrayal of violence and war.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is a good movie. It is also a funny movie. However, it has it's shortcomings. It takes the violence a bit too far for some people's tastes. Adding in fart jokes and jokes about retarded people doesn't help either. However, it manages to retain some charm, and deliver at least a laugh or two. In my opinion, the film is at its best when Speedman's agent finds himself in a dilemma as to whether remain faithful to his actor, or sell him out for undeserved riches. That is what I had hoped Tropic Thunder would be, but I guess they just wanted to have fun with this one. But that's alright, and so is Tropic Thunder, considering my expectations of it. It's alright. (Note: The cinematography work done by John Toll is exceptional.)"

It's pretty cool to see some of the unexpected actors who show up here, and they all have spectacular on-screen chemistry with each other. Tropic Thunder works as a comedy just as well as it works as a spoof of actors who submerge themselves to the point of foolishness in their roles, in pursuit of accolades and awards.

"tomimt","8","0","2","13 February 2010"," Well made war spoof
","Movie spoofs are a difficult genre, as if they are made to spoof very recent movies they usually work only a couple of years, if the movies spoofed in them fade away fast. So in a sense it's much more safer to do a spoof of a genre by using classic elements from genre movies that people have remembered for years and will most likely remember in the future as well.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is a comedy, that takes its humor from Hollywood stereotypes and Vietnam war movies in general and that is a smart move as I would reckon jokes about half crazy method actors, sexually insecure rap artists, money grubbing producers and drugs popping funny men are always valid. Most direct movie jokes are ripped from movies that are in the general knowledge of most movie viewers, like Platoon and Saving Privare Ryan and the other jokes are in general made from material that doesn't require vast movie knowledge.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller has managed to direct a well cast, well written movie, in which we see some actors in very untypical roles, like Tom Cruise as an obnoxious movie mogul, while some just seem to parody them shelves, just as it seems to be with Robert Downey, who plays a part of a method actor taking his commitment to a role a bit too far.<br/><br/>If you like good movie based comedies with some bit more edged humour, you might like Tropic Thunder as well.

And you'll never predict what's coming next.<br/><br/>On top of this, brilliant performances, especially by Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>It's enough of an upper to pull you out of the black depression you get when you've just seen The Deer Hunter.<br/><br/>I'll give Tropic Thunder a Star Wars style *classic* 10 out of 10, not something I do lightly or often."

It's a really good film, great characterisations and the opening sequence is inspired (I want to see 'Satan's Alley' lol) All the performances are great, standout is Robert Downey Jr and Tom Cruise is a hoot as Les Grossman. There are things in it that could be considered disrespectful, Simple Jack comes to mind, but, look at them in context and you can see that they are not meant to offend, but, to illustrate how certain roles win Oscars. The use of the word 'retard' in one scene actually illustrates the ignorance of the characters rather than aiming to offend us, in my opinion at least.<br/><br/>There is one gross out scene near the start that I felt was carried a little too far and I could have done without regarding Damian Cockburn, but, aside from that I enjoyed this movie for what it was, no brainer fun that was at the end of the day, a parody.<br/><br/>It would have got more points if Ben Stiller hadn't been his usual annoying self."

","It is said that one who laughs at ownself laughs the loudest. It is absolutely true in the case of Hollywood. Nobody makes more fun of Hollywood than Hollywood itself. Tropic Thunder can be called a satirical, insane and sometimes meaningless no brainer spoof on Hollywood war movies. The start of the movie itself is absolutely hilarious which shows some trailers of upcoming movies with actors who are the protagonists of the movie. The story is about four popular actors - One a black rap artist, one an action hero who has made 6 sequels of his original action hit, one comedy star who does 'farty' movies and one classical actor who has won the Oscars 5 times. All these actors come together for a war movie based on original facts written by a supposed Vietnam veteran. How These actors get into some real trouble during shooting and how they come out of it is the movie. The scenes and dialogues between the leads gives the humorous touch . The jokes are full of satire and intelligence. They poke fun of Hollywood trends and the Academy Awards. There are some instances in the movie when you may think 'What crap is this'? But spoofs are not meant to be intellectually motivating anyways, so view them as a good 1-2 hour timepass.<br/><br/>Acting is surprisingly good for a spoof movie. Ben Stiller and Robert Downey Jr. are the life of this movie. Jack Black does his usual stuff. Tom Cruise has a special appearance (Literally a special ""appearance"") in the movie. You have to watch closely to recognize him. He has done comedy efficiently proving that he is a versatile actor. In short, a great one time watch .<br/><br/>Rating : 8/10"

It begs the burning question: ""Who IS Kaiser Sose?""<br/><br/>That said, I give myself bonus points for finding Tom Cruise before the credits.

","This movie is downright hilarious and the main highlight of this film has to be Robert Downey, Jr performance portraying a black guy when he is really white, it was just so memorable and funny. So we got ""Tropic Thunder"" which is a parody of Hollywood parodying itself and a bit of a parody of some old war movies, where you get a bunch of different stereotypical actors from the Oscar nominated actors, to action star, to the comedian, to the rapper that is a wannabe actor all to make one Vietnam movie but the director just can't handle these self absorbed actors and the movie is about to be shut down and out of desperation he takes the advice of the consultant John ""Four Leaf"" Tayback(Nick Nolte). Who suggest he put the actors in the real jungle environment and shoot it live and it's here where the actors cross paths with real drug gangs, but don't recognize the danger cause they think it's all part of the movie and crazy stuff happens from there on as well. This has got to be one of the funnies movies I have ever seen, and this is definitely the way to parody Hollywood cause it really works. Robert Downy, Jr brought his game to this movie and more and it is what makes this movie hysterical, with it's crude but clever humor. Now the people that find a white man acting like he is black to be insulting but that isn't the case for this film and it's just funny without it being insulting. I was in the theaters and there was quite a lot of black people and even they were laughing out loud. Every other actors in this movie was pretty funny as well, even some cameos even by Tom Cruise who plays the role of a executive producer and does a obnoxious but funny job, while acting insane, acting...maybe. This would have still been a funny comedy without Robert Downey, Jr's character but because he is in it, it makes the movie amazingly laugh out loud hysterical.

"sddavis63","7","0","1","1 September 2009"," A Good Spoof Movie
","Because Hollywood sometimes (or often) comes across as far too full of itself, I have always enjoyed the so-called ""spoof"" movies, when Hollywood engages in a bit of self-deprecating humour about how silly the whole business can sometimes be. I didn't think that ""Tropic Thunder"" was the best spoof movie I've ever seen, but it was pretty good and it did point out some of Hollywood's excesses. Actually, that happened right from the start when we were given a series of fake ""trailers"" and ""previews"" of movies that starred the actors who were in the fictional ""Tropic Thunder."" I especially enjoyed the trailer for ""Scorcher VI,"" starring Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller). How did it go? ""He made a difference five times before. Now he's going to make a difference again. But this time it will be different!"" So the movie caught my attention right from the start. The actual story revolves around a collection of stars shooting a movie about the Vietnam War. Convinced that they're not giving it their all, the decision is made to drop the whole bunch of them into the jungle to let them get the feel of the place. It's sort of ""Celebrity Survivor Extreme!"" Into the mix comes a drug ring led by a Vietnamese kid who thinks the actors are DEA agents and sets out to eliminate them, but it takes a while for the stars to actually realize this is happening for real.<br/><br/>In all honesty, the movie wasn't hilarious. Amusing is probably more the word I would use for it. Stiller was good, as was Jack Black as ""Jeff Portnoy,"" but the real gem here was an over the top performance from Robert Downey, Jr as Australian actor and 5 time Oscar winner Kirk Lazarus, who is nevertheless so desperate for a part that he undergoes pigment alteration surgery to become a black man. In the words of actor Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson): ""they had one good part in here for a black man and they gave it to Crocodile Dundee!"" Downey was superb here in a complicated part: after all, he wasn't a white man playing a black man, he was a white man playing a white man playing a black man! There's a lot of good fun contained in this movie. It may not be the greatest ""spoof"" movie ever made, but it's still a pretty good one. 7/10"
"hall895","9","0","1","1 July 2009"," Oh, the hilarity!
","This movie is outrageous. And a touch absurd. OK maybe more than just a touch absurd. Turns out there can be great fun in absurdity because this movie is utterly hilarious. Writer/director/star Ben Stiller has crafted a film which is dead-on perfect in its skewering of the Hollywood industry. Imagine that, Hollywood producing a big-budget motion picture which points out the absurdity of the Hollywood culture which produces big-budget motion pictures. Well played Mr. Stiller. Well played indeed.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is a laugh riot right from its very beginning. Actually the laughs start before the film itself properly begins with a series of fake trailers which introduce us to our four main characters, the actors who will set out to make the greatest war movie ever. There's Brandon T. Jackson playing rapper Alpa Chino who sees his role in the film as an opportunity to promote his energy drink more than anything else. Stiller plays Tugg Speedman, a Stallone kind of action hero attempting to save his career after a foray into serious acting went less than well. Jack Black plays Jeff Portnoy who specializes in flatulence humor and who has a nasty heroin habit. And then there is Robert Downey Jr. who ultimately steals the show with his portrayal of Australian Oscar-winning method actor Kirk Lazarus. Lazarus is white. The character he has signed on to portray is black. So Lazarus has undergone pigmentation alteration to make himself black. Yes that is as stupid as it sounds. And the ultimate effect is funny as can be.<br/><br/>Anyhow the filming of the greatest war movie ever does not go according to plan and the director decides to film guerrilla-style in the jungle. Unfortunately that plan gets blown to bits. Hilarity ensues as our actors wander through the jungle and find themselves in the middle of a conflict that's all too real. The plot really is absurd but it works perfectly. So many funny moments, so many memorable lines, so many great performances. Downey shines as the white man playing the black man, Lazarus seemingly having convinced himself he really is black. His back and forth with Jackson's Alpa Chino, a real black man, is priceless. Stiller is very good as well. Black's character comes off as a bit of an afterthought but he's OK with what he's given to work with. And so many other familiar faces pop up as well. Most memorably there's ""that guy"" playing studio executive Les Grossman. Oh dear Lord is he funny. All in all Tropic Thunder is a brilliantly conceived and brilliantly executed comic treat. You will see few movies which are any funnier."

","Sure, this isn't the funniest movie Ben Stiller has been in, but I still thought it was pretty good. Robert Downey Jr and Tom Cruise steal the movie with 2 great characters. Downey plays an Oscar winning actor whom really gets into his roles. In this war movie, he's gone black both in skin color and the way he talks. It's funny. And Cruise plays the head of the movie studio and all he does is cuss and be an *sshole. It's very funny.<br/><br/>The movie is about this group of actors whom are in Vietnam to film a movie. In order to make it more realistic, the director takes the actors into the jungle. They have cameras and explosives already set up. So, the actors believe it's part of the movie, however, there is a group of drug dealers that are really shooting at them and capture a few of them. Stiller, is Tug Speedman, sort of washed up action star whom is playing the lead. The way he talks in character is very funny. Jack Black is the dope head whom is suffering withdrawals in the jungle. Some unknown is Alpha Chino, a rapper whom raps a rather dirty song: I love the *****.<br/><br/>The director steps on a mine and Tug thinks it is fake and picks up his head and does all this gross stuff. It was gross but I found myself laughing. Another funny scene was Kirk telling Tug don't go retard all the way, that's why you didn't win the Oscar.<br/><br/>Matt Mcconhay plays Tug's agent, has some funny scenes. But Nick Nolte was better as the crazy war vet that wrote the book Tropic Thunder. But we learn Nolte's character isn't telling the whole truth, which was funny.

I'm going to have to watch it a second time, at least, to get all the references, because I'm sure that I missed many follow up lines while I was laughing at the one before it.<br/><br/>A good litmus test for this movie was my wife, who will not laugh at a movie filled merely with potty humor ... at all. She didn't know what to expect, and was frowning at me that I still had this playing after the faux trailers at the beginning, and especially after the gratuitous gore in the opening filming sequence. THEN some dialog caught her attention, and she started paying attention. Before long we were both howling, frequently. After the movie, she looked at me and said, ""I did NOT expect to be laughing at that movie so much!""<br/><br/>The sequence where Robert Downey chides Ben Stiller for an earlier role where he went ""full retard"" is, honestly, some of the best comedy repartee since some newsroom scenes in ""His Girl Friday"".<br/><br/>Crude at times?

This was just a pretty average movie all around, it left little impression on me. I would say the only times I got a slight chuckle out of it were during the bits with Stiller playing the fictional retarded character, and even Tom Cruise's guesting bit as a bald ball-buster was more inspired than anything else... though it was obvious that Cruise was ""just playing a part"" and didn't really come off as authentic. ** out of ****"

Dialog sequences were overlong and had no real point to them, especially for viewers not totally immersed in modern pop culture. A shame really, because there was potential.

And yes, you will be singing Apla Chino's song for a long time after the movie ends."
"TheUnknown837-1","6","0","1","2 January 2009"," it does have its moments and some of its moments are classic, but unfortunately they do not outnumber the defects and flaws
","Comedian Ben Stiller seems to be a very popular celebrity amongst people in my age category. Me personally, I think he's a talented comedian in several regards I just wouldn't call him one of my favorites because I haven't seen a single movie with him that I liked or recommend. As an actor, he's good. As a director, he's getting there, but he's not quite there. And that's basically my opinion of his acting/direction job in Tropic Thunder.<br/><br/>This cornball action-comedy is about a cast of a war movie (Ben Stiller, Robert Downey Jr., Jack Black, etc) who are dumped in the real war zones of Vietnam and end up actually having to fight for survival, in the weirdest methods possible and the entire time, they are recorded by hidden cameras their unhappy director (Steve Coogan) set up. War veteran Nick Nolte watches from behind the scenes.<br/><br/>Now I am giving Tropic Thunder a negative review and I do not recommend it. But I don't abhor the film. I just don't think it's very good. Yes, it has its moments. In fact, it has some classic moments. There were many scenes where I erupted with laughter and I have to give credit to Robert Downey Jr. He stole the show with his performance. The lines they gave him, given to another actor, would have been okay, but Robert Downey Jr. makes it work well. He's the star, not Ben Stiller. Also, Tom Cruise was undeniably hilarious in this film as well. But while there are some moments that did make me laugh and there is some charm in this film, I must admit there are a lot of scenes that do not work as well. Many jokes that weren't funny, many scenes that serve no purpose in the film. As a matter of fact, the pacing is very off. It's too long by about fifteen or twenty minutes. And that is because there are some ludicrous, boring scenes that could not be excised because they play important levels in the so-called ""plot"" of the film. And as for the movie's profanity, it's way over the top.<br/><br/>There are some good elements. I liked all of the homage made to Hollywood and classic war and action films and directors and I liked the performances, but ultimately Tropic Thunder fails. It's an okay movie. Strictly okay. Worth seeing once, but not one that I imagine people will be watching over and over again."

","This movie is perhaps the worst movie I have seen in years. There have been some Ben Stiller movies I have enjoyed but, this one has to be condemned. Ridiculous plot, ridiculous characters, and about the only surprise is Tom Cruise being in the movie in the first place as some sort of foul mouthed studio executive.His disguise is impressive and a viewer would have to wonder who the actor is. Just so pointless though. Watch the trailers and you have seen the movie. I suppose Nick Nolte, who is in this as well as another ridiculous character, has to scrape the bottom of the barrel these days due to his publicized problems some years ago. This movie is not worthy of his considerable talents that I have enjoyed over the years. This is a really poor movie.

","This film was probably a lot more fun to make than it is to watch (for people not immersed in Hollywood culture anyway). Numerous actors get to ham it up, quite well on most occasions but the film serves as nothing more than an excuse for actors to commit the craziest stuff they can think of (and get away with) to film. Robert Downey Jr. playing a black character right out of the 70's? Ben Stiller playing a range of roles from a ""full"" retard to Charlie Sheen in Platoon? Tom Cruise playing an obnoxiously aggressive bald fat guy? It's all here but the question is, is it fun to watch? For me the answer was moderately so, so overall this collection of acting had little substance and made for an unsubstantial viewing experience. I've seen much less enjoyable comedies but from the IMDb rating and the cast, I couldn't help feeling that there should have been more in store. I will give it credit for being watchable, not sinking to any real lows and not running out of ideas 3/4 of the way through which gives it enough points to bring it up to an average comedy. Perhaps for me this is a lesson in having heightened expectations."

(I suppose there is irony if that was the case - given the plot's constant ribbing of insecure actors). I do appreciate what Stiller is trying to do and I think it will be perfected by the next few movies he produces. I just hope that he doesn't find it too exhausting and draining. Keep going you are on the right track. BTW: I'm really impressed with the buff Ben - wow!

"brando647","9","0","3","30 November 2008"," One of the Funniest Films from 2008...
","I've noticed that most of the reactions I've gotten from people regarding this film were at one extreme or the other: they either love it or hate it. I'm surprised at some of the negative feedback I've read for this movie, seeing as I found it to easily be one of the funniest movies of 2008. Every time I watch this film, I enjoy it more and more as I find something new to laugh at. The film follows a cast of problematic actors in Vietnam and the director who's having a hard time keeping his film together; so, as a last resort, the director takes his actors into the jungles to give it an aspect of ""realism"" and the men find themselves pulled into a battle with a local drug cartel.<br/><br/>I guess some people have a problem with the fact that the movie isn't what most people are expecting. For those going to the film for a general spoof on war films, you're barking up the wrong tree. While this movie does that to an extent, it's primarily a satire of the Hollywood system and all those involved...self-centered actors, sycophantic agents, iron-fisted studio heads, etc. The humor in the film is derived from the clashing of these outlandish personalities and their need to overcome their petty insecurities and crutches to survive. Of course, the film does have plenty of the raunchy humor that's expected, but a lot of the funniest moments come from the situations and the awesome performances.<br/><br/>Seriously, this movies has one of the funniest casts I've seen in a while. Ben Stiller (who also directed and co-wrote) is fading action superstar Tugg Speedman who sees this film as a means of reviving his career. Normally, I'm not a huge fan of Stiller's work but this movie changed my opinion on that. Jack Black is Jeff Portnoy, an actor famous for multi-role, gross-out comedies and a heroin addiction. While a lot of people though Black's role was pointless here, I thought he added some great moments (""Let's do the yak...""). My personal favorite in the film is Robert Downey Jr. as Kirk Lazarus, the award-winning actor who goes through a pigmentation-altering surgery to play the squad's leader. Downey stole every scene he was in and was easily the funniest aspect of the movie with his character's racial incompetence (especially when he got into it with Brandon Jackson's Alpa Chino). The movie also has an awesome supporting cast, particularly Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, and Nick Nolte...Nolte's was freakin' awesome when he went nuts with the flamethrower.<br/><br/>As one of my favorite comedies from 2008, I've completely recommend watching Stiller's film. Just make sure you know what you're going into and watch it for what it is. As long as you can do that, this movie is hilarious (especially the director's cut of the film). Everyone involved in this film did an awesome job and I really hope to see them all pull together in the future for further projects."

Danny Mcbride delivers with another performance along the line's of his others.( his roles in Hotrod, Pineapple Express,Drillbit Taylor) And although I as far from a fan of Tom Cruise as you can get, but he was very funny.

It was funny in Zoolander and kind of funny in Dodgeball, but seriously how many times can you play the same role and still be funny. Luckily, Zoolander wasn't the be all and end all of this movie, Downey Jr. carried the embarrassing Zoolander on his back, while the other supporting actors and Cruise/McConaughey did a fantastic job. In the end Stiller deserves some credit for making a very funny movie, however, maybe he should have left himself out of the script and left the comedic acting up to someone else. Unfortunately, for Stiller, what could have been a great all time comedy became a very funny movie in the year 2008."

","I had been anticipating this movie for a long time before it was released in the theater and it did not disappoint at all. This came to be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen and it is highly entertaining. The cast is, of course, ridiculous. Ben Stiller's movies are always enjoyable to me. That includes both his acting and directing. The controversial ""retard"" scene was blown way out of proportion and context. Don't people understand what the point of that scene was? Robert Downey Jr. was completely hysterical. How he stayed in character cracked me up and even the more subtle things he did and facial expressions were very humorous. Jack Black had a lot of funny stuff as well as a drugged out wacko. The scene where he is tied to a tree was quite hilarious. All the other supporting cast did a great job. I didn't even realize Les Grossman was played by Tom Cruise until halfway through the movie. I finally bought the DVD and watching the movie again knowing that it was Tom Cruise made it even funnier, if that was possible. It was great to see him play a role like that and it makes me wonder why he does not do more comedy because I was seriously surprised and impressed. Overall, I really think people that are offended by this movie needs to examine what this movie is really about. The actors in this movie are almost poking fun at themselves and Hollywood in general. It's about the personalities, egos, and overblown production of big Hollywood movies. So I do not understand people taking offense to the movie, but if you truly just did not enjoy the movie, then that's your opinion. Though, I do not see how that would be possible. Some other reviews mentioned this movie had both smart humor and ""dumb"" humor. This is absolutely true and was a big reason why the movie worked so well for me. It had both obvious and blatant jokes as well as many subtleties. So if you want to see one of the funniest movies that has come out in a very long time and can enjoy the movie for it was supposed to be, you are in for many laughs and a real treat. I give this one a 10."

","Why do so many Ben Stiller movies, along with Will Ferrell movies, have to be so OTT and goofy? <br/><br/>I was cautiously enjoying Tropic Thunder right up until a certain point (about a third of the way in)... As up until then, the film had been entertaining and tongue-in-cheek without being pointlessly wacky But then the 'semi-spoof' tone really started to take hold.<br/><br/>Will Ferrell's films are perhaps better examples of the semi-spoof phenomenon though, as they often seem to get stuck between being a decent comedy and a goofy spoof comedy (a spoof comedy like some Wayans brothers drivel) Modern comedy, stuff made for the masses, has a tendency to sink into a swamp of unnecessary silliness...<br/><br/>Now, I'm not against OTT scenes in general I like that stuff when it's done well I just hate the way that everything sort of becomes nonsensical by the end of these films- as though having lots of zany antics is the primary goal Good comedies (IMO) are things like Groundhog Day, Trading Places, Midnight Run, Ghostbusters etc etc Films that are very funny but don't make a complete joke of the central concept by repeatedly descending into spoof...<br/><br/>As I say, I was really getting into Tropic Thunder as a decent comedy film, especially the dialogue between Stiller and RDJ etc Yet rather than things getting more interesting and characters really getting fleshed out, things just got sillier and less plausible at every turn. In the end, despite lots of potential and some amusing moments, the film wasn't at all satisfying...<br/><br/>I know that some people will be thinking to themselves ""But it's a comedy! Just enjoy it!"" Or something But I've already explained why I didn't really enjoy it I want to watch a DECENT comedy for a change! Not just the next in a long line of eye-roll inducing semi-spoofs <br/><br/>And 'decent' doesn't mean it has to be all straight-laced and meaningful (Happy Gilmore has got lots of silly things in it for instance, but I still enjoyed that) I just mean a funny film that also has a passable story and a consistent tone.<br/><br/>I felt Tropic Thunder started out quite strong It seemed funny and 'knowing' sort of like a big budget version of Ricky Gervais' series 'Extras' by the end though, it felt more like Wayans brothers material."

The usual Fish Out of Water scenario, but this time the actors are forced to learn how to learn how to play military personnel since not one of them is able to do so and somehow end up being put down too far away from the movie set. Stiller is one of those actors that you really like him, or just tolerate him, or you cannot stand is grandstanding. It seems lately that most of his movies, other than Night at the Museum, he's showing off his great body. I had to turn on the English subtitles because I could not understand a lot of what the actors were saying, and this was not just Downey's part. Black, I do not know what to say, as he seems to get stuck in the same type of roles and I sure would love to see him branch out more. There's a lot of talent there and I think it's getting wasted. Same with Stiller. Diversify guys! But the premise of the movie is, as stated above, your proverbial fish out of water story, with a lot of special F/X tossed in. Also a lot of noise, which drowns out the dialogue. The story goes along according to plan, and you can figure out what will happen in the next scene fairly easily. This is not to say that the movie does not entertain. I think that was the main point. Forget a plausible storyline and believable characters and just let loose. I got the feeling that a lot was improvised, and if so, then maybe these were the areas in the film that were the best. At least for me. Pay special attention to the 1st few minutes when it's a true parody of movie trailers. This is the funniest few minutes in the entire movie, and one I went back to watch again."

","With its wacky trailer, I was really looking forward to Tropic Thunder. My verdict: I have mixed feelings. It's as if a schizo created this flick. When it's funny, it's really funny; but these moments are not sustained (and not in the way where it is poised to just recharge to setup for more laughs). There are (gasp!) draggy parts and the plot refuses to engage the audience, who thankfully snaps back just in time for the punchlines, which border on sick and irreverent.<br/><br/>Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller, who also directed and co-wrote the film with Justin Theroux) is a fading action superstar who jumpstarting his career with his co-stars Oscar-winner Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey, Jr.), comic Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), by going to Southeast Asia to film the ""biggest, most-expensive war movie ever produced"". But when things go wrong (as they often do), they draw on their artistic mettle to do battle as real soldiers when they face a fierce drug ring in the middle of the jungle. Downey, Jr. is the scene-stealer in this flick and spews out more of the wit as a blonde and blue-eyed Australian trying to stay in character to be a convincing black.<br/><br/>Also worth noting are the fake trailers at the start of the movie. Matthew McConaughey as Speedman's overzealous agent; Nick Nolte as the badass writer Four Leaf Tayback, on which the movie was supposedly based; and Tom Cruise as the balding, fat but fierce producer Les Grossman are surprisingly hilarious in their supporting roles. Impressively consistent is the talented Brandon Soo Hoo as the scary child-drug-lord Tran. Also watch out for a bunch of cameos from Tobey Maguire, Tyra Banks, Jon Voight, Jennifer Love Hewitt and more."
"jzappa","6","0","1","20 October 2008"," Promising Start Then Wrings Itself Dry Even Before Halfway Mark
","I will begin by saying that fortunately there are no token female characters. Ben Stiller, Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen (I swear they hired him for his name) are mature enough not to contrive any demeaning roles for actresses when they aren't necessary in a movie about the making of a Vietnam war film.<br/><br/>All but stealing the show, Robert Downey Jr. is not merely funny but also very good and sometimes even subtle as Kirk Lazarus, an Australian actor who has won five Oscars and has surgically dyed his skin to transform himself into a black man. So committed is he to this role that he remains in character at all times, seemingly convinced that he is actually black.<br/><br/>This exasperates his fellow actor Alpa Chino (ha), a rapper who was born black and blasts Lazarus for his method acting delusions. I'm going to take the opportunity to say that Alpa Chino, like many rappers viewed by many blacks as demeaning, promotes his own chauvinist merchandise, notably Booty Sweat, an energy drink that keeps him going in the jungle. It's also intimated at one point that Chino is gay, meaning that he is posing as something he is not as well. So let us stop the ""controversy"" over this ""troublesome"" issue of the film. Anyway, Lazarus is nit-picking of Tugg Speedman (Stiller's character), who starred in a terribly unsuccessful family film called Simple Jack, a movie reminiscent of Jack with Robin Williams or a low-grade Forrest Gump, about a mentally handicapped farmer who thinks animals can understand him.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for this movie, it is Simple Jack that saves their lives when they're taken prisoner. The bored druglords have only one video, an old Simple Jack VHS, and think Speedman is Jack himself. It is here where the movie really starts to overexert itself. The movie opens with promising trailers establishing three of the characters, not only Lazarus and Speedman, but Jeff Portnoy (a typically livewire Jack Black) whose specialty is fart humor. The promise of the trailers is gratified by the hilarious subsequent scene: During the shooting of the memoir of Nick Nolte's creepy Vietnam veteran, the stars, one an action star Tugg, one a five-time Academy Award-winner, one a rap star, one a low-brow drug-addled comedian, and a character actor, behave unreasonably and self-importantly, resulting in a $4 million explosion going off with no cameras shooting. With filming a month behind schedule only five days into shooting, the media dubs it the most expensive war movie never made. The frustrated and scapegoated rookie director played by Steve Coogan is ordered by the artfully profane studio executive played by a shockingly made over Tom Cruise to get the production back on track or risk having it shut down. With inspiration from Nolte, the director drops the indulged and pampered superstars into the middle of the jungle, where he implausibly mounts hidden cameras and special effect explosions manipulated so that he can film guerrilla-style.<br/><br/>If you saw the film up to that point, you would not understand why I'm so disappointed in it, because it really is hilarious up till then. It simply takes a nosedive by further developing its brilliantly narcissistic characters in such hackneyed caricatures and relying upon screaming and explosions for cheap laughs.<br/><br/>The breadth of Ben Stiller's film however is quite amazing. It's a war epic, an echo of Altman's The Player, and an echo of his own Zoolander, and it is the only thing that could end the four-week roll of The Dark Knight. So I will give him that, because in spite of any grave and fatal flaws, it certainly is an intriguing vision. And anyway, it's on Stephen King's list of favorite films of 2008. And so who can argue with Stephen King?"

","When I saw bits and pieces of this film from trailers and reviews I expected it to be a spoof of the serious Vietnam film, e.g. Platoon, Apocalypse Now, but it is more spoofing the making of one, but still a pretty funny film, from star/writer/director Ben Stiller. The film starts with trailers and commercial so you get an idea of what the lead characters do, and then it goes to the actual film, where actors Tugg Speedman (Stiller), Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) and Kirk Lazarus (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Robert Downey Jr. - most of the time in black make-up) are shooting ""Tropic Thunder"" with British director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan). When the actors don't seem to be showing realistic emotion, John ""Four Leaf"" Tayback (Nick Nolte), writer of the book the film is supposedly based on, suggests to Cockburn that they enter the guerrilla territory filming the real reactions of the actors, and Speedman is the only one who is convinced the film is being made in ""guerrilla-style"". The actors are now trekking through the jungle, Lazarus staying in character, Portnoy trying to take his drugs, and Speedman going off on his own, only to be captured by the guerrillas, and being forced to play the character ""Simple Jack"", his flop film, and being held for ransom. Also starring Jay Baruchel as Kevin Sandusky, Danny R. McBride as Cody, Brandon T.

","""Get Some"" <br/><br/>Ben Stiller's satirical look at Hollywood, Tropic Thunder concerns the production of an epic Vietnam War film that quickly derails thanks to the giant egos of everyone involved in the production. Stiller stars as Tugg Speedman, an action hero trying to segue out of that genre. Jack Black plays Jeff Portnoy, a drug-addicted fat comic also attempting to change his image by taking on such a serious film. They star alongside Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.), one of the world's most awarded actors, and a man who insists on immersing himself totally in a role. In this case, that means Lazarus has had his skin dyed in order to portray an African-American soldier. After their outrageous behavior lands the film's director, Damien (Steve Coogan), in very hot water with producer Les Grossman (Tom Cruise), Damien takes the advice of grizzled Vietnam vet Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte); in order to gain control of his performers, Damien drops the actors off in the jungle, planning to film the movie guerrilla-style with hidden cameras. When the group stumbles upon a heroin production camp, the actors are unaware that they are in very real danger.<br/><br/>One of 2008's funniest movies and a hilarious yet, almost true parody of the way Hollywood works. One of the best parodies I've seen in a long time well for one thing, the parody/spoof genre has been infested by the street trash that is Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer and their puke-inducing movies so I'm really glad that someone stepped in to save the already dying genre. And not only somebody but funny man Ben Stiller who's been making us laugh since he accidentally zipped his Wang between his zipper.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller stars and also directs this movie along with Robert Downey Jr. and Jack Black to take on a movie in a movie they're starring in. In this case, a war movie but not really a war movie when it all becomes real so the 'movie' factor is taken out and the results are hilariously catastrophic. There are two things that stole the show, first is Robert Downey Jr, playing Kirk Lazarus playing a black platoon Sargent in the fake movie. Every word he says is golden, I couldn't control myself from laughing out loud. I mean, he doesn't even have to do anything, all he needed to do was stand there and at least try to act like a black guy and the hilarity will ensue.<br/><br/>Second is Tom Cruise in a fat suit as mogul producer Les Grossman. His potty mouth plus the fat suit and top to that a hilariously awkward dance routine to the beat of a rap music. You couldn't get any better than that. The others of course were not left out of the spotlight, Jack Black is in his usual form, an obnoxious yet lovable funny man and Ben Stiller also in his usual form as an ignorant schnozzle.<br/><br/>Solid deliveries, a hilarious script and hysterical scenarios are what makes this film a comedic gem. If you want to have a good laugh, this movie is highly recommended."
"Syrchek","6","0","1","8 October 2008"," Perhaps it's a little ""too American"" to be really funny for a worldwide audience.
","I'm not from the US, but I admit I had a few good laughs while watching this at a theater the other day. But there were just these few quite good laughs, probably not more than five. It made me think that the film is a bit ""too American"", it happened quite a few times when something was supposed to be funny and people didn't take it as such. One good example is the ""DVD comment"" from Downey Jr., people didn't laugh much, probably because they didn't get it. There are more of these examples, but I don't want to mark my comment with spoiler alerts. Or sometimes people laugh at the accent and not at what't actually said.<br/><br/>A lot of the jokes get ""lost in translation"" if you are not American and if you read subtitles. The other problem in my opinion is that there isn't a peak laugh, or a really big laugh in the end. Because of that I think a lot of people left the theater a bit disappointed. When I saw such high marks for this film I was a little negatively surprised. It almost seemed to me that I didn't watch the same movie. Some would argue that despite the lack of grand laughs in the end it's ""overall"" funny, but in my view, more mildly."

","This is a film about the making of a film about the shooting of a film and stars a dude playing the dude disguised as another dude. Confused? Well, ""Tropic Thunder"" is that kind of movie. From the very beginning - no credits, just mock advertisements and fake trailers - we're in for a rumble in the jungle with much madness, mayhem and even a touch of genius with visual and verbal gags coming so often and so fast that nobody will get them all on first viewing (especially some of Robert Downey Jr's heavily accented lines) but most will catch enough to have a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Most of the credit goes to comedian Ben Stiller who co-wrote, co-produced and directed this work as well as taking a leading role. The whole thing is a parody of action movies in general and Vietnam movies in particular with ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Platoon"" and ""Rambo"" being just three of dozens and dozens of films that are referenced. The focus is on a team of five thespians - Tugg Speedman (Stiller), Kirk Lazarus (Downey Jr), Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) plus two minor actors - who start off making a war movie with grand ambitions and pathetic outcomes, only to realise (slowly) that they really are in a conflict situation and nothing is what or who it seems."

","I went to see this with some trepidation - I had enjoyed the trailer, but the critics had not been kind.<br/><br/>Well, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. During the first week of its UK run, the cinema was well populated with young people - couples and groups, both male and female - and there was laughter all the way through.<br/><br/>The jokes in this comedy are applied with a scattergun approach - they range from fart gags to gross-out gags, from lampooning figures to Hollywood in-jokes, from character-based humour to sight gags. They aren't all funny, but enough of them are to make the movie constantly entertaining.<br/><br/>I got a silly amount of pleasure from seeing Universal, New Line and Fox Searchlight all cheerfully lending their logos to decorate the ""trailers"" which precede the movie proper.<br/><br/>The three principals - and the other members of the platoon - are all excellent. Even Jack Black, who I normally cordially dislike, delivers a credible and sympathetic portrayal of an essentially unpleasant character. Nick Nolte is - shock, horror - funny, and Cruise is simply magnificent (although I think he should have varied his voice - hearing the normal Cruise tones emerge from the Weinstein clone does spoil the illusion somewhat).<br/><br/>As usual there is a fair amount of bad language, but as it is mostly in service of the plot, it didn't spoil things excessively.<br/><br/>Steve Coogan is wasted.<br/><br/>Well worth catching."

","Tropic Thunder had me in two minds, on the one side its riddled with high quality actors, on the other, its a spoof movie. Now, in short i enjoyed it thoroughly.<br/><br/>The comedy is 'in your face,' its not sly or clever, its outright gags and slapstick. Yet it works. The reason for this i believe is that the actors pull it off brilliantly. The star, Ben Stiller, plays an excellent part, and with cameos from many other actors, it kept me entertained.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise steals the movie with his brief yet frequent scenes, where he plays a highly strung actor, BRILLIANTLY. its hilarious, cruise is barely recognisable.<br/><br/>Watch it. Its great."
"freemantle_uk","8","0","2","21 September 2008"," Surprisingly I like this film
","Before I start, I am not really a fan of Ben Stiller or American comedy films generally, I didn't have high hopes for this film. However, I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is about the filming of a Vietnam film based on an ex-serviceman's memoirs. It was going to start Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.) and Jeff Portney (Jack Black). They are all highly paid prima donna actors and their director is a British rookie (Steve Coogan). Tugg is a faying action star who is trying to become a serious actor, similar to Sylvester Stallone. Kirk, a serious Australian Oscar winning actor who has angry issues. He is basically a parody of Russell Crowe and how far some actors would go to do a role. Jeff is a comedian tried actor who just does family comedies and just uses the lowest common dominator (i.e. farting) and addicted to heroin. There are troubles on the set and the actors and director clash early on in the film shoot. It is suggested by the author of the book (Nick Nolte) to take them go to the middle of the Vietnamese jungle and make them into men. The director hoped to help his film to go back on track and make it more realist. Unforuately they ended up going into the middle of a war zone, dominated by drug lords.<br/><br/>What makes this film work is that it is a little more intelligent then most frat pack films. It parodies a lot of Vietnam films, especially Platoon and Apocalypse Now. It is also a parody on Hollywood itself, on all people who are involved in the filming process. There are jokes that will please everyone in the film; from the faux trailers, jokes about Hollywood and general jokes parted on the delivery. Out of the main three cast Robert Downey Jr. is the best, but Ben Stiller and Jack Black were still gone. There are also very good guest performances from Matthew McConaughey and Tom Cruise: especially Cruise who gets to shout some very fun insults. Its also good to see that Steve Coogan is getting work. There are also a lot of cameos to keep an eye out for.<br/><br/>However, I really could have done without the dancing.<br/><br/>Basically it is a good comedy, and I recommend it."
"jhobdell","7","0","2","21 September 2008"," Utterly stupid...I loved it!
","To be fair, the seven-star rating is possibly a little unfair. It's hard to know how to rate this film after seeing it only once. I laughed uproariously and that was enough.<br/><br/>The premise of making a more war-like atmosphere for filming a war epic was pretty good, even if the inevitable descent into an actual war-like environment was hopelessly predictable. With that out of the way, this film goes on to spoof every war epic for the last 30 years: Platoon, Apocalypse Now, Predator, Rambo, The Dirty Dozen and Forrest Gump to name but a few. There's even a hint of Proof of Life.<br/><br/>The film is utterly bizarre and totally brainless but all the random elements somehow hang together to make a vaguely coherent whole that is absolutely hilarious (although I'm still not sure how Tom Cruise's cameo fits in!)"
"dj_xand325","7","0","2","20 September 2008"," A fun, hilarious, irreverent, full blown satire of Hollywood
","Tropic Thunder is an excellent satirical gem made by the prolific Ben Stiller. Its about an uneven group of actors that attempt to film a war film in Vietnam and through a series of events their filming turns into a race for their lives as they stumble across REAL bad guys.<br/><br/>Stiller has produced a type of film that I have never seen before. It isn't just a series of parodies, its a series of satire. If you like, this is an 'epic movie' type film with quality. The film references are subtle, the satire is subtle and unsubtle at times, its perfectly balanced. A top quality series of comedy that is sure to please anybody that has ever seen a Hollywood film before.<br/><br/>The only direct satire I could spot was Downey Jr's character. Its most probably Daniel Day Lewis or Russell Crowe. Also Downey Jr's performance was excellent. Hes possibly the most believable fake black guy I have ever seen!.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder is a controversial blend of outrageous one-liners, sharp satire and laugh out loud comedy.<br/><br/>Hollywood has finally been effectively mocked! <br/><br/>7.5/10"

","I cannot believe so many critics want to pick apart a great comedy. Some of the dialogue and a lot of the ""off the cuff"" lines are genius. So in someways it hits some lower brow levels of comedy. Woody Allen is not the be all and end all of comedy. I love some stupid comedies because they embrace what they are. This is somehow both cerebral and low brow. It has under lying subtext that most ""retarded"" comedies never attain. It's not the perfect comedy but it's pretty close. Robert Downey Jnr. maybe the best send up of someone like Crowe i've ever seen. I rank it alongside one of my personal favourites, another Ben Stiller, Mystery Men. Look out for the previews before the main film, genius! In summation quite your itching and get back to the mincing fags!!"
"bulletproofclod","8","0","3","8 September 2008"," Worth Its Weight in Fun
","Once upon a time August was considered a sort of dumping ground for subpar films that couldn't make the grade for the May through July season, but recently late summer films have been triumphant.<br/><br/>Ben Stiller's latest film takes place on the set of a Vietnam War movie based on memoir by Four Leaf Tayback, who is an intense veteran and amputee played to perfection by a nearly unrecognizable Nick Nolte.<br/><br/>Thanks to the unreasonable and ridiculous behavior displayed by the four main actors, the studio threatens to pull the plug on the war epic. Fear of failure drives the desperate director to take Tayback's advice and drop the divas into the wilderness.<br/><br/>The cast is led by Ben Stiller, who both acted in and directed the film, playing fading action star Tugg Speedman who sees this as his last chance to stay afloat in the movie industry. <br/><br/>The amazingly talented Robert Downey Jr. takes an unforgettable turn portraying Kirk Lazarus, a passionate method actor who undergoes a controversial surgery in order to portray the black platoon sergeant.<br/><br/>Some of the funniest moments come from his attempts to embody a stereotypical African American. Lazarus's extreme submersion into the role leaves him incapable of dropping the character, cleverly satirizing the lengths actors are willing to go to in order to perfect their 'craft.' <br/><br/>Jack Black portrays Jeff 'Fats' Portnoy, a lowbrow comedian hooked on everything but phonics, suffers through withdrawals throughout the course of the film and his crudeness opens up many comedic avenues.<br/><br/>Actual African American rap star Alpa Chino, portrayed by Brandon T. Jackson, butts heads with Lazarus, disgusted by the actor's ridiculous dedication to becoming and acting like a black man.<br/><br/>The cast of the epic catches the attention of the jungle's prime drug manufacturers, the Flaming Red Dragon Gang, who initially believes that the oblivious thespians are a threat to their organization. <br/><br/>Speedman continues to believe that the whole experience is doctored and remains convinced that the cameras are still rolling even after the team is ambushed by the drug dealers and real landmines explode.<br/><br/>It is levelheaded rookie actor Kevin Sandusky, played by Jay Baruchel, who holds the team together when Speedman goes off on his own to continue making the movie that everyone else realizes is long over. <br/><br/>When Speedman is captured by the malicious drug lords and forced to perform his critically panned role of Simple Jack for the locals, his costars must think of a way to rescue him as well as save their own skins.<br/><br/>While the action is well spaced and the film is punctuated by many belly laughs, Tropic Thunder is not for the light of heart and is rated R for good reason. There's vulgarity enough for everybody as well as grossly realistic severed limbs and bad language galore.<br/><br/>Downey Jr. leads the pack, portraying the preposterously serious Lazarus with a straight face, despite all of his laughable absurdities, but he does not stand alone. The cast is strong and the dynamic between the five clueless actors creates the perfect environment for both clever comedy as well as the occasional cheap laugh.<br/><br/>The controversy surrounding the film is not without merit for there are many risqué moments and vulgar jokes that could easily upset the sensitive.<br/><br/>However, the offense taken by Lazarus adopting black face and the debate besieging Speedman's portrayal of a mentally challenged character is taken out of context. One can only presume that those who take such great offense to ""Tropic Thunder,"" never bothered to see it.<br/><br/>The point of both controversial depictions is to poke fun at the movie industry and how actors, like fictional Lazarus and Speedman, can take both themselves and their roles far too seriously.<br/><br/>Tropic Thunder succeeds as a great ensemble piece, the main and supporting actors playing off each other perfectly. There is even a hilarious bit part by a nearly unrecognizable Tom Cruise. <br/><br/>This is a movie best taken with a laugh and a grain of salt and true fans of Downey Jr., Stiller and Black will not be disappointed. The politically correct and easily offended should do their best to avoid it."
"MidnightWarrior","7","0","3","31 August 2008"," Starts off slow, mediocre middle, fantastic ending!
","The summary says it all. The start of the film was really slow and boring. I saw right through their paper thin plot and wondered why I bothered spending time and money to watch this. Well, I decided to stick it out and I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>Robert Downy Jr. and Jay Baruchel carried the middle of the film. Downy Jr's impersonation was hilarious as a black man and all the things that he said; he was really convincing as an Australian too. And in the end, Ben Stiller picked up the film and completely rocked it out. The action, intensity and humor was all nicely melded together in the end. That, in my opinion, is what makes the film just awesome!<br/><br/>On a side note, Tom Cruise, Tobey Maguire and Matthew McConaheughy were all spectacular. I was really surprised to see Cruise step out of the box and depart from his normal character roles with this one. However, he managed to pull it off, was hilarious and did an awesome job! I prefer to see him as an action hero instead of some fat, slimy, greedy boss who's every other word is the F word. Hopefully he won't portray this type of character again (one time, for him, is more than enough!).<br/><br/>All in all, the directing was spectacular and the action packed scenes along with the explosions and stuff were really, really good. More plot would have been nice, but I suppose that's something for them to work on, should they make a sequel.<br/><br/>7/10"

"jbmorgan-1","6","0","3","17 August 2008"," Formulaic comedy, but with some brilliant acting
","This movie is a typical American comedy - meaning that the plot is completely predictable, it relies on a lot of disgusting visuals and bathroom material for its humor, and many of the jokes fall flat. The reason I rated it as highly as I did is because Robert Downey, Jr. and Tom Cruise, ironically the only NON-comedic actors in the group, are both hilarious. Downey, in particular, as an Australian superstar who immerses himself completely in his role as a stereotypical African-American Vietnam-era soldier, is ingenious in this film. He has some of the most brilliant comedic dialogue I've ever heard. I laughed nearly every time he opened his mouth, as did everyone else in the audience. And Cruise, virtually unrecognizable in his costume, is great as a studio executive who sees himself as a gangsta. Nick Nolte, playing the Vietnam vet who wrote the book on which the film they're making is based, has some great scenes early on. And it's a shame that Steve Coogan exits the story so early on, as he had the potential to bring a lot more to the movie. Everyone else in the cast is pretty average. Ben Stiller is a washed-up action hero trying to save his career, although nothing he does on screen is particularly memorable. Jack Black is a heroin-addicted teen comedy star trying to make it as a serious actor, but unfortunately he isn't given much to do. I don't know what the producers thought was funny about watching a man go through heroin withdrawal for 107 minutes, but Black is never allowed to get beyond that. Jay Baruchel is basically there to play the straight man, while the actual African-American actor, Brandon Jackson, who is given about six lines of dialogue, is clearly only there to ease the producers' conscience about having a White man in blackface in their movie. Matthew McConaughey, as Stiller's agent, is only there as eye candy for the ladies (and to provide an unlikely deus ex machina at the movie's climax). There's not much else to say about this movie - the plot is trite and ridiculous, although film buffs who, like me, are burnt out on Vietnam films will appreciate the many references to ""Platoon"" and ""Apocalypse Now,"" some of which are quite subtle."

","To start off, this is a very original concept that has not even been attempted, yet alone recreated, until now. Stiller directs a very edgy, epic-violent comedy that crosses every boundary possible. It takes a lot of A listers, and mixes them in with some of Apatow's fine list of guys to create and overall funny storyline. (Tom Cruise is hilarious, you wouldn't even realize it's him until the credits) For the first time, this movie starts off with an advertisement for Booty Sweat, and then three trailers, this was a very unique and interesting way to reel in the audience...and it seemed to work judged by all the laughter.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to all those who enjoyed Pineapple Express, heck to anyone who enjoys any war movie, except as a spoof. This pokes fun at every area possible to nitpick at.<br/><br/>Definitely a keeper, and remember to get the TiVo."
