","Top 10 comedies of all time. Enough jokes and hilarious situations to keep laughing long after the viewing.<br/><br/>Sit back and enjoy the ride."
"MovieAddict2016","8","406","651","7 June 2009"," Genuinely funnier than any comedy in recent memory
","Most great comedies are based on fundamental truths -- we find a deal of humour in the illumination of our own human tragedy. Office Space is funny, for example, because we've all worked that type of job, put up with that type of boss, and suffered that type of monotonous everyday boredom.<br/><br/>Todd Phillips' new movie, The Hangover, is as aptly titled as anything else released this year: it's about a Vegas bachelor party gone horribly awry, in which the groom inexplicably disappears, no one can remember a damned thing, and Mike Tyson wants his tiger back.<br/><br/>Yes, we've all had those nights, though perhaps not to such extremes (that's where the exaggeration of comedy serves us). The Hangover is funny because it takes this cultural ritual -- an American tradition; something almost all of us can relate to -- and finds genuine humour in the pain of its aftermath.<br/><br/>I concede that bachelor party movies are not in short supply; the genre (if it is, indeed, a genre) should have probably both begun and ended with the Tom Hanks flick almost three decades ago. But The Hangover wisely studies the day after rather than the day itself; this is funnier because the plot works backwards, without tacky flashbacks, and much of the evening in question is left to our imagination.<br/><br/>While it would be misleading to claim this is a brilliant film (in either regard – as comedy or character study), it's an assured picture that finds its footing immediately and achieves a surprising level of sustenance throughout its running time. And frankly, let's be honest, this is a breath of fresh air: it's one of the best R-rated comedies of the decade, and certainly the most uproarious since Superbad was released two years ago. Most R-rated comedies produced today are defiant; the R-rating has become a hindrance to film studios' sensibilities – everything is PG-13, saving the shameless Unrated schpeel for the DVD cut. The occasional theatrically-released R-rated comedy, as such, is infrequently modest; the ads stress the rating to remind us what we've been missing. For every legitimate offer, such as Forgetting Sarah Marshall, we're treated to movies like College that attempt to lure us into theaters based on the promise of raunchy decadence. The problem is that it's all so coldly calculated; these films are not funny because a majority of the time they are simply lazy and dishonest.<br/><br/>The simplest reason for The Hangover's success in being genuinely funny is the fact that it achieves a rare balance of character and vulgarity. We laugh at the characters' misfortunes because we like them, we empathize with them, and they are distinctly actualized. Are they stereotypical? To a certain degree, sure: we have the repressed pussy-whipped guy who obeys his girlfriend's every command (Ed Helms); the weird John Belushi-esquire figure who speaks in non sequiturs and naïve absurdities (Zach Galifianakis); and the womanizer whose confidence renders him automatic leader of the group (Bradley Cooper). It's a testament to the strengths of these actors that they make their characters endearing and believable, even in the face of total lunacy.<br/><br/>Helms has been an underrated highlight of the American Office for the past several years, never quite earning the praise he deserves. His character on the show is played with pitch-perfect perversity: he's not overtly creepy (like the program's other weirdo, Creed), but rather subtly unnerving. Helms invests a great deal of nuance into what is ostensibly a throwaway, supporting goofball; this movie, if nothing else, will justly reveal his talents.<br/><br/>Cooper uses his looks to his advantage: it's funny to watch handsome people exploit their securities. Cooper essentially turns your typical Leading Man figure into a bumbling idiot, self-absorbed and clueless. It's effective, he's got great chemistry with the other guys, and it's fun to watch such an immoral and ruthless character take center stage in a mainstream comedy.<br/><br/>Galifianakis, a cult comedian who I've admired for years, has been struggling quite a while. Not many people other than myself and Sean Penn saw his 2001 comedy Out Cold, probably because it wasn't all that great; but he was easily the most amusing aspect of the picture. He once described himself as being gifted by the opposite of the Midas touch, with more than a few canceled TV shows to his credit (including Comedy Central's unheralded Dog Bites Man), but it seems his persistence has finally paid off: he has discovered, at last, a movie of strong enough quality to reflect his talents. Galifianakis has a fair share of the film's funniest dialogue; as far as fat funny guys go, many of them (such as Chris Farley) made the ill-fated mistake of playing dumb in a sharp fashion: hurtful quips and silly one-liners, all self-aware. Galifianakis plays his character straight and the laughs are subsequently heartier; when he embraces his brother-in-law while nude, the act seems innocently awkward rather than deliberately awkward, and that's what makes it so funny. He's described in The Hangover, by another character, as a child with a beard. Imagine how funny it is when he names a Caucasian baby Carlos, without any shred of condescension or knowing humour.<br/><br/>The Hangover is surely destined to become the sleeper comedy hit of 2009, and, more likely, a cult flick in the years to come. It's more deserving of such acknowledgment than many recent successes, and while we may live in an era saturated with unnecessary sequels, I actually left The Hangover hoping to see these guys again. And that's a rare feeling these days."
"dalagler","8","405","700","26 May 2009"," A very funny movie
","With the exception of one character (more later in this review), I found this movie filled with male, sophomoric humor. Having said that most of the females in the audience also enjoyed it; kind of an equal opportunity movie to offend all sexes equally.<br/><br/>Unlike most trailers that show all the humor in a 60 second clip, this movie will throw so many funny situations at you so quickly that you will be giggling non-stop for the first hour.<br/><br/>Then, the introduction of the Mr. Chow part - essential for the plot, but played WAY over the top by Ken Jeong - became distracting. Up to that point, Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Justin Bartha, and Zach Galifianakis carried the movie briskly and with real chemistry. Zach Galifianakis, in particular, was brilliant. Who is this guy???! The last 30 minutes were not as good as the first hour and I found the ending somewhat forced.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, everyone I talked with after the movie will be seeing it again. This is one movie that is as funny as advertised.<br/><br/>Of course, I will get flamed by those who find this kind of humor too low brow for their tastes. Hey, just know what you're getting into when you see this."
"hawkman1569","10","376","655","30 May 2009"," Very Funny
","I just saw the first screening of the movie, and it is very worth the money you will pay for it. I was skeptical about it at first, thinking that the previews would have only the funny parts, but they are just the tip of the iceberg... Everyone hit a home run in this movie. Even Mike Tyson generated a few laughs for everyone. If you need a pick me up from a bad day, just watch this and you will definitely feel better about everything that may be going wrong in your life. I will DEFINITELY be buying this to watch over and over again once it comes out on DVD, probably even see it in theaters again. I hope you find this review helpful because this movie is definitely a must see in my opinion."
"jirshon","10","451","806","6 June 2009"," One of the funniest movies I have ever seen. PERIOD.
","I walked into this movie a little hesitant, and man did I feel like a complete tool for doubting Todd Phillips once again.<br/><br/>I was hesitant for quite a few reasons. One being that I was a little unimpressed with the trailer, but trust me, after you see this movie you will realize that most of the movie couldn't have possibly made it into the trailer. Another reason was the writers.... their previous works being The Ghosts of Girlfriend's Pasts and Four Christmases and Rebound. I don't know what they did between those and this but damn did they step their game up.<br/><br/>Now, the movie is hilarious. I have become so used to the thought of the Judd Apatow gang being the only ones to make truly funny films, but I realized very quickly into this movie that I was dead wrong. I think this movie was by far ten times funnier than Pineapple Express, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Step Brothers, etc. And I find each of those flicks truly, hilariously, funny.<br/><br/>I remember watching Superbad the first time and thinking that that was the funniest movie ever made, when it comes to films with legitimate plots and characters, etc. And maybe Superbad and The Hangover are pretty close, but who knows....<br/><br/>So PLEASE see this film. The audience I saw it with was laughing hysterically every five minutes at least. There is enough one-liners to quote all summer, and enough subtle jokes to laugh about later on that you didn't catch the first time.<br/><br/>OH and by the way, if you love Old School, you will LOVE the ending. That's all I can say."
"ste_shmoobert","10","46","73","15 July 2009"," Funniest film so far this year.
","I reckon it will be noted as the funniest film this year as I think it would be hard to top. It is certainly the best comedy I've seen for a couple of years. The cast were excellent with a truly great dynamic of main characters played by very talented comedic actors. The performance that sticks out is Zach Galifianakis' character 'Alan'. Zach has brought a fresh character to the screen and with the quality of this films script the combination of the two are what brings this to the point of a comedy masterpiece. As a film fan who is partial to only rating thrillers and dramas with a sense of respect, this film reminds me of how comedy can be the masterclass of cinema and the reason why we enjoy it so much. My Dad is not a fan of comedy as such and normally sees going to watch films of this type as a chore but to see him laugh as much as my brother and myself at 65 years of age shows how its humor can break not just an age gap but more importantly a persons taste in film. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this movie and do not wish to say anything about the story. The best thing to do is to go and see this film for yourself and you'll realize what i'm talking about."
"mrhgibs","10","250","458","5 June 2009"," Succeeds Where Old School Fails
","After much anticipation, The Hangover has finally hit theaters. Todd Phillips returns raunchier than ever with a surprisingly consistent comedy loaded with bizarre situations ensued by lots of laughter. From a live tiger in the bathroom to an abandoned baby in the closet, this movie has everything. Seriously, everything (confirmed by the credit sequence).<br/><br/>Phillips does not shy away from his formula. The movie centers around four immature adults dumbfounded by the seemingly unexplainable result of a wild Vegas night catalyzed by the foursome's out of control bachelor party. Set the day before one of the principle character's wedding, the film is primarily seen through eyes of Doug (the groom-to-be), Alan (the lovable moron), Stu (the hopeless one), and Phil (the stud, and in many ways the leader of the pack). The director of Old School does not shy away from shock humor but embraces it, while gradually building confidence and self discovery within the characters. <br/><br/>Overall, the film triumphs through curiosity and chemistry. Just like the main characters, we are eager to find out what happens, or what DID happen. At the same time, the strong relationship developed by the characters makes the viewer realize how much he/she cares about what ultimately happens to them. Chemistry is the secret to a good comedy; it is about time somebody shows this understanding.<br/><br/>I don't want to reveal too much, but let me tell you this: everything does get explained in the end (except for the chicken aimlessly walking around in the hotel room, but I mean, it's a chicken). All of the actors succeeded in their roles admirably, and I wouldn't be surprised to see these guys in more lead roles. Ed Helms hasn't made me laugh this hard since The Daily Show. Seriously guys. Go watch this movie, you won't be disappointed."
"bigchris002","10","277","517","5 June 2009"," Outperformed the already high expectations!
","I have to start by saying that my friends and I have been talking about this movie and watching the trailers for weeks, so our expectations were really high.<br/><br/>With that being said, this movie didn't just live up to the expectations, it was one of the funniest movie I have seen in a long time. Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, and Ed Helms are all very good. Galifianakis steals the show at times. It is hilarious from the beginning. Mike Tyson brings a few laughs and Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) is a great twist. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie, it is worth every penny. Just got out of the midnight showing and I'm going back tomorrow night."
"cannedtrash","4","210","394","22 July 2009"," Bland and uninspired comedy, highly overrated
","This is without doubt one of the most overrated comedy of all times, the jokes are totally bland and boring and the whole concept has been done over a million times before . The story looked like a bunch of toilet jokes and elementary grade humor slapped together resulting in a forgettable comedy that definitely doesn't live up to the hype. One of the worst moment in that movie was in the casino scene where they won over $800000 with the help of a black jack book, I mean it looked like the script writer couldn't find a better way to get the characters out of that problem and he just went for the easy way with an all time classic (and cliché) video editing scene just like the karate kid movies (you know the whole ""be a champion in 2 minutes"" thing). The acting in some scenes looked like it came straight from a forgotten b-grade , straight to VHS movie. I know that a lot of people found that movie hilarious but I didn't find anything fresh in that movie, it was the first time that at the end I pulled out my cellphone and started watching my sms out of boredom."
"chucknorrisfacts","1","245","472","25 June 2009"," Disappointed...
","Every now and then, there's a movie that has a lot of hype surrounding it, and everyone seems to talk about it, and without a doubt, ""The Hangover"" is one of those movies.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it doesn't live up to or deserve the hype it's getting. I found it to be a rather empty ""comedy"" and I can't understand why so many people seem to think it's so humorous. Apparently, I wasn't the only one not to enjoy it, the audience I was a part of barely let out a snicker during the entire flick.<br/><br/>I think a lot of the attempts at humor were forced, and a lot of the jokes fell flat. The acting wasn't very impressive either, particularly that of Zach Galifianakis.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say to avoid this movie if you don't want to be disappointed. Is it the worst movie I've ever seen? No. However, there are far better comedies out there I'd recommend over this for sure."
"ojolie","1","130","243","2 July 2009"," give me a break!
","I can't believe this movie gets such high ratings. I just wasted 1.5 hours of my life. I decided to see it because everyone was so high about it... I had such high expectations as a result, of course. Oh man, there is nothing more in the whole movie than in the trailers. And to me the trailer was no fun, either... So you can tell if you are with me at this point.<br/><br/>It started really slow and I was waiting for something to happen.. nope nothing... At some point I expected a twist. nope... The tiger, the baby, the tooth, the bed, everything is just so forced. It was like when Conan o'Brien creates absurd situations and take a shot of that moment in his show. Conan's creations are waaaay funny though... I have to apologize from Conan for comparing this movie to his absurd shots since he does them for what they are. But these guys in hangover is trying to sell a real funny story, but I don't buy it. not a bit, sorry.<br/><br/>All those screams, cursing, unnecessary naked people and stupidness got me stressed! I didn't enjoy it, but go ahead and watch. I may be the only person who is telling you that it's not good. just... whatever..."
"GAKAS","5","158","299","27 July 2009"," Please tell me what all the fuss is about?????????
","After I saw this movie I rated it 2 out of 10. But after having a further think and discussion about it, I reduced my score to 1 out of 10. Why? This movie is stupid! Most of the time it doesn't make sense. A cop car that's stolen but there's no man hunt for it, a tiger in the bathroom but they're talking about it in the living room like they've had it happen to them previously. Meanwhile the nerdy guy is more scared of his fiancé than the tiger! The hotel finds a bed thrown on a statue but assume it was thrown out of a window, even though they don't have windows?????? What the hell! The tiger is drugged and put into their car to take it back to Mikes place? Have you lifted a tiger lately?? I know they are trying to be funny, but they lost me from the beginning. By the time the photo's are shown at the end I was already over it. Not only that there are absolutely no consequences in the end for any of them. BOOOOOOORRRRIIIINNGGG! ""Yeah, lets high five each other"" Amazing that Hollywood can produce this crap and promote it so hard, and still make huge dollars. In conclusion, rent Very bad things, now that's a Vegas movie. And if you don't get what's going on in that movie, like one person who called it an evil movie about a homicide........IT'S A BLACK COMEDY!!!"
"tmglobe2004","1","202","388","11 July 2009"," No one in the theater laughed never- super stupid movie
","I feel burned for going to watch this super stupid movie. I am baffled that so many other people in IMDb thought it was funny and that it has good reviews. There were about 30 people in the theater when I watched it of a pretty good demographic spread and there were nearly NO LAUGHS through out the whole movie. At best a few people chuckled a few times. Some of the attempts at comedy are so, so old. OK, here are a couple little spoilers. In one scene one of the guys is face down on the ground about to get up & another one of guys opens up the car door and opens it bumping the guy laying down on the ground in the head- so, so stupid! This scene was funny in cartoons when I was under 10! Another spoiler coming- in a different scene one of the guys finds a used condom in there car and they start grossing out and tossing it around- so stupid and not funny anymore since I was 17. I can only understand the high reviews on IMDb that there are so many more potheads these days. If you are a pothead under 25 is the only demographic I can understand that can laugh from this."
"zididane","1","196","378","10 July 2009"," Terrible, Terrible, Terrible movie, the fact that it is a phenomenon is just depressing.
","This movie was terrible, to put it simply. To look at it more thoroughly read on.<br/><br/>Character: There was almost no character development in the movie, one character learns any kind of lesson at all, other than that everyone is the same character at the end of the movie as they were at the beginning. And while I'm looking at the characters let's do some summaries, we have the smug asshole, the beyond idiotic weirdo, the angry nerd, and the uninteresting groom, who also has an uninteresting bride, who by the way has like four lines in the movie.<br/><br/>Plot: The idea of forgetting what happened in the night time and trying to put all the pieces together in the morning, yeah it's clever. The problem is, the movie was so short, every problem they encountered had to either resolve it's self, or they solved it so quickly it wasn't really even a problem to begin with. Mike Tyson comes and claims the tiger, then they drive it back, fascinating, really I'm enthralled. They see the hospital bracelet and the Las Vegas doctor remembers everything that four drunk guys said earlier that night, not only that he leads them to there next clue right away. Maybe the doctor could have magically just told them where there friend was. And those aren't even the worst parts.<br/><br/>Dialogue: I hardly feel like touching this but let's go. The nerd, all he does is get abused, and then start yelling, then people laugh. Ha ha ha, nerds yelling, ha ha ha. The weird dumb guy, insert non sequitur here, that's pretty much every line in the movie. The Pretty boy who's a dick, well he's just mean and for no real reason, and as for the uninteresting groom, well he only has like four lines, and they aren't very good.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I wish I could rate this movie zero, who ever programs this website might want to get started on that."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","9","72","130","5 June 2009"," You spin me right round, baby, right round
","From the moment that I saw the trailer for The Hangover I knew I had to see this movie, I don't think I had laughed so hard watching a trailer in my life. But one thing I was kind of concerned about was how most movies just show the funny parts in the trailer and this would just be another ""Old School"" type of movie that would have no originality. I saw The Hangover this afternoon and I just can't believe how funny this movie was. The great thing about it as absurd as the story is, seriously, it's kind of realistic in some matter. I mean, who hasn't had a morning where they woke up from a night of drinking and just cannot remember one thing about the night before? This is a comedy mystery story that just gets funnier with each scene that is played due to the strong cast, great chemistry and a hilarious story.<br/><br/>Doug is about to be married, so his friends: Stu, Phil, and Doug's soon to be brother-in-law Alan, take him to Las Vegas for a bachelor party. Stu's girlfriend is very controlling, thereby forcing Stu to lie to her about their destination. The guys get a suite at their hotel, then sneak on to the roof of the hotel and toast to the night ahead. Skipping forward to the next morning, the three groomsmen awake with no memory of the previous night. They find Doug missing, Stu missing a tooth, a tiger in the bathroom, and a baby in the closet. Initially they believe Doug to have gone out for breakfast, but soon worry when his cell phone has been left behind. They collect what memories they have to figure what happened to Doug. They go through the whole town of Vegas discovering they messed with the Chinese Mafia, Mike Tyson, marrying a stripper and it just keeps getting weirder and weirder.<br/><br/>This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen, I don't think I've laughed so hard consistently in a theater. Granted the movie has it's flaws, not everyone is going to fully get it or have the same sense of humor, but just to see Mike Tyson jam out to Phil Collin's ""In The Air Tonite"" is worth the ticket price alone. I don't think there isn't going to be one person I don't recommend this movie too. I think what did it for me was the cast, they just had such great chemistry together and really made the movie work and took us with on this crazy story. All the side characters were a great laugh too with Heather Graham as Stu's stripper wife and the Chinese Mafia leader Leslie Chow, who has the biggest ""WTF?!"" moment with getting out of their car trunk naked and beating the heck out of the boys. Trust me, you have to see this movie, if you liked Old School, you will love The Hangover! If you have ever had those mornings when you woke up and don't remember anything, this is the movie for you.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Michael Fargo","10","150","293","6 June 2009"," The Unchecked Id
","Zach Galifianakis, Ed Helms and Bradley Cooper fall so perfectly into the circumstances of a night out without the wife/girlfriend—a bachelor party, no less—that we're all happy we're safe in the audience clucking our tongues but secretly envying every single moment (one that includes the ever watchable Heather Graham). These boys fall and fall hard, and trying to pick up the pieces of a night they strangely can't remember brought more laughs than the last time I laughed this consistently (that was ""There's Something About Mary"").<br/><br/>The cast never forgets that they are actors here and not on an episode of ""Jackass"" as Apatow's comedies often feel. There's tight control on the dialog and we never descend into simple slapstick. Oh, there's broad humor, but we're watching terrific actors in very broad situations. The trailer is a perfect sample of what you're going to get, although it may veer into raunch perhaps a little more than the trailer hints. But it's never just sensationalism, because I can—regrettably, I confess—relate to waking up in a room with a chicken and not knowing exactly from whence it came.<br/><br/>Galifiankis has the most unique character (well, besides a naked Chinese fellow, but you can discover that one for yourself) and he's wonderful to watch. Not everything he does comes off 100%, but when he scores, it's so far out from our own comfort zone, that when the jaws of the other characters drop, we're right there with them. Rachel Harris deserves special mention as the girlfriend who demonstrates why marriage can be so fearful.<br/><br/>This is as tidy a script as ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" and just as beautifully shot. The cinematography could be pulled from any of the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce ads, and it only adds to our confidence that whatever is coming around the next corner, we don't have to worry that it will wreck all that's gone before. The makers of this little gem are as much in control as the characters are out of control, and it was joy to finally get a great farce that we're very sorry to see end. I see that ""Hangover, 2"" is in development, and I hope lighting strikes twice.<br/><br/>(The standard for wedding singer has been set. Anyone want to top this?)"
"ignoranceisntbliss","1","80","150","18 August 2009"," Cheesy ripoff 'sequel' to ""Very Bad Things"" (1998) gave me a hangover.
","It's amazing browsing thru some of these 15 page orgasmic rave reviews to such an unoriginal lackluster film.<br/><br/>Very Bad Things: 5 guys go to Vegas for a bachelor party and all hell breaks lose. Cops. Comedy. Suspsense. I think they might have even been driving there from LA.<br/><br/>HANGOVER: 4 guys drive from LA to Vegas for a bachelor party and 'all hell breaks lose'. Cops. ""Comedy"". ""Suspense"".<br/><br/>I was amazed that the opening scene of HANG depicts the story line just before the actual wedding, and then after the short title sequence a caption appears saying ""Two days earlier"". This had to happen within 4 minutes of the film. VBT (1998) start with a scene just before the wedding ceremony, showing the male actors all stressed out, and then a captions says ""A few days earlier"", within about 2 minutes. In HANG the male actors are calling in to the wifey just before the wedding all stressed out with their potentially wedding altering circumstances. Not even original there, as the notion of the wedding being called off due to the events leading up to it was already done in VBT.<br/><br/>VBT contained some of the best acting of the careers of the many known faces. Hangover contained bad acting from a bunch of nobody's. VBT even contained some gut wrenching special effects, although compared to HANG it didn't need any, whereas HANG was desperate for anything to spice it up in VBT's wake.<br/><br/>VBT is a top notch dark comedy, whereas HANG attempts to enter the category and falls smack into its own dark crack."
"agmancuso","7","80","150","28 June 2009"," Heterosexuals in Sin City
","Yes, okay, it's very funny at times down right hilarious. What sets this comedy apart from others of its ilk, is a well structured script and a pace that doesn't allow any form of thinking. The chemistry between the four leads is also a plus. There is a surprising, maybe unconscious, touch of innocence in the midst of this night of debauchery that makes it palatable even charming. Bradley Cooper is coming into his own and I'm absolutely certain that he was born to play Emperor Caligula in a future Ridley Scott flick. The women, as in most films about a bunch of heterosexuals doing childish things, are treated appallingly. They are the enemy that they have to protect themselves from or just escape, run, run as fast and as far as you can. Try to find the hooker with a heart of gold, and if she looks like Heathter Graham, that much better and forget about settling down. ""The Hangover"" has already become the surprise hit of the summer 2009. I say, well done, it could have been worse"

"Bigbang","3","42","75","16 August 2009"," Hey another ""guys are complete morons"" movie. That's new.
","I don't find the ""dumb guy"" shtick funny anymore. If I want to see guys portrayed like complete buffoons all I have to do is watch television commercials and sitcoms all day. It's getting old and played out, especially because the Apatow clan and similar movies have covered this ground over and over the past few years. This movie just threw a bunch of random crap at the screen to see if it would stick and people would laugh. I guess they did, look at the high IMDb rating. I know that happens with new movies and the rating will go down over time, but come on.<br/><br/>How many times have we seen the ""get so wasted in Vegas and wake up married the next day, not remembering how it happened"" thing? Even the recent What Happens in Vegas with Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher was a lot better than this, which proves I'm not some anal-retentive humorless guy who forgot how to laugh or can't enjoy stupid movies. The clichés in Hangover are endless and the humor predictable.<br/><br/>The ridiculous plot holes don't help. There's nothing wrong with absurd moments in comedies that aren't believable to get some laughs, but come on. Personally I need some connection to reality to get a laugh. A tiger in the hotel room? And then the guy walking in the room to hand the tiger a steak, instead of just throwing it in room and quickly leaving. Totally predictable. Although it was good to see the Mike Tyson cameo, they totally wasted it with more random nonsense. It doesn't help that he's a terrible actor.<br/><br/>Heather Graham, who I used to love, continues to throw her career in the effin garbage. Although her mere presence helped at least. Well seeing that this move got high marks from a lot of people, we'll be stuck with this BS for awhile. No one is forcing me to see them, true, but even in decent movies there's always at least one ""dumb guy"" character. I'm tired of it. I can't watch one more dumb guy. Enough already."

","Absolutely loved this movie. The theatre was all laughs through the whole movie. Don't go expecting a cinematic masterpiece but if you are looking for out of control laughter this is your flick. The story was funny the acting was hilarious and I don't want to spoil it but the end was so funny my wife hurt her ribs (no I'm not kidding) from laughing so hard. <br/><br/>I am going back to see this movie again. And I don't do that often, but for any guy with a sense of humour or has ever been to a bachelor party (or can't wait to go to a rockin' bachelor party) this is a must see movie."

","Not only did I think this movie was awful, but most of my family did too. We thought it was completely awful, and didn't laugh once. I even tried to force myself to laugh, of funny there's a tiger in the hotel room, wait that's not funny, or is it? But the odd thing about this movie is other people I know thought it was hilarious. I watched it on my own so I'm confused about what parts others found funny. I guess what this movie lacks for me is wittiness, it's more of scenic humor possibly. I don't know how else to explain it because quite honestly I'm confused and just wish I hadn't watched it. I'd like to hear someone that understands what makes people laugh explain why it is that this movie gets so many laughs from some but none from others."

","I just joined IMDb to trash this movie, that's how much I didn't like it. Now, I found SuperBad, 40 yr old virgin, Something About Mary, Animal House all hilarious movies....not opposed to 'gross' humor is my point. But this movie was completely humorless, had no soul, each character more deplorable than the last. What makes movies funny is often the tension between the well-intentioned 'good' character and the rogues who beset them, (think Ben Stiller's character vs Matt Dillon's in SAM). Nothing like that here, really the character who might have brought comic tension into the story was the one roasting on the roof, off-camera for 95% of the time...dull, dull, dull."

","We got a single half-chuckle out of this movie at the 32 minute mark. That was it for the entire movie. We stuck it out to the bitter end only because so many people at the rental store said this was a very funny movie. Thanks to a couple of beers on hand, I didn't die of complete boredom, but we should have listened to the minority who said they turned it off after a few minutes.<br/><br/>This movie contains trivial, unfunny ""humor"", including lame butt jokes. The acting is ponderous and uninspired, largely because the content is completely lame and due to the need to drag this movie out to feature-length. I could write funnier material than this if it was my job.<br/><br/>Casting was also terrible. For instance, the ""Fat Jesus"" character just wasn't crazy or ugly enough.<br/><br/>The sleeping with the bartender joke was lame the first time. We didn't need it repeated 10 more times. Same with the Dr. Dentist joke.<br/><br/>The portrayal of police officers and the physician as unprofessional was too uninspired to be funny.<br/><br/>The movie is chock-a-block full of 4-letter words and unimaginative insults, yet every so often it throws in a kiddie swear word for no reason at all. Stupid on all counts!<br/><br/>Why did Dr. Dentist ever think he'd get away with staying in Las Vegas, when his girlfriend checks his credit card statements and he was billing the hotel room to his credit card? It wouldn't matter if the bill was for $100 or $10,000, she would still see it was in Las Vegas, not Napa.<br/><br/>Never answered: how/why did these deadbeats meet Mike Tyson and how did Mike Tyson's tiger ever get to the hotel?<br/><br/>Even the makeup was bad: Doug should have much redder and his color was inconsistent between scenes at the end."

"joecunningham14","8","21","36","13 June 2009"," deusexmachinafilm.blogspot.com
","If there's a film that will be sold on word of mouth alone this summer, it's The Hangover. With a funny but unspectacular trailer, a plot (guys go to Vegas for bachelor party and crazy things happens) that seems overly familiar, and stars who are relative unknowns there's nothing to suggest anything hugely promising. But those who have seen it can surely testify that it's a 24-carat piece of comedy gold, for once you can believe the marketing moguls...we have been graced by the sleeper comedy hit of the summer. On closer inspection it shouldn't actually have been that surprising, Todd Phillips occupies the director's chair and his previous output includes such hits as Road Trip, Old School and Starsky and Hutch. 'The Hangover' though easily surpasses those by merit of providing regular and consistent laughs amidst backdrop of a frenetic and unrelenting morning after.<br/><br/>The problems most comedies face are that they have to put all their best laughs in the trailer, so by the time the film comes around the funniest parts lose their impact and the rest of the film is disappointing in comparison. This is a problem The Hangover sidesteps masterfully. Yes we know they wake up with no memory of what went before; there's a baby, a tiger, a chicken, a missing tooth, someone's married a hooker and (in an unsurprisingly bizarre cameo) Mike Tyson turns up...but these moments, albeit hilarious, aren't what make the film tick. The heart of the film is in the chemistry between the three leads; Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) are likable and identifiable enough for an audience to go along with events that could quite easily in another context seem ridiculous. Alan in particular is a character that could really grind your gears if he turned up in certain films, as part of the affable trio however he grows on you immensely.<br/><br/>This success may partly be credited to casting unfamiliar faces but the actors themselves deserve huge credit. Cooper may already be slightly familiar to some and is undoubtedly a star in the making (having been cast this week as Faceman in the new A Team flick), Helms is best known for his stint in the US version of the office, Galifianakis though has come completely out of the blue and it wouldn't be at all a surprise to see him follow a career path similar to Seth Rogen's post Knocked Up. The missing groom Doug (Justin Bartha) also deserves an honourable mention for slotting effortlessly into the group when around, it's a shame the plot requires him to go missing for the most part. There's also perfectly pitched cameos for Heather Graham, Jeffrey Tambor, Ken Jeong and best of all Rachael Harris who is magnificently vile as the hapless Stu's wife.<br/><br/>Phillips has no qualms puts his characters through the wringer, there's one shocking revelation after another as the people, animals and events they encountered the night before come back to bite them on the ass during the search for Doug. As the audience know as little as the characters do the reactions ring true, they suspend disbelief as colossally silly events are only matched in magnitude by the sound of laughs in the theatre. The Hangover never quite lets up - the laughs even continue way into the credits - so it should come as no surprise that a sequel is already being planned. Having come up with something so fresh here the producers will have to be careful not to suffer from a hangover themselves the second time around.<br/><br/>Verdict: Brilliant chemistry and a few plot tweaks make The Hangover better than you could possibly be expecting going in. It's funny from start to finish and is guaranteed to have you leaving the cinema with a smile on your face."
"Serva","1","70","143","10 June 2009"," What happens in Vegas does not stay in Vegas unfortunately
","After seeing the movie I was so unimpressed I felt like writing an ironic review praising the fine acting and exquisite plot in this film. However, since it's currently in the IMDb top 250 and number one in the US box office, being a bit more serious seems like a better choice since I think the irony probably would be lost on most people.<br/><br/>The Hangover is about four guys who go to Las Vegas to attend one of the guy's bachelor party. They have a wild night and wake up the next morning not being able to remember a single thing from the previous night. This setup could possibly make for a somewhat entertaining film, however they have failed on this one. Out of the running time I think I laughed about two times. It's a very excruciating thing to watch a film where even one joke falls flat, in this one which is supposed to be a comedy they turn into string combos of jokes that simply aren't funny.<br/><br/>The humor is crude, sexist, violent, and still without going ever going over the line which is a problem. Comedies that go over the line, like Borat for example really is my cup of tea, but The Hangover never really dares to venture there. For example you are supposed to think the fat guy is funny because he is weird and stupid, although he comes off as too pathetic for it to be funny.<br/><br/>The plot never draws you in since one does not feel anything for the main characters, they are all unlikeable in their own unique way. In movies it's important to have a logical thread going through the entire film, and not introduce too many random characters or events that are not motivated, especially not in the later half or so. In The Hangover way too many characters and situations are just randomly inserted which I suppose is meant to be goofy and hilarious, but it just comes off as bad scriptwriting.<br/><br/>Worst of all though, and what really puts me off in The Hangover is the glorified picture of Las Vegas it produces, which unfortunately is very common in the mass media today. Las Vegas appears to be a paradise on Earth, where you come to have fun, win lots of money, and still leave with a smile on your face, no matter what happens. Because, what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. Well, let me tell you something: I've been to Las Vegas. Never in my life have I been to a more horrid place. I would never ever want to go there again. To me Las Vegas really embodies all the bad parts of the American culture. Nothing feels real there, it's all about surface and everything has this plastic, artificial feeling to it. Commerce is what it's all about there, spend money or lose it by gambling. None of this matters though, because most of the average joes watching this film will never go there, so film makers can continue to picture Las Vegas in this almost mythological way."
"therubixtheory","3","31","59","3 July 2009"," Dude where's my Doug? Where's your doug dude?
","It's happened again. The Hangover is another film produced this century that has a premise that's almost identical to an older movie. <br/><br/>The Hangover = Dude Where's My Car 17 Again = Big, 13 Going on 30, Freaky Friday Tropic Thunder = The Three Amigo's The Devil Wears Prada = How to lose friends and alieniate people (the version of DWP that's written by a man, about a man) Surfs Up = Cars (Surfs up was way better though)<br/><br/>Anyway.....<br/><br/>I'm dumbstrcuk by how much praise this movie is receiving. It's got no originality, the plot is ludicrous and boring and most of it still doesn't make any sense. Some of it's jokes include a backless jock strap. A man peeing while he turns to look at a tiger (Which happens to be Mike Tyson's that they stole from his house. Makes no sense for two reasons. A. they somehow find and walk right into Mike's house. B. they take this tiger up to their room without anyone noticing). A naked Chinese man beating the crap out of them. And the unexplained Rooster wandering the hotel room.<br/><br/>It did have it's funny moments but numbed my bottom thoroughly as they say.

","It's not often that I start out laughing hysterically and then wish I had not bothered wasting two hours on a movie. But that is exactly what happened for me with the Hangover. The basic notion of the movie had so much promise. When the gang wakes up in their incredible hotel suite at noon after the night of all nights before, with the groom missing, a full grown tiger in the bathroom, a crying baby in the closet, evidence that one of the groomsmen got married to a prostitute, body piercing, missing teeth, a mattress from the hotel room on top of one of the Ceasars' Palace statues and absolutely no memory of how any of this happened, I thought we were in for one hell of a movie. Oh how wrong could I have been! Everything went down hill from here. The implausible valet parked stolen police car, the baby sat normally in the back of the police car with a regular seat belt whilst the gang mounts the Vegas sidewalk at speed just to get out of traffic, the Gangsters with guns who do little more than threaten verbally, the ridiculous on-going escapades with Mike Tyson's Pet Tiger, the MIT blackjack team impersonation from just 15 minutes reading a book on card counting that conveniently results in winning $82,000 to pay back a debt of $80,000, the police tazar gun demo on the gang by the local cops in front of participating school children, and the mid-drive interstate delivery of tuxedos that conveniently fit perfectly. I really wish someone would redo this movie and take the initial premise and make it darker and believable. I'm amazed that the ratings are so high for what I feel was one of the worst movie's of the year, if not the decade!"

","This movie being rated with a similar rating as such a great films as ""Some Like it Hot"", ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""Annie Hall"" shocks me.<br/><br/>So generic. I find nothing funny about the same old gag trick of someone suddenly vomiting (which didn't look real, but I don't care), a car being trashed, people beaten up, cars trashed more, more beatings, slap-stick gags, breast shots, genital shots and ugly fat asses and more vomiting.<br/><br/>Certainly the writer or whoever, wanted to use shock effect since most people nowadays have seen so much and heard so much that they have to go quite far to shock, but this was sooo cheap and low grade. A few others here have mentioned this as well and I really wish I had read their comments, but they were too far down the chain of praise for this stupidity. I only read the main comment that the IMDb gang has posted as the representative comment. Not to slam IMDb, it's a terrific site and I've used it for years, but there needs to be a balance so that people like myself don't get sucked into shelling out my hard-earned money to be dragged through this trash.<br/><br/>It starts right off with insipid, re-hashed, foolish-high-school-kid type pranks which drones on to the very end. And that weird pedophile. What humor does anyone find in a pedophile? Do most people nowadays think it's funny? Or maybe it went over their heads. I don't know. Then the poor little baby was obviously frightened on purpose to get him to cry. Just that alone was upsetting me.<br/><br/>I did laugh in a couple of places, but that was after I'd already been sitting there for half an hour kicking myself that I'd actually paid to watch this garbage and that short interval of ha ha didn't make up for the rest of the film which leans heavily on the above-mentioned cheap, low-grade, slutville humor."

Find someone who has seen this movie whose opinion on movies you almost always agree with. If they say you'll like it, go and see it and join in with the stupids who find this rehashed tripe hilarious. If you're going based on hype, you may end up as disappointed as I was.<br/><br/>Oh and BTW, there's no way this movie belongs anywhere near the Top 250 of all time.

The movie gets funny from the Las Vegas part right till the end. There is hilarious stuff in every other scene. Not to be missed, one of the best comedy of 2009.<br/><br/>The entrance of Chinese goon is Hilarious, will have you in splits.

Major points where the two pieces meet are the scene, casinos and the hangover in Las Vegas, the appearance of a tiger, Tyson, getting married to a casino employee and so on ... all must be a miraculous coincidence.<br/><br/>""The Hangover"" clearly has some great jokes but it cannot keep up the same level throughout the 100 minutes therefore the moderate rating.

This would have made it a much better movie. The ground work was there, it was fun, but they fell short on delivery. Can't rely on a dozen or so snapshots at end to tie it up and satisfy the audience. It seems they all put on the make-up for the photos, had some kind of location, and someone forgot the film camera and so they couldn't shoot it live. So they took photos instead. Disappointed with lack of vision on whoever made that call. Also, a little anti-climatic with finding friend they were searching for entire movie.

"C-Younkin","7","31","61","3 June 2009"," Hungover with laughter
","""The Hangover"" is the work of Todd Phillips. You know him. He made ""Road Trip"". He also made ""Old School."" Getting a bunch of buddies together and throwing in sex, drugs, beer, and all kinds of frat-boy hi-jinx is a formula that's served him well in the past and it does the same here. At the outset the movie is simple. One wild night followed by a couple days of trying to figure out what happened. It's a buddy comedy and mystery, reminiscent of ""Dude, Where's My Car"", except this movie happens to be funny.<br/><br/>The cast is mostly unknown but Phillips has worked with that before. Comedy is about chemistry, not big stars commanding big paychecks. Bradley Cooper (last seen in ""He's Just Not that Into You""), Ed Helms (""The Daily Show"") and Zach Galifianakis (idk, ""This"") play Phil, Stew, and Alan, three guys taking their buddy Doug (Justin Bartha) out to Vegas for his bachelor party. Phil and Stew are the best buddies, Alan is Doug's mentally-askew soon-to-be-brother in-law. After a wild night, the three guys wake up the next day to a trashed hotel room and several odd, unexplained phenoms. They find a baby in the closet, a tiger in the bathroom, and Doug is nowhere to be found. Other mysteries include why did Stew marry a stripper (Heather Graham), why are Asian mobsters after them, and dude, where's the car? The guys must retrace their steps to figure out the night and also find Doug.<br/><br/>Fresh surprises keep coming as the story moves along. Some, like the baby and the marriage to the stripper are missed opportunities, but for the most part they're pretty hilarious. The tiger is a great bit, as are the Asian mobsters. What happens to be lying in the trunk of the car is another good one. What powers it all is that the guys remember nothing of the night before. The movie is like a fish-out-of water tale, just replace the water with Jagermeister and roofies. Phillips ties it all together with crude laughs that nonetheless come off very funny. Masturbation, sex, drugs, stun-guns, f-words, condoms, and a couple of baby gags that I'm pretty sure will cement his place in hell but still make people laugh pretty hard are just a few things in his comic arsenal.<br/><br/>The three guys are great together. Allan is awkwardly clueless, unpredictable, and a little crazy. His speech, inviting the guys into his ""wolf pack of one"", is fantastic, as is what comes after that. The chubby and fully-bearded Zach Galifianakis is a scene stealer. Stew is the opposite, a guy so whipped into submission by his girlfriend that they might as well share brains. He's a nervous nerd prone to unraveling at the first sign of pressure. And Phil is the cool, clear-headed straight-man to the other two who get most of the laughs. Cooper, Helms, and Galifianakis know their roles well and convince that these three very different guys could actually be friends. The supporting cast, which includes Rob Riggle, Rachel Harris, Mike Epps, and Mike Tyson (in a very funny cameo) help out as well, but the best one comes from Ken Jeong, playing Mr. Chow, leader of the Asian mob. His flamboyance and exaggerated speech make him a ridiculously quirky villain.<br/><br/>""The Hangover"" is a comic adventure well worth taking and when it finishes, don't leave yet cause you'll miss the hilarious trip photos playing over the closing credits. The movie is fresh, lively, fast-paced, and the cast is all game. Drink it up. It's a lot of fun."
"jts0405","10","25","48","8 June 2009"," High Expectations get Surpassed
","It is about time that we see Bradley Cooper as a leading man, he has performed so well in comedies like Wet Hot American Summer, Wedding Crashers and last year's Yes Man with Jim Carrey. On the other hand his co-stars of Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis perform better than most of the familiar comedy genre faces. This movie was already held with high expectations before it was released, but those expectations have truly been met and surpassed altogether. Now at first I was hesitant, because the whole Rated R gross out comedy style is getting recycled way too much lately, but this actually turned out to be a hilarious movie, with nothing seeming like it was recycled from Judd Apatow, Adam Sandler or Kevin Smith movies. The cast actually is made up of people that normally have to take the backseat as cameo people or supporting people, and they truly deliver and showcase why they need to lead more often in films. All in all you really get what you expect and more from The Hangover. The characters are likable, the story is something new and different, plus you get a lot of laughs that don't seem like they have been stolen from the Apatow/Sandler movies. This is truly the breakout comedy of the summer and probably one of the funniest movies of the year 2009.<br/><br/>10/10"

Hollywood needs to grow up - they were making movies like this when I was in my teens (Porky's) - get your noses out of your school boy fantasies and try and make a decent movie next time will you? Something with a little wit and intelligence if you don't mind."
"evan-200","1","35","71","7 October 2009"," This Was Supposed to Be Funny?
","I didn't have very high expectations just because these kind of made-for-fraternity movies aren't usually appealing to me. In that regard it was what I expected. Not clever at all, there really weren't any jokes. I mean you pretty much know that the movie is going to be about a terrible hangover, and it is - but there aren't any very clever jokes, solid characters, or interesting situations where something funny might happen. Instead, the writers take the easy route (but not a very funny one) and all of the attempted humor is just pure shock-value. It just doesn't meet my definition for what a good comedy or good movie should be at all. I kept waiting to laugh, but never did. I would not recommend this film to anyone. It's all hype and marketing and does not deliver."
"Simon_Says_Movies","7","26","51","7 August 2009"," Entertaining as much for its puzzle-piece story then for its raunch
","Sometimes the title of a film can sell itself, or at the very least pique a viewer's interest. Director Todd Phillip's new comedy The Hangover does this and more by introducing an infinitely relatable premise and infusing it with a clever story to keeps the gimmick supported for the duration. While providing the requisite raunch, stupidity and laughs, The Hangover is bolstered more by its puzzle piece narrative then by straight up humour. The mark of a good comedy is one that can keep your interest in between the laughs; be it by human drama, character development or in this case, a meandering riddle.<br/><br/>What do we really know about a hangover? We know we have one, and we know we drank too much. Often everything before, after and in-between can be a blur at best, and for three friends, Phil, Stu and Alan they certainly got the worst. Travelling to Las Vegas for a night of sin, gin and wins to celebrate their friend Doug's (Justin Bartha) bachelor party they awaken the next morning to find their hotel room a tad dishevelled, a tiger in their bathroom, their memories wiped clean and their groom to be MIA. Playing the three worried bros respectively are Bradley Cooper as the bored-with-his-life school teacher, Ed Helms as the neurotic dentist and Zach Galifanakis as the awkward weirdo and soon to be brother in law of Doug. So unfolds the mystery; trying to find their missing friend before the wedding by piecing together the clues of their epic night out.<br/><br/>For me the standout of the group was certainly Ed Helms. He plays the role straight, he is likable and he is funny. His characters arc is the most complete and entertaining and he certainly grounds his wilder counterparts nicely. The other players are certainly funny, yet the characters of Phil and Alan are not fully likable. Cooper's Phil is a bit of a prick and Alan is flat out creepy. That aside the actors put forward such commendable efforts all is soon forgotten and the quick pace and continual humour keeps things fast, fun and frantic.<br/><br/>As promised by the trailers, we get a cameo from the Mike Tyson who is funnier for being himself then for his actual performance, darting in an out with a great supporting performance is heather Graham as an escort and Mike Epps makes good use of his time as quote 'Black Doug'. More hilarious yet is a closing cover for rapper 50 Cents' Candy Shop which is as inspired as it is hilarious. The Hangover is certainly one of those comedies that is re-watchable, and likely to improve with repeat viewings. However it is probably a good thing actual hangovers are not this much fun; I'd rather die of laughter then alcohol poisoning.<br/><br/>Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"

","Wow, this is just the worst movie I have ever seen. Everything failed and I did not even smile once. It was so full of clichés, bad actors and over-the-top BS that I was tempted to exit the cinema, for the first time in my life. I would have if I didn't go there with friends.<br/><br/>It's predictable, boring and a complete waste of time. The actors overact almost every scene and some of them are embarrassing to watch. I particularly disliked the guy who was always being an asshole towards the others as he seemed to be a complete douche and a waste of air. The guy named Alan was overacting in a way that is hard to describe. The one with glasses was boring and dull and the last one we didn't really see that much, which I am grateful for.<br/><br/>This is just dick-humor, and a bad attempt at that even. This movie is a waste of money and everybody involved deserves some sort of torture directed towards their lower region.<br/><br/>I am in shock. Even things like Epic Movie is better than this."
"SkidMcCormick","10","20","38","20 July 2009"," Long Live This Bromance!
","As a long standing admirer of movies and acting, I do enjoy my comedies (as the doctors say, laughter is the best medicine!) Sure, the face of comedy has changed from the sophisticated seventies of Annie Hall, but that isn't a bad thing eitherwhich brings me to the Bro-com or Bromance as I prefer. We've seen its early stages from Road Trip, Old School, Anchorman, The 40-Year-Old Virgin and blooming into gems such as Role Models, I Love You, Man & now the classic Hangover! (God, I still can't stop laughing as I'm writing this)And before you ask, I have seen this film 6 times already and aim to watch it even more upon its DVD release sometime in October (lucky guess I think).<br/><br/>From the posts I've read on this thread, I would agree with some opinions, such as the fact that The Hangover is Sex and the City for men – but funny. It proves again that when a bunch of guys get together (as wonderfully illustrated in this film) that they're not leering at women from afar in Benny Hill fashion; but paying them cheeky compliments along the way: ""Excuse me Ma'am, in the leopard dress, you have an amazing rack!"" says Bradley Cooper's Phil Wenneck on a megaphone. I won't recap the scenario for you, as I am sure 95% of the USA has seen this already! Oh, and don't get me started on dweebs who say that the tiger in the backseat is unreal – IT'S A COMEDY for crying out loud! It's the same with Stu Price confronting the tiger in the bathroom and screaming like a girl when giving him his raw meat. The laughter would've been lost if he simply threw the morsel at the animal.<br/><br/>Why I embrace the Bromance so much is that it outlines women's faults as much as ours. In I Love You, Man Rashida Jones's Zoe thinks it's fine for her to gossip with girlfriends about her sex life with Peter Klaven (Paul Rudd) but he can't behave in the same manner with his male pals. The same goes for Ed Helms's (Stu Price) and the fact that his Antichrist girlfriend won't let him have a lads weekend away; but it's okay for her to sleep with a bartender! It also illustrates America's constant homophobia issues and luckily, it's acceptable for straight men to declare their brotherly love without worrying about waking up in bed together! What grates on my nerves are people who express their disapproval about so-called gay bashing in this and other movies such as The 40-Year-Old Virgin. This is comedy after all and you cannot be politically correct to please your demographic audience, that's just plain silly. Lines such as: ""Paging Doctor Faggot!"" are simply hilarious, because it's mocking that character's stupidity, not making fun of homosexuals. If you're gay and want to be offended, go and watch Bruno with Sacha Baron Cohen or Beerfest where they do nothing but reinforce the stereotype. If people start to nitpick about the flack racial/religious/sexual groups receive from comedies, then what will you eventually make fun of? I am actually mixed-race myself and have never taken offence to a classic comedy where the majority of the players are white. In fact, I welcome these movies than drivel such as Pooty Tang & A Thin Line Between Love & Hate (4.7/10 on IMDb's start rating?). Oh, and Bad Boys – unfunny, shouting and self indulgent.<br/><br/>What makes The Hangover an instant classic is the casting & chemistry with all the leads (and Todd Phillips's hilarious cameo). Bradley Cooper, whose character of Zachary ""Sack"" Lodge in Wedding Crashers was such a douche-bag, but played the part to perfectionin other words, he was unforgettable. I was surprised at his casting initially, but the man can play comedy very well and gets a few good laughs, as I have mentioned already. He seems like a stand-up guy in real life and look forward to seeing more of the Coopster in the future! Ed Helms is also phenomenal in his role as Stu – and quite sympathetic at times as well. Don't know much about him but believe me, I am a convert now and will be watching The Office as soon as possible. Great comic timing and delivery doesn't hurt your appeal, does it? Zach Galifianakis: I used to watch him in Tru Calling but had no idea he was so funny! Yes, he's out of shape but that makes him more believable and his deadpan humour gives this movie some of its funniest moments – including the threat of not being afraid to beat-up an old man at the gas station or ""the side effects of Roofies is memory loss, remember?"" or the side-splittingly hilarious ""I didn't know they gave out rings in the Holocaust?"" Justin Bartha as (white) Doug: He didn't have a lot to do in this film, but as a testimony to visual comedy, his red face in the end is something else – and pretty sure his on screen bride-to-be couldn't keep a straight face either! The thing I love about this comedy is that unlike Sex and the City, these guys have ordinary professions (except for Alan & Doug, whom we don't find anything about) -which makes it easier as an audience to bond with and best of all, is the shared dynamic they all have. Also, the fact that you miss comedic moments the first time, means you'll savour them on repeated viewing. A great chemistry and a comedy that doesn't apologise when it comes down to using a baby for a jack-off joke! Let's hope Hangover 2 is as good as or surpasses this milestone classic. Todd Phillips, we salute you! PS: Ken Jeongwhat a legend and a great sport for understanding the values of being in a R-rated comedy. His ""So long gay boys"" line will forever be on my cellphone when the DVD is released!"

","Saw Preview at Vue Cinema Thurrock 2/6/09 This is without a doubt the funniest film I have seen in quiet a while to tell you anything about it would spoil the film but suffice to say that I thought my wife would need the toilet a few times during the film. It has some uncomfortable tones (it brings a whole new meaning to the expression 'never act with kids or animals) which may upset some people and the overall effect is a whacking success. The language is a bit rich at times but given the situations I think I might have sworn. The actors are mainly unknown (until now) and that adds to the unpredictability of some of the funniest scenes in that there are no heroes or villains as such except!

","When I first saw the trailer I thought there is another stupid comedy filled with generic humor, but this movie was just amazing I was laughing during the whole thing. Usually there are five or six extremely funny moments in every-one of this kind of films but this was entirely new experience. The plot is old, the actors are well known but somehow the movie is just hilarious, I am absolutely serious when I say that this is the best comedy I have ever seen. Everything in it is so unpredictable you just do not know what will be the next absurdly funny scene. And they do not over do it, something that is very, very important because you would normally say to yourself when watching this kind of movies, well that is just impossible or why am I watching this, here instead you would say I just got to have one night like theirs. And that is the thing that me and my friends said to each other after the film. It is so unrealistic and at the same time so plausible in an unbelievable way, that is what makes it so amazing extraordinary things happen to ordinary people. My advice is to watch this movie because it will change your entire idea of what comedies should be."

","Unless you're some smug, pretentious, uptight anti-social person that people don't like to hang out with you're gonna love this flick. It's hilarious. Off hand the ""group of guys going to Vegas for a bachelor party"" doesn't sound enticing or something that could make for a great movie since it's an epic retread in cinema but director Todd Phillips takes the idea and runs with it.<br/><br/>The movie, unlike most, doesn't center around the bachelor party but the next day as the guys try and trace their way through the night and figure out what exactly happened the night before in a drunken haze.<br/><br/>The flick plays like a whimsical, drug induced detective story. They chase leads, confront many colorful characters, and find themselves in and out of trouble while trying to piece together the pieces of the night before and locate their pal (the groom) who was lost along the way.<br/><br/>The Chemistry of these fellas is outstanding. None of them miss a beat and they're all funny. Of course the lesser known Zach Galifinakis really shines here as the not all there, cling-on, soon-to-be-brother in law of the groom. None of his one-liners miss their target and the sheer sight of him puts a smile on our faces.<br/><br/>All in all a hilarious adventure that will keep you laughing throughout and this I promise you.

I like to think of myself as someone who definitely has a great sense of humor and I truly appreciate many forms of comedy.

""Four Christmases"" scribes Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, who also penned ""Ghosts of Girlfriends Past,"" have concocted a fresh, funny, and far-out misadventure that consistently delivers laughs based on the comic formula of incongruity.

Before he gets hitched, Doug's two best buddies—school teacher Phil Wenneck (Bradley Cooper of ""He's Just Not That Into You"") and dentist Stu Price (Ed Helms of ""Semi-Pro"")—along with Tracy's weird brother Alan Garner (Zach Galifianakis of TV's ""Tru Calling"") take him to Vegas for a last-minute blow-out. Tracy's father Sid (Jeffrey Tambor 0f ""Hellboy 2: The Golden Army"") hands Doug the keys to his classic Mercedes convertible and entrusts its care to him. Sid admonishes Doug not to let Alan get behind the wheel, and Doug and his cronies hit the road for Caesar's Palace. No sooner do they arrive than they alter their plans. First, they check themselves into an expensive $4, 200 a night villa. Second, they ascend to the roof to toast Doug's future with shots of Jagermeister. Third, cretinous Alan laces their liquor with Rohypnol or roofies, a date-rape drug that he mistakenly believes is Ecstasy so they can really enjoy themselves.<br/><br/>Phil, Stu, and Alan awaken the next day to a trashed villa. Alan waddles off to take a whiz and discovers that a real-live tiger—stripes, claws, and all—is lounging in their bathroom. Our heroes regroup and deduce that they have spent the wildest weekend of their lives. Phil wears a medical bracelet from his night in the emergency room where doctors treated him for a concussion. Not only has Stu lost one of his front teeth, but he has also lost his mother's Holocaust ring that he planned to give to his girlfriend Melissa (Rachael Harris of ""The Soloist""), when he proposes marriage to her. Incidentally, Melissa believes the boys are enjoying a wine tasting weekend in the woods rather than a bachelor party in Vegas. Nothing really awful happens to Alan because he qualifies as his own worst enemy. Alan discovers, however, that they have an infant in their closet. When the guys descend to the parking lot for their Mercedes, they are surprised when the valets whip a Las Vegas police cruiser up to the entrance for them.<br/><br/>Principally, our heroes remember nothing from the previous eight hours thanks to the roofies. Worse, they find neither hide nor hair of Doug. Indeed, Doug has vanished. Phil, Stu, and Alan set out to retrace their evening's revelry in an effort to recover Doug. Stu learns he has married a stripper, Jade (Heather Graham of ""Say It Isn't So""), who is wearing his mother's Holocaust ring, while a couple of Asian thugs want to pound them into the pavement for stealing $80-thousand from their whiny boss, Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong of ""Role Models""), who has lost his dough as well as his duds.<br/><br/>Todd Phillips relates most of this madcap merriment in flashback. No stranger to comedy, Phillips also helmed ""School for Scoundrels' and ""Road Trip,"" and he keeps the humor in high gear. One of the funniest scenes finds our hapless heroes making a deal with the Las Vegas Police to drop their grand theft auto charges if they participate in a tazer demonstration. The LVPD let elementary school aged children tazer them. Eventually, our heroes find Doug but they also have to tangle with Mike Tyson as well as Doug's testy fiancée. Tracy demands unequivocally that they haul themselves back to L.A. for the wedding. Predictably, our heroes damage Sid's priceless Mercedes and snap scores of incriminating photos of themselves at play. Unlike ""Very Bad Things,"" ""The Hangover"" will keep you doubled up in hysterics!"

You have to admit sometimes the most interesting/invigorating thing you can do is freak out about what you did last night, and try to put the pieces together! I'd say that would make a great movie but no...they went beyond that and made the movie gut busting. I'd say I haven't laughed that hard for a movie in a long time. Bradley Cooper was great he was the cool guy in the group who had a lot of the ideas, the cracks about his life were awesome and I am sure something all guys can relate too (especially the family men). Its crazy how they had the regular circle of friends for the movie, the ""smart"" one (Ed Helmes' character...Andy from the Office) who did some really stupid stuff, marrying Heather Graham though was the smartest thing he has ever done, would be any man's dream come true. The ""cool"" one, Bradley Cooper's character mentioned earlier, and the ""retarded"" one, (Zach Galifianakis) he was so dumb because basically he was comic relief for a comic which just basically added to the laughs. I am pretty sure his character in a baby standing silent with those glasses on made me laugh.<br/><br/>I don't know what to say I can't think of anything bad to say about this movie, at some point I was put off but I can't remember when because they immediately recovered with an awesome laugh. <br/><br/>So that's what I am going to do I am going to say only positive things about it and just say that if you are feeling blue and in need of good medicine, this movie deals out the best of it and in mega quantities.

The Script is perfect for the location (bachelor party) and the Director, Todd Phillips has just made a wonder out of it. Except for the scene where they carry back the Tiger, I never felt that there was any moment in the movie that looked ""unreal"". Plain movie where circumstances take them around, and made such a good humorous flick out of it. Phil (Bradley Cooper), the cool dude, driving the story, with Alan (Zach) in all that crazy stuff and Stu (Ed Helms) cracking those comments just perfectly fit in to make it a mind blowing hilarious flick. A special mention to Jade (Heather Graham) who looks lovely as ever making the guys skip a beat for sure. Mike Tyson with his best punch and the Chinese guy Ken Jeong with his unique style just make it a worth watch file.

","This film was amazing, from start to finish I was laughing all the way through. My mom was even laughing, and she doesn't even like crude humor, but she said she wanted to see something funny for her birthday. And she even said it was the funniest movie shes ever seen.<br/><br/>The cast is amazing, and the writing was great as well. It balances out the humor quite well, and doesn't seem to make fun of one general thing to much (Race,Gender,Homosexuality). The movie always seems to surprise you, and it is nearly impossible to guess what happens next which is a big plus for me.<br/><br/>My one complaint about the movie is that near the end it kind of felt pushed, I would say the last 20 Min, but its all made up for with a great ending, and a few pictures from the wild night during the credits.<br/><br/>The movie is pretty vulgar I'm not going to lie, but some of the situations that they are put into are just so funny you can't help but laugh, I remember at one point I was literally in tears, not just watery eyes, tears.<br/><br/>If you want to laugh, a lot, See this movie."

","The detective story. We have many cases where humor is overlain.<br/><br/>But we have few cases where the mystery involves the detectives. Usually the detective is implicated in some way, or is involved through some matter of honor. Other than ""D O A"" I do not know of another film where the detectives were the victims. <br/><br/>The jokes work here, as does the pacing. It has energy. But the thing that intrigues me is the mystery. We have a missing tooth and a missing groom. There is an unexplained animal, baby, police car, wedding and pursuer. The setup, with a pending wedding that sets the clock ticking, probably relies overly on us having seen ""Sideways.""<br/><br/>The strange engineering here is the distance maintained between the guy world and the girl world. Its too consistent and effective to be mere intuition. There are script consultants for this sort of thing but it is so well integrated I believe it have been there at the beginning. We have the chatty quite lovely bride, steeping in girlie stuff in soft poses. There is a prostitute who factors in the mystery. It seems they had to reach far to find someone as appealing as Heather Graham: needy, attractive, innocent but still a hooker. And then there is the bitch, harder than any stereotype known to me.<br/><br/>The result is the reinforcement of the insular pretend work which we enter in order to enjoy the story.

","What unadulterated tripe. I've never seen such utter kak in all my life. Not only was it insulting to someone of moderate intelligence, to class it as humour...what can I say? I'd rather have stuck hot needles in my eyes. This movie was SO boring. The whole reason you go and see a supposed 'funny' movie is so that it makes you laugh. Not in this case. You d rather see the stupid characters in this film run over by a double decker bus. That'd be a lot more funny.<br/><br/>Mike Tyson has a cameo role in the movie and boy is he a bad actor. I know he isn't one to trade, but his scenes should definitely have been left on the cutting room floor. Like many other aspects of the movie, he was cringe worthy. People will argue that his stint in the film was 'crucial' to the plot, which goes to show just HOW bad this film really is, if they could have done without it.<br/><br/>Just crude, predictable drivel. No plot, annoying characters and a bad script. I also hate it when they use swearing to try and make something seem funnier than it really is.

Certainly nothing like Old School or Wedding Crashers (which is what everyone who 'raved' about the film compared it to). The funniest part of the entire film was when the credits rolled. I don't mean that as an insult. That part really was funny. Other than that, I felt most of the jokes were flat, cheap sight gags and very few witty lines.<br/><br/>I'd wait for this one on rental. Even then , it's not that great. Should have listened to my gut after I first saw the trailer."
"MartinHafer","3","8","14","29 July 2011"," I guess I am missing something with this film....
","I felt so out of touch with everyone when I got around to seeing this film. After all, it has a very respectable score on IMDb and a lot of folks seemed to like it--yet I found it about as enjoyable as dental surgery. Part of the problem might be that I only watched it because I was bored and on a cruise ship with a very limited selection of DVDs. Part of it might be because the day before (also out of boredom) I watched ""Hot Tub Time Machine""--and it was practically the same film.<br/><br/>""The Hangover"" is a story about four completely unlikable guys who seem more like caricatures than anyone you'd ever meet. In addition, they were so unlike each other you wonder if such friendships ever exist anywhere but in a Hollywood film. One is the guy who is about to get married--and wants to screw some hookers before he ties the knot (how heart-warming). One is a handsome school teacher who is just nasty and 100% unlikable. One is a screw-up and idiot--so they naturally make him the fat guy. And, the other is the man in a relationship with a castrating female. If these sound familiar, they were pretty much the same characters you'd see in ""Hot Tub Time Machine""--but even more one-dimensional and this is especially true for the last two characters I mentioned. They go to Vegas, accidentally ingest some of the date rape drug and do lots of insane things--little of which is particularly funny. And this is the problem with the film. If you laugh at very low-brow humor, don't mind that the plot makes no sense (such as the tasering scene) and think that a dirty word is THE punchline for most jokes, then you'll enjoy the film. As for me, I can enjoy a dopey film (such as ""Talladega Nights"" or ""Strange Brew"")--but there is a limit to dopiness. Plus, it's hard to stick with a movie when you simply don't care what happens to any of them. Overall, over-rated unlike any recent movie I have seen. Unpleasant, unfunny and for the undemanding."
"brodsky_donna-1","10","8","14","11 September 2009"," Funniest movie I've EVER seen
","The first time I watched this movie with my sister and daughter. I thought we were going to get kicked out of the theater for disturbing the peace, we were laughing so hard. Three viewings later, I still laugh out loud and I can't wait to have a permanent copy in my home. The setup took a little long before launching into the action, but was necessary to give us a good look at each character with a lot of payoffs all the way. Over the top humor with an over the top premise kept the tone and pacing perfect. There were a few things that were unbelievable (leaving a baby in a car and a guy in a trunk in that Las Vegas heat?) but never interfered with the entertainment value. Bless the investors -- I'm sure they're dancing in the streets after this success!"

","I just returned from the theater where I saw ""The Hangover"", and I must admit, with what I saw from it first, I wouldn't have chosen it myself, but a very foxy lady (Italian, redhead, and a nice rack) asked me if I wanted to see that one, and any guy will know that if a girl like that asks you out, SHE chooses the movie. Awaiting her arrival, I met my cousin up front, and he told me he thought""The Hangover"" was that chick flick. After just watching the film for 2 minutes, Bradley Cooper appeared on the screen and my date said ""Oh God, he's so hot, that's the reason why I wanted to see the film"". At this point, I didn't really think this movie was going to be something, but soon I had to review my opinion.<br/><br/>The humour in this movie for starters is of different levels. There is the sexual innuendo/teen-humour, there are crazy and absurd situations, there is some slapstick, basically, whatever humour you favour, this movie has got it. You'll laugh at some point in the film.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie gives you a great feeling. It really somehow has that vibe of ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", where you also had the feeling that you wanted to experience the same fun the actors in that movie had. You just feel like you're on a ""magical ride"" with them, and you regret not being there in real life.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie are really worked out nicely, both by the screenplay as well as the actors. Hot shot of the evening, Bradley Cooper, really gave me the impression like he was an incredible fun person to be around with, and I'd definitely want Phil (his character in the movie) to be my friend in real life. Zach Galifianakis (Alan) plays a great annoying little moron too. In the beginning of the movie you hate him, and you'd wish they dump him in the desert, but he manages to win you over by his at least good nature.<br/><br/>A nice addition to the movie is Ken Jeong who plays a (probably) gay leader of the Chinese mafia who seems obsessed by imitating Western (African-American) slang and manners. Normally I'm not too fond of Asian actors, but this one really give the movie extra humour.<br/><br/>Don't let a weak trailer keep you from seeing this movie. I've enjoyed it immensely, and had quite a few laughs, while I'm usually not the kind to break out in laughter."

","With writers churning out script after mundane script; and story lines weaker than the state of some actors after a hard night on the town:- this film is exactly what those who have a hangover need; a breath of fresh air. This is the funniest film of the decade. Compare it to the likes of Yes Man which has Jim Carrey to carry the story but this script calls upon actors of lesser known fame- and it does the script and film more justice than having a well known cast member (I am not criticising Yes Man either by the way!). The laughs are sustained throughout and you are able to explore 'The Night Before The Morning After'. We have all been there, but it has never been this amusing. Even calling upon physical attributes of the actors for jokes; i.e. weight or facial hair allow this script to have more depth than modern day thrillers.

All is well until the next morning when the friends wake up in their hotel suite with no memory of the previous night's events, a gap where a tooth used to be, a chicken, a tiger, a baby - oh, and no Doug. The rest of the movie tells of the increasingly desperate attempts by the friends to reconstruct what happened last night so that they can, hopefully, retrieve Doug in time to get him to his wedding.<br/><br/>I never believed the events of this movie for a second, but that didn't really matter: there was sufficient suspension of disbelief for the improbable narrative to work, and it was always fun to be in the company of these well fleshed out, if caricature-ish, characters.<br/><br/>There aren't too many belly laughs, but the humour is constant and organic - I found myself chuckling all the way through.<br/><br/>Special mention must go to Ken Jeong who is a deliriously effete Chinese crime tsar, and who has the most memorable on-screen entrance of any character in any movie I can remember."

","My brother-in-law, who is in his mid 30s and who knows I love a good comedy, handed this DVD to me and said ""Here, you need to watch this. It's the funniest movie I've ever seen."" I should've known then it was going to be awful, considering in most cases his idea of ""humor"" is about the same as that of a 14 year old boy. However, I had heard others say how funny it was, so I thought ""maybe, why not?"" For the record, let me state that I'm a big fan of low-brow humor. I love the majority of the classic ""dirty"" comedies. The Hangover is DEFINITELY not in that group however. At one point I looked at my wife, who also likes a good comedy, and asked her if she wanted to watch something else. Her exact statement was ""Maybe it will get funny."" Not a good sign.<br/><br/>The first problem is that the characters are just not likable. Justin Bartha's character is probably the most likable, and he's hardly in the film. Bradley Cooper's character is a massive jerk (much like his role in the Wedding Crashers, which is a MUCH better movie than this one!), Ed Helms' character is an irritating whiner and Zach Galifianakis character wasn't much better, just stupid irritating.<br/><br/>Secondly, the movie tries too hard to be funny. ""Look, a dentist pulled his own tooth out! Isn't that funny?"" ""A tiger in a hotel room! Isn't that funny?"" ""Look, the idiot is a genius black-jack player! Whew, didn't see that one coming!"" ""Mike Tyson! Wow, that dude is funny, right?"" I could go on... The supposed gags feel contrived and forced.<br/><br/>Finally, the ""dirty humor"" comes across as crass rather than funny. Animal House does dirty humor very well. It's funny. The Hangover does not. It gets the dirty part, but misses the humor.<br/><br/>Save yourself two hours of your life and watch something else."

","I realize there's an audience for crass, juvenile comedies, and while I myself don't enjoy them, I am capable of understanding what it is about them that amuses some people. I might even manage a chuckle or two while watching one (always under duress and never by choice). ""The Hangover,"" however, baffles me. It is so witless, so humorless, so vulgar, and so senseless, its success astounds me. I can't imagine anyone not having undergone a lobotomy finding anything remotely funny about this film, which doesn't come close to fulfilling the potential of its plot. How it grossed nearly $500 million at the box office is beyond my comprehension. Had I paid to see it, I would demand a refund. As it is, I feel everyone associated with it owes me the 90 minutes of my life I lost watching it, sticking with it to the end only because I needed to see if there was at least one laugh before the final credits. Trust me, there isn't."

","I thought this movie was total trash! Not funny at all. Just a bunch of stupid frat boy humor. I was actually depressed watching it, because it just goes to show you how low our society has sunk. Seems that Hollywood has no limits anymore on how to make money off of sex, drugs, exploiting women, and lack of caring for animals and children. This is just mindless garbage. The lead character (Bradley Cooper) is also extremely annoying. He plays a Dick in every show he is in, and I have a hard time believing it is far from reality. It is actually insulting to the general public that the majority of people that went to see this movie gave it such high ratings. stupid and sad!"

Tracy's father lends his convertible Mercedez Benz that is his pride and joy to Doug with many recommendations. The quartet rents the best suite in the Caesar's Palace and they go to the roof to celebrate. Alan proposes a toast to Doug and they drink his booze.

The trio tries to track down last night to find what happened and sooner they discover that Stu married the stripper Jade (Heather Graham) and Alan has spiked their booze with ""Good Morning, Cinderella"" in the beginning of their crazy night. <br/><br/>""The Hangover"" is a hilarious comedy that slightly recalls the situations and pace of ""Mystery Date"". The story is very funny and the screenplay is unpredictable and full of action. There are many joke and witty lines, and all the characters are likable even the bad guys. Where they got that chicken is an unanswered question? I only regret that the director did not show a scene with Tracy's father seeing his Mercedez. This is the type of movie recommended for a Friday night after working along the whole week – the entertainment and laughs are guaranteed.

I do not get and do not think that I will ever get what makes this movie so funny. I will continue to be against them and will suggest that people do not go see them, but who will listen to me. I am one person with an opinion that will probably go against tons and tons of people that find humor in people acting dumb. And well that is not me.

","Someone told me not that long ago that the 2003 film Old School was the f****** bomb. And Todd Phillips' Old School is moderately a winner for IMDb users, I saw it and damn, I liked better the other two comedies of its director Todd Phillips that I had seen (Starsky & Hutch and School for Scoundrels) which, by the way, are usually paned by IMDb users (not to mention by professional critics, especially Phillip's 2006 remake of a British 1960 picture). Now, this year Phillips came with The Hangover, it had its US theatrical release a couple of months ago, on 5 June 2009 to be exact, and boy is it a winner for users and professional critics (plus a great money maker), for everything I had to see The Hangover, last Friday finally arrived to my city and boy did I laughed a couple of days ago, last Sunday to be exact, at the theater. <br/><br/>If you are one of those angry IMDb's top 250 buffs (I'm not a really big follower and I think the other times I have commented about the top 250 were when Nolan's Dark Knight reached the first position and when WALL*E had a place in the top 10) that are always like ""good film, but why is it part of the awesome top 250?"" or like ""why this film is not in the top?"" you may be wondering if this film deserves its place in the list of 250 best films for the users (right now it is the #191), I can say to those that who knows, who cares, The Hangover is a film that, in the way Old School didn't, lived up to all the praise and, like I already said, I really laughed with the time in Las Vegas of Phil (Bradley Cooper), Doug (Justin Bartha), Stu (Ed Helmskind of looks like McLovin) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis).<br/><br/>And as is tradition these folks went to Las Vegas for Doug's bachelor party, for us is not really a problem the fact that we went to Las Vegas with our main characters and basically missed the party time, certainly not a problem since for us there's fun before and after the crazy party time but for our main characters (I add, Doug will get married with Alan's sister Tracy, played by Sasha Barrese, and Doug's best friends are Stu and Phil) is a problem but no they didn't went to Las Vegas and missed completely of the crazy fun time, actually and mostly just apparently they had a really f****** crazy night and that ""apparently"" is actually the big problem since our characters simply do not remember a single thing the morning after the big Vegas night, not to mention that Doug ain't around. Of course the guy who may be not be as funny as the others (Bartha) is nowhere to be seen almost the entire film, it's a hangover only with the funny guys and certainly not the usual hangover. They, Stu, Phil and Alan, wake up not remembering a thing and just wondering why a tiger and a baby are in their suite and stuff, it's all a mystery, they must find Doug but pretty much every time there's a little peace after putting some pieces together a damn big crazy thing comes to make more f****** unbelievable their secret Vegas anecdote (sure they met Mike Tyson, and his tiger, but) and certainly more f****** funny! Heather Graham, Ken Jeong, Mike Tyson, Mike Epps, hell even when Bartha, the may not be as funny as the other main guys, returns or better said is found he is really hilarious! Red Doug!"

"davideo-2","9","6","10","19 March 2010"," One of the more inspired and successful comedies of recent times
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>There's lots of places I'd like to visit in America, with it's fifty one states and stapling as the most powerful country in the world. But Las Vegas, to be honest, has always stood out as one I could quite comfortably avoid. The emphasis to me has always seemed to be on the casinos, and I've never gambled in my life (well, I've brought the odd lottery ticket.) But of course, there's also plenty of super hotels, nightclubs, world class shows...the place would seem to have something for everyone. But, from the sweeping over shots on the opening of The Hangover, my main problem with it now is that it all looks too over whelming to me, with bursting visual stimuli coming from every pore. ""Designed to inflame the senses"" as Ned Flanders well described it in an episode of The Simpsons. ""A place where it's against the law to be responsible"" as Piers Morgan more worryingly described it in a recent newspaper article for the Mail. Aya Napa and Ibiza are wild enough for me, but if you had the time and the money, just how out of control would things be if you had your stag night in Vegas? There's people in the world that could do that, and that's the high concept idea of this film.<br/><br/>How wild it gets is that the groom Doug (Justin Bertha) goes missing...that's without mentioning a trashed hotel room, a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the closet, a stolen cop car and the naked Chinese man (who turns out to be a camp Triad boss!) who jumps out the boot. Somehow smooth Phil (Bradley Cooper), charmless Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and meek Stu (Ed Helms) must make sense of it all while searching for their friend who's getting married in less than twenty four hours. It's such a simple but effective idea that probably works so well because of it's what if?...potential. Men together are laddish and egg each other on, and just how out of control could things be and just what would the consequences be? Of course a lot of the humour is facile and over the top, but it works well with the tone of the film in that's the mindset of the men involved and quite often the film is pant wettingly hilarious.<br/><br/>The director (who luckily has a string of well known credits behind him) has taken a cast of unknowns and produced a highly successful high concept comedy that's inspired and original and like the best of them nowadays, about as politically correct as a drunken Roy 'Chubby' Brown. As such, it's definitely one of the better comedies of recent times. ****"
"MetalAngel","9","6","10","25 August 2009"," The BEST comedy of the year!!!!
","Oh my god. I simply had to write this critique straight off the theaters. There is no way to exemplify how much fun and original this movie is without raving on and on about it all night (which would make me disclose a million spoilers, and you don't want me to do that).<br/><br/>It's about four friends, one of them is getting married in two days, and they decide to go to Las Vegas to have their bachelor party. Everything starts out all right, with the four dudes toasting atop the rooftop of their Vegas hotel to a wonderful unfolding night, and then we fast forward to the next morning, when three of them awake in their hotel bedroom (which is wrecked beyond repair and features a hilarious set of new additions) and they notice the groom is missing. What's worse, none remembers what happened the night before. And so begins their two-day adventure through Vegas trying to find their lost partner and, in the way, discovering the hysterically crazy things they did that night.<br/><br/>At first, it may seem like your typical bromedy, and you indulge in the movie's plot expecting to have a few laughs and later forget about it. But you get, oh, so much more. The character development is spot-on, the plot is seriously funny and (wow) believable even in its absurdity. The performances are very good, the directing is awesome. The film actually involves you, and it doesn't take itself too seriously and it doesn't try to be funny, unlike other comedies who seem to strain themselves to force laughter out of you. This is a truly special comedy, perhaps the best comedy I've seen all year.<br/><br/>The screenplay itself is worthy of its praise, and I wouldn't be amazed if it pulls a stunt at next year's Oscars receiving an Academy Award nod. Todd Phillips certainly rein-vindicated himself and his film earned a rightful spot among those which we'll remember for some time to come. Why, it's even better than ""Pineapple Express"" and ""I Love You, Man"", which I also consider to be excellent bromedies.<br/><br/>Whether you simply want to be entertained, or whether you want to experience a fun, modern comedy that's both hilarious and perfectly-made, you can't miss out on this one.<br/><br/>Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 4!!"
"SebaZava","9","6","10","23 August 2009"," One of the funniest movies I've seen in some time
","I had been expecting The Hangover to be released in theatres here in Peru for some time - the movie was ridiculously well-received in the States, and it eventually became one of the most unexpectedly popular movies of the year. Why it took so much time to arrive in Peru? God only knows - or maybe the ones who have the distribution rights too - but the fact of the matter is that, unlike other movies of its ilk, it has arrived in Peruvian theatres, much for the delight of local movie buffs and average Joes. And that's because being a sort-of ""Independent"" movie - yes, it was produced by a big studio, but it features no big name ""stars"" and it was made with a pretty limited budget - no one expected it to be as funny as other comedies featuring more recognizable actors and inflated budgets. But it is. The Hangover is decidedly hilarious - the funniest motion picture I've seen in the last three years or so, actually.<br/><br/>When I say The Hangover is the funniest movie I've seen in recent years, I really mean it. The whole point of the movie is to watch these guys trying to remember what happened during their night of craziness, looking for clues everywhere they can, interrogating people who seem to have partied or done stuff with them, although they can't remember being with them. This leads to a whole lot of ridiculous and over-the-top situations, which include -but are not limited to - realizing that they got involved with some sort of crazy, gay Asian gangster, that the tiger they stole - yes, stole - belonged to Mike Tyson, or that Phil spend a portion of the night in the hospital. The movie doesn't provide with anything particularly outrageous - there's plenty of bodily fluids and profanity, although nothing that hasn't been seen before - but it is nevertheless hilarious because it knows how to exploit its funniest bits without tiring the viewer.<br/><br/>None of the principal actors are particularly well-known, but they nevertheless seem to belong in this movie, playing these parts. Bradley Cooper is great as Phil, portraying him as a sort of asshole who, despite being what he is, can be likable from time to time. Ed Helms plays the out-of-place nerd who discovers that he can be pretty wild and crazy if he wants to - or if he has consumed enough alcohol - and does it marvelously. The weirdest - and by far funniest - characters is Alan, who as portrayed by Zach Galifianakis is definitely the most memorable character in the film. His strange personality can lead to some awkward situations - take the ""blood brothers"" oath for example -, but also to some of the most hysterical situations I've seen in any comedy. The Hangover ears its R rating by having some profanity and showing a couple of bare, male buttocks - you know, male nudity always seem to cause viewers to laugh - but it isn't as shocking as other films of its ilk. It doesn't need to be. It only needs to be funny, and it accomplishes this goal beautifully.<br/><br/>I really wanted to see The Hangover, and now that I have done so, I can't say I was disappointed. Considering so many Hollywood comedies nowadays fail to make me laugh simply because they are too stupid or too derivative, it's refreshing to watch a raunchy comedy that's actually funny. It also helps that its main characters, despite not being particularly three-dimensional or realistic, are charismatic enough for the audience to care for them. The movie laughs with these guys, not at them, most of the time, and that's why, despite having a couple of stupid parts, it never really feels overly dumb. What can I say? With some solid performances, hilarious gags and jokes and very original premise - I really wonder why a ""hangover"" movie hadn't been done before, at least as effectively as this one -, The Hangover is an stupendous comedy. It will hardly offend anyone, and it should make most audiences cry with laughter."

I went in blindly. Then WAM, this was F-U-N-N-Y, funny stuff, if you didn't laugh, that's sad, maybe time to lighten up. For me these were original and fresh gags! And I'm no fan of R-Rated sexist slap stick usually filled with mindless moronic nonsense, but this movie is the bomb! It is definitely a man's movie though.<br/><br/>The writers are fantastic comedians with the utmost timing, the acting is superb. Who are these dudes?!

Heather Graham is hot as always. I'm sorry of Jeffrey Tambor, because he is the man, he is the funniest grandfather ever, but he is in this movie for couple of minutes. But he rules.

This is a ""laugh out loud every couple minutes"" movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The narrative is excellent, making you wonder what the hell they did the night before and having you guess with the characters as to their actions (A favorite moment is when the chicken is walking around the room. All I could think while laughing was, ""What the hell did they do with that chicken?""). At the end of most of the scenes there's also a fun surprise twist; something you didn't expect to see, and makes you laugh at the same time.</li></ul><br/><br/>NEGATIVES - I'm really just nitpicking here, because the movie was really good. However, I didn't care for some of the shock humor. Shock humor is something like showing an old man's ass during a prostate exam (which they do in this movie). It wasn't used often, but it was irritating when they did it.<br/><br/><ul><li>Rob Wriggle and the lady playing the other police officer are very over-the-top, and don't really feel like real characters.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Some story threads remain unresolved at the end. I would've liked to see what happened when the Uncle saw the car on the return, and I would've liked some closure on other story threads, but it didn't really impact my enjoyment of the film.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Some of Zach Galifianakis' lines seemed forced, but even the forced lines are kind of funny, so I didn't mind that much.</li></ul><br/><br/>OVERALL - The film is ridiculously funny, and if you watch it with a few friends who aren't easily offended, you will probably have a good time.<br/><br/>8/10 - Some flaws, but not enough to take away from the enjoyment of the film."

With days before his wedding Doug (Justin Burtha AKA: Riley off National Treasure) takes his friends Phil (Bradley Cooper – He's Just Not that into you), Stu (The Daily Show's Ed Helms) and Doug's Joaquin Phoenix look alike brother Allan (Zach Galifianakis) out on a road trip to Vegas for a night they'll never forget. The next morning Phil, Stu, and Alan wake up hungover with a tiger along with a baby in hiding their hotel room, and Doug missing. With only a day left to find him, the men set out on a city wide search using CSI tactics, but the question is can they find him in time for the wedding? The Hangover is a hangover you won't forget anytime soon. It takes what could have been just your average R rated raunchfest and turn it into something that's fun, classy, and utterly outrageous (thanks to the hilarious and likable chemistry between the cast.) At moments you'll feel that the comedy is forced, and some of the crudeness felt unneeded but at the end you'll realize you've had such a fun time you won't even remember its flaws. This is sure to be an instant classic and is by far the best comedy of 2009, but it's made for a certain audience in mind so if Sex Jokes, Profanity, or partial nudity isn't for you then, you might want to sit this one out. For those that don't care about that, if you're looking for a comedy loaded with fun, heart and cameos (Mike Tyson being the most obvious one) then grab $10 sneak in a bottle of vodka, bring your friends and let this be a hangover you won't forget."

","First off, we were a bit reluctant to see this movie after reading its plot summary but the rating (8.4 at the time) and all the positive user comments made us give this movie a chance.<br/><br/>Needless to say, we regret doing so.<br/><br/>Perhaps it is a mistake. Perhaps this movie should have been given 4.8 instead of 8.4 and even this would be too generous, in my opinion. The movie is not only a cliché of Hollywood bachelor's night 'what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas' type of films, but 99.9% of the jokes were either tasteless or completely predictable. The actors did not even do a remotely good job and the screenplay writers did absolutely nothing to help them along the way.<br/><br/>I still want someone to explain to me what was so different about this movie.."
"The_Other_Snowman","1","13","27","16 August 2010"," How to Make a Movie like ""The Hangover""
","A few helpful suggestions for how to make a movie as successful as ""The Hangover"":<br/><br/>1) Don't make your characters likable. Instead, make them annoying, selfish, and petty.<br/><br/>2) Don't be afraid to indulge in a little sexism. ""The Hangover"" is a movie for the guys, and many guys secretly harbor low opinions of the women they date, marry, or otherwise know. Provide some female characters who can confirm these opinions: an annoying harridan of a fiancée, a stripper, etc.<br/><br/>3) Don't be afraid of a little racism either. If all your stars are white, you can expect your audience to be white, so it's okay to show off some stereotypes of Asians and Latinos in your film.<br/><br/>4) Don't make it funny! This is the most important one. Rather than clever jokes or memorable slapstick routines, provide your viewers with painful gags, obvious one-liners, and grating sarcasm, while generally soaking your film with a feeling of negativity. Abuse your characters, actors, and audience as much as possible. You will only hurt them because you love them so much."

","***MINOR SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Why can't America produce decent comedy any more?<br/><br/>I mean seriously. This is the country that gave us the Blues Brothers, Dr. Strangelove, Some Like It Hot, Airplane and even Blazing Saddles. Why can't it be done today?<br/><br/>The Hangover is a prime example of missed timing and poor delivery, the worst offender by far being Zach Galifianakis, playing the part of the oddball Alan.<br/><br/>Now the guys I saw this film with tell me they loved it which goes to show how subjective humour is, but to me Zach really didn't seem to give a damn on the set. His performance is flat, he really seems to have no sense of comedic timing and manages to utterly flatten almost every scene he is unwise enough to open his mouth in. However, in the spirit of fairness I'll note that his character exists for only two reasons:<br/><br/>1) To play as the dork come good / Rain Man savant at a crucial but blatantly telegraphed point, and<br/><br/>2) To be the odd-man-outsider and obligatory gross-out character<br/><br/>In the first of these he succeeds well enough - it's not exactly a revelation in the plot when it happens and Heather Graham steals the scene with a knowing piece of over-acting. In the second role... oh dear gods no. Just... no.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast, well they struggle gamely with insipid characters, flat direction and sub-Dude Where's My Car scripting.<br/><br/>The film plays essentially as a series of loosely connected sketches. Some hit, some miss but none ever reaches a real crescendo, it all feels hackneyed and, well, unoriginal.<br/><br/>In summary, it isn't a terrible film, but it isn't good either. It's just dull and that is a real failing in a comedy.<br/><br/>Worth having on if you're with mates and drunk. I can't recommend it otherwise. Oh and there is a sequel in development. I can't express my enthusiasm. Really."

","I didn't plan on seeing the movie in theaters but after everybody telling me the movie was the funniest movie they had seen in years and even IMDb having it in the top 250 I thought I would give a try.<br/><br/>I saw the trailer for the Hangover months ago and my immediate impression was not full of high expectations. Everybody who has been completely hammered before knows that even on their worst night of drinking you usually don't wake up with a baby in the closet and a tiger in the bathroom. The comedy just seemed a bit far stretched and forced.<br/><br/>I did laugh pretty hard for the first 10 minutes but after the beginning the humor dwindled. Halfway through the movie my friend leaned over and commented on how ridiculous the storyline was and I couldn't agree more. <br/><br/>The annoying thing about the movie was that the humor was not intelligent (except for Zack Galifianakis). If your a fan of Zack G. then you know his stand-up is brilliant and hilarious but the movie as a whole will let you down. Though i will say Zach G. made the movie worth watching. <br/><br/>I was hoping to see a movie that topped Wedding Crashers or Pineapple Express but the movie didn't even come close. The movie was not horrible but top 250 come on!? thats insulting. <br/><br/>If your a big fan of intelligent comedies I wouldn't waste your time at the theater and wait for it to come out on DVD. This movie is a classic case of mainstream comedy that will top the box offices but just doesn't deliver."
"fornello","2","5","8","6 April 2013"," So bad it made me angry
","I signed up for IMDb just so I could review this piece of bland garbage. There is no character development. No dramatic tension... everybody is nearly the same character. The ""oh man what happened last night?"" thing gets old after about three minutes. Cheap unbelievable situations they got themselves into, predictable jokes, and cruel, unlikely gags (the kids tasering the prisoner). Look I married a stripper and she treats me like she knows me so well! How is this even possible? Most of the crazy things that happened did not seem believable, the movie simply came up with the same tired clichés and put them together and expected the audience to swoon. Oh and the wussy guy finally tells off his nagging woman at the end of the movie... big deal, we saw that coming. Overall it was a ham-fisted attempt to re-do the ""we got drunk and did crazy things"" movie."
"mysteriesfan","2","5","8","16 April 2011"," A slick, empty downer
","I was looking forward to this movie, based on some enthusiastic word of mouth from a couple of acquaintances. As I stared at the screen with my expression becoming blank, then black, and without ever laughing out loud, all I could think of was that some movies make you look differently at the people who recommend them. ""The Hangover"" is a base, empty mess, wrapped in some slick packaging and hype.<br/><br/>I know the party line, from some, but certainly not other, reviews: the movie is a wild, gross-out fun ride that goes down smooth. Quirky buddies try to reconstruct a wild bachelor party night in Las Vegas after they black out and wake up the next day in their trashed hotel suite, with their friend the groom missing. They are a supposedly likable bunch of a weird-acting stoner slob, a dorky dentist with a domineering, unfaithful long-time girlfriend, an irresponsible, self-centered hunk, and a dour boy scout. In their adventures, they encounter colorful characters, like smart-mouth cops, a sleazy owner of a quickie wedding chapel, and Mike Tyson (magically rich, no longer bankrupt, with some canned eccentricities added).<br/><br/>The problem is that the movie does nothing but string together a series of gags -- either crude or violent or both -- that grow more and more depressing the clearer it becomes that everything about the movie is shallow, phony, and cliché. The missing night reconstructed over the course of the movie, with any remaining graphic details gratuitously laid on thick over the end credits, is strikingly unimaginative. (Drunken time with hookers; the drunk, hen-pecked dork marries a single-mom hooker with a heart of gold and then falls for her for real; the awkward slob as genius at cards; the groom swearing renewed, undying devotion to his fiancé; trashing fancy and cop cars; stuck-up, rich parents of the bride, totally wasting Jeffrey Tambor.) As to the mattress tossed from high up down on top of the hotel statue, it is an embarrassing plot contrivance, conveniently to delay finding the groom, that no one investigates until the last minute the source of the damage (including the police or hotel staff, who would know better than anyone that it was a hotel mattress, that none of the hotel windows open, and that hotel cameras would have picked it all up). The rush back to L.A. and happy endings are pat, forced, and uninteresting.<br/><br/>Like a self-indulgent child, the movie wants to have it both ways -- the buddies are supposed to be relatable, down-to-earth guys, yet somehow manage to reserve a $4500/night luxury Vegas ""villa,"" come up with fancy clothes at will, and all have hot-looking girlfriends, wives, fiancés, or families. The movie goes for cheap laughs early on by having the slob say he has to stay away by law from schools and parks, yet later treats his carrying around a baby, even making lewd gestures with its hand, as all part of the fun. The same tendency is true of the film's use throughout of what it calls this ""fat man"" as a pratfalling, publicly urinating punching bag; turning him into an instant genius at cards; his casual talk about using the drug ecstasy; and the film's use of slurs to describe the dorky dentist. The hunk, portrayed as a jerk and not in the least believable as a ""school teacher,"" suddenly becomes a devoted family man at the end, hanging all over his wife and son and later even carrying his sleeping son over his shoulder while he leers at cell phone pictures taken by one of his buddies of nude women they made out with in Vegas, as well as of the dentist's bloody, stupidly smiling face after drunkenly pulling out one of his front teeth that night on a dare. The movie does not even manage to convey any genuine sense of joy to the adventures, even as it seems to glorify them, including lots of senseless destruction (like trashing hotel rooms and cars, someone getting shot, an effeminate, foul-mouthed Asian beating people with a tire-iron, the tooth-pulling, etc.).<br/><br/>Add to this these points recently made by a print reviewer about the movie: ""I didn't think 'The Hangover' was all that funny. It was too choppy, too mean-spirited and too much of an ensemble that didn't fit together as well as it should have."" (As to the embarrassingly uncritical pass Roger Ebert gave this movie, like so many others, it only reminds me why I always liked Gene Siskel so much better.) Why sweat any of this? It's about drunken partying, right? Identify with it. Go with the flow. It's not about making sense or taking anything seriously. If that works for you, fine. Maybe this is one of those movies where someone likes almost everything or almost nothing. All a reviewer can do is explain why s/he feels one way or the other. For the reasons discussed, what is bad or weak about the movie so overwhelms anything good about it that the above excuses come across to this reviewer as just a convenient, lame cop-out. A cop-out here for failing to entertain in any meaningful sense of the word and in the process not merely disappointing, but spoiling the time of, plenty of people who were looking forward to a good time at the movies."
"kenjha","7","5","8","9 April 2010"," Mildly Amusing
","For his bachelor party, a man goes to Vegas with his buddies. Hilarity ensues...sort of. The film tries very hard to to be funny but fails to deliver many laughs. It is entertaining and provides enough amusement to keep it from dragging. The script consists of a series of vignettes that don't all come together the way they do in the best comedies. The sophistication level of the comedy is pretty low, a step above ""The Three Stooges,"" and there is a sense of deja-vu to it all. There is a Vegas segment in the 1999 comedy ""Go"" that is more amusing that anything here. The main source of laughs here is the doofus brother-in-law played by Galifianakis."

","Wow, what a movie! The Hangover was a brilliant portration of 4 best friends who go to Las Vegas for the Groom: Doug Billings (played by: Justin Bartha), bachelor party 2 nights away from his big wedding day. When they get to Las Vegas they get drugged and drunked on that night and the next day completely forgot what happened the night before! And whats more, The Grooms missing! In addition to that there is a tiger in the hotel room, a baby in the closet, a Chinese man in the trunk of the car and the list goes on... Then the 4 friends who now are 3 go on a frantic chase to find their best mate who is supposed to get married the next day! The adventure is just beginning as they get up to very mischievous activities... <br/><br/>The concept was simple, but it was the characters that made it for me: Phil Wenneck (played by Bradley Cooper): A school teacher who likes to be authorative and demeaning of everyone, but has a soft side and at times can be sensitive, and most of all he likes to have fun! Stu Price (played by Ed Helms): The Dentist nerd who is on the verge of proposing to his aggressive and ""mean"" girlfriend.<br/><br/>Alan Garner (played by Zach Galifianakis): The dimwitted brother-in-law of the groom. Has no common sense but has a big heart and loves all his friends.<br/><br/>And Finally....<br/><br/>Doug Billings (played by Justin Bartha): The nice hearted husband to be, who everyone loves and gets along with, however he goes missing after the boys' infamous night in vegas.<br/><br/>All these characters created such a brilliant mastermind comedy, the actors played them to perfection and no one ""overdid"" their character. Also credit has to go to the director: Tod Phillips who in my opinion is the best director of comedy there is. And lets not forget the brilliant screenwriters who made up this amazingly funny film: Jon Lucas and Scott Moore. The cinematography was beautiful as it captivated the hustle and bustle of the fantastic Las Vegas City.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was comedic genius, and the best part of the movie is the ending which explains everything that had put a question mark in your mind prior to the ending.<br/><br/>A MUST SEE FILM! BRING IT ON THE HANGOVER 2!"

","This movie was brilliant on so many different levels. It had humorous moments from almost every character which tends to be rare in most comedies. There always tends to be one person that carries everyone else. Though Zach (Alan) was the most funny of the characters, he did not carry the whole movie. It was funny all around and I was very glad to see a good comedy this summer, seeing as how Land of the Lost was somewhat lacking. The Hangover had so many different things going on that it is a movie worth watching more than once. I, personally, went to see this film twice and I will for sure be purchasing it when it comes to DVD. This is a definite must-see movie of the summer!"

Give credit to the writers first and foremost, because this was LOL funny from start to finish and the storyline and dialog kept the comedy pace going throughout. There weren't any slow spots.<br/><br/>The acting was pitch perfect, from the main characters to those with secondary roles, including brief cameo appearances. Zach Galifianakis, in a breakthrough role, was great as the goofy brother-in-law to be, Ed Helms was outstanding as the Dentist buddy, Brad Cooper also great as the hipster friend, brief appearances by Rob Riggle as the cop, Matt Walsh as the Doctor at the Hospital, Jeff Tambor as the father-in-law, Mike Tyson as himself, and the Wedding Singer (Dan Finnerty) in one of the funniest bits in the movie (he sings 50 Cent's ""Candyshop""), and numerous others actors, really contributed to the film.<br/><br/>The film also finished strong, with a great ending that tied everything up nicely, with the closing minutes the high point of the film.<br/><br/>A great movie, an instant classic I would add. Can't wait for the DVD to come out."

"harry2quinn","10","5","8","6 June 2009"," The greatest thing to happen since Wedding Crashers
","Yes, it's that good. I just got out of the theater, and instantly felt the need to write a gushing review for this movie.<br/><br/>The premise, free of any major spoilers, is that four friends go to Vegas on a bachelor party, black out and lose the groom. Now this could have gone wrong in production, since a simple recounting of the crazy events would have made a funny but very ordinary movie. Instead, the movie focuses on the morning after, and laugh after laugh results from seeing crazy sh*t that transpired in the last 14 or so hours: including a tiger, Mike Tyson and a naked, angry Asian mobster (whose voice was stereotypically a bit reminiscent of Kim Jong Il from Team America).<br/><br/>It's the characters that really make this movie. The groom doesn't really play that big a role; the future brother-in-law, Alan, and the two best friends, Stuart and Phil are hilarious. Alan is a weird and inappropriate guy that never fails to shock and produce hilarity, with memorable comments like 'Classic!', 'I find your language offensive' and the wolf pack speech. Phil is a bit more of a cliché, but he fills the void of the necessary 'cool guy' of the group, who likes having a crazy time. Stuart is a neurotic kind-of-dork-but-not-really, someone you sympathize with because he's totally whipped.<br/><br/>In conclusion - I think this movie is a must see for anyone that enjoys this kind of humor. There are no fart jokes for the lowest common denominator, but there is an overload of genuinely witty banter and plot twists. There are no clichéd epiphanies or moralization. It's about a good time, perhaps too good a time, that went wrong, that'll make you want to hop in your car and drive to Vegas. This movie really took a trite topic - the bachelor party - and turned it into a great plot, great characters, hilarious lines and a satisfying ending.<br/><br/>Definitely a 10."
"Cocacolaguy912-2","10","5","8","7 June 2009"," One of the most consistently funny movies in a long time.
","""The Hangover"" is what a comedy should be without being a bad movie. All the ingredients of a good movie in general exist here and the film is just so, so funny...and funny consistently. There aren't huge laughs followed by gaps of plot explanation or catch up or whatever. The plot is essentially the comedy driven ingeniously by the actors. There are almost no spots in the movie where you aren't laughing...and if and when you aren't laughing you are only listening closely and anticipating the next laugh and you never worry if the bulk of the comedy is over. It is nice to see a comedy that doesn't need Judd Apatow and company to make it a good one. The Hangover leaves the sophistication at the studio and just brings laughs - some crude, some stupid, some witty, some dark, some insulting - but all worth seeing this hilarious comedy."

","This is definitely one of the best comedies I've seen in quite some time.

The hi-jinks ensue the morning of the hangover as they are left wondering what happened and how it happened.<br/><br/>Each of our main four actors adds their own brand of humor to the movie, but I thought Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis stood out and made the movie especially funny.<br/><br/>I'd definitely suggest one checks this movie out on video, if not in the theaters.

"Hey_Sweden","7","3","4","12 April 2012"," Has its moments.
","To be honest, after the way this movie has been built up, I couldn't help but feel some disappointment as it wasn't as flat out, falling down funny as I was hoping for. That's not to say that there aren't very lively moments, and some genuine laughs to be had, but this isn't really that great. Still, its tremendous success is impossible to deny; obviously it was a crowd pleaser. What it does benefit from is a set of enthusiastic performances by its star trio: Bradley Cooper as Phil, Ed Helms as Stu, and Zach Galifianakis as Alan, as three guys helping the about-to-be-married Doug (Justin Bartha) have the last great wild time of his life in Las Vegas. Unfortunately, what happens is, on the day after, they have no memory of the Hell they raised. All they've got are the end results: a tiger in the bathroom, an adorable infant on the premises, a hotel room in ruins, a missing tooth, Stu's apparent marriage to a stripper named Jade (Heather Graham, looking as foxy as ever), a stolen police car...and, most importantly, the disappearance of the groom. So they're obliged to solve the whole mystery of the night before, with often wacky results. Just to give you an idea, boxing icon Mike Tyson, playing himself, turns up, showing his appreciation for Phil Collins's ""In the Air Tonight"". Some sequences work better than others - among other things, the three guys find themselves roped into participating in a tasing demonstration, and are pursued by a vengeful character named Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong). Todd Phillips, who gave us such other comedies as ""Road Trip"" and ""Old School"", is director of these nutty shenanigans, and the gags keep coming right through the end credits, as we finally get to see, through snapshots, bits and pieces of the kinds of things that the guys got up to. Overall, this is certainly lively stuff, with enough chuckles to make for fine viewing, and making the city of Las Vegas a character in its own right, but for this viewer couldn't quite measure up to its reputation. Seven out of 10."

","A Las Vegas-set comedy centered around three groomsmen who lose their about-to-be-wed buddy during their drunken misadventures, then must retrace their steps in order to find him.<br/><br/>Nowadays, as you should all know, comedies (and horror, specifically) have had clichéd attempts at creating something funny (or scary.) As do these all fail, the man who brought us Road Trip and Old School makes possibly one of the best comedies of the decade. The premise is simplistic and clever. You'll feel as if your joined along with the gang and their misadventures through Vegas. The humor is top notch and each character has their own personal comedic aspects. My favorite was personally Zach Galifianakis, who has made a new debut in the film industry. Seeing how much these guys messed up and how they react to their mistakes, it all turns out to be the funniest things ever. The twist (Alan actually drugging the wolf pack) was kind of stupid, but it worked and I see of no other twist they could've planned. The acting was good and funny, and I'm so glad how the gang wasn't those famous actors like Johnny Depp or Leonardo DiCaprio. This meaning I loved how they chose some underrated actors and made them shine through, similar to Horrible Bosses. This controversial, hilarious, gritty, humorous-filled trip will have you hungry for more of the wolf pack. I highly enjoyed everything of the film, to the humor and to the simple, clever plot. If your into Todd Philips work, your more than likely to love the Hangover. If your into comedy, point black, your more than likely to love the Hangover. Even if your not the biggest fan of each, maybe the Hangover will take you by surprise with it's NO clichéd funniness.

","The movie talks about a bachelor party gone wrong when the groom goes missing in the middle of Las Vegas.<br/><br/>The characters are different and you can relate to each one. You have the responsible yet loose Doug, the adventurous Phil, the 'adult' Stu, and the sick-o Alan.<br/><br/>The movie has its moments, it's funny at times but gets a little lame when it's the same joke over and over again. The ending was kind of shocking since it was sudden and out of the blue the way they found Doug.<br/><br/>However, it was fun.

","When I sat down to watch this I wasn't sure what to expect; of the main cast the only actor whose name I recognised was Bradley Cooper and that was because I'd seen him in the TV show 'Alias' which is hardly a comedy. The idea of a group of men going out for a stag night in Las Vegas led me to expect a fairly puerile story about what they got up to there; and while the actual film was fairly silly it was also pretty funny and I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected.<br/><br/>Most of the story is told in flashback after one of the group telephones the bride to be to let her know that they have lost the groom; the rest of the film follows their adventures as they look for clues as to what happened on that fateful night. This adventure will include a tiger in their bathroom, a missing tooth, one of them marrying a stripper, stealing police car, finding a naked Chinese man in their car's boot and a meeting with Mike Tyson. If that sounds fairly madcap it is because it is rather! Several scenes caused me to chuckle and some were laugh out loud funny; the scene where they were children got to shoot the group with stun guns was hysterically funny!<br/><br/>The acting was decent, Bradley Cooper shows that he can do comedy as well as drama, Zach Galifianakis was funny as the less than intelligent Alan and Ed Helms was good as the hen-pecked dentist Stu. While some of the jokes missed the mark it was funny enough to be worth watching so long as you don't mind the adult tone of some of the jokes and a fair amount of swearing."

","One of the funniest comedies of the last years.<br/><br/>A group of friends get together to spend a weekend in Las Vegas at a bachelor party before the wedding of one of them.

I loved the last minutes of the movie in which a sliding photo presentation tells the viewer in images what really happened that night, putting everything into place and placing all the pieces of the jigsaw in their proper space.<br/><br/>The actors are all terrific, funny, charming and believable in their colorful and archetypal roles. However, are the script and the movie director the ones to be congratulated as it is thanks to them that the comedy is fresh, truly funny and engaging without falling into vulgarity. Moreover, and despite being a comedy full of men, this is not an Alfa-male comedy.

","As far as wedding movies go, ""The Hangover"" is a tad different from others in the genre. We are not asked to follow the antics of these grown up men getting in all kinds of mischief, while trying to celebrate the ritual of a bachelor party in Las Vegas. As a matter of fact, the film spare us of all that, as the creators take us to watch the effects of the night in question as three of the four friends have to face the consequences of their night on the town. The American male shows signs of wanting to remain children for as long as they can. <br/><br/>Phil, Stu, and Alan wanted to give their pal Doug a night he would not forget. Bringing him to Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas was a sort of adventure for these foursome. When Doug, the groom to be, disappears after a night on the town, the remaining trio decide to retrace their steps to find him. Obviously, they have no clue as to where to begin. Alan discovers there is a tiger in the bathroom, as well as a baby hidden in an unexpected place. Stu finds, to his horror, he is missing a front tooth.<br/><br/>As the friends try to put together the pieces about the disappearance of Doug, they get into more trouble, when a gang of thugs led by a gay Chinese man, begin to pressure them for eighty thousand dollars he claims Alan stole from him. Stu learns he got married at one of those ubiquitous chapels that dot Las Vegas. What's more, he has married a hooker, the mother of the child found in their suite. As for the tiger, it belongs to no other than Mike Tyson, a tough guy to deal with. Their erratic ways bring him to despair, but no Doug.<br/><br/>Todd Phillips directed this entertaining comedy with sure hand. The screenplay by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, is not the by-the-number kind, although fans of the genre will find similarities with other movies about weddings that are disastrous. For starters, the creators have kept from the audience everything related to what really happened on the night of the bachelor party. We only see shots of what they really did in snapshots as the credits roll.<br/><br/>Zach Galifianakis is turning into an impressive presence wherever he appears. We admired his work in the series ""Bored to Death"". He proves he is a funny man that does not mind 'baring' it all for a laugh. Bradley Cooper is the leader of the friends, but actually he is the straight man. Ed Helms, on the other hand, goes from the nerd type he is supposed to be into a new man, changed when he married the hooker. Rachael Harris, who plays Melissa, Stu's terrorizing lover, is an actress that has been around in small roles and really deserves to play more often. She excels as the henpecking Melissa, the woman that two-times Stu with the bartender of a cruise ship and who makes his life impossible. Jeffrey Tambor has only a small part."

These include schoolteacher Phil (Bradley Cooper), businessman Stu (Ed Helms) and Doug's soon-to-be brother-in-law Alan (Zach Galifianakis). Free-spirit Phil is trying to loosen everyone up, for Doug is less than adventurous, Stu is hogtied to his girlfriend from Hades, Melissa, who thinks they are going to Napa Valley for a wine tasting, and Alan is a chubby, consummate weirdo. The friends arrive at the hotel and go up on the roof for a toast. That's the last thing they remember, for in the morning, they wake up in a daze. A tiger is in their bathroom, a baby boy is in the kitchen, and Doug is missing. What happened in-between and why can't they remember? As they try to piece things together, while taking care of the little lad, they have encounters with the Korean mafia, Mike Tyson, a hooker who is sporting Stu's grandmother's ring, and more. Will they find Doug in time for him to make it to the ceremony? This film is very clever and very funny, sending most of the audience into a bellyache of laughter. However, it is definitely on the raunchy side, which some filmgoers will find offensive. You definitely don't want to mention in Sunday School class that you saw it. The cast is nice, with Cooper and Bartha quite fine as the two friends, and the lesser cast members are great, too. But, stealing the show, are Helms and Galifianakis, for they are funny beyond words and create very memorable characters in Stu and Alan, respectfully. The scenery in Vegas is glitzy while the costumes, camera work and other film amenities are very fine. Most importantly, great applause should be extended to the devilishly clever script and the rapid-fire direction. That does not mean, however, that drug use, excessing drinking, and other unsavory practices will seem ""funny"" to everyone.

","THE HANGOVER Director: Todd Phillips Country: USA Year: 2009 Language: English Runtime: 100 Minutes Rating: 16<br/><br/>I like my comedies brash and loud. I like to find my self choking on popcorn and shooting Coca-Cola through my nose. I like to laugh out loud and so DUMB & DUMBER (1994) is most definitely my kind of comedy.<br/><br/>Because of this I also loved the flood of films starring Frat-Packers Vince Vaughan, Ben Stiller and the Wilson's. I laughed my ass off at DODGEBALL (2004), WEDDING CRASHERS (2005) and OLD SCHOOL (2003) which was directed by Todd Phillips.<br/><br/>So I had high hopes for THE HANGOVER, the latest film from Phillips, a new comedy about a bachelor party that goes horribly wrong.<br/><br/>The basic premise is this: two days before his wedding, Doug and his three buddies drive to Vegas for a blow-out night they're hoping that they'll never forget but when the three groomsmen wake up the next morning with pounding headaches, they realise they've just spent a night they'll never remember! Their posh hotel suite is beyond thrashed with a wee baby in one room and, of all things, a tiger in another. But worse than that the groom is no where to be found.<br/><br/>With no clue as to what happened and little time to spare, the trio must attempt to retrace their steps and relive their bad decisions from the night before in order to figure out where things went so drastically wrong and, hopefully, get Doug back to LA in time for his wedding.<br/><br/>However, the more they begin to uncover the more they realise just how much trouble they're really in!<br/><br/>The film is already a monumental hit in the US, taking in more than $40 million in its opening weekend alone, more than double what was expected. The movie soared on extremely positive word of mouth that started, first as a trickle, from previews and then turned into a torrent as the audience who saw it on Friday and Saturday told their friends who flooded the cinema screens on the Sunday.<br/><br/>But is it any good? Hell, yes it is! When the three groomsmen awake they lurch from one hilarious situation to another. It's a wickedly smart film and manages to mix the very lowest of the low-brow comedy to wondrous effect. It's rude, raucous, raunchy and rib-tickling funny. The comedy is brilliantly written, the characters are wonderfully played and the situations, while contrived, are seldom less than hilarious. If you're a fan of the movies listed above then you'll love this!"
"MrPink08","10","4","6","11 June 2009"," A Comedy We All Desperately Needed
","In rough times like these, we need a good comedy to make us laugh and put a smile on our faces. The Hangover is that movie. Its a raunchy rowdy crazy good time, featuring everything from retro Mercedes to Mike Tyson. So far, it's easily the best film I've seen all year.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a trip to Las Vegas gone wrong, which sometimes works (Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas) and sometimes dosen't (What Happens In Vegas). Two best friends, the cool schoolteacher Phil (Bradley Cooper) and the nerdy dentist Stu (Ed Helms), along with the bride's brother Alan (Zach Galifianakis) wake up in their room in Caesar's Palace, with no recollection of what happened the night before, which they spent having a wild bachelor party for their friend Doug (Justin Bartha). Turns out, there's a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the closet, Stu's missing a tooth,and (for reasons unexplained) there's a chicken in the kitchen. And, oh yeah, Doug's nowhere to be found. The three race around Sin City searching for the groom, where more crazy stuff starts happening. When the valet brings their car, it's a police car. Stu is married to a stripper (Heather Graham, beautiful as ever). They apparently had a run in with a mean gangster (Ken Jeong). They went to Mike Tyson's house. The list goes on and on, each misadventure produces more hilarity than the last.<br/><br/>The cast is pretty much a poor man's Judd Apatow, without the cheap love story sandwiched in (yes, Knocked Up and The 40 Year Old Virgin were classics, but turned slowly into chick flick territory). Most of the guys you know you have seen, but just can't put a name to a face. Helms, best known as Rainn Wilson's rival on The Office, plays the role of Stu perfectly. He plays the delusional Stu with great humor, especially when he goes crazy on the others. As the closest thing to a lead, Cooper is the laid back guy who tries to keep everyone under control. Hopefully more lead roles are headed his way. Galifianakis plays the annoying Alan with perfect poise, that when he when he dosen't fret over the tiger when he first sees it, you just have to wonder why no one discovered him until now. Bartha's screen time is reduced, due to the fact he's missing for half the film, but he does his job well and manages to crack some good ones before he goes missing. There are some enjoyable cameos by Mike Epps, Tyson, and Jeffrey Tambor that will keep you laughing as well.<br/><br/>Overall, The Hangover is one of the funniest films I've ever seen, and, as I said earlier, the best I've seen all year. A sequel is already being written, but I'm not sure if I want it. But knowing these guys, if they could make a comedy about anything, I'd probably watch it."
"gradyharp","2","10","20","29 May 2010"," 'Where have all the good films gone - long time passing'
","THE HANGOVER apparently swept the country, touted as the funniest film ever made. And indeed the proof of its success lies in the fact that THE HANGOVER 2 is in post-production. So there is more on the way. The question arises, 'more what?' Apparently resting on the information gathered from television sitcoms and other raunchy potty mouth movies like 'Borat' etc., there is an audience for films that pose middle aged men as men in their 20s performing acts that are more like boys in their misbegotten teens. It is amazing that these films that put down African Americans (like the manipulation of Mike Tyson and the dumb drug dealer character 'Black Doug' portrayed by Mike Epps) and Asian Americans (like the foolish over-the-top fop of 'Mr Chow' by Jen Keong, etc etc etc are not confronted. But then it may appear that all is fair in cinema 'comedy'. <br/><br/>The premise is that four friends go to Las Vegas for a bachelor party before the wedding of the most mild of them all. Bradley Cooper (a teacher), Ed Helms (a dentist), Zach Galifianakis (the obese mentally disturbed brother of the bride) and Justin Bartha (the groom to be) spend one lost night of doped drunken misadventures and wake up in an hotel suite with a chicken, a tiger, a mess, hangovers and amnesia, and a missing groom. The remainder of the film is simple the antics of these broken down individuals attempting to find the groom and to right some infractions of behavior. Is that funny? Well, apparently to the vast number of people who see this film it is. So here comes the next installment in what will likely be a long line of gross-out sequels. Meanwhile the beautiful adult movies languish in oblivion. To this we've come? <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

They all float around 7 to 7 and a half. This comedy had nothing new about it. The only funny thing was when Alan sad he had plans for next weekend, cause The Jonas Brothers where in town.

Then again, maybe it's everybody else.<br/><br/>When I watched the Hangover, I was indefinitely expecting a hilarious movie, especially given how much my friends seemed to adore it. Well you know what? I left the theater wondering what all the fuss was about. By that I mean, I was wondering how such a crass, stupid, humorless piece of crap could garner so much attention. <br/><br/>The Good: <br/><br/>The concept is original and has potential. The movie features a Korean actor, the casting crew's way of keeping the movie relevant to those of oriental background.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>The Jokes - there doesn't really seem to be any. The movie relies predominately on ""zany scenarios"", mostly involving some form of gross out humor, brutal injury, and a verbal assault of out of place cursing. Seriously, since when is the death of a minister supposed to be funny? If that's the case, then the videos of 9-11 are downright hysterical.<br/><br/>The ""R-rated"" Content - The film contains a lot of attempts to shock its audience, which I guess the idiots interpret as funny... I don't know. This includes a foul mouthed Wedding Singer, making a baby look like it is masturbating, and a naked man jumping out of the trunk of a car and beating the protagonists. You just can't find quality writing like this anymore.<br/><br/>Pointless, Gratuitous Porny Shots - Movie has a fair amount of unnecessary nudity, including nipple shots, naked me; whether you care about this is really dependent on whether you've graduated High School yet. And to top off such a well crafted movie, we get a slideshow during the credits - basically an excuse to show softcore porn to the audience. Classy!<br/><br/>So as you can probably tell, I hate this movie, and that is all that she wrote I guess<br/><br/>1 out of 10"
"VernonDozier","1","9","19","23 May 2010"," Unfunny
","I realize comedy is subjective and it is hard to convince someone who's laughing that the gag he just guffawed over isn't really funny. So to be helpful to those debating whether to see it or not, I offer this. If you found the movie ""Sideways"" unfunny and overrated, you will probably find this one unfunny and overrated as well. Both feature the same inattention to the most essential ingredient in comedy: timing. Both feature mostly unlikeable characters. Both are basically boring.<br/><br/>Some here have criticized The Hangover as racist, sexist, or just gross. If done right, such politically incorrect ingredients don't prevent me from laughing, and sometimes they actually enhance a comedy if done right. But those ingredients are not funny just in and of themselves. The Hangover brought me one or two mild laughs. The rest was just gross or otherwise offensive without any imagination behind it. There are no ""I can't believe they just did that"" laughs here. The gags are stale and occasionally cruel, and the characters are unsympathetic. I'm stunned at the popularity of this garbage."

","I just watched the movie and can't see what people find as funny. The movie was crude, fine. I have no problems with crude humor, actually will roar in laughter at it. It just has to be funny. I kept waiting for the funny parts of this movie to happen. -----A guy using the toilet while a tiger keeps roaring to get his attention. Wait it is working, the guy keeps peeing while he turns to notice the tiger----- Yes that got a huge roar of laughter from the crowd. They meet up with a girl. The one guy unknowingly married her the night before. Okay the joke is coming. She says she is a dancer, then corrects herself and says she is actually a prostitute. That was the joke, hear the crowd roar. I kept waiting for her to do something funny, come on get crude I don't care, just make it funny!!! I don't know how much you can say on this site but the friends tell the guy his wife is the one who cheated on him. He said it was alright because the guy didn't for censorship reasons ""deposit DNA"" inside the woman. Yes, it was filthy, didn't offend me but didn't' make me laugh either.

","For the life of me, I do not know why this pathetic excuse for a film even made a million let alone becoming one of the biggest hits of the year. This is the first movie I have ever seen that I have walked out of, I left with a little less then a half hour to go. You don't have to eat a whole apple to know that its a rotten one, a good analogy for this pathetic film. It does not have anything resembling intelligence, humor or style. These three guys are so stupid and unlikeable that you don't give a damn about them or if they find their friend. That is the first rule for liking a film, you have to care about the characters. There was a friend who saw this film who said it was junk and told me to stay away from it and boy I wish I had listened. This movie is an insult to the intelligence of every intelligent moviegoer."
"qualityguyftl","1","7","14","25 January 2010"," This crap won a golden globe?
","The worst comedy I've seen in the last year. The talented cast is wasted (especially Heather Graham) on this unoriginal script filled with shallow stereotypes. Bradley Cooper struts through the movie as a completely unlikable good-looking jerk who has no problems cheating on his wife and ignoring his son while in Vegas. The other actors are mostly forgettable and poor Heather Graham is wasted in her cameo role. How this ever got nominated for a golden globe and how it won is obviously a bit of a back room bargain and payoff with Hollywood Foreign Press, because the film is not funny. I only laughed once during the whole thing and that was the tiger in the car scene. Its sad when Mike Tyson's tiger is funnier then the entire rest of the cast. I'm glad I did not waste 10.00 bucks seeing this at the show, this is a rental and no more. This makes Porky's and Weekend at Bernie's 2 look like The Godfather, don't waste your time."
"bob the moo","Null","7","14","24 November 2009"," Funny but not as hilarious as some would have you believe
","I got to The Hangover after everyone else had already seen it, told me how brilliant it was, told me their favourite ""bit"" and told me to get around to going to see it. Having been burnt many times before though, I did not let this praise make me have any grand expectations and I came to it just hoping that it would be funny. And it was. I had some good laughs and plenty of chuckles throughout the film – enough to enjoy it right through from the setup to the pictures over the end credits. Whether I would be able to enjoy it for a second viewing though I'm not so sure.<br/><br/>The reason for this is that many of the laughs came from the sudden nature of the comedy – whether it be a sudden physical act or the unexpected nature of a line. It is a slightly childish type of comedy with lots of people getting hurt in funny ways and this only has so much of an appeal to me. Like the Oriental gambler says, ""it's funny because he's fat"" and that does rather sum up why some of the film is funny. This is not to take away from some of the very funny lines and scenarios that the film comes up with, but I still did think that the majority of my laughs would be dissipated if I had known what was coming (as I would with a second viewing). The flow of the story works a little bit against it as well. In some regards it has a good ""mystery"" structure to it but then again the central concept means that in too many scenes we have to listen to a character explain that they have no memory etc etc. Fortunately it is mostly funny enough to cover up this clunky repeated problem.<br/><br/>The cast really help the comedy by their delivery. Although he is not really that well known in the UK (The Office US not being a big show here) Helms was the standout for me. In a character with elements of his Andy in there, I found him very funny and with a great sense of timing. Galifianakis is pretty good as well, although he has a simpler character in many ways. Cooper is not quite as good with the comedy but he is a good presence in the film and plays off the others (particularly Helms) well. The various comic characters in support include mostly funny turns from Graham, Jeong, Riggle and of course Mike Tyson.<br/><br/>In summary, The Hangover will be loved by the majority of the target audience but is fast-paced and funny enough to please the casual viewer. It may not stand up to repeat viewings due to the nature of some of the laughs but it good fun without too much reliance on crudity or basic pratfalls."
"tboothone","9","7","14","23 August 2009"," Sometimes everything is done RIGHT in a movie!
","Simply put, The Hangover gets everything right. First, the movie is hilarious. Second, the direction, script, and comedic timing are spot on. This is one of those movies that guys in their 30's and 40's can relate to very easily. So many of us have either been in or known friends who've been in situations like this only to relive these experiences later in life as our ""You won't believe it story"". As someone who rarely takes time to comment on films, I have to say ""what a great job!"" to the director and all the other cast and crew for really getting all the elements to come together so well. From the choice of actors to the cinematography, editing and score, this film made me laugh over and over again, while appreciating how well all the talented folks who worked on this movie did such an outstanding job. I can't remember when I've gone to see a movie more than once, and I've seen this one 5 times! This is extremely rare for me. Don't wait for the DVD go see it now, but I will buy the DVD. I can't wait to see the deleted scenes and extras like director commentary on this. Thank you for making a classic!!!!!"

God, a lot of movie critics even rate it highly! In the first half hour it's not funny once, not even a little bit funny. Makes u wonder about yr fellow man. Ben Elton is funny. John Cleese is funny as Basil Fawlty. Benny Hill. Robin Williams even. These guys are just horrible. Okay I have to say more. Need ten lines. Well it is not a movie one would bother critiquing. One movie critic said it was funny line by line. I guess line by line you could have different responses, u could grimace one line, groan the next, look puzzled maybe, perhaps at the least worst lines yr grimace might segue into a bitter smile, the sort of look Clint Eastwood might have when looking at a massacre.

The only good performance was that of Ed Helms but even his acting ability couldn't save the script that could have been so much better based on a half decent idea.

"zabagabe-2","2","12","28","30 June 2009"," *Much* more painful than having a hangover
","Like our intrepid protagonists, I think somebody drugged me before seeing the Hangover. This is the only possible explanation for why I found this movie so terrible while critics and audiences alike seem to rave about it. There were maybe two funny jokes in the entire movie. In between the offensive portrayals of minorities, women, and gays, the screenwriters managed to fulfill every 12-year-old boy's supposed fantasies: heart-of-gold strippers, hijinks with a tiger, a painfully unfunny Mike Tyson cameo, and the egregious use of tasers, among other overused tropes (Tyson aside). I'm guessing the director thinks that because the audience has in the past enjoyed scenes with tasers, the mere use of them in the movie instantly makes them funny. Not so.<br/><br/>What this movie lacked was everything that a successful film possesses: likable (or at least sympathetic) characters, some semblance of a realistic (or at least internally consistent) plot line, and an ending that satisfies (or at least relieves) the audience's journey. Instead, we get four unsympathetic, idiotic, unfunny characters. The conceit of piecing together a drunken wild night out could be funny - could be - but none of the jokes are funny."
"Kalle_it","1","8","17","10 December 2011"," Awful beyond words
","I'm astonished by the high ratings and the positive feedback this movie has been getting. The characters are unlikeable, childish and brash while still remaining painfully uninteresting and generic. Their drunken adventures are so over the top you can't help but shaking your head and wonder what the writers and the producers were on when they green-lighted such a mess of a movie. I mean, we expect outlandish adventures from four drunken guys in Vegas, but what they go through in the movie is so ridiculous it requires an insane amount of suspension of disbelief to vaguely buy into the possibility of such events happening.<br/><br/>Or are we supposed to believe you can pretty much thrash a very expensive suite at the Ceasar's Palace without getting caught? Nobody asked questions about the bed on the roof? And since when can you sneak a freaking TIGER in and out of a luxury hotel without anyone noticing? Not to mention the stolen police car and the ludicrous taser scene.<br/><br/>But all those loopholes could have been forgiven had the movie been genuinely funny. Instead it was a predictable sequence of trite gags and jokes so old even your 9-years-old cousin has already heard them before. The only ""first"" in the movie is the cringeworthy baby-is-masturbating gag, repeated TWICE in case you missed it the first time or didn't find it offensive enough. Stay classy!<br/><br/>The characters have no redeeming qualities so there's no empathy and it's really hard to care about them finding the missing friend, making it back to the wedding or dying in the middle of the desert.<br/><br/>A special mention to Zach Galifianakis'es character: seriously, the moronic and awkward man-child isn't funny, it's just annoying. The fascination Hollywood has with such character is baffling, although probably it represents a fair portion of the core audience for unfunny and inane flicks like The Hangover.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if you're not into low-quality 4th grade toilet humour and/or into road trips involving adults with a mental age lower than their shoe size just avoid this movie.<br/><br/>Or use it as the measuring stick for your friends' skills in movie-recommending. If some of them speaks highly of The Hangover never follow his advice about another movie. Ever."

Two days before the wedding, the four men in the wedding party - Doug, Doug's two best buddies Phil Wenneck and Stu Price, and Tracy's brother Alan Garner - hop into Tracy's father's beloved Mercedes convertible for a 24-hour stag party to Las Vegas. Phil, a married high school teacher, has the same maturity level as his students when he's with his pals. Stu, a dentist, is worried about everything, especially what his controlling girlfriend Melissa thinks. And Alan seems to be unaware of what are considered the social graces of the western world. The morning after their arrival in Las Vegas, they awaken in their hotel suite each with the worst hangover. None remembers what happened in the past twelve or so hours. The suite is in shambles. And certain things are in the suite that shouldn't be, and certain things that should be in the suite are missing. Probably the most important in the latter category is Doug. As Phil, Stu and Alan try to find Doug using only what little pieces of information they have at hand, they go on a journey of discovery of how certain things got into the suite and what happened to the missing items. However they are on a race against time because of Doug's wedding... I really wanted to like this film,I really did.It was extremely talked about,the premise seemed great, it has Vegas as a background and it has Bradley Cooper in it who I really like since he was in Alias(2001).Unfortunately The Hangover was a huge disappointment to me.And don't get me wrong I enjoy a good comedy as much as the next guy but this film is a total and complete disaster.Nothing about it was clever or creative, most of the jokes were just loud,crude and very simple. Nothing even quaint or quirky.I might have smiled a couple of times but I didn't laugh once.

I enjoyed the storyline and some bits were quite amusing, but I merely grinned at it. How this gets 7.8, I'll never know, because the point of a comedy film is to make me laugh, but really the only thing that was keeping me watching was the fact that the storyline wasn't actually too bad.

The mere suggestion of masturbating a baby in front of your friends is not possible as humour, not under any circumstances is this ever ethical, moral or socially acceptable, there is nothing comical about these scenes, they only serve to fuel more baser minds and contribute to this disturbing problem by desensitising what little public awareness there is regarding sexual abuse of children, and clearly ignores the victims 'the actual adults' who were abused as children, how can these baby scenes sit legally and legitimately as comedy?<br/><br/>The film may have been the usual stereotypical formulation for it's target market were it minus the baby scenes, I switched it off and vomited..."

They have to retrace their steps to find the groom before the wedding the following day. That sounds like a routine ""Gross Out"" comedy, which in many ways it is. Most of the characters are straight out of clichés, the hen pecked nerd, the married guy who wants to cut loose for once and the groom who wants to have a good time but not overdo things so soon before the wedding. There are some very funny scenes and unexpected plot twists to keep your attention.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly for me the highlight of the performance of Zach Galifianakis as the brother-in-law to be. He is subtle and very funny as the unclichéd and downright weird Alan. He also gets the best conversation stopping one-liners.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this to a mainly male audience. The female characters aren't developed at all and are there only to move the plot along. An alternative title might be ""How the lads got away with acting the eejit in Vegas"".

This is probably the most unimportant and overrated comedy ever made. Don't believe any of the hype you may hear, because the 7.8 rating is far from accurate.<br/><br/>Now I enjoy stupid comedies and buddy flicks, but this movie fails on every single level. It's pretty obvious that they ripped off the plot of ""Dude, Where's My Car?"" (a good comedy) and replaced it with Vegas, proving that they can't even get the story right. Just because Mike Tyson is present, doesn't automatically make it funny. When a naked Asian guy jumps out of a car, that doesn't automatically make it funny either.

","Comedies must be the most critical type of film for me, 1 1/2 hours or so of story line with a few laughs here and there, does that make it a comedy? Action film with a few action scenes does not make it a action film, get my drift? But to be honest it was a good show, great characters, solid acting, and a whole lot of trouble us blokes seem to look and want in our lives. Was weird to see hamburger Mike Tyson in this, what do they say about a fool and his money? Any way a 7 out of 10 for me, would I pay money to see it at the cinema's?

","The Hangover, is about a bachelor party in Las Vegas for a couple of friends that ends up going totally wrong, resulting in the friends trying to remember what exactly happened the night before and retrace their steps to eventually get back home again in time for the one character's wedding. More problems and off the wall hilarity follows. It seems recently that a film like The Hangover could really be a hit, or a miss. It is an R rated comedy that is very crude and sometimes very silly and something like that could go either way with critics. We have all seen how well the R rated films of Judd Apatow have been received as well as films like Borat and Wedding Crashers. All of those films for the most part I enjoyed a lot and I will add The Hangover to the list of R rated adult comedies that actually work really well. The comedic performances, which I always find so important to a comedy, are right on target here with a few exceptional performances from some of the supporting cast and overall they make the film work. The film's script is like I mentioned, pretty off the wall and it really is a wild and crazy movie, but it makes for a very entertaining, hilarious and at times exciting ride that you just get fascinated by watching. You do not perhaps want to be one of the characters in this film, but watching them and as things keep getting worse and worse for them in totally unpredictable and bizarre ways it is very captivating and will sure to keep you entertained. Even if this genre of comedy is not your particular taste, I would find it hard for someone to be bored by this film because it is so faced paced and wild that we feel the characters and us in the audience have just entered a non stop roller coaster ride that will make us laugh, feel a bit nauseated at times and will certainly keep us alert and wanting more of the crazy ride we are on. That, I feel is an appropriate way to describe this movie. And even though a lot of the film is silly and a bit on the far fetched side, a lot of it is very creative and just to make an almost two hour film work so well as this one does, you have to acknowledge the talent that went behind it. The performances work, the script works and the fast paced direction all work and make this film not just an above average comedy, but instead a very good comedy that is one of the best of the past few years. It is very funny, entertaining and like I mentioned it will capture your interest and take you on a wild jolted ride till the film ends. I personally really enjoyed myself when I saw this film and this is a perfect example of an adult comedy done right that is pure entertainment, but done well, so we are not only entertained, but get a lot of laughter and enjoyment from watching it. One of the best comedies of the year so far and for fans of the above mentioned films, this is highly recommended for you as well."

","In the opening of ""The Hangover"", in the middle of the Mohave Desert, Bradley Cooper's haggard Phil calls Doug's fiancée Tracy (Sasha Barrese) to inform her that they have ""lost"" Doug (Justin Bartha). Distressed Tracy reminds Phil that they are getting married in 5 hours. Phil replies, ""Yeah that's not going to happen."" Director Todd Phillips's ""The Hangover"" is the funniest movie of the year. And the story by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore is brilliantly hysterical.<br/><br/>The premise is outrageous. In a Las Vegas bachelor party completely gone awry, a group of buddies wake up the next morning to discover their Caesar's Palace suite demolished, with a tiger in the bathroom, a baby, but missing the groom Doug (Bartha). Phil (Cooper) has sore ribs and a hospital wristband. Dentist Stu (funny Ed Helms from ""The Office"") is bloodied and missing a tooth. Tracy's brother Alan (wacked out Zach Galifanakis) is sans pants. All three have no clue what happened in the previous 10 hours, when they lost Doug. The last thing they basically remember is making a toast with Alan's Jaeger Meister. Phil, Stu, and Alan must pool their damaged resources and return Doug for his wedding back in Los Angeles.<br/><br/>The defining moment of ""The Hangover"" comes when the crew watches a surveillance video with Mike Tyson at his home. Mike asks, ""You guys stole a police car?"" Stu sheepishly cops to this. Mike high fives saying, ""Nice!"" Later after watching the entire debacle on tape, Phil apologizes to Tyson. Mike says, ""We do dumb sh**, when we're f***ed up."" That pretty much sums up Todd Phillips's ""The Hangover"". It is a hysterical ride, and ultimately all plausible. Make sure to stay through the credits of the movie. Bradley Cooper as ring leader Phil is going to be a star. He is tall, handsome, and has great comedic timing. Cooper also is the surprising solid one, who literally rolls with the punches. Ed Helms is the brilliantly unglued Stu, who is about marry his bitch girl friend Melissa (taut and scary Rachael Harris). Zach Galifianakis is initially warped creepy as Alan. He points out to Doug when they pick up teacher Phil that he can't be within 200 feet of a school or a Chuck E Cheese. Galifianakis effectively morphs into a lovable loner. Justin Bartha nails the straight man Doug. He is so comfortable being with funny, which is not easy.<br/><br/>While blitzed out his mind Stu marries big hearted stripper/ escort Jade (stunning and hysterical Heather Graham). Graham is amazing and beautifully lends ""The Hangover"" its deceptive charm. With all the high jinx including being attacked by a naked Chinese mobster Mr. Chow (funny Ken Jeong) wielding a crow bar or being stun-gunned by kids in the police station demonstration, ""The Hangover"" is all fun and never mean spirited. Writers Lucas and Moore craft a hilarious tale that is strangely plausible, and really about heart-felt friendship. Granted there are more hysterical moments that should not be missed. What I really appreciated about ""The Hangover"" is its spirit and sense of fun. ""The Hangover"" is one the funniest movies around."

I was very uncomfortable about the idea of somebody getting intoxicated, but too the point of not remembering is just awful. Well I made 10 minutes into it, and those were the worst 10 minutes of my life. Within the time frame I heard more swear words than I've ever heard before, saw more nudity than I see with my husband, and had the worst feeling watching these sinful people. I leaned over to my friend Abby and told her she could find me elsewhere (in the theater for Land of the Lost); because no way in Jesus' holy name was I watching this movie for another minute. I enjoyed that (Land of the Lost) a whole lot more, and when they (my so called friends) came out laughing at me, saying it was the funniest movie ever, I told them they better repent come Sunday, and I haven't spoken to them since then...

If it were not for the 17 to 30 year old crowd, this film would not have made it past its third weekend.<br/><br/>Movies like this one are an example of the downfall and/or decline of Hollywood.

Aside from being unfunny, reducing the suffering of countless millions of people to a punch line amounts to cruelty. It's just unacceptable and has no place here. If these clueless idiots knew anything at all about history and how fortunate they are to live in a society that allows them the freedom to act so immature they might behave differently. But that's beside the point of this film, which is to entertain on the lowest level possible. I found it a rather sad experience on all counts."

","I watched ' The Hangover' today after hearing recomendations from friends. Twenty minutes into the film I couldn't understand why I wasn't laughing. I am no prude and have found comedies such as 'Knocked Up' hilarious. However the clichéd storyline and frat house 'jokes' took it's toll on me. I found the humour that they used with the baby crossed a line. It is fine to use vulgar humour if the jokes are intelligent and well thought out. The makers of South Park posses this skill, unfortunately the makers of 'The Hangover' lacked the skills to do this. Instead relying on clichéd frat boy humour appealing to the lowest common denominator."

Anyway, good concept with weak writing. If you want a mindless comedy Old School is much better, but as far as this year, Funny People had more depth and way more laughs. Don't believe the hype!

Almost all the jokes are lame and fall flat throughout the whole movie. I maybe smiled/laughed twice? It makes me think that people who rated it highly must have been so drunk or f*cked up when they watched it. The actors suck. It all seems so forced that it's embarrassing.

"Quinoa1984","8","6","13","5 June 2009"," a near unapologetic pleasure - better than Old School
","The Hangover, until its closing credits, is a little like the Reservoir Dogs of bachelor party movies; as we never saw the heist in Dogs, we never see the party in this film. It becomes like a comedy-of-errors trapped in a mystery-riddle-enigma where three guys, Alan, Stu, and Phil (Galifianakas, Helms, Copper) can't seem to find their buddy, Doug, who is, you know, the groom in the wedding happening in one day. So, their quest leads them on a path of the unlikely and outrageous. There's a tiger in the bathroom and a baby in the closet when they wake from their stupor. When they leave to look for them Stu finds out he got married to a hooker (Heather Graham, very funny bit part) and she even has her grandmother's holocaust ring. As you might have seen in the trailer Alan's line ""I didn't know they gave out rings at the holocaust"", that should give a glimpse of other classic tid-bits in the movie. Oh yeah, and there's Mike Tyson singing Phil Collins, an effeminate Asian gangster (maybe the only meh stereotype done), and an scene with Rob Riggle that, damn his weak Daily Show bits, is really hysterical.<br/><br/>Oh sure, if you think about the movie for too long then it's predictable and not all the jokes work 100%. But so much of it does, and the director Todd Phillips, making the third round on this kind of outrageous-guy-buddy-comedy flick (before was the good Road Trip and the sometimes good sometimes overrated Old School) is assured with his craft here. What appears to be just a situation being told does become a story, with separate conflicts (i.e. the nice Mercedes, Stu's fractured relationship with his girlfriend), and spectacular camaraderie between the three main stars. To give away many more of the gags, some of them so obvious that they work because of the attitude of Galifianakis and the style of comedy Ed Helms has perfected from his time at the Office, towards scenes that could be played for simple laughs. There's real wit here, and a sense of ""what-the-f***"" going on at every turn that makes it worthwhile.<br/><br/>So, grab your buddies, sneak in some beers, and get ready to kick back with some guys you might recognize, maybe so close you'll be wondering if art imitates life a little much (save, perhaps, for Fat Jesus jokes, ha-ha), on a road trip in Vegas. Delicate sensibilities need not apply, as all will be offended at some point, even with mild jokes like Mike Epps' character having the same name as the missing bachelor-groom (""Black Doug"", ""White Doug""). Did I mention Mike Tyson sings and throws punches in-between? One can't decide if this or his recent documentary takes the cake for Tyson's comeback via cinema."

"SurrealistDreamer","Null","7","16","4 June 2009"," Remembering The Night That Was
","The Hangover<br/><br/>For those of you who are looking for a low-brow summer comedy with offensive jokes relating to babies, overweight men, testicles, drugs, hookers, strippers, immigrants, dentists, Las Vegas, and Mike Tyson than 'The Hangover' is the right movie for you. Directed by Todd Phillips of 'Old School' fame, he brings back classic characters from his claim to fame; the infamous wedding singer returns as well as the guy looking for the 'gang bang'; to shed light on the history of this genre of comedy that some producers and audiences can't get enough of. This movie is no exception, it pushes the limitations of its audience with its humor, both physical and verbal, from the hilarious mannerisms of Alan (Zach Galifianakis) to great writing and pacing of a night that nobody can remember. <br/><br/>It all starts with a wedding, followed by a flashback which begins with the bachelors Alan, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and the groom to be Doug (Justin Bartha) driving to Las Vegas for one last night of fun at Caesar's Palace. Each character carries excess baggage with them (Phil is looking to escape his mundane life as a teacher, husband, and father; Stu is dating a possessive woman that monitors his every move; Alan is a hazard to be around in general; and Doug is getting married). Their plan is to just have fun and forget about where they came from and this comes back to them full circle because they get drugged before the night begins and can't remember any of the events that took place or where to find Doug. This is the premise for the film, but the flashbacks are limited to security tapes and photos that act as the refresher for the three remaining members. <br/><br/>They go on a wild goose chase to a hospital, wedding chapel, sketchy motel, police precinct, impound lot, casino floor, and the dessert looking for Doug. They encounter doctors, police officers, strippers, a baby, a tiger, Mike Tyson, and a Chinese dignitary. But all of this is a blur to them and they make fools of themselves in the process trying to piece the night together, but it is all in vain as the trio only puts together a time-line of events and can't decipher when are where their friend disappeared. They make fun of themselves, each other, those around them, and by those around them along the way; bringing to life their personalities and giving hope to solving their problems back home along the way which adds to the humor of the storyline. <br/><br/>Each character has their own subliminal conquest when entering Las Vegas, they don't solve it when they leave but living through the night of their lives sheds light on their current situation causing each of them to appreciate the things that they have, or don't have, even more when they go back home. In their attempt for a night of fun they overcome their backgrounds and are considered equals when it comes to their memory. While searching for their friend they learn things about themselves that weren't quite clear prior to their trip and are able to bring all of their past problems to the surface. However, no real solution is devised for any of them or their problems, but they return to California changed men for the better. <br/><br/>'The Hangover' shouldn't be viewed as a comedy or and coming of age story,as it gets played out as. Rather, look at the film as a guidebook for what goes into a man's head. Not everyone has experienced a night like this, nor will many have a chance at it, so use the film as a vehicle to explore the unknown and take notes on what one should and should not do along the way. <br/><br/>I don't want to spoil the ending so I'll cut myself off here and leave you with a plea to see the movie with an open mind and a plan. The open mind will make the jokes more amusing, especially since they all come out of nowhere. The plan is for how you can avoid these situations with future bachelor parties or trips to Las Vegas. If nothing else see this movie so you know what to avoid when experiencing one of these two."
"aidanratesmovies","10","3","5","1 April 2020"," An absolutely hilarious time
","Outrageously funny, endlessly amusing, and by all means entertaining, The Hangover proves itself as one of the greatest comedies of the 2000's by never doubting its own insane potential. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis star in this hilarious comedy with some excellent chemistry. Surprisingly Bradley Cooper provides the best performance of the 3, and all together, the large celebrity cast in the film, never truly feels like they are milking the script. In other words, the acting seems real for this type of film, which is not only refreshing to see, but very amusing as well. The film is full of many hilarious gags, over-the-top situational humor, and plenty of excitement. At times the film can take a drag by dulling down to not make light of the situations they have found themselves in, and it may sound like this is a good thing, but it feels out of place with the rest of the rapid fire material. In the end, however, The Hangover more than succeeds as one great and hilarious comedy flick, and truly is a film experience to never forget.

","I understand how The Hangover became a hit with audiences. The raunchy, foul- mouthed spirit of the movie is precisely the kind of thing teenage boys try to create in the schoolyard. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis are the type of group every middle schooler wants to be a part of. They're vulgar, cool, and a little dopey. The ""jokes"", if you can call them that, are dumb teenage humor incarnate. I get why The Hangover has its younger fans. What baffles me about The Hangover is that it is so celebrated by critics. This is a comedy of the worst kind. One that is less interested in wit than it is in four letter words. <br/><br/>The concept of The Hangover is a good one, ripe with potential for lots of laughs. In it, three friends retrace their steps after a wild bachelor party in Las Vegas in order to find the missing bachelor. There's a clever idea to have the crew rediscover the pieces of their crazy night along with the audience. Unfortunately, the concept basically fizzles out after the first couple encounters.<br/><br/>And let's talk about those encounters. The little vignettes that the crew goes through to piece their night back together are total whiffs. There is plenty of room for comedy here. What did the crew get up to last night? Your mind runs wild with possibilities. What does the movie give us? Mike Tyson, a tiger, and a baby. If you didn't laugh at that list, chances are you won't laugh at the movie because all writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore do is present these scenarios flat. We're asked to laugh simply at the fact that Mike Tyson is on the screen. ""They met Mike Tyson last night, isn't that funny?"". There is absolutely no attempt to be clever with the concept. It's all surface. Another famous gag sees Ken Jeong jumping out of a car naked. Again, if you don't laugh at the idea of a naked Asian man, then you won't laugh at the movie. Without adding any kind of situational thought, a naked man running around screaming has less comedic value than a birthday clown. Scenes like this just sit there flailing around aimlessly in hopes for any kind of laugh.<br/><br/>And that's the target The Hangover aims for--any kind of laugh. That's why the movie is so vulgar. The director, Todd Phillips, is clearly just trying anything. It's trial and error right before your eyes. This joke didn't hit? Throw in a couple F-bombs and see if that gets anything. The movie is just so peppered with filth that it all becomes meaningless. When every other word is a swear, it just becomes noise. The trio of actors do nothing to help matters. Bradley Cooper is a fine actor, and a relatively likable persona. Here he is a disgusting, mean-spirited prick. Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis are funny, funny guys. They are squandered here. Let's face it, it's hard to be funny when you have nothing clever to say. The dialogue here is comedically bankrupt. When ""So long, gay boys"" is one of your big quotes and a guy getting tazed is one of your big scenes, you've got some serious script problems. <br/><br/>There are hundreds of comedies that fail because they're too silly or they try too hard to get laughs. Then, every once in a while comes a movie like The Hangover. A film of such laziness, such ambivalence to the idea of creating comedic scenarios, that it physically repelled me. All The Hangover does is insist you laugh at its concept, and if you like filth, laugh at that too. It's a total mess. I have no idea what people see in this movie. It's ugly, nasty, gross, and I did not laugh once. Other than that, well, it still sucks.<br/><br/>06/100"

"ironhorse_iv","7","3","5","9 May 2013"," Got a Hangover after watching Hangover
","I know a lot of people love this movie, but for me, not so much. Don't get me wrong, it's funny some what. Still, it's just has that stupid humor that reminds me of another similar movie 2000's 'Dude, where is my car?'. It's not that different from other drunk comedies. Instead, of a car, they are missing the groom to be, Doug. (Justin Berta). Also why is there a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the hotel room, and one of them is missing a tooth? Now the other three men deemed to be call the 'Wolf Pack' must find the groom, and retraces their steps from the night before when their Las Vegas bachelor party went horrible wrong. They must figure how all these things came into play. First off, there is Alan Garner (Zach Galifianakis), the social inept who both alternately creepy and hilarious stupid at the same time. It's not like he is that funny. He just like any other fat stupid guy in a comedy. I can name at less two dozen comedies with fat guys just like his character. Then there is Stu Price (Ed Helm) the dorky dentist who always end up taking the most chaotic change in his life in this type of movies. Last is the self-centered Phil Wenneck, (Bradley Cooper) who pretty much plays the straight man in these comedies. In their adventures, they encounter colorful characters, like smart-mouth cops, a sleazy owner of a quickie wedding chapel, and Mike Tyson. The problem is that the movie does nothing but string together a series of gags either crude or violent or both that grow more and more depressing the clearer it becomes that everything about the movie is shallow, phony, and cliché. It's not new. Honestly, what type of valet would drive a beat up police cruiser to the front of a hotel when they ask for their Mercedes? Wouldn't he think something is odd by that? Honestly, what type of hotel wouldn't notice such outrageous act going on without calling the cops? I think it's would be funnier if it's more realistic things happen rather than things that wouldn't happen in real life. I surprised that the police or the hotel staff wouldn't had investigates until the last minute the source of the damage. Honestly, I thought it would be funnier if they went to jail for their crimes. I wish I can escape jail time if I steal a police cruiser while high on rohypnol, by doing a taser demonstration, but in real life, I will probably be seeing 20 to 30 years jail sentences for something like that. The hype about this movie was kinda overrated. I think the reason why it was so enjoyable to some people because they saw it when they were probably high or drunk. While the movie says they were drugged, the title says otherwise. It's about drinking. It's didn't feel funny if you were watching it sober. It's just the fact, that this is a film is about getting drunk, that most people would see it, probably are drunk while watching. Hints why they thinks its awesome. Honestly, people that has something against drinking, shouldn't watch it because it makes drinking too much look cool. People that do drink shouldn't act like these fools on film. There is nothing funny at being a alcoholic child. It's not fun babysitting drunk people. There are various types of humor out there, but not everyone likes all types of humor. I think comedies need to have a subcategory according to the type of humor to help people to further identify if they like it or not. And this is not my type of humor. I found Bridesmaids funnier than this. While that may have been perverted as well, but the acting and comedy were actually very funny. It's more realistic in tone. Overall: Director Todd Phillips's Hangover is over the top, frat boy humor who opening was very slow, hard time building up the plot and lacks any sense of smart humor outside of dumb dark humor and jackass violence behavior. It's funny if you like dumb man-child type humors movies, if not-- this isn't your type of a film. You'll just feel pain like a hangover."

","Hey....I'm a guy who loves all types of humor, both highbrow (most Woody Allen films) and low (Billy Madison, Bachelor Party). As an example of a film in the lowbrow category, The Hangover disappoints......tremendously. There is no doubt, however, that the context of extreme hype this movie generated added to my disappointment. <br/><br/>After seeing Bradley Cooper in this movie and in other roles, I now conclude that he is an actor of limited range, delivering forgettable performances, and who adds absolutely no value to any film. In contrast, Ed Helms appears to be an actor perfect for a comedic role. I will definitely seek out his future performances (Hangover 2 the exception). The director, Todd Philips, produced two other forgettable movies in the same buddy format as Hangover: Road Trip and Old School. Both are derivative, unfunny films. Look for him to churn out more junk in the same mold. <br/><br/>Believe me I love to allow the juvenile in me to enjoy a crazy buddy movie. I just don't get this film. If you enjoy crazy movies that Hangover attempts to emulate watch Clerks, Billy Madison, Little Nicky, or even Dodge Ball.<br/><br/>If you to continue to have a desire to see this movie wait for its appearance on a non-premium cable channel.<br/><br/>Nuff Said"

"baronmordo001","4","8","20","8 June 2009"," Dude, Where's My Car + Very Bad Things = A Slightly Less Entertaining Film Called The Hangover
","Firstly I must say this isn't a bad movie... it's simply below average. It is funny which means it fulfills it's purpose. If, however, you watch a lot of comedy don't expect to see anything new. Other than Zach Galifianakis everything here has been done and even his character would simply be the clichéd bumbling idiot if not for Galifianakis' genius. The plot itself is very thin and poorly though out. If these guys simply utilize the logic that everyone else uses when something goes missing the movie would be over very quickly. Instead they go on this over bloated journey full of insanely obvious red herrings and numerous secondary characters that never seem to fit in with the atmosphere of the movie. But again this is comedy and because it is, it allows itself room for illogical plot holes and unnecessary silliness. I recommend if one is sitting at home and this comes of TV or if your at a friend's house and they happen to own it then go ahead and watch it but don't expect the type of movie you'll be talking about in 20 years (or even 2.) As I tell my wife time and time again just because something is funny doesn't make it good. I think in the grand scheme of the comedic genre of American film The Hangover ranks just below average."
"aiga","10","4","8","12 October 2009"," Funniest movie of the year.
","Well, it might be that everything there is to say has already been said, but today I feel like sharing my opinion. I am one of those people who put their DVD players on repeat. Especially, if I like what I see. I saw this movie for the first time already long time ago, but I do watch it over and over again. Today was one of those days. I must say that even though I've seen it many times, it is still funny. I guess it is not that easy to come up with jokes that would be funny when repeated over and over. This team has done it. I am so impatient for the sequel. I do wish those guys most of luck and success in making the second film just as good and funny. I love the fact that this movie has a reality feel to it. No matter how ridiculous and impossible the situations are, it still seems plausible. Maybe it is because those guys could be anyone and everyone. Like who hasn't been to a wild party?! Well, maybe not as crazy as that Any way, it is something new and fresh in the vast sea of American-Pie-type movies and all those romantic comedies. Don't get me wrong! I liked the first American Pie. May be the second, but all those sequels and alike no, not really. And what's up with all those romantic comedies!? Girl meets boy, boy meets girl, and so on. Most of them are all the same. You can see them once and forget just as you exit the theater. Sometimes I catch myself guessing the turns of the plot and ruining the movie for my friends by telling them exactly how it is going to end. I don't like to be able to do that after the first twenty minutes. I like surprises. It is really rare nowadays that one gets that in a movie. There are so many things made that I can understand that it is hard to find an original subject and, even more, to surprise the viewer. Well, I would like to conclude this short account of my impressions by citing a friend of mine who said that this movie is the best thing that has happened in cinema this year."
"Robert_duder","8","4","8","23 August 2009"," One of the best road trip, buddy comedies in years. A hilarious romp!
","There are a few reasons why I would never slap more than an eight out of ten on this movie. First the obvious reasons...the trailer does indeed show, in the grand tradition of comedies, a HUGE portion of the funniest moments and basically covers the entire film. Fortunately the rest of the movie is so well written and really well performed that the scenes are still funny and everything in between the scenes are funnier. Secondly the film uses a tried and true formula and while there is nothing wrong with that it does mean that the film is a little bit predictable at times and the scenes that would have been truly funny and shocking they give away in the trailer. Regardless of these things The Hangover is a hilarious romp and you will go along with these crazy and very different guys and love every minute of it. The best part of the film is they will make you feel like you are one of the guys on the craziest night of their lives...and like them you have no idea what happened the night before making it all the more fun.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper headlines the cast as the alpha male and is absolutely perfect as the alpha male. He is strong and suave and cool, he's the popular guy that everybody wants to hang out with and Cooper carries the role flawlessly. He is more the straight man in this comedy but he is versatile enough that it really works and he holds the story and cast together. Ed Helms is just terrific as perfectly composed, level headed dentist Stu Price. The character unravels almost more than any other in the film and he just does a terrific job. Zach Galifianakis is probably the funniest member of this comedy troupe. He is brilliantly perfect as the quirky, awkward Alan. He easily becomes everyone's favorite and has some the funniest lines and subtly hilarious moments in the film. Justin Bartha plays the missing groom Doug. Bartha gets the least screen time out of the four guys but he is still a solid part of the team and is good in the role of Doug. The supporting cast is really terrific and quirky and lots of very funny moments come from the supporting cast including Heather Graham, Sasha Barrese, Jeffrey Tambor, Ken Jeong (absolutely hilarious role--a must see for him alone), Rachael Harris, and Mike Tyson (also hilarious.) These are the cameo roles that will really stand out and worth watching out for.<br/><br/>The Hangover is practically guaranteed to become a cult classic...maybe even reach Animal House, Bachelor Party comedy status. It is also practically a guarantee that we will see another installment in The Hangover series and you know this from the moment Doug squeezes his wife's hand and whispers ""This will NEVER happen again,"" that the crazy four guys are going to get in trouble all over again and millions will flock to watch. The four of them have amazing chemistry, the perfect combination and personalities and performances. Everything just fits together perfectly. Sometimes that's talent and sometimes its just luck. In this case it might be a little of everything. Certainly director Todd Phillips is no stranger to comedy having directed some really solid slapstick, raunchy comedies but with really good stories and that is the key. The Hangover is the must see adult comedy of the year. It will have you in stitches and I haven't heard a single bad word uttered about it so it seems like a general consensus, probably the comedy of the year thus far. 8/10"
"choldren89","9","4","8","17 August 2009"," Hilariously Funny
","After seeing the previews I thought this movie might have potential, but it would probably turn out to be another one of those ""stupid-funny"" movies that come out on a monthly basis.<br/><br/>Well the movie definitely has potential. This movie is easily up there in the top 5 funniest movies I've ever seen. Possibly even the funniest. The plot is pretty original, and the casting was perfect in my opinion. Zach Galifianakis, who plays Alan, is hilarious the whole way through, and none of the other characters disappoint either. The humor is crude and, while not as bad as Borat, is still enough to turn-off some of the more conservative moviegoers. However if you're up for it this is definitely a movie worth the money. I highly recommend it."
"katospsopfismenos","9","4","8","15 August 2009"," Deserves to be higher up on the Top 250
","Well, where can I start, and where can I end with a film such as ""The Hangover""... First of all, it's a great comedy, and most definitely one that I have expected for years... I had a good laugh. I watched it twice in a cinema (and heck, maybe I'll go at least once more) I will be buying the Blu-ray when it comes out, and I will be enjoying this brilliant piece of comedy in all of it's Hi-Def glory.<br/><br/>Now why should you go watch it when some people are badmouthing it? Well, give it a try. Everyone has a different opinion, and a point of view, so it's only reasonable if some people don't like it. The trailer is all the preparation you need for this joy-ride, so if you don't think that it's your style of comedy, then fair enough.<br/><br/>I personally gave it a 9, and this is because I am overjoyed to finally see a new, fresh and funny movie on the big screen again. Just think for a moment what kind of comedies we've been fed the last couple of years... Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie, Epic Movie... Thanks, but I'll skip those, I learned my lesson.<br/><br/>The point is, this movie isn't trying to be funny by overflowing with pop culture references, or lame slapstick jokes... It's ACTUALLY an originally Funny film. I honestly couldn't remember when was the last time a laughed in a movie theater, and enjoyed that moment with my friends by my side. It's one heck of an experience and I'm glad I didn't miss it. <br/><br/>It's definitely a guy movie, but that doesn't mean, female viewers will be disappointed... Bottom line, It was a refreshing experience, and anyone should give it try. Make sure you go with friends though, the more the merrier! And the ending is absolutely priceless, this movie has a serious pair of balls, and just like the guys on the way home from Vegas, it passes miles ahead of all the other latest comedies, letting them eat it's dust!"
"3xHCCH","7","4","8","14 August 2009"," Madcap Zany Fun Movie
","I did not really plan to watch this movie because I am not the type of guy who enjoys drinking alcohol. The poster was strange and the stars were unknowns. First impression was: Not Interested. However, the news came that this flick actually topped the summer box office Stateside. I heard a couple of radio DJs talk about how funny and cleverly plotted it was. I had some time to kill, so I was able to watch it.<br/><br/>""The Hangover"" is about a stag party in Vegas which goes totally haywire. When they wake up wasted the next morning, their suite was thrashed, one finds that he has lost a tooth, there's a tiger in the bathroom, there's a baby in the closet, and worst of all, the groom is nowhere to be found. The three groomsmen needed to retrace the obviously wild night they had to find their friend and get him to the wedding on time.<br/><br/>It was very funny how the director went on to steer the audience into realizing what happened together with the characters, as we follow them through their madcap misadventures. As this is a movie, realism is thrown out of the window and our IQ should be checked at the door. You simply know those situations are out of this world, but it grabs our attention as we too want to know exactly what happened. There were potentially offensive subjects like police brutality and Asian racism, but we know these were done tongue-in-cheek, so we go along with the fun ride.<br/><br/>I have not seen these actors before. They are really the unlikeliest of gangs. I do not think people like them would flock together in real life. Bradley Cooper plays the mean alpha male. Ed Helms plays the nerdy straight-laced dentist. Zach Galifianakis plays the weirdo brother of the bride. Justin Bartha plays the groom. Their chemistry with each other and willingness to make fun of themselves adds to the success of this film."

","This is absolutely, without a doubt, the funniest movie I've ever seen. I can officially say that Apatow better watch his back, because Todd Philips just set the bar VERY high. My best friend and I were literally in pain from laughing so hard! In a nutshell, Doug is the groom-to-be. He and his 3 best friends decide to have one last, big ""guys night out"" in Sin City before Doug heads to the altar in 2 days. But the plans go horribly (and hilariously) awry! The guys wake up to a completely trashed hotel room to find that Doug is missing, there's a crying baby in the closet, a chicken wandering aimlessly around the room, Mike Tyson's tiger is hanging out in the bathroom, and none of them can remember a thing from the night before. They must retrace their steps and figure out where they went and what they did the previous night in order to find their friend in time for his wedding the next day. I won't give away too much more, but seriously, this film is an absolute must-see. The cast is amazing, the cameo by Mike Tyson is side-split-tingly funny (you'll never listen to ""In the Air Tonight"" by Phil Collins the same way again, I promise) and I guarantee that the first words out of your mouth when you leave the theater will be, ""We GOTTA see this again!""... I know mine were! I give this movie 10/10 because I've never laughed so consistently and so hard in a theater before. Do yourself a favor and go see this movie ASAP. You won't regret it!!

"jreafilms","10","4","8","14 July 2009"," Genuinely Funny
","It's always great when you can share a movie experience with an entire theater of strangers. When an entire crowd can burst out in a unison of laughter, all the while making you appreciate each gag for its originality and authenticity. ""The Hangover"" is one of those rare movies where the audience becomes an extension of the group of buddies with which you went to see the movie. Not to mention, it's f**king hilarious. The unity with strangers aside, this movie is wholly satisfying as a comedy. Biased though I am (a Zach Galifianakis fan for years now), I enjoyed this film for everything it is: a gut-buster, brimming with laughs not only farcical in its whimsy, but deep-rooted in the stellar casts' interplay. Galifianakis is brilliant as the somewhat-disturbed third wheel thrust upon the bachelor party, almost all of his lines memorable and quotable. Cooper is spot-on as the dis-likable man-boy, ultimately redeemed through his belief in friendship and a renewed relationship with his wife. Helms somewhat continues his role from the office, an overly preppy suburbanite with a wild side (not to mention, wholly committed to the wrong woman), and uniquely hilarious nonetheless. So here's the kicker: I'm a film graduate, raised on uppity purebred master cinema, praising the work of the ""lowest"" form of entertainment: comedy. This movie was thoroughly entertaining, engrossing, and above all, absolutely hysterical. Shouldn't my reason for purchasing a ticket to be entertained? Isn't that what this movie did? Did it not unify a roomful of complete strangers with its unabashed hilarity? What then, is so wrong about this relationship?"

Even if you didn't care for those movies very much I would still expect everyone who sees it to laugh until it hurts. I want to watch it a second time so I can hear all the jokes I was too busy laughing through the first time to catch. Unless you are easily offended or have a heart condition where a huge amount of laughter can be a bad thins this is a must see. Best comedy ever made bar none."

","Because of the hype, I decided to give this one a try. I'm a fan of Wedding Crashers, Role Models, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, and I expected this film to be of the same general caliber. It was, in many ways.<br/><br/>However, this film is definitely a dude-flick (paralleling the *chick-flick*) as it explores the male-escape fantasy through a device I will not reveal due to IMDb's scary spoiler laws. I feel like it crossed the line several times in regards to a woman's sense of humor and her tolerance toward ""humor"" using violent sexual offenses, pedophile-related jokes, and sexualized breastfeeding--hard to make the ladies bust out laughing with this list of serious icks and no-no's.<br/><br/>The other annoying part of this film was its audience. Sadly, half the theater was filled with ""gentlemen"" that had seen it before and were either yelling things like ""OH GOD, I LOVE THIS PART"" before the scene happened, giggling during silences in the movie, or naming the item (repeatedly) that is making him laugh so hard in the first place.<br/><br/>I think movies like this should be made, and I'm so glad men are laughing and enjoying themselves--but ladies--you may decide to just let the guys go ahead and enjoy this one their own. Having seen ""The Proposal"" last weekend, I would definitely save my money and go see that with your girls instead. Hilarious, worth the ticket price, and a genuinely good time."
"USC_Trojan","10","4","8","6 June 2009"," Tremendous feat worth remembering
","Here's the thing about this film. Yes it is vulgar and offensive, we know that and it's no surprise, however, it is also a comedic masterpiece and a very well made movie from the acting to the score (the music fit the scenes beautifully and the songs don't have to be obscure and artful creations to do that). Each character is vivid and unique, especially Carlos (how about that acting job), with the exception of maybe Mr. Chow, who I still liked. Zach Galifianakis, somehow, continues to do a tremendous job bouncing between television, the big screen and stand up. The comedy flows freely and is very rarely forced, plus it poked some fun at other movies like 21, when Alan went on his card counting rampage, without being ridiculously over the top like the epic movies of the world. What impressed me about this film compared to other half-hearted comedies is how the humor comes about. For instance, a mediocre comedy may have Stu losing his tooth in some freak drunken accident that has you chuckling and saying that was okay, but in The Hangover, Stu's friend bet him he wasn't a good enough dentist to pull out his own tooth, which he may have done to prove he was a real doctor, which was an issue throughout (maybe that's looking to deep into it though), he was... well you know. It was small punch lines like that that helped move the story along. As for the story itself, it's been done. Four friends, sort of, go to Vegas for a bachelors party and craziness ensues. Although, the path the film took was so innovative that you won't care."

Would-be comedic dynamo which starts off like a champion and then fades into obscurity like a washed-up bench-warmer. The typical ""Old School"" and ""Wedding Crashers""-styled comedy wears out its welcome as the zany situations (a missing tooth, an abandoned baby, a loose tiger, a stolen police car, the yakuza, and so on) come at you fast and furiously with adult situations and sometimes downright vulgar outcomes being the orders for the day. Lost in the mix is Bartha (just basically getting lost in the shuffle early on) and usually dependable performers like Heather Graham and Jeffrey Tambor who have little more than token parts. Cameos by Mike Tyson and Mike Epps are unnecessary distractions and the inclusion of sexually-confused Asian crime boss Ken Jeong (seeing more of him than we want) are dizzying sidelines which represent little rime, reason, and most importantly merit.

I often comment on people's reactions to things that aren't anything but entertaining. This film is just not very engaging. It's a bit too much to think that a group of men could all get so drunk that they can't remember anything. For one to have that issue is stretching it. For all of them. Well! I do admit that given some of the visual stuff, I did laugh. I mean, there's a tiger in one of the rooms. There's a chicken running around. But at some point, it is so over the top, and the issues so irreconcilable, I had to think that only ridiculous plotting could get them out of this. And, of course, it did.

"rayshad","9","2","3","4 October 2013"," The Hangover use of Foreshadowing and Time Elapse
","October 2, 2013<br/><br/>Review<br/><br/>Time plays a huge role when it comes to the making of a film. Foreshadowing is a technique that is often used at the beginning of movies to get the audience attention. This technique can have both a negative and positive view on a movie. In the movie The Hangover, directed by Todd Phillips, starts with Phil on the phone with Doug's wife Tracy. He told her that they messed up the night and lost her soon to be husband Doug. Then the movie goes back two days earlier to reveal to the audience what happened the nights before. Another example of how Phillips played with time is by showing the elapse of time over the Las Vegas skyline during the night of Doug's bachelor's party with his three friends in Las Vegas. I believe Philips' use of foreshadowing and the elapse of time is very effective because it kept the audience anticipated to see what happened.<br/><br/>The use of foreshadowing at the beginning of the movie kept me engaged to see what happened to Doug and the bachelor party night. James Berardinelli from Reelviews quotes, ""The Hangover begins and ends conventionally""(N.p). Foreshadow at the beginning was conventional because it was unexpected and grabbed the audience attention immediately. Berardinelli went on and states, ""The film begins with a teaser: it's the day of the wedding, the groom is missing, and his friends are in the middle of nowhere""(N.p). Even though the situation Phil presents to Doug's wife Tracy was a serious situation, it was also considered to be comedic because who gets lost right before their own wedding. From Phillips starting the movie with a flashback it created the mood and plot for the rest of the film. This was a genius idea because it tells you the problem, but it does not go into detail on what happened for this problem to occur. This technique is opposite of an ordinary movie because usually the problem is built up into the movie, rarely is it given at the beginning of it. The counter argument for using this technique of displaying the problem at the beginning is because it reveals the main gist to early. I do not agree with this dispute because I think this was very much needed in The Hangover because it creates an attention getter.<br/><br/>Another brilliant idea that Phillips used in The Hangover is the elapse of time over the Las Vegas Skyline. Even though the audience would have probably like to have seen what happened the night of Doug's bachelor party they didn't get to see the outcome. This is the counter argument of Phillips use of time elapse. Honestly I thought his use of time elapse was a great idea. The reason why I agree is because I think that Philip had in his mind from the start of the movie process that he wasn't going to reveal the bachelor party and what happened that night until the end of the movie. From Philip's doing this he created a mysterious effect to the movie making the audience question what happened the night of the bachelor party. Robert Ebert the movie critic states, ""The next morning, Doug will be missing. The other three are missing for several hours; none of them can remember a thing since they were on the roof of Caesars Palace, drinking shots of Jagermeister. They would desperately like to know: How in the hell do you wake up in a $4,200- a-night suite with a tiger, a chicken, a crying baby, a missing tooth and a belly button pierced for a diamond dangle? And when you give your parking check to the doorman, why does he bring around a police car? And where is Doug?"" (N.p). Philip's gives the audience the answers to the questions by showing how the three friends gathered up clues to determine what happened that night to find Doug. Ebert states, ""The search for Doug has the friends piecing together clues from the ER doctor, Mike Tyson's security tapes and a mattress that is impaled on the uplifted arm of one of the Caesars Palace statues. The plot hurtles through them""(N.p). The structure of this movie through the elapse of time gives it a unique element. <br/><br/>Philips was able to create more of mysterious theme in a comedic movie through the elements of foreshadowing and time elapse. The Hangover is probably one of the most successful comedy movies in this century. Through Philips play on time it adds a more realistic effect to the humorous movie. The play on time fits perfectly with the randomness of the movie. <br/><br/>Work Cited Berardinelli, James. ""The Hangover."" Reelviews. N.p., 05 Jun 2009. Web. 4 Oct 2013. Ebert, Robert.

","Phil, who is the genius with two other jerks named Stu (the Crazy Doc) & the Stupid but Genius Nerd Alan. OMG, I can't stop laughing when they open the car's Dicky & Mr Cow hits all when he comes out. Fantastic screenplay, Story & Audio effects. Actually I realize that this could happen with anyone, who drunk a lot. but stealing a police car & getting marry with an prostitute.....:O :O :O. People are doing craziest things only when they are drunk too much. And unfortunately that's true & that's what they wanna do in their real life. Doug, who was the first character of movie isn't doing a big part unfortunately. but if he does, may be the movie may be a mess. Any way I would like to thank the CREW of the movie, to making me laugh. Overall movie is a magnificent effort that made me laugh than any other movie."

","That's right, this is the second best movie ever made. First of all, I've seen this movie milions of times that I think that I can't even count them with the fingers on my hand, at least I can't count with just one hand, that's for sure. This movie is just awesome and when I saw it, I just thought, this was such an incredible idea for a movie, and only now they thought about it and decided to make a movie? Masterpieces can't be done in one minute, right, this movie was hilarious, entertaining and it had a great cast.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper is awesome in this movie, he cood have role where he cood be mature but also hilarious and crazy. Cooper is known from Wedding Crashers, Limitless, The Hangover Part 2, Yes Man and All About Steve, Ed Helms, had a role familiar to Bradley's role, but he was probably a bit funnier, Ed Helms rocked in this movie, he was hilarious, Ed Helms is known from The Office, The Hangover Part 2, Evan Almighty, Semi-Pro and Cedar Rapids, Zach Galifianakis, what can I say, this movie woodn't be so awesome as it is if it didn't had Zach in it, Zach just steals the show, he's hilarious in every time he's on the screen, just to hilarious to be truth, Zach is known from G-Force, What Happens In Vegas, The Hangover Part 2, Due Date and It's Kind of A Funny Story, the rest of the cast is completed by a cameo with Matt Walsh and Rob Riggle and it's also completed with the amazing role by Jeffery Tambor, Justin Bartha is also in it, and Ken Jeong too. Sow, the three first actors I've wrted in there, are now three of my favorite actors, specially Zach, then Ed and then Bradley, choosing a not to known cast for an incredible movie was a big risck, but it was worth it, these three guys cood show their big potential, since this movie, I guess all of them are very known.<br/><br/>Doug (Justin Bartha) is about to get married, but before that, he and his buddies planed a bachelor party in Vegas, Doug, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and his fiancé's brother Alan (Zach Galifianakis) are the three guys who are joining Doug to Vegas. After getting there and go to the hotel room, thinking they will have a night, that they will never forget, when they wake up, it happens exactly the opposite. They all wake up with a giant hangover, they don't remember everything of what happened last night, Stu losts a tooth (By the way, Stu was a dentist), Doug is missing, there's a baby in the closet, a tiger in the bathroom, who appears that belongs to Mike Tyson (Himself), Stu got married to a hor, Jade (Heather Graham) and now Phil, Stu and Alan, who call themselves as the Wolfpack, will have to do everything it takes to remember what happened last night, so they can find Doug and go back to the wedding. It's not going to be that easy. See that, this is the second best idea for a movie, the first best is the idea for Horrible Bosses.<br/><br/>Overall, as you can see, this movie is hilarious, you will constantly laughing, the story will lead you entertained every second, this movie has a great cast and it also has lots of memorable quotes. Second Best Movie Ever Made. Extremely recommended. Grade: A+."

","The Hangover is a very good comedy movie. I spent almost all the movie time laughing. This one will make you laugh till you fall on your back. I can rate it one of the best comedy movies in history. . A group of friends meets many situations in which they act, think and talk some comedy. I didn't laugh this much a long time ago. I loved every second of the movie. and I'm ready to watch it again and again and again and I'm sure I will not be bored. All the four characters are amazing in this film. They played their roles very professionally. So, if you want a good comedy movie, this is the one you are looking for. As I can see (in the moment I wrote this review) it has a rating of 7.9 and I'm sure it deserves more than that. I rated it 10 stars as I love comedy movies especially good ones like this."
"FatMan-QaTFM","Null","2","3","24 August 2011"," Begs the question ""Can you call it a comedy if there are no jokes?""
","I'll be straight up honest: I didn't like The Hangover. I thought it was over-hyped and really not much to write home about. Back then it got a C- and I recall considering walking out it was so offensive and pointless. All that didn't stop it from raking in almost a half-billion worldwide.<br/><br/>This style of movie is a convergence of the Tina Fey generation of comedy writers and the R-rated comedy run that started probably with Wedding Crashers and has not let up. They are the comedies with no jokes, just funny/gross/offensive/wacky – you name it – as long as you don't have to actually put in the effort of writing a single funny line of dialog.<br/><br/>Here we go on Part 2. In a particularly good choice, I went to the crack-head cinema. I've yet to see a good movie at this theater and I didn't think anything was going to change. Turns out crack-heads are within the target audience. The place was packed and roared with laughter throughout the entire movie. I was a little island of silence in the middle of a jovial (high) crowd. I managed one ""heh"" at some Galifianakis line, but it was Part 1 all over again. And I mean that literally – it was the same story in every way, just set in a different city. They wake up after a wild bender, someone's missing, all is well by the end.<br/><br/>The difference that gave The Hangover a C- was a bit of heart, some personal growth, and a little bit of dramatic tension. Phil has to own up to what happened, Stu broke up with his controlling girlfriend to pursue his wife/stripper with a heart of gold. I know you're saying ""But this is a comedy, Fat Man! There's no plot needed!!"" Sure, if it's complete non-sequitur comedy, but any narrative (comedy or not) need to have some plot structure and a reason to exist. All that development is all thrown out the window in Part 2 where they are all great friends already, Stu has dumped his mistake of the past and they apparently have not learned a single thing about honesty. Bottom line: I don't care how cool a woman is, none of this is instantly okay. With some time, maybe. Right away? Absolutely not. The characters reverted to their selfish lying selves that we saw at the beginning of Part 1. Also, extreme irresponsibility, last I checked, does not increase the respect of someone who has no respect for you to begin with. You know, just in case you were planning something wild to impress your boss and get that big raise.<br/><br/>The Hangover Part II is just another R-rated comedy that begs the question ""Can you call it a comedy if there are no jokes?"""

","This movie is one of the best comedy movie ever made in Hollywood.

I mean the whole story is very nicely displayed and each character leaves its mark.<br/><br/>By the name of the movie you might get the idea that it will be about some people getting drunk and then not knowing what they are doing/have done after that, but this movie is far better then this simple idea. The things shown in the movie is simply awesome and the way it story reveals itself is superb.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper and Zach Galifianakis did very good job.<br/><br/>All in all: An excellent comedy movie."

","This comedy is perfect. It doesn't waste a second, because when it's not making you laugh with a joke, it's presenting a funny situation (that would end in a joke to make you laugh later). But the difference here with other low brow comedies is with the other moments, where besides being funny, the movie allows the characters to be real and let us know each of them, their relationships and how those grow. There is space for realistic reactions and emotions in them, even if the situations and the story are exaggerated.<br/><br/>Superb acting from the three leads Helms, Cooper and Galifianakis, stealing the show, making every line as funny as possible.<br/><br/>The script and dialogue is pretty great, and the direction from Phillips maintains a good enough balance between realism and ridiculousness really hard to hit. The score (or songs used) could've been better, but that's just a minor thing. Awesome low brow comedy, with enough ingenuity to elevate it above something like a Seth Rogen comedy."

However, when something is good they tend to ruin it by making too much of a good thing to make money. I found the second one funny, but it didnt suprise me as much as the first one because they used the same scenario, having a such a hang over that you dont remember anything, and haveing a person missing that you have to find.

The cast did a fantastic job portraying their roller coaster of emotions as they try to trace their steps and figure out what happened during their wild night. The characters in the movie are well developed, with each having his or her own distinct personality. These personalities are clearly surfaced through the way each character responds both verbally and physically under different situations. The characters' strengths and weaknesses complement one another well and the cast had great chemistry. Overall, this movie is a must-watch!"

"harriseli-12221","9","1","1","8 January 2019"," Good comedy with a hint of mystery
","This film was a comedy set apart from the rest of the genre. What sets this comedy apart from others is a well structured script and a pace that doesn't allow any form of thinking. The chemistry between the four leads is also a plus. The jokes and actions will leave the audience rolling in laughter, sometimes making you feel bad for laughing.
The cinematography doesn't stand out, but it doesn't need to in this comedy. The actors did an amazing job with their roles. The chemistry between them makes the friendship feel genuine. The music choices fit the theme of Las Vegas escapades well. The plot was interesting and made the movie feel like a comedic mystery movie. It kept the audience guessing as to what would happen next and the comedy helped propel the story to its end. The Hangover is a great comedy that hits almost all its jokes and doesn't feel stale after watching it more than once."

","""The Hangover"" (2009) is a professionally produced comedy about three friends, Phil played by Bradley Cooper, Stu played by Ed Helms, and Alan played by Zach Galifianakis, that wake up with no memories of a bachelor party the night before in Las Vegas. During their eventful enlightenment they search for their missing bachelor friend, Doug played by Justin Bartha, in order to get him safely back to his scheduled wedding. This film is hysterical in every right. It made my laugh from beginning to end with it's over the top antics and comical twists. It reminded me of similar life experience, though not as extreme, still very funny and nostalgia inducing. The writing and dialogue are both very well put together, though different backgrounds effect dialogue, but it's the story that is actually magical. <br/><br/>Even though this film is a comedy and the acting is executed superbly in its extremeness, the story is about having your buddy's back. I sincerely enjoyed how the director, Todd Phillips, allowed the comedy to flow without abandoning the message. The whole film is about trying to figure out what happened the night before, but it is all in an effort to locate and save Doug. Through the comedy, the director still provides a sense of identifiability to the audience in caring for a friend. Overall, this is a top-notch comedy that I would recommend to everyone that has friends they would bend over backwards for."

That doesn't mean that the movie isn't funny. In fact, there are many lines that are hilarious, but, honestly, I didn't laugh out loud, or even laugh a lot as much as I should or wanted.<br/><br/>The jokes at the third act are kinda silly and lazy as well as the third act as a whole.

Especially if a MATTRESS is hanging from the roof, it would cause attention/inquiry/investigation, not just ignored all day. My grand finale: why would he choose to cook in the sun for hours and hours when there are shady spots all over the place? It's not funny, it's just stupid and ridiculous."

","Doug Billings is getting ready to marry his beautiful bride Tracy Garner in this comedic adventure directed by Todd Phillips. Before the wedding takes place, Doug and three of his friends plan a one night bachelor party in Las Vegas. Everyone knows what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas and this movie is the definition of that statement. The movie begins with Phil Wenneck calling Doug's bride to be from a remote desert location. Phil looks like he has been beat to a pulp and he informs Tracy that they have lost Doug. The conversation ends abruptly and we are taken back in time to Phil and his soon to be brother-in-law getting fitted for tuxedos. Doug and Alan discuss their trip to Las Vegas and the movie proceeds with the introduction of Doug's bachelor part attendees. Stu Price, who loves to be called ""Doctor Price"" because he is a dentist, is introduced while packing his bags for Vegas. His wife is very condescending and controlling and Stu's friends have no shame in pointing this out. Stu convinces his wife they are going on a wine tasting tour, the guys show up to pick him up, and away we go to pick up Phil. Phil is a teacher by day and a party animal by night. The guys are all together and ready to head to Vegas. Once the crew arrives in Vegas they get settled in their hotel room and decide to go to the rooftop to have a toast before the night begins. Alan gives a wolf pack speech addressing how happy he is to have new members in his pack. The guys throw back a few shots and the scene cuts to a destroyed hotel room, everyone slowly waking up with a hangover, and Doug nowhere to be found. The hotel room has a lovely tiger in the bathroom that was acquired the previous night, which, by the way, nobody has any recollection of. Alan, Phil and Stu are on a mission to find Doug because his wedding is the next day. Director Todd Phillips takes us on a hilarious ride with Alan, Phil and Stu trying to figure out what happened the night before and where they left Doug. <br/><br/>The theme of this movie revolves around the theme of getting drunk, the effects of drugs, and what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. The guys go on wild ride which we are engulfed in the entire movie. The editor makes good use of montages to take us through the night that happened but nobody can remember. Alan, Stu, and Phil discover a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the closet, chickens running amuck and their man of the hour missing in action. As the movie progresses there is good use of transition with music. The editor does a fine job tying scenes together with musical bridges that are unobtrusive to the flow of the movie. This movie also makes good use of camera angle to get the viewer in the scene. A hand-held camera angle is used in one scene where Stu is looking around frantically for Doug. Stu is in a state of confusion and feeling a heavy hangover. The camera angle is a great tie in to the theme because it depicts what can happen in Las Vegas if you let your inhibitions run wild. Todd Phillips has made several movies with a theme dealing with partying hard and getting in to trouble. <br/><br/>Todd Phillips also directed the movie Old School with Will Ferrell, Luke Wilson, and Vince Vaughn. This is another hilarious comedy that involves drinking, making poor decisions, but having fun every step of the way. The Hangover does an excellent job using crude dialogue to keep the viewer on their toes. Phil, Alan and Stu represent what happens to a lot of bachelor party attendees when they are let loose in Vegas. The dialogue is relevant to the relationships the guys have with each other and to the situations played out in the movie. <br/><br/>The idea of getting incredibly drunk and unknowingly taking drugs is portrayed with a great comedic twist in The Hangover. There may be several bachelor party movies where something goes wrong but this movie is one that will last through the passage of time. Director Todd Phillips was able to take a common plot and put twists and turns throughout the movie to keep the viewer guessing as to what really happened that night. Spoiler alert! The movie ends with a hilarious montage of photos on a digital camera that Alan found in the back seat of his dad's car. Finally, our guessing is over, and the events that took place do not disappoint."

","I've seen this comedy twice, two days in the row; first, with my husband, and then on the New Year Eve, with the company of friends. Everyone enjoyed it and laughed a lot. I liked it both times, the second time as much as the first and this is not usually my kind of comedies. I prefer my comedy more sophisticated, subtle, witty, but Hangover somehow won me over. It started and ended fairly predictable, but in the middle - the night that four friends spent conquering Las Vegas and throwing the bachelor party to end all bachelor parties, of which they have no recollection the following morning, -this part of the movie was very funny. Just to picture once again in my mind the battle field that their posh hotel suite in the Cesar's Palace has became, with the Bengal tiger occupied the bathroom and meeting every visitor with the scary roar, with the lonely chicken walking on the floor, and with the baby-by in the closet, makes me laugh again. And I did not mention that one of the friends is missing his front tooth, another is wearing the hospital wrist band, and the groom has disappeared in the thin air. Did the tiger eat him or did he turn into the chicken or became a baby? When Mike Tyson appears in the middle of the film as a visitor of three friends who were desperately looking for their friend and tried to figure out what exactly did happen last night, I knew that I liked the movie. Showing Mike Tyson singing in unison with Phil Collins and demanding that his pet-tiger who was stolen from his mansion must be delivered back to him or else, was a stroke of genius. Don Luis Bunuel would have loved that scene, I am sure.<br/><br/>We were watching uncut full version. Many of the jokes were far below the waist but the performers seem amused at what they were doing on the screen, and when this happens, then the audience laugh. Not for sensitive viewers, who easily blush and get insulted.<br/><br/>The Hangover may be described in two sentences, ""What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas"" and with the opening line from Mr. Dolittlle song in My Fair Lady, ""Just get me to the church in time"". We all have seen many movies about bachelor parties, Vegas, hangover, and male bonding. Hangover does not tell anything new but thanks to the clever writing and the real chemistry among Bradley Cooper (Phil, the schoolteacher), Ed Helms (Stu, the dentist), and Zach Galiifanakis (nerdy, socially awkward brother-in-low to be homage to the Rainman), the film keeps the viewers interest and provides more than few laughs. Did I mention Mike Tyson who almost overplayed the professional actors?"

","This seems get a lot of praise from professional critics and casual viewers alike. However, this isn't going to get much from me. The whole thing just seems like a rehash of ideas which've been already done before. Moreover there's no fresh feeling to it either as it's done in a typical modern day comedy fashion i.e tons of swearing, lots of sex references, action scenes and obscene humour. I don't have a particularly huge problem with any of these characteristics but when they are what the movie is based around, it gets quite a bit annoying.<br/><br/>The storyline isn't as bad as some of the movies in the same vein. And there were a few moments that made me smile and even semi laugh. But the overall humour comes off as pretty dry. Using the f word a billion times does not make a movie funny. But that seems to be a problem with a lot of comedies nowadays.<br/><br/>Overall, I though it was a pretty mediocre movie and I would only suggest checking it out if you like similar movies e.g Pineapple Express, Observe and Report, Superbad etc. Personally, I'm sick and tired of these kinds of movies."

The night before involves a tiger, a chicken, a baby, a stripper named Jade (Heather Graham), who Stu accidentally marries, and Mike Tyson. The real joy of this movie is that we're as interested to figure out what the hell happened as much as they do. You feel like you're part of the mystery. The conclusion is nothing less than perfect. When the end credits roll, you see a bunch of pictures on a camera that show what really went down that night. It is the perfect finale to a movie that can only be described as a funnier, raunchier version of Dude, Where's My Car?"

","You know I thought it would be hard to top the comic lineup of films that we had in 08'. Tropic Thunder, Pineapple Express, Step Brothers, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and Role Models. Last year was a good comedy year. Until 12:01 A. M. June 5th, 2009.<br/><br/>The Hangover has got to be the funniest film I have ever seen. The characters have great development and fall wonderfully into their situation. If you haven't seen the preview here's a synopsis: Guy's go to Vegas for bachelor party, they get messed up, spend the rest of movie looking for the groom they lost the night before. Bradley Cooper was the perfect choice for the leader of the bozos about in Las Vegas. Ed Helms is perfect as the doctor with the horrible girlfriend (Also played very convincingly by Rachel Harris) and the uptight but loose at the same time attitude. ALAN is the off the wall comic relief in this equation and has some of the most memorable lines in the film. The soundtrack is also great and goes well with this film.<br/><br/>This is truly the funniest movie in a long time that I have seen.<br/><br/>Go Watch AS Soon AS Possible"

"harry-austin","Null","3","6","20 July 2011"," Over hyped and over rated.
","After the reaction that this film created I thought that it was about time I watched it - two years after its release. The name of the film made me believe the humour would be entirely predictable and probably a bit too crude. I was expecting to see the best comedy of the past decade because of people's amazement when I could say 'I have never seen ""The Hangover' and I can now say that I don't regret my rather late viewing of the film.<br/><br/>I was disappointed by the film's humour, there were too few 'laugh out loud' moments and I thought that because of this the film just seemed to drag on and on. I would not call it boring, but I would certainly call it mediocre.<br/><br/>The acting was of a fairly decent quality, Bradley Cooper seems to have come out of nowhere, although I seem to be the only person who remembers him from ""Wedding Crashers"". I have never particularly liked him as an actor, partially because of his arrogant presence on the screen, and this, for me, it a problem in the film. I found the other two of the main characters to be fairly sound, and seeing Heather Graham was a breath of fresh air. It was nice to see her in a major(ish) film, her first since ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" over ten years ago.<br/><br/>While the above is for the most part fairly negative, it was still a film that you could watch from start to finish while not feeling bored at its end. My particular part was a certain cameo appearance which was probably the highlight of the film, as this made the fairly crude humour to be more ridiculous and entertaining, which was definitely needed.<br/><br/>All in all, ""The Hangover"" is worth a watch, but don't expect to see the best comedy of your life, because realistically it is not better than most of the other comedies coming out at the moment."

","I started to watch it and the humor was OK, found it funny when Zack's character took it as far to be blood brothers and that there seemed to be one sensible character in the film but he went missing.And that Zack thought it was Cesar's palace and yet he was serious.Then when one of the characters pretend to jack of a baby was disgusting that is every sicko's dream and yet no one found it disturbing. Just because its meant to be entertainment doesn't mean that morals go out the window i found it sick that a mother would allow there child to be in a film like that, i found it sick that the writer even put that in the script. I'm all for funny films but this made me chuck the film straight in the bin."
"rparks33","8","3","6","24 January 2011"," The Hangover
","The Hangover is a movie about some guys (Stu, Doug, Alan, Phil) who go to Vegas for a bachelor party. The bachelor party is for Doug and it is just a few days before the wedding is supposed to happen. While in Vegas the group ends up losing Doug and the whole movie is their journey to find him. They try to back track (from what they can remember) and find him.<br/><br/>There were a few reasons why this movie was so great. For one, the cast couldn't have been much better than what it was. Zach Galifianakis is one of the funniest people in Hollywood today. Also, it's a really catchy movie and is very easy to quote without even realizing it such as ""Driving drunk... Classic!"" Another reason I loved this movie so much is because it was appealing to people MY age (college student) and even people much older than me.<br/><br/>I do not have very many complaints about this movie. There were a couple parts that I thought were a little slower than the rest. For instance, when they are in the desert at the end with the Asian (for those who have seen it know what I'm talking about and for those who haven't will know after you see it). Another bad part was Tyson's acting. I understand he's a boxer and not an actor but it could've been someone else famous who knew how to act a little better.<br/><br/>Overall, I was very pleased with the movie and I am now a proud owner of the DVD. It will always be a classic to me as my DVD collection grows."
"oneguyrambling","7","3","6","30 October 2010"," Memento a la Blotto
","Firstly as The Hangover is basically ""Blotto Memento"", and unfolds back to front I can't give ya too much in the way of plot.<br/><br/>I will tell you things I thought prior to watching the movie:<br/><br/>1/ In advance of the movie starting I had set the over/under of gay jokes at 5. And I had the over. (I was close but wrong. Although the first 2 gay jokes come in the first couple minutes.)<br/><br/>2/ I saw Heather Graham's name in the credits and thought that exponentially increases the chance of seeing boobies. (Again only sorta right, not sure breastfeeding counts.)<br/><br/>3/ This seems to want to be quotable. (The jury is out, I for one can't think of much that I would regurgitate in social situations.<br/><br/>4/ This one from my wife, ""Bradley Cooper is Ben Affleck hot."" Now I know my wife so sadly I know this is supposed to be a compliment - not sure Cooper would agree.<br/><br/>Now the limited things I can say without giving too much away:<br/><br/>The boys leave for a Buck's party in the days prior to the wedding. Zach Galihhjgajsdfjgbjksbdjhikis (sp?) is the standard ring-in-relo that is almost always in attendance, everyone has met him multiple times but no-one really remembers him.<br/><br/>Quick question, why a buck's party so close to the wedding and why could such an apparently cool guy only have two friends and a relo that would want to go? As a guy I would consider that poor form, any reasonable guy needs a couple days recovery time from a good buck's party.<br/><br/>The jittery bride is told on the phone that the wedding ain't going ahead as planned, then the wavy lines appear (in our minds) and we go into flashback mode.<br/><br/>The Hangover basically starts when three of our four lead characters awake after a ""rough"" night celebrating a bachelor party. In their $4,200 per night villa are the ingredients that over the film provide most of the laughs and help explain just ""what the hell happened last night?""<br/><br/>A Tiger A Chicken A Missing tooth A Baby A Hospital tag A Mattress on roof A Cop car in their hotel bay<br/><br/>All of which are explained fully... aside from the chicken. Seriously, what happened to the chicken? I really hope there is an explanation in the sequel explaining the chicken's existence. Why? Why? Why? Was it to feed the tiger?<br/><br/>Unfortunately, these are the things that keep me awake at night<br/><br/>Anyway it wasn't the hilarious, quotable laff riot I half expected going in, it was a pretty funny 90 minutes with some memorable scenes:<br/><br/>Getting out of a night in prison. Finding a random naked guy in the car boot. Meeting Mike Tyson<br/><br/>Zach Galikjuhkgcvksvdckhvsjikis (sp again?) is suitably random and apparently wasted-without-being-wasted at all times. But not as randomly hilarious as described in other reviews by any stretch.<br/><br/>Bradley ""Affleck"" Cooper is the most rational and realistic of the three, while he is still a w**ker at times he is no more a w**ker than a myriad real-life guys that I have encountered at various Buck's parties and gents events.<br/><br/>And as far as the dentist-guy and his b*tch girlfriend goes, no man should ever be as whipped as he is, and no comeuppance could be drastic enough to teach her a lesson. (I am not being sexist, everyone should have the right to a 50/50 relationship, and if they choose to have a 60/40 or a 70/30 and both parties agree so be it. The chick in this film is a total b*tch and needs a flogging.)<br/><br/>Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. Humorous but by no means hilarious. Will however be deemed an immediate classic by those still too young to have forged their own drunk stories. (God willing their time will come and this won't be as ""far out"".)<br/><br/>If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com"

","Before ""The Hangover"" was released it was the talk of the town. Even its previews were funny. I mean, although most comedy film's previews are funnyor are at least supposed to be funny. This was more than I expected. Talk about ""LOL."" The Hangover was more than ""Laugh Out Loud"" funny. <br/><br/>Even Mike Tyson, The Champ, surprised me with a little laughter in his tiger scene.<br/><br/>The plot of this film held my attention by making me want to see what else happened ""last night?"" <br/><br/>This comedic trio of Bradley Cooper as Phil Wennick, Ed Helms as Stu Price, and Zach Galifianakis as Alan Garner, tickled my funny bone with their hilarious endeavors. Not only is ""The Hangover"" a knee slapper and a belly cruncher, it could actually be a ""Based on a true story"" film.

","""You mind putting on some pants? I feel weird having to ask you twice.""<br/><br/>It has become so rare in this century, to find a genuinely decent and funny comedy. In the crowd of Scary Movie type comedies, Todd Phillips' fresh and hilarious The Hangover stands out as a clear winner for modern comedy.<br/><br/>The plot is simple: four friends travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor party and wake up the next morning with no memory of what happened the previous night, this plus the fact that they don't know where the groom is makes for a roller-coaster ride of hilarity as the remaining three friends try to find him in time for his wedding the next day.<br/><br/>In short, The Hangover is just genuinely funny. It may actually be the funniest movie I've had the pleasure of watching in a long time, so much so that it has become one of my favourite movies. Galifianakis, the ""child with a beard"", effectively makes this movie the brilliantly hilarious trip that it is. His unashamedly idiotic behaviour provides much of the hilarity and it seems as if the movie would be pretty empty without him. But all three leading men have brilliant chemistry together and it's hard to imagine anyone else playing a different role in this movie.<br/><br/>The Hangover is sure to become a cult classic and I don't see it ever getting old. I also really never thought I'd be feeling sorry for Heather Graham's character at the end. So far I've seen this five times and I'll probably watch it a hundred times more.

","I feel like quite a sucker for having bothered to buy and then watch The Hangover. It follows the aftermath of a stag night in Vegas - four friends get drunk, are slipped some drugs and then forget what they did, losing the groom on the way. It struck me that this is ""Dude, Where's My Groom?"" - the characters, all uncharismatic, all unfunny wander around Vegas trying to piece together the night before and find the groom. Think of every cliché concerning Vegas and you will find it here, the writing was not witty, the jokes as such were not especially funny. There was certainly no drama - I could not care about any of these people, definitely a major disappointment and definitely over-rated. There must be better American comedies out there???

I would say this is the best ever comedy movie i have ever watched. It is a real comedy movie with a nice story.

","This film is far better than is deserves to me I think.<br/><br/>I was thinking 'Porkies' rolled up with 'The Real Cancun' or something when I saw the trailers. In reality, this smart comedy is a delight. It's fast-paced, very irreverent and spot on for gross-out-ness.<br/><br/>One minor unsettling thing about it (for me anyway) was the veiled sub-plot involving the bearded brother and his paedophilia. I'm afraid I didn't quite get it and the subject was approached in such a way as to be very disturbing. I don't quite know why but I'd question why anyone would need to include that in this fine romp. I can only assume it is introduced to induce a low-level feeling of anxiety in the viewer that this brother is going to so something so heinous during the film that it will shock ... if that's the aim then I suppose it does take one's mind off some of the visual gags etc that would give the excellent twist in the tail away. Having said that, I did view the 'uncut' R-rated version and maybe this material was cut from the final cinema release? I'm not saying it was wrong to try and unsettle the audience even more or anything, just that it didn't seem to belong there.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this despite thinking I wouldn't"

The three friends now must retrace their steps from their wild night in order to find their lost groom. And what about the tiger in the bathroom? <br/><br/>Comments: Actually not what I expected. I did expect a high paced almost silly comedy from the get go. Surprisingly it started out quite slow with a long and detailed introduction and explanation how they got to Vegas. That almost became boring.<br/><br/>Then it started for real. And it was really funny, but it didn't go off in that pace I expected. But I'm not sure that's a bad thing. Instead it changes pace from moment to moment, really making the audience pay attention. And it really takes off in totally unexpected directions, some quite hilarious.<br/><br/>Surprisingly enough there is a collecting thought behind it that even if doesn't seem so at times directs the heading of the story and neatly ties everything together in the end. Well, everything except the rooster, I guess.<br/><br/>A really good and fitting cast with actors I recognized but couldn't quite place in the leads. They did very well though. It felt like they did have some good chemistry between them, and apparently some of them have made movies before.<br/><br/>I liked this movie. I liked it a lot. It had just the right level and amount of humor. Just the right kind of absurd humor that suit me just right.

","I've paid to see ""The Hangover"" 13 times (my personal record for one title), so until a funnier flick comes along, it's my gold standard for what a modern comedy should be. A lot of folks would call this funny, but not the funniest. I can understand that perspective. And a lot of people who weren't laughing at all were attending weekend screenings I was at. I can only tell those who didn't bust a gut at this Vegas is hell story they should have stayed home and watched reruns of ""Murder, She Wrote"" or whatever crap they find entertaining. To keep seeing a film multiple times is to sometimes get a dream crowd and other days get a group of codgers who are simply at the wrong movie for them! Those Tuesday nights when the theatre was packed were amazing and the collective riotous laughter was louder than any other film I've been to besides ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""This is Spinal Tap"". I can only hope we get another collaboration from Phillips, Helms, Cooper, Galifianakis, Bartha and the rest of this band of lunatics. Best film of 2009!"

I will, however, give kudos to those involved in making this movie.<br/><br/>Primarily, the film works as a result of a brilliant narrative device: we are just as clueless as the characters are about what happened the night before. As the film progresses, we are given one shocking revelation after another, each building to high comedy. The momentum is almost non-stop! <br/><br/>A lot of the humor is also generated from the corky characters and how they react to each shocking development. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis all turn in brilliant performances and stay in character rather than just acting goofy. The fact that they all seem so believable makes the chaos that they face all the more hysterical.<br/><br/>Laughter is valuable to your health and it is hard to produce an effective comedy these days.

","Usually when people talk about hangovers they usually meant about the day after drinking a lot. In this case The Hangover is the most ingenious comedy I've seen in the year. Directed by Todd Phillips, The Hangover contains all kind of comedy and humor existed in this world. It is an hour and a half full of laughs. It is cleverly written, Two days before his wedding, Doug and his three friends drive to Las Vegas for a blow-out bachelor party they'll never forget. The movie follows a fast paced rhythm, a very nice thin for the viewer because you never get tired or bored. It also has some great locations in Las Vegas, in fact you can see two different faces of Vegas, one at night so glamorous and shiny and the other in the desert with amazing landscapes. Another thing you appreciate from the movie is its wonderful soundtrack, the music is so good and every song in it fits to the perfection with every scene in the film. The cast is excellent every actor and actress delivers an excellent and convincing performance specially Zach Galifianakis as Alan, he was so funny and the special appearance from Mike Tyson was great. The Hangover only purpose is to entertain people and I'm sure people will enjoy every minute of it. In conclusion, it is the best comedy of the year."
"fireflame94","6","3","6","11 August 2009"," Had it's moments, but overall unrealistic and uneven
","This movie is just one of many in it's sub-genre of comedy, this one just having been far over-hyped. The Hangover is not the sort of movie that appeals to it's audience with realism, instead deciding to use either very stereotypical characters or unrealistic characters. An example of this would be the school-teacher. He is a teacher who hates the kids he teaches and spends a weekend out drinking with his buddies in Vegas. It would have been more prudent to have him as someone who was unemployed, or just in a profession not working with kids to create a more realistic character.<br/><br/>The movie does however create some laughs in the middle section of the film, where the characters were essentially on a wild-goose chase. These come from shock comedy, such as the naked guy in the boot of the car coming out and beating up all of them. Mike Tyson's cameo was also quite funny.<br/><br/>The movie also had issues with it's pacing, with the beginning and end seeming to drag, particularly at the end at the wedding was far too long and I was very bored.<br/><br/>All in all the movie works if you take it for what it is, a fairly average comedy with some great moments but poor characters and a very, very stereotypical plot."

But at the same time, totally different, and MUCH better than Old School.<br/><br/>Galifianakis is brilliant, and the cameos fit in perfectly. Even the way in which the protagonists piece together the events of the previous night is well woven and not disjointed in any way.

","This is really very funny, provided that you like shock humor, crude humor, situational humor, ridiculous circumstances, etc. I didn't even think the preview I saw looked that funny, so I was surprised when the story got underway and I couldn't stop laughing. The main characters' personalities vary so much that much of the comedy too comes from the quirky character traits they have - and how that causes each of them to react differently the absurd situations they have gotten themselves into. This R-rated comedy is a nice departure from the films of Judd Apatow or the comedies of Will Ferrell or Adam Sandler. I'm not saying I don't like those other guys, but sometimes it seems like those are the main comedy options (along with romantic comedies or family comedies). Well, here's a new, original, hilarious comedy. Loved it!"
"SPaS","8","3","6","2 August 2009"," A one - note comedy... a flawless one.
","Where to begin? Guess I could start with the evolution of raunchy, R - rated yet smart high-concept comedies where three - dimensional key characters must deal with over - blown situations and charicatured characters in modern - day America, learning lessons in life in the end. These include such modern classics as American Pie, There's something about Mary and about a dozen examples by Judd Apatow and co. in the last five years. However, this would be just tooting my own horn, and since most of you have seen those movies, who gives a rat's a$$?<br/><br/>So, here we have the latest inclusion: a comedy about three guys waking up in a terrible hangover in Vegas, only to realize they have lost the groom along with their memory in a barchelor party gone way out of the map, and that they have only about 48 hours to find him and get to the wedding. Directed by Todd Phillips, who also gave us ""Road trip"" (and which I've always considered superior to ""American pie"" for the sake that ""RT"" is just more laid-back).<br/><br/>Unlike for example most of Apatow's comedies, ""The Hangover"" is not ""smarter"" than what the premise lets you in on. You can't break it down to analyze it, because it's just what the one - line description says. I guess the film-makers considered two choices: re-write it and force it into the successful ""Apatow"" mold, or play it out like it is: like an ""eighties"" comedy. They did the latter, and with that, the right choice.<br/><br/>The Hangover's biggest assets are that it's been crafted to the hilt on all distinctive areas: - The characters. When you meet them at first, you go like ""ok, so they are not clear caricatures, but how could these guys ever be friends?"". But, along the movie, you grow into accepting them, with their pros and cons. You get to recognize their roles and how they ""complete a full circle"" without it being too obvious from the get-go. Huge plus.<br/><br/><ul><li>The dialogue. Well, the usual Kevin Smith/Judd Apatow - stuff. Kind of like ""Friends"" but with F - words and pop culture references. Good stuff, though.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Plot. The whole thing plays out like a good mystery and gives a 100 minutes of laughs without missing one beat, losing pace or losing focus (basically this is what ""Dude, where's my car"", SHOULD have been). Let's just repeat the thing that really struck me in ""The Hangover"": there are no lulls. This, I consider a defining strength: when one clue has been solved, it moves straight into the next one. The ""ok...what now?"" - bits have been surgically removed. Also, you will NOT check your watch when the film moves from the second act to the third. Now THIS is rare.</li></ul><br/><br/>Gotta hand it also to Phillips (whose best movie so far) and to the cast - along with castING. Bold having this many new names in key roles.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 stars. Hope they won't ruin this with the already green-lit sequel."

","I've seen The Hangover twice, within a week, which is a first to me especially with high ticket prices these days.

On both occasions that I've seen this, the whole audience was LOLing for the majority of the film. I literally cried laughing at the end of the film and most people did as well. What made this film so enjoyable and hilarious? For me, it was the chemistry of the actors, real life scenarios and troubles encountered with booze and drugs, and the thought of good friends partying in fabulous Las Vegas. This is a comedy you can watch over and over and still get the same reaction every time. Simply genius!"
"Gordon-11","Null","3","6","30 July 2009"," The funniest Vegas film I have ever seen
","The Hangover is about a group of 4 guys going to Las Vegas for a bachelor party just two days before the wedding.<br/><br/>Though bachelor party films are so overdone, The Hangover puts a fresh spin on the whole concept. The delivery of the plot is refreshing, I like the way they have to find out what happened the night before as they wake up from their eventful night. It's so refreshing to see them trying to figure out what they did, and to see the shock of what they really did! The jokes are phenomenally funny, it's out of the world. Basically the film is unbelievably funny, you have to see it to believe it."
"Sirus_the_Virus","10","3","6","29 July 2009"," Maybe the funniest ever! What awesome characters!
","The Hangover is the story of four guys. Phil (the always good Bradley Cooper)is a married teacher that hates his life. Stu (the surprisingly good Ed Helms from The Office )is a dentist, who are usually prone to suicide. Stu should be. He has a mean cheating slut for a girlfriend. And Allen (Zach Galifianakis)who's sister is getting married.These three guys take their best friend Doug (the always good Justin Bartha)to Vegas for the Bachaelor Party.The next morning they wake up and find that their room is trashed, there's a tiger in the bedroom, and there's a baby in the closet. and that the groom is missing. The three guys had some night. They stole a police car and Mike Tyson's tiger. Tyson gives the best cameo of the year. Stu actually married a stripper(Heather Graham from Bowfinger)and Allen accidentally slipped roofie into their drinks.The date rape drug. Why's it called roofie if you always end up on the floor? That's just a joke from the movie. The Hangover has everything you'd want in a comedy. It is my second favorite film of the year. Every single character in the film is funny.Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifanakis should be in more films. I can't wait for the sequel in 2011. This movie deserves to be on the top 250 because it's on mine. It's probably on my top ten. The Hangover is the comedy the world needs and will love."

It is funny, i promise you that.Out of all the comedies i have seen in my seventeen years of life,that was by far the funniest for sure.

","I had a feeling about this movie, from watching the trailers, and let me say, it's THE most hilarious movie I have ever seen. It's escapism at its best. Who wouldn't want to roll into a movie theater, be thoroughly entertained for 100 minutes and literally laugh your *ss off so many times you come out feeling like you've done two hours of crunches at the gym the next day? It's rude. It's vulgar. It's raunchy. It's so, SO politically incorrect. And it doesn't apologize for any of it, which I LIKE. There are many grains of truth in it's absurdity, which really is what makes it so funny. The cast clicks and the story line, while ridiculous, is engaging. I absolutely loved it. I'd go see it again, and it would be just as funny the 2nd time.<br/><br/>For those who hated it, to each his own. That's why some of us like sushi and some can't stand it. C'est la vie."

The guys wake up one morning in Las Vegas and find a hen, a tiger and a six-months-year-old baby in their hotel suite. But one of the pals is missing.<br/><br/>The rest is even more crazy. This is a performance in taste-lacking, but it's very funny and the tempo is high. The movie is certainly totally of this world, but 1,5 half hour of shallow plain entertainment.<br/><br/>Las Vegas the myth, is once again the main character here.

"chapsmack","8","3","6","15 July 2009"," Adult fun
","A refreshing change in the story line and a slick cast of characters makes The Hangover a must-see movie. The adult fun bordering on the likes of Borat makes the movie kind of more a guy movie than a chic movie. Not that chicks can't dig it, but it does have some over the top scenes which may cause severe embarrassment for some. The dialogs were quite catchy, the acting I thought was quite quite well, and Galifianakis, someone I never knew before this movie came into being, is certainly a treat to watch. I would rate it to be less funny than Superbad but somewhat in par with Wedding Crashers. Whatever the case a movie you will want to see again. 8/10"

This leads to so many weird twists and turns that listing them here doesn't do them justice. Let's just say a certain boxer is involved as well as a tiger, a baby, and an accidental marriage of one of the groomsmen.

"webmaster-3017","9","3","6","30 June 2009"," HK Neo Reviews: The Hangover
","Tagline: Most probably the funniest movie of the year <br/><br/>Review by Neo: It's been a long time coming, since I have encountered a genuine comedy that actually makes you laugh out loud at the cinemas. It is also been a while, since I can recall a Hollywood movie that actually got me laughing from start to finish. Nice shock and an excitement movie to finish off a hangover weekend on a Sunday Night. The trio (or foursome if you must include the one on the roof for the majority of the flick) performs in an almost faultless manner. All the more, the three cannot be more different, one is with serial player looks, one is just a dentist and the other is a brother in law who is just plain fat. So much so that the movie didn't seem like a movie, as the characters are simple and easy to relate to, as the audience goes along the ride with them, rather than simply sit and watch.<br/><br/>The movie goes like this: 4 guys go on a bachelor party two days just before the wedding. Basically the destination is Las Vegas and before you know it, they are on a rooftop not knowing that the drink they are about to cheers is actually drugged. And so, they woke up in the villa of Caesar hotel, with the following items, a baby in the wardrobe, a tiger in the toilet (yes, literally), a stripper as a wife and the most of all, they lost the groom. So begins the journey of the three who are totally wasted and do not remember a thing, as they stumble here and there to the line of finding a friend.<br/><br/>Usually flicks like these ones, the best jokes are already in the trailer, but somehow, Hangover, does not contain just a couple of laughs, but rather enough laughs to make your stomach burst. The fat guy (played by (Zach Galifianakis) is just so down to earth that it is funny and one of the best lines is certain the Caesar one. Basically he asks ""so have Caesar actually lived in this palace?"" Sure, it is a damn stupid question, but the audience can so feel that he is serious about it, that make it more funny than it should be. The guy with player looks (played by the guy Bradley Cooper, who got Scarlett Johansson on her knees in He is Just Not That in You) is cool and the way he interacts with others is just seamlessly fun to watch. Likewise, the film cannot be complete without the dentist (Ed Helms). The moment his tooth came out and married a stripper, he is just a stand down funny guy to endure.<br/><br/>You must praise the director (Todd Phillips) for the perfect comic timing; a film like this can so easily go the wrong track and go the route down the path of films like Hot Chick, but luckily the fun is more on the scale of American Pie or Kumar Castle flick. His focus on the characters and allows them to act and interact and play off each other as though they are really friends is really a joy to watch. Another examples, is the enjoyable cameo appearance by Heather Graham, who plays the stripper who married the dentist. Her line: ""That is so Doug!"" works even though she only just met them the night before. Now that's a sign of cinema magic.<br/><br/>All in all, Hangover is a joy to watch, a rare piece of cinematic gem, adding to the mixture of brilliant chemistry between the co-stars, the liveliness of nightlife in Vegas and evolution of down to earth comedy. It is a shame that not everyone will relates to the characters, but somehow, I got a feeling that most of good mates and I included embracing it. Coming off a trip from the wine district of Hunter Valley where me and my mates, tasted almost all the wines within the 9 wineries along the way. Hangover is really and is most probably the best comedy of 2009 and if you go in the cinemas with a relaxed mindset, I am sure that it will make you smile a little, laugh a little and enjoy life a little more  (Neo 2009) <br/><br/>I rate it 9/10<br/><br/><ul><li>www.thehkneo.com</li></ul>"
"lghnichols","9","3","6","26 June 2009"," HANG it on your Shelf....
","the HANGOVER... One Movie that lives up to it's expectations. Staring an unfamiliar cast to the comedy genre, and working on the backdrop of (do-dont-tell) Las Vegas, this combination of booze and 'what to do with your spare time' is a masterpiece of the seriously falling comedy genre.<br/><br/>Zach Galifianakis stands as the greatest asset to the films success, a star willing to do whatever it takes for a laugh, and 'WILLING' to carry a baby on set, playing a man who's known for a dangerously 'dumb' mind is classic. <br/><br/>Constructed of colorful and often gut-aching characters, ( Mr Chow: 'Watch out for him' ), the progress of the HANGOVER is well structured and plays the viewer perfectly as to what might happen next. Justin Bartha as Ed stands as the 'nerd in us all' and relates to so many men who want to get out and live their life.<br/><br/>And Bradley Cooper as Phil; the one who screws it all up.. Losing his best friend Stu is funny enough, but when he actually finds where the groom-to-be really is, plays for an even funnier ending.<br/><br/>Compiled to have you laughing and crying, the flow kills in its comedy-fashion and although the film does feature a 'severe' array of frequent language, its done so in a passive matter.<br/><br/>Although the setback is found in legend Mike Tyson, starring as himself in a 'relaxed' and potentially skittish manner. Personally, the tiger touch was hilarious, but Mike Tyson really didn't do anything.<br/><br/>Best scene however had to be the playback where Mike Tyson shows the boys his video camera from the previous night, catching his tiger being kidnapped and sexually assaulted by the drugged, drunk and ill'mannered boysome-foursome.<br/><br/>The HANGOVER is a great film... funny, crazy... and a potential party pleaser..<br/><br/>9* / 10*"

","This is the funniest film I have ever seen genuinely, I cannot remember laughing so so much while watching a movie. OK most comedies advertise themselves as the funniest film ever but this can definitely take that title, I don't really go to the cinema very often because no movies have really taken my fancy that much and I also have a busy family life so I entered the theater expecting a few funny moments in the movie but once they started coming they didn't stop. I also didn't know who any of the actors were, a couple of them I recognized but in general didn't ""know"" them, OK the film would suit anyone with a sense of humor but would bring out the sense of humor in someone who does not normally show it I will be buying this on DVD as soon as it is out got to be seen to be believed."
"Otoboke","7","3","6","25 June 2009"," The best thing is that you won't wake up the next day and have forgotten all about it.
","""We all do dumb s*** when we're f***ed up"" concedes a rather sombre Mike Tyson when reviewing security footage of four random drunkards stealing his tiger and urinating in his pool—and it's at this moment, around two-thirds of the way into the bizarre but infectiously humorous trip that is The Hangover that everything shifts into place. Maybe it's something to do with the fact that if Tyson can sit back and laugh at the absurdities and downright obnoxiously reckless abandon that he witnesses when brought into contact with those guys, then we can too. I seriously doubt it, but the entire expedition that is The Hangover is equally as—if not more-so—dubious than seeing a bearded guy get knocked out by the heavyweight boxer to the tune of Phil Collins' In The Air Tonight, but this in no way makes the feature any less entertaining or downright hilarious. In fact, that's exactly what makes it the romp that it is; it's silly, indulgent and somewhat charred like a barbequed steak mixed with some tough liquor, but with a fine ensemble of tangible characters and a pace that keeps things readily engaging and entertaining, The Hangover is fun, fun, fun—and the best thing is that you won't wake up the next day and have forgotten all about it.<br/><br/>Taking place over the course of two days and nights as three best friends attempt to put the jigsaw pieces of their wild night out in Vegas together in order to find their missing friend, The Hangover is a deliciously simple albeit compelling story. Striking right at the heart of modern western society and its tendency to do just as these guys do every now and again, the majority of Todd Phillips' feature here is steeped in infectious pathos that plays into that ever-so tried-and-true method of combining observational humour with broad, situation farce. The result is a story that flows excellently from act to act, keeps the jokes and gags steady throughout whilst developing characters and throwing them around often enough to keep the viewer laughing, intrigued and laughing some more. To be fair, there is a certain lack of substance to the overall arc of the adventure penned here by Lucas and Moore (something that is evident in a large portion of their previous works to date) that inevitably stops the feature from ever becoming more than a light-hearted buddy-comedy, but you probably won't notice thanks to lack of pauses in laughter provoked by the script or the actors.<br/><br/>At its heart however, despite the robustly imaginative and complex intertwining of the central characters' journey, it is the characters themselves that make the majority of this hangover such a joy to watch. While the movie ostensibly revolves around four friends, much of the screen time is given to just three of those who share a wonderful chemistry that always feels flesh, edgy and natural. Through the performances of Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper and Zach Galifianakis (who gets much of the movie's laughs as the awkward and weird bearded guy with a baby), the buddy/road-trip story that serves as the centre-piece for all their drunken antics, missing teeth, stolen babies and stun guns to revolve around really hammers home the key narrative that propels things forward and retains the script's distinctly Y-chromosome-centric nature. Sure, there's plenty of material here that the ladies of the audience will be able to latch onto, but there's no denying the overtly boyish tendencies that rule supreme here that will be sure to give male audiences with a thirst for profane, crude comedy the most satisfaction. Sharp dialogue and genuinely exciting plotting makes this one of this year's most remarkable and hilarious comedies.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"

","Don't be taken by a fool. This isn't just another comedy about groomsmen and their night before a wedding. It's a lot more. Guaranteed laughs from the beginning until the end, and a lot of fun to.<br/><br/>'The Hangover', is an excellent example and proof of a comedy, that even being very simple, can become so big. The leading cast of actors searching for their lost friend in a Vegas adventure is outrageous. Bradley Cooper gives us the smoothness, Galifiankis, the incoherent genius (because of his dumb side colliding with his mathematical characteristics) and Helms for his brains. These three are the key to an excellent ride, fulfilled with the most scandalous episodes, like the one with Mike Tyson, the fashioned Chinese, or even the Casino scene. Also, other unrevealed and unexplained gags like Alan's character, that isn't allowed to approach a school from a hundred feet or that one time he found a baby in coffee shop, turn the Vegas trip even more funny.<br/><br/>I've never seen a comedy like this: people, were still laughing at the end of the movie and out of the cinema. Possibly, this is one of the greatest comedies which I have ever seen in my entire life and already entered in one of my favorites. Get to see it if you can...it's GLORIOUS - 8/10."

","After the self-centered yee-haw ride of 2000-2008, America wakes up with a massive hangover, looming doubt about the future, and some confusion about what has just happened. Gambling debts? Whoring? Destroying stuff you can't pay for? Getting mixed up with the wrong people? Stealing? Yup, that's what happens when the American middle class mixes the right amount of tradition and cheap oil-- err, I mean, whiskey and chemicals, as do the characters in this film.<br/><br/>Four guys-- a nerd, his brother (the groom), a teacher and a dentist-- go to Vegas for a bachelor party. Three wake up to find the groom missing. He has been replaced with a tiger and a chicken. Quest/hilarity ensue. The film's main theme might well be that when the social order-- here, marriage-- is followed out of mere obedience to tradition, it is sterile. The film's ending tries to give that order some kind of organic counterpart--the party, and the wedding music-- and largely succeeds.<br/><br/>Fun that's smart, crude and frequently oddly touching. One of the better recent comedies and a fairly new entry in its genre. Take a boy/girl to this one. And, yes, ladies, this *is* what happens at bachelor parties. At least the ones we dream about."

","Todd Phillips, who has been a director who really misses his mark (with the exception of Old School) has landed his footing among comedic filmmakers. The Hangover is my favorite comedy of the year so far and is sure to become a cult classic among college students and young people.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Doug (Justin Bartha), a middle aged man who goes on a bachelor night with his best friends, Stu (Ed Helms, ""Andy"" from 'The Office'), Phil (Bradley Cooper), and his fiancée's strange brother Alan (breakthrough performer Zach Galifianakis). After a night of heavy drinking and waking up to a missing Doug, the three amigos venture out to find clues to their missing comrade. <br/><br/>The comedy here is incredible with the raunchy humor that hits and sticks every time. The script keeps a great pace and keeps you laughing the whole time. Helms and Galifianakis hit hugely in this film and steal the show every time. The Hangover never loses sight of its objective and remembers its target audience. Through the laughs we are immensely stuck on these four guys and their quest to find fallen mate.

","Unrememberable, that is what Hangovers are; Unrememberable, through beers and bars. My apologies to Nat King Cole! We have all had them, we can't stand them, but is a part of ""paying the piper"" for the few vivacious hours of liquid festive madness from the previous night! Hangovers!!! I think Hollywood was overdue in providing us a comedic film about them! Maybe they got hung up with the premise! But finally they gave it to us and they did not barf it up with the winning comedy ""The Hangover"". Let me throw you up the plot of this gem: Three groomsmen and their about-to-be-wed buddy go to Las Vegas for a stirring bachelor party. Phil is the cocky ringleader of this Vegasfest and also the best friend of the groomie Doug. Stu is the neurotic Dentist buddy who gives his possessive girlfriend muela by lying about where the boys are going for the bachelor festivities. Alan is Doug's soon-to-be brother-in-law who's probably gone over the hangover threshold zillions of times in his life thereby explaining his outlandish behavior. So these fearsome foursomes drink it up in Sin City and before you know it- Hangover Helper gets a service call! They wake up the morning after with chaos colliding in their not-so-little Caesars Palace suite- A tiger in the bathroom, a stolen police car, a baby in the closet, a hanging mattress, a broken tooth, and a missing Doug. Obviously, their alcohol-induced memory banks are at zilch so it is oblivious to Phil, Stu, and Alan how this happened. So consequently, they need to retrace last night's itinerary of events to find the lost Doug. I will not seltzer you up (whatever that means) with more details, so you just gotta hang on tight & witness this zany mayhem that is ""The Hangover"". Director Todd Phillips does phil up this comedic adventure Vegas ride with side-splitting, off-beat material that makes you crave for a longer Hangover running time! Bradley Cooper as Phil had the adequate charismatic pizazz in portraying him. Zach Galifianakis was very Belushish as the deranged Alan. Justin Bartha as Doug was not a barfa of laughs in his supporting role, but walked this acting aisle admirably. But my favorite thespian performance here was that of Ed Helms as Stu; Helms stewed it up just right with a perfect blend of comedic acting ingredients. So the remedy for your cinematic blues is to catch ""The Hangover"" before it gets out of your must-see system. ***** Excellent"

I don't think it's just a frat boy comedy because it has much better jokes...it's not just beer, breasts and sex everywhere. The story has a great plot line, and the set up is awesome. I usually try to find plot holes in movies and I couldn't find anything obvious in this one. Mr. Chow is hilarious, I'm Asian, and he was so stereotypically awful that I couldn't help but laugh, especially cause I would only see him naked even though he shows up in clothes later.

With each passing scene the film gets funnier and funnier.<br/><br/>The Hangover will make you laugh and it doesn't let up on the comedy. If you want to have a great laugh, this is the film to watch. It is easily the funniest film of the year."

","Great movie about 4 guys going to Vegas for a bachelor party, they wake up the next morning missing a friend who is going to marry very soon. They are going to look for him. This will not go so simply because they have forgotten everything, so they try to remember by going to all the places en people they have seen the night before. I just saw it about 6 hours ago, in Almere(The Netherlands). It's very hilarious, with some very (and when I say very I mean VERY, VERY) random things in it. Some jokes are predictable, but that is not annoying, sometimes it even makes it better. This is a great movie for all guys out there, and for some even recognizable."

","My husband talked me into this one. Definitely not a chick flick. The female characters are either stripper/call girls or bitches. Even from a story standpoint it's weak. If you're going to have boys night out or in this case the morning after boys not out, let's see a little more of what happened. Lots of chatting of how wild and crazy they got, but I was drawn in by it. Unfortunately, after being enticed, a big no show. Typical of men, all talk and no go. What happened, they ran over budget so all the best scenes they just blab about and cover up with a series of digital pictures. If boys will be boy, at least go for it and show it. It was like they went to one scene to the next, talked about how crazy a segment was, realize what happened and then move on without showing it. With the exception of two moments, it was mostly talk and no show. Sorry BOYS, next time, if you're going to get your audience excited, at least give US something to talk about after wards. And FYI, even my husband was disappointed he didn't get to experience the night with the boys. The pictorial didn't cut it."

","The Hangover is a bumpy, raucous, raunchy road trip.<br/><br/>It's also pretty forgettable.<br/><br/>A couple of Bufferins and you'll be ready for the next comedy. Why do movies about overindulgence have to be overindulgent? I get a kick in the comic solar plexus from reviewers who call The Hangover and its ilk, ""instant classics."" They must have seen only one or two movies in their meager critical careers. They certainly don't know what ""classic"" is, and they don't seem to know comedy.

The only mildly amusing line was Jeffery Tambors comment about what goes on in Vegas, stays in Vegas at the beginning.<br/><br/>Predictable line up of Groom, alpha male, hen pecked nerd and fat beardy loser take the Father-in-Laws prized vintage Mercedes (uh-oh!) to Vegas for the stag night and after a booze and drug fuelled rampage(which you don't see) try to piece together what happened in an attempt to find the missing groom.<br/><br/>Clues are provided so easily that it makes Scooby Doo look like a major forensic investigation. Along the way there is an encounter with a camp Asian gangster (yawn!), a tiger in the bathroom that's acted out in way that suggests it's an everyday occurrence, a deus ex-machina scene where the beardy fat loser is now some kind of Rainman at Blackjack followed by a ""oh I remember where we put him"" ending so lame it's almost in a wheelchair.<br/><br/>Worst of all Mike Tyson is roped in as the Tigers owner in a scene that goes nowhere.

","I am a little surprised that this movie has averaged such high reviews. It seems to be universally well reviewed on the web and many people I know that have seen it have highly recommended it. This may be the main reason why I was so disappointed, but overall I thought it was quite an average road-trip-gone-wrong type of movie and would have rated it as I have regardless. I certainly didn't experience the laugh-a-minute entertainment that others have mentioned. A faint chuckle here and there, but that's about it.<br/><br/>Now I don't mind the odd far-fetched ""silly"" movie so I'm not a prude when it comes to this type of genre. The premise of the movie had potential, but the execution just didn't quite cut it for me. For starters, the acting was mediocre. ""That was bad acting"" came to mind in several scenes. Some of the situations were a little over-the-top, juvenile, and lacking in comedy. The cops with the tasers is just one of many examples. If you're into ""kicked in the nuts"" kind of humor, then you may find this really funny, but only barely made me grin.<br/><br/>Not the worst comedy I've seen and overall wasn't a totally unenjoyable experience, but certainly (for me) not worthy of the hype it is receiving."
"limiz87","4","3","7","18 August 2009"," Great idea, bad execution
","Firstly, I must admit I saw this movie with high expectations - everybody kept saying how funny this movie is. So I was prepared to laugh for 90 minutes. But now I'm very disappointed.<br/><br/>I liked the idea. 4 men go to Las Vegas for a crazy night and end up losing the groom. They can't remember anything and have to put the puzzle back together and find the groom before the wedding. Sounds funny already, right? But it wasn't funny. Okay, there were a few laughs and overall it was an entertaining movie, but absolutely nothing special.<br/><br/>The movie had so many story lines that could have made it very funny. First, there was this baby and they had no idea whose was it. But the baby was there for 15 min and nothing funny happened. The tiger - also nothing exciting (what was the point of Mike Tyson??) Phil being in the hospital - they said that the pictures would explain it, but I'm sorry, I didn't get it. Stu lost his tooth and the reason was mentioned once. I didn't like the place where they finally found Doug - who was red now because he had spent 2 nights on the roof - he could have easily saved himself from there just by screaming. They never gave us a timeline of the events - how and when everything exactly happened. It would have been nice to see everything - maybe as flashbacks or fast forward in the end of the movie. PS How did the chicken get there? <br/><br/>The characters were too stereotypical - Alan as this crazy guy who never had had friends before; Phil as the guy who only wanted to party; Stu as this man who was terrorized by his girlfriend and finally starts dating a stripper and Doug.. I'm sorry, but Doug was so boring and unmemorable that there's nothing to say about him.<br/><br/>This movie tried to be everything and it failed."

","Okay, it's about a stag night that goes wrong, four thirtysomething lads are heading out to the city of sin, Las Vegas - when they awake the next morning things have gone badly wrong but they can't remember any of it and have to retrace their steps.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it enough but it didn't quite hit the spot, somehow I felt Judd Apatow (Knocked Up, 40 Years Old Virgin, Forgetting Sarah Marshall) would have made it work better. It has the flavour of Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but we don't quite get time to know the characters and the humour is a bit broad, a bit obvious in that it's designed to evoke the audience sympathies. Ooh, one of their friends is a bit weird with a horrid beard and lets his pants hang down of his backside! He's not allowed to be near schools it seems! What a character! Yawn. None of the actors are really comic actors. I didn't quite warm to them. <br/><br/>Towards the end of the film it loses touch with any semblance of reality, unlike 'kids'' movies like Risky Business or Ferris Bueller, where you had your heart in your mouth towards the finale.<br/><br/>What it did have in common with Apatow's films is the vein of misogyny he gets accused of; all of the women are shrews bar the happy hooker in Vegas played inevitably by Heather Graham.<br/><br/>Great soundtrack, Vegas looks terrific but not a hugely endearing film."

Some of the fun things we are seeing later aren't explained to satisfaction. How they end up as they are going to is explained deus-ex-machina-style...quite lame, sadly. Some fun stuff, some childish scary-movie-type of jokes.<br/><br/>While this is an entertaining flick I don't understand how it wound up on #130. Better than Snatch, Big Lebowski et al? No way!

","I noticed that this movie was lingering in the Top 250 movies, so I decided to take a look. The film is very much along the lines of a Farrelly brothers movie and follows a Bachelor party in Las Vegas. Three of the four middle aged guys wake up and have no recall what happened the night before. They have lost the groom and they need to try to piece together what happened during the previous night. The humour in the movie is very base, but the story does zip along. I found a couple of the visual jokes very funny and it was very light-hearted throughout. I probably will not remember a thing about it in a few months, but it was a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. It seems the director Todd Phillips will provide competition for the Farrelly's in the future."

","After a wild bachelor party, 3 friends wake up in a destroyed room and discover that their friend, the groom, is missing. Now they must re-trace their steps from the night that they can't remember in order to get him back to the wedding the next day.<br/><br/>This premise is just an excuse for some wild and random comedic scenarios, such as having a tiger be in your bathroom when you wake up. The joy of watching this film is seeing just how many crazy things come next, all of which the characters have no memory of. What makes The Hangover work so well, is not just those random comedic scenarios, but the cast that blended so well together. Specifically Zach Galifianakis, whom has been the audience favourite.<br/><br/>As the film progresses, the characters find themselves getting into some serious situations due to their antics the night before. I want say what happens, as each one if funny and should be watched with surprise. It easy to say that this film will not bore you. It does have a particular comedic style though and you can judge yourself if you'll be into it or not from the trailer. <br/><br/>Todd Phillips, of Oldschool fame, has his funniest movie here. Both Road Trip and Oldschool were good, yet were missing something that made me really love it. The Hangover has this something. It's not a teen comedy (road trip) nor is it a star powered film (old school). It uses familiar faces that make you go ""I've seen him before"" but never do these actors overshadow the film. Had it of been a bigger name cast it wouldn't have worked so well.<br/><br/>The three friends are played by Ed Helms, the uptight dentist, Bradley Cooper, the suave smooth talker, and Zach Galifianakis, the odd brother in law. The groom is played by Justin Bartha, the National Treasure sidekick. It's easy to say the Galifianakis steals the show. It's obvious he will garner more roles from this, I just hope he doesn't get pigeon-holed into this style. He reminds me of Chi McBride and I want him to branch out before it's too late (Michael Cera). Helms and Cooper also hold up nicely, I'm familiar with Helms from The Office and Daily Show fame and Cooper from previous films has always been likable. Bartha isn't in the film that much, since most of it is them looking for the guy.<br/><br/>The Hangover also doesn't suffer from the one thing that seems to kill so many comedies. Over exposed trailer. Yes we've all seen the Mike Tyson bit, but the film has so many random bits of comedy that you will enjoy yourself throughout the running time. If the film does fault, it's with the character of Mr. Chow. I like Ken Jeong, but here he plays the character way over the top and it becomes distracting. Heather Graham makes an appearance as well and as she does with almost every role she takes on, you see her boobies. Well, one boob.<br/><br/>The film is funny, I was entertained, and I expect to see good things from Galifianakis. It's vulgar and obscene and don't expect to see much heart near the end or a good message, like Apatow films do. While it does have that one scene in which one character stands up for himself, it doesn't try to throw any real messages out the audience.<br/><br/>Make sure you stay for the first bit of the credits, as the laughs don't stop."
"socrates99","6","5","15","8 June 2009"," Probably the biggest disappointment this year
","I must have read a half-dozen reviews of this movie before seeing it. My wife and I were in need of a few good laughs but instead we struggled for every one. I frankly can't imagine a more damning criticism. My expectations had been wildly off the mark. The players were pleasant enough but not particularly engaging or worth as much time as given to them here. Allen, though over-the-top, was my favorite as the bearded somewhat sappy goof-ball. He was fun to listen to and watch, for a while. But the storyline was not very impressive and seemed to have been written by someone in high school. It just tries way too hard to be cute. Probably one of its better points is it didn't denigrate or belittle any particular ethnic group. To the contrary, one of its obvious intentions is a strangely low-key and stealth attempt to put in a good word for Jews as, I guess, fairly ordinary, fun-loving people. It did take a shot at gays, however, and Mike Tyson, probably without realizing it, is made to mimic a fairly recent European commercial where an ape plays the drums to a familiar song whose title I can't remember. If I were the producers I'd pray Mike doesn't find out about that!"
"Westcoastal","5","4","11","30 December 2009"," Ridiculously Overrated
","I found reading the reviews of this movie more entertaining than the movie itself. Yeah, there are some funny moments, but for the most part it just over-promises and under-delivers. There are so many elements to the story that go too far over the top, but don't have enough absurdity or humour to make it work. There are plenty of comedies that are more outrageous than this one, but they pull it off because they have the comic delivery to make us laugh enough that we just don't care. In the case of The Hangover, the delivery is just not funny, witty or foolish enough to make any of the major comic devices work. As a result, most of the content just seems gratuitous and annoying, and falls really flat.<br/><br/>The Hangover is watchable enough, and you will laugh a couple of times, but don't let the over-the-top reviews fool you. It's just not that great. Unoriginal, and stupid in a bad way.<br/><br/>One last thing. PLEASE, people, stop comparing this to Wedding Crashers. It's not anywhere near as funny or as well executed.

All that is fun flashing lights, but it's the chemistry of the three that makes this movie. Zach Galifianakis' breakout performance is hilarious. But it means nothing if Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms wasn't there. Bradley is a great leading man, and Ed is able to balance out Zach.<br/><br/>Director Todd Phillips really had the group humming.

","While not entirely awful (I did laugh 5 times), this comedy is more likely to appeal to young teenagers. The best comedies are those where realistic things happen.

The 'black Doug' was telegraphed too. The saving grace was the dental guy, who was the only character that developed through the film and came out the other side with something about him. The short fat guy was just irritating and entirely not funny. The police station scene was amusing. This film is HUGELY overrated and I certainly won't be bothering with part 2.

","This will probably be deleted because I am going to insult a lot of people. Anyone who thinks that this movie is at all funny is either (a) a kid who doesn't know how to think or (b) a moron. The jokes are either just not funny, reused from other movies, or completely inappropriate. The stuff with the tiger is directly ripped off from Tommy Boy, Zach Galifiniakis is not funny, Bradley Cooper is a douche-bag, and anyone who thinks a baby making perverse hand gestures is funny just needs to be shot. Seriously. The world is better off without you. This is quite possibly the worst movie ever made, but because our world is full off mindless losers who don't know how to think for themselves the studio convinced you that it is funny.

"itamarscomix","7","2","4","2 May 2012"," A real comedy
","Just when I was starting to think I lost my sense of humor, along came The Hangover. I've been getting an uneasy feeling over the last decade that comedy is a dead genre; the ones that achieve any kind of critical acclaim are either mixed genre and dramedies, like Little Miss Sunshine or Juno; and I've enjoyed some absurdist films like the ones of Wes Anderson; but strict comedies have been hijacked by the likes of Adam Sandler, Will Farrell and - horror of horrors - Friedberg and Seltzer. These are crude comedies that rely on gross-out humor and very cheap laughs, while dismissing everything else that makes a movie watchable. Not since the late 90's have I truly enjoyed a comedy purely for the laughs. Was something wrong with me? The Hangover was a big surprise - at first glance it looked a lot like those gross-out comedies that are everywhere to be found. Indeed, Todd Phillips doesn't shy away from crude sexual and physical humor - which can be seen as early as his forgettable debut, Road Trip. But The Hangover has some other things that Road Trip didn't - good pacing, solid characters with interesting interactions, and genuinely funny moments. The humor is still mostly physical, but the story manages to grab the viewer's attention, and the far-out jokes fit right in, rather than being tacked on. It's a rare species these days - a strict comedy, which is truly funny and truly entertaining. I don't think I saw a pure comedy this funny since 1999's Office Space.<br/><br/>The Hangover isn't a masterpiece, of course - it's a formula movie, and it embraces that formula whole heartedly. The characters are all familiar stereotypes, but they're written well enough and their interactions interesting enough that they feel real and compelling. In the same way, the editing, cinematography, music etc. are solid and built on well-founded and well-tested formulae that keep the viewer involved without distracting, the style never taking over the substance. It's a classic comedy, with no artistic pretenses but with plenty of laughs, comparable with John Landis at his best, and it's a real joy to see a movie like this can still be made today."

It goes without saying that the writing takes the crowning glory. Very smart, quite clever, intelligent and definitely out-of-box thinking translated into pen and paper. <br/><br/>The four lead characters are so distinctly separate that everyone carves a niche in your head. Bradley ""Phil"" Cooper, the super-confident hulk obviously gets icing on the cake with the length of the screen time. Ed ""Stu"" Helms leaves an impression on how a typical alpha-male transforms into a prey to the BDSM acts of the oppressor, to the point its become an acquired taste. Zach ""Alan"" Galifianakis is a lovable character whom you would love to hate, but later unveils his hidden talent. Justin ""Doug"" Bartha, the bachelor who makes everybody do a chicken-run is found only in the beginning and in the end. Heather Graham has a limited screen time and she doesn't miss the opportunity to pop-out her ""hidden"" talent. Jeffrey Tambor as the would-be father-in-law leaves an impression. And yes Mike Tyson is a bonus in the movie.<br/><br/>The good thing about the screenplay is the ""blacks out portions"" of the bachelors party which builds up the suspense quite effectively.

It is one of those films that seem worthless but, instantaneously, from the first scene becomes a destined classic comedy that takes up your number one spot on your top 5 comedy list. It is a film with a stupid plot that quickly changes into a film with, matter of fact, unbelievable twists and action, not to mention the slick, hilarious, continuous sick stunts and jokes. The film was probably the most deserving of its award at the Oscars for best comedy or musical because with a movie like this, it can definitely go wrong, in a good way. One extra award should have been given out for Zach Galifianakis for his priceless role as Alan Garner (P.S I am definitely not exaggerating when I say that he should have won an Oscar. Damn you Oscars!!!!!) Todd Phillips is my new director to look at out for and he, obviously, has some great films under his title. Here I come Road Trip! A director like him is very rare nowadays because he is someone who never hides or thinks something is inappropriate for the eyes. He is one of a kind. His camera angles are impeccable. The acting cast did a brilliant job of making this riot come to life and the four main actors were perfect for their roles. I haven't seen much of Bradley Cooper on film, with the exception of He's Just Not That In To You (which he acted great in), but after watching him in The Hangover I have to say that this man has some great talent to show-off. He left a great impression on me and I have to get The a-Team just for him. Bradley Cooper is playing Phil Wenneck, a school teacher who has the ""same maturity level as his students when he is with his pals"", is one of the unlucky friend that goes to Vegas for the (worst) two days of his life. Ed Helms is, surprisingly, quite funny for a geeky dentist that can get pretty wild at parties, especially when he is drunk, and he looks tougher than he actually is. He is another unfortunate soul. Ed Helms has a great transformation from a dentist who is under the rule of his soon-to-be fiancée to a newly made man. In real life Ed Helms is quite cool and with playing a dentist with no balls, he is someone to look out for. Justin Bartha (National Treasure I and II) is Doug Billings, a soon-to-be husband who is ready for the time of his life, too bad he didn't see this whole thing coming. Justin Bartha has changed a lot from the last time we saw him in National Treasure. He still felt a little out of his place. The Main Star of the show is Zach Galifianakis who plays the hilarious Alan Garner, the brother in law of Doug Phillips, and who has an addiction for trusting druggies. The whole sh*toad of trouble starts when he puts Roofies into each glass of wine that he brought from a druggie who seemed trustworthy. He is the landmark of stupid/funny characters in films like these that the laughter flows out from. He is the fat part of this film and also the immaturity as well. I do not know how Zach made this guy come to life and how he gathered up all the energy? Anyways, Zach is a gifted actor that belongs into the Mensa of films. Well done! The rest of the cast is history......<br/><br/>Since the plot is too complicated and funny to comprehend, I took the liberty of copying this straight from IMDb: Just two days before his marriage with Tracy Garner, Doug Billings, in the company of two friends: Phil Wenneck and Stu Price; and Tracy's eccentric brother, Alan, head out to party in Vegas. Driving his father's Mercedez, they rent a pricey villa at Caesar's and head for the rooftop to have a good time. Three of them later wake up with a hangover, unable to re-collect what exactly happened. With the villa in a wreck, turned upside down, they find that they have a baby in the closet, a grown tiger in the bathroom, Stu has a missing tooth and a hooker for a bride, and Doug is missing. Hilarious chaos results as the trio head out to re-trace their steps, find out that occurred in order to try and locate Doug, and bring him home in one piece before the wedding.<br/><br/>The film has a cameo by Mike Tyson who is a fierce little fella and he lights the screen on fire once he makes an appearance. The punch must have hurt when Alan got it! The film has too many classic scenes and it would be very hard, if not impossible, to choose one but there are some scenes which stand out from the rest. The whole Alan making the baby look like it is jerking off is stuck in my mind for days and I laugh whenever it is thought off. I laugh in the classroom in sleep, even in the toilet. The Ending, which I won't certainly not spoil, is also very funny because it outlines the stupidity that the bunch had to go through after realizing......... (lets leave it at that.) The film amazes me when I think of the R18+ rating it got because the film had hardly any nudity to what you might expect but the foul language and the offensive acts fill that up in a flash. This is a must recommend for Comedy fans who are looking for the word ""Originality"".<br/><br/>""Over and Out"" 10th June, 2010."
"bohab","10","2","4","1 June 2010"," This is a pretty funny movie.
","I wasn't going to watch this movie because normally films of this type are an utter waste of time.<br/><br/>However, After a few minutes, it caught my interest and I ended up watching the whole thing.<br/><br/>It wasn't rolling on the ground funny but it was outrageous and interesting enough to draw me in and make me want to see the ultimate conclusion.<br/><br/>I could identify with the characters and have had a few Vegas nights where I woke up wondering where the heck my pants were.<br/><br/>To the naysayers... if you are looking for something witty and cerebral...forget it..just relax and enjoy the silliness."
"Ryan_MYeah","8","2","4","25 May 2010"," MYeah's review: The Hangover
","Hello everybody! This weekend I saw The Hangover.<br/><br/>The film centers on four best friends: Phil Wenneck (Played by Bradley Cooper) Stu Price (Ed Helms) Alan Garner (Zach Galifianakis) and Doug Billings (Justin Bartha), who all travel to Las Vegas, to celebrate Doug's bachelor party before he gets married. But the morning after, they wake up to a massive hangover. And for some reason, they cant remember ANYTHING from last night. And what's worse? It turns out they have lost Doug. They find out that the reason WHY they can't remember anything is because they were slipped roofies. They have to retrace all of their steps from the twelve hour period that they have no memory of to find Doug.<br/><br/>And the film is absolutely hilarious!<br/><br/>The script is creative, inspired, and brilliantly structured. The film is occasionally very random, but it's still so funny. The film is very well paced, and isn't hindered by slow pace that the first few minutes does suffer from a bit.<br/><br/>The performances are great in this movie. Cooper, Helms, and Galifianakis all play off of each other so well as an ensemble (They're the three best friends that anyone's ever had. :D ), and just as good separately, along with Justin Bartha as well. They're all supported by some great cameos from Heather Graham, Jeffrey Tambor, Ken Jeong, Rob Riggle, and Mike Tyson among others.<br/><br/>Overall thoughts: The film's strongest benefits are from it's creative, and hilarious screenplay, and performances.<br/><br/>The movie gets *** out of **** from me."

","I have never laughed in a cinema so much in my life.This movie is everything I want in a comedy, I think the reason I find it go good, is because we all have had a hangover at one time or another in our life, and we know the feeling of not being able to remember anything. So from the moment Ste wakes up on the apartment floor, with that""What the Hell is going on"" look on his face, I was howling with laughter, and from there it just got better and better.Alan Garner is a absolute LEGEND!!He is defo top dog when it comes to the laughs in this picture. You have got to see this film, and laugh your ass off, as i said before The Greatest and Best Comedy I Have Ever Seen!!!Hands Down!!!10 out of 10!Also the slideshow at the end, pure GOLD!!!"
"Bravesfan17","10","2","4","21 May 2010"," The best movie from director Todd Phillips
","Director Todd Phillips knows how to make a good, original story, and make it his own. With The Hangover, Phillips proves that he does not need famous actors to make a fun comedy that shows to be a good time. Phillips first shows this by having only semi-famous actors play the four main characters.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper, who appears in Wedding Crashers and Yes Man, plays Phil, a married man who takes his buddy out to Las Vegas for a bachelor party. Ed Helms, who is most famous as Andy Bernard from The Office, plays Stu, a dentist who calls himself a doctor. Justin Bartha from the National Treasure movies plays Doug, the man who is getting married. Zach Galifianakis steals the show as Alan, who thinks of Phil, Stu, and Doug as his best friends. Alan says and does the dumbest stuff but Galifianakis pulls it off and makes Alan believable.<br/><br/>Many people know who Heather Graham is and she is brilliant as Jade, the stripper who marries Stu while they are wasted. In another brilliant part is Ken Jeong, who plays a mob boss that is angry with the guys. Mike Tyson also makes a hilarious cameo.<br/><br/>As the scenes and the story unfold, Phillips puts us with the guys as we try to figure out what happened to the guys and makes us want to know just as badly as the guys do. Phillips decides that we as an audience should try and figure out how and when everything happened. This is some brilliant work by Phillips as he puts us involved in the movie.<br/><br/>I also like that the director doesn't just give away the ending. Phillips knows how to make the characters believable and keep the story compelling. This is his best movie to date and he proves that he can get semi-famous actors and make them good."

"edwagreen","7","2","4","15 May 2010"," Hangover...And I Actually Liked It ***
","Ridiculous movie with one basic thing going for it: The plot is so off the wall that it actually becomes funnier as the picture goes on.<br/><br/>Three guys take their friend for a weekend in Las Vegas from California. The guy is supposed to get married. When the groom-to-be's brother-in-law, who is totally off-the wall, drugs the other guys, the film goes into an odyssey of what the 3 guys go through trying to find their lost friend. We see them interacting with drug dealers, playing 21 at the gambling tables, meeting up with Mike Tyson and his tiger and all other forms of ridiculous adventures. Yet, believe it or not, the film is humorous.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper steals the show as Phil, the California teacher, who curses repeatedly and heads the group consisting of a dentist, the zany groom's intended brother-in-law and our intended groom, the latter who has gone missing through most of the film.<br/><br/>It's rare that a zany comedy works now, but this film actually does."
"Sladoled","9","2","4","6 April 2010"," A fun,cliché-free spin
","I saw the movie twice.First time,I saw it alone and found it amusing but was kinda disappointed because I expected a much funnier film and I was annoyed with the weaker parts of the plot(I found the Chinese guy trying too hard to be funny and rather fake,in particular). Still,I was entertained.I think the music in the film is well chosen and no one can denie there is a lot of originality in this movie,not all those clichés that we are forced to see in comedy films this last couple of years.<br/><br/>Recently,I saw the movie again.This time with my friends.I didn't remember it well so I realized I hadn't seen it carefully the first time. I laughed out loud a lot which I don't do that easily.Admittedly,the atmosphere was cheerful,having friends over.We had a lot of fun. This time I didn't notice the weaker parts in the movie and I didn't look for them.The movie is funny,it doesn't have a lot of lame or already seen jokes,it has a lot of unexpected events and I liked the characters-Bradley Cooper's bitter school teacher who still knows how to have fun,Ed Helms' henpecked Stu,Zach Galifianakis's Alan,weird and uncomfortable but funny(the actor had perfect timing) and Justin Bartha's Doug,a normal guy who actually got together the other 3 completely different guys.Heather Graham's Jane is also likable.<br/><br/>If you want to see a good comedy,and you haven't seen the Hangover,rent it,get it,see it. If you look closely,you'll get more than just a comedy. If you just want to relax,get it again .<br/><br/>This is one of those comedies that people will see in 10 years each time it's on.The next Weekend at Bernie's,a surprising summer hit we always tune in to watch,but the Hangover is deeper and more hilarious(imo :D)<br/><br/>So just watch it.Forget about the hype,the critics,the good and the bad reviews.The movie is original enough to give it the benefit of the doubt. Forget your expectations and prejudices and just watch it. It will be worth it."

","oh my god. i have seen a lot of funny movies but this is the best. it might have parts inappropriate for younger people. and sometimes it really makes you think. but this is the best movie i've ever seen. and i've seen a lot of comedies. it has many memorable quotes. like not at the table Carlos. or when Alan hits the baby with the door and asks if his glasses are OK and Stu goes yeah you dick. you will laugh your head off. i cannot say enough how funny this movie is. i wont lie if your easily offended you might not want to watch it. but if you have a slight bit of demented humor you will find this movie to be a great choice"
"lexvanweert","10","2","4","21 February 2010"," most likely the best comedy ever made (especially for guys)
","This has GOT to be the BEST comedy/ road-movie EVER. I can not remember another movie that made me laugh more. The story is SO whack (without going into detail), that it becomes plausible. People get married all the time... and they all have bachelor- parties.Unless you're sad and have no friends of course. This is the ULTIMATE male bachelor-party!!! And it even has a happy ending. The casting is perfect, 4 types of guys thrown into it.... this is how comedy should be. To complement the feel of the movie, the music fits like a glove. I SOO hope there will be a movie just like it ( maybe a sequel)...but those are tricky when the first one is AWESOME.<br/><br/>If this movie doesn't make you at least giggle or more likely LOL/ LMAO... you need counseling for NOT having a sense of humor"
"electra_xan","8","2","4","6 February 2010"," As of 01/01/2010 it's safe to say Hangover was the funniest thing we saw in 2009!
","Well structured action, genuinely funny performances and script. The kind of comedy you would recommend to everyone without reservations! What really makes a difference here is the chemistry of the characters. If you just take a quick look at them, you will see no possible way of co-existence. Yet they not only -almost miraculously- manage to survive each other but their hangover experience works like a bonding factor. Bradley Cooper as the voice of reason and Zach Galifianakis deliberately trying to make everyone's life miserable with his 'brilliant' ideas is called Flawless Casting. It's the kind of comedy we hadn't seen since... Well, I have no idea when the last time I watched something equally funny was! Enjoy!"
"rbfclik4","10","2","4","2 February 2010"," The Hangover Review: By Jakkrabbit.
","My Review: I gave The Hangover a 8 out of 10. I thought this movie was excellent on the point of setup. Everything that would be previewed within the movie would come back with conclusive endings to what was previously revealed from past parts of the movie. Nothing was left out. The movie was absolutely hilarious, It almost defines the word. I thought this movie topped Superbad, and i never thought that could be done cause in my opinion Superbad was the funniest movie I've seen in awhile until of course I've seen The Hangover. In The Hangover, Not only was a lot of these actions that was visible hilarious, A lot of the lines were right on target; And what i mean by that is in other Comedy movies they would try and say some line and it would be totally random and it would supposed to be funny but in fact it is not and makes no sense at all. That rarely happens within this movie, Almost every line is agreeable and will produce a laugh from you. This movie will be an instant classic in many cases. <br/><br/>My rating and reasoning: 8/10. This movie was very funny one of the best comedies i have seen since Superbad. I cant say this is an absolute perfect and complete Comedy, and that's why it did not receive a 10 from me. But i tell you it is close to it. It could had just a LITTLE bit more put into some things to make it a perfect Comedy.<br/><br/>Positives and Negatives:<br/><br/>(+): Very funny lines and actions.<br/><br/>(+): Everything fell into place perfectly throughout the movie.<br/><br/>(-): Some of the lines and actions were kind of stupid and unrealistic, I don't like things like that and i always take off for it. <br/><br/>(-): There could have been a little bit better acting in it. For example, The Hotel Check-In Lady, Lisa. I thought she did an horrible job acting.<br/><br/>My Favorite Characters: Allan and Phil.<br/><br/>My Favorite Random Moment: When Allan wakes up and stumbles over everything.<br/><br/>My Favorite Line: When Chao stomps on Allan's ""Satchel"" and he says "" Hey ! There are Skittles in there !"" <br/><br/>My Favorite Moment: When their all sitting at the table and Allan acts as if the baby Carlos (Tyler), Is ""pleasuring itself"" By moving his hand in the motion.<br/><br/>Recommend this Movie?: Yes, Most definitely. If you haven't seen this, it follows in the Must-See Category.<br/><br/>Final Word: I am absolutely stoked for The Hangover 2 to come out, Im curious to see how the story will take place from where it left off. Its gonna be hard to top this, But it will be possibly great also."

","love this film<br/><br/>you might think the reviews hype movies up and then when you see it it's not as good as you expected. well that is not the case for this film.<br/><br/>i think this modern classic will get Oscar nominations for best writing (lose to QT) best picture (lose to Inglorious basterds) and possibly a best director win maybe i know it's abit of a stretch but i reckon it can do it. i know this isn't going to happen but i would love for Zach Galifianakis to get nominated but sadly it wont happen.<br/><br/>Zach Galifianakis is the best character in this cult film. everything he says is a stitch. his highlight is the wolf pack speech (be prepared to fall of your chair when you watch that particular scene) the other two actors (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms) are fantastic too. this film turned Bradley into a leading actor, and is staring in this years the A team. and Ed Helms, his character is hilarious in the U.S office.<br/><br/>during this film the three main characters go to vegas for a stag night and get really drunk and lose the groom. they go on a hilarious journey around Vegas to get him to his wedding. the go around Vegas and meet very humorous people. then finally (SPOILER ALART) they find doug on the roof and race to get him to his wedding. he gets there just in time and gets married.<br/><br/>i strongly recommend this to any body it will crack you up"
"monica_sharma90","10","2","4","13 January 2010"," Hungover on The Hangover
","To begin with, I just have to state that it has been a really long time since I laughed as much as I did while watching The Hangover, and I am a film addict.<br/><br/>The Hangover is a refreshingly original story about 4 guys (Stu, Alan, Phil, and Doug) and their wild bachelor party in Las Vegas. The originality of the movie comes from the fact that we do not actually see the night of partying, but the day after -- it's a surprise that this has not been done before. The plot of the story is that Stu, Alan and Phil must retrace their steps because they seem to have lost Doug, their best friend who is getting married. The only problem, is that they can't remember anything that happened the previous night. <br/><br/>After Todd Phillips' success with Old School and Starsky and Hutch, he has become one of my favourite comedic directors and I had very high expectations of The Hangover because of Phillips. <br/><br/>The extraordinary characters that were put together for this movie is what makes it so epic. Without Phil (played by Bradley Cooper) - the handsome masochist, Stu (played by Ed Helms) - the ""responsable"" dentist, and Alan (played by Zach Galifianakis) - the insanely odd but hilarious brother in law, The Hangover would not have been what it was. Credit must also be given to Heather Graham as she plays Jade, the happy stripper with the lost baby. Furthermore, the addition of Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow bring together a hysterical cast that will not be forgotten. <br/><br/>Again, the fact that this storyline has not been done before (at least so well) is mind blowing. The wild and insane situations faced by this group of friends is laugh-out-loud funny. The slapstick humour, along with each characters original personalities, make us want to watch the movie over and over again. The amazing one liners that will be quoted over and over again to friends and family make us wonder about the minds that come up with such things. And the (musical)cameo by Mike Tyson is just icing on the cake. <br/><br/>So for all those who are skeptical about Todd Phillips, and live by Judd Apatow, I truly suggest putting that skepticism aside and watch The Hangover. Call up all your friends, get comfortable, and prepare to laugh for and hour and a half straight."
"harkian1","10","2","4","9 January 2010"," Some say it sucks, and I know why
","Not because I agree with them, not at all, I loved the movie. I laughed so much throughout this movie, it was great. But there are those who hate this movie, and they all say the same thing 'Is it just me? All my friends seem to think it's hilarious but I barely even let out a snicker during the entire thing.' You can easily examine this and determine why these people think that this isn't funny. These people are annoying, egotistical asses who think they're god's gift to the world. The first line, which they ALL use, 'Is it just me?' shows how they try to identify themselves as unique and 'above' everyone who likes this movie. Yup, they think that they are superior people because of which movies they like. They then use the 'all my friends' line, which is laughable because these are the types of people without any friends. Then they say 'I barely let out a snicker', implying that the movie wasn't just bad overall, they try to make it seem as though there was no part of the movie, even for say, 5 seconds, that was funny enough to make them laugh. So, to the people who say they hate this movie: No one cares about what you think you self-centred moron. I hate these kinds of people, luckily I haven't known too many of them in my time. They also usually think that they are exceptionally intelligent, but their life situation, which of course matches their actual intelligence, is completely average and they blame it on something that they of course have no control over. Anyway, enough with those ass holes, this movie was awesome. If you are one of the people I described above with a ten-foot pole up your ass, then watch the movie. You'll control yourself and won't laugh at all to try to seem too high-brow for this movie, but secretly you'll love it and you'll hate that you love it because you need to seem intelligent because you know that you need to seem intelligent whenever possible because in reality, you aren't... at all. If you aren't one of the people I described above, then WATCH THIS MOVIE, you WILL laugh a lot during this movie, I certainly did."

I have never been so entertained in my entire life. <br/><br/>Being a HUGE Mike Epps fan, I was psyched to see his name in the credits, and for once, he didn't steal the show...he added to it. Most movies with him in it, I find to be funny only when he is in the scene...but I cannot pin-point just one scene stealer in this. Every person in this movie, from the bride's dad down to the guy who worked in the wedding chapel had their shining moments! <br/><br/>I will say this much, Ed Helms is my new fave! He had me at ""I Look Like A Nerdy Hillbilly!"" The way his character Stu dealt with his retched girlfriend Melissa was just awesome too! He was amazing! <br/><br/>All in all, what an AMAZING movie. People who are looking too much into this movie clearly just feel the need to complain cause they lead miserable lives.

"blairgallop7","10","2","4","4 January 2010"," A Hangover worth remembering
","After watching this film, I thought it was one of the best comedies of not just 2009 but of the entire decade( the 2000's). The Hangover is about four friends,Phil Wenneck,Stu Price, Alan Garner and Doug Billings(Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis and Justin Bartha respectively) who travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor party but end up staying longer as they wake up the morning after not remembering much. The reason why I found this to be one of the funniest films of the decade as well as one of my favorite comedies is because of the film's plot, the main actors in the film(listed above) as well as some of the supporting actors(namely Ken Jeong and Heather Graham) and one or two of the cameos. Overall,it is an hilarious ride from start to finish."
"indiefan77","10","2","4","19 December 2009"," Saw it in theaters (twice) will buy DVD soon!!!
","Judging from the trailer I thought this film would be pretty funny. I was wrong. It was HILARIOUS. I have never laughed so hard in a theater, never heard other people laugh so hard in the theater. There was almost so much laughter that I actually wished people would be quiet because I knew we were missing more jokes while waiting for the laughter from the previous joke to die down.<br/><br/>The part with the masturbating baby was ridiculously funny, and the face the baby was making was just priceless. I'm pretty much to the point where I think Zach Galifianakis can do no wrong. I saw his ""Comedy Central Presents"" several years ago and was hooked. I am so glad he's doing as well as he is.<br/><br/>Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper, Justin Bartha, and Ken Jeong were all great in this film. I love the fact that none of these guys are ""superstars"" yet could still carry this film beautifully. This just goes to show you that Hollywood should be focusing on stories instead of ""star power""."
"thechrisclarkblog","8","2","4","16 December 2009"," A Day In Vegas To Remember
","I love Las Vegas. For an entertainment buff like me, a city designed specifically to entertain its millions of tourists is my own personal heaven. I never experienced Vegas as the characters in ""The Hangover"" did...in other words, I didn't get totally hammered, steal $80,000 from a vicious Chinese gangster, kidnap Mike Tyson's tiger, lose my best friend on the eve of his wedding, or marry a stripper. But, given what I know about the so-called ""Sin City,"" I wouldn't be surprised if it was possible. Like the city that never sleeps, ""The Hangover"" never ceases to be entertaining. It is funny from the set-up to the conclusion and never has any of those dreaded moments when the comedy dies down. The performances are spot-on, the humor is appropriately raunchy, and the writing is witty. Capturing both the glamorous and low-rent sides of Vegas rather perfectly, ""The Hangover"" is, without a doubt, one of 2009's funniest and most competently-made comedies."
"Romarth","Null","2","4","15 December 2009"," In this current dark period of cinematic comedy, it's a relief that great movies like The Hangover are still being made
","The intelligent comedy is a dying breed. Gone are the days of the Marx Brothers and good Woody Allen movies; here are the days of Meet the Spartans, farting and cameos from Carmen Electra. It's relieving, than, that in this current dark period of desperate cinematic comedy, great movies like The Hangover are still being made.<br/><br/>The Hangover proves that there is still genius to be derived from the unsophisticated: this isn't routine slacker/bromance fodder; this doesn't sacrifice all its integrity for a flurry of puke-awful penis jokes. It carries itself with the wit of a sitcom and the flare of the big screen, resulting in the funniest mainstream comedy of the year thus far (I said mainstream, In the Loop, so don't worry).<br/><br/>Todd Phillips has outdone himself this time, because The Hangover is his best film to date. Though, given his last outing was School for Scoundrels, that mightn't be saying much in terms of personal vigour, but his latest trumps a lot of America's recent comedic output.<br/><br/>It's become a recent fad in cinema to compare almost every American comedy to the work of Judd Apatow, a more mature (but not quite as legendary) Kevin Smith. Following his rise to fame, his movies have conquered the hearts of cinema-goers, pleasing both the box office and critics. So, how do comparisons with The Hangover hold up? Well, if Apatow is an auteur for finding hilarity in the mundane, or deadly serious (unplanned pregnancy, heartbreak, etc.), than Phillips is the master for creating comic genius from the completely insane.<br/><br/>In fact, the only thing that's even remotely similar to Apatow's frame of work is the layered character observations, because what's significantly exceptional about The Hangover, and that indefinable quality that made and didn't break it, is that it's very taken with its characters. Rather than constantly busy itself with an excessive drive of punchlines, it's very involved in the surprisingly acute development of our illustrious trio's relationship, and frequently reaches breakthroughs in terms of simpatico. An oddball (Zach Galifianakis' Alan), a lothario (Bradley Cooper's Phil), and a neurotic (Ed Helms' Stu) they may be, these characters are still very investible and very believable, and given the ludicrous events that transpire during the movie's runtime, that's pretty impressive.<br/><br/>Though that doesn't mean it doesn't yield many a punchline; in fact, the gag rate is unfathomable, and, on average, there's a joke every few seconds. Even more impressively, for every joke that misfires, there are two that hit home, to hilarious effect.<br/><br/>But going back to characterization, it brings me nicely to the performances; what's refreshing about The Hangover is it's neither the first comedic outing for a major actor, nor does it's cast consist of the usual humdrum SNL affiliates. While the primary trio are seasoned, it's great to see some different faces appose to the norm. And, boy, you wouldn't want this cast any other way.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper as Phil is cocksure charisma winningly applied to an everyman the average schmo can both like, empathize with and, similar to Galifianakis' Alan, somewhat idolize. He's slick, he's suave, and he's no slouch when it comes to punchlines, and, thanks to his leading man good looks, he's enough to bother Ryan Reynolds, and just as talented. Given that he's never really given a definable moment to shine, his insanity, compared to his co-stars, is admirably low-key, but, sadly, he is upstaged by both Helms and Galifianakis.<br/><br/>Ed Helms, one of the most underrated and scandalously underused comedic actors to recently come about, fits the role of Stu perfectly, which is a pleasant surprise; fans of his will probably be more acquainted with the many self-serving, idiotic assholes that have shaped his frame of work so far. Hats off to Phillips for giving him the attention and limelight he deserves, because it was definitely worth it; watch Helms throughout, and you'll see how his increasingly-frustrated Stu begins to squirm. The character's outbursts mightn't come as quite a surprise as a result, but you'll still be able to watch a maverick subtly begin to take centre stage. If, however, you don't have the tolerance to do so, than simply laugh your ass off at his piano/voice solo midway through the movie, and particularly his rib-tickling fermata.<br/><br/>And, finally, Zach Galifianakis... It's not difficult to identify which aspect steals the show; Galifianakis as Alan turns in a comedy tour du force; thanks to Galifianakis' undivided dedication to manic vivaciousness, and the innocent, dumb grace he inhibits the character with, Alan is the unfaltering focus of a very devoted audience, all of whom should be waiting for his next hilarious pratfall or observation (you can't masturbate on a plane because of 9/11, apparently). He is endlessly funny, and just never wears thin.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, not everything is as steady; there's a hammy Ken Jeong, who, after one funny moment, just becomes plain irritating. Also, the film fancies itself both a comedy and a mystery movie, but the characters' sleuthing grows a little monotonous as things proceed. Every twist is very predictable, and while some scenes do offer legitimate pathos (the scene in the impound lot, for example), others just deter from the general interest. Thankfully, the movie is deliriously fast-paced and doesn't fret too much therein.<br/><br/>And you yourself should not fret, because there's more than enough here to entertain and enthrall: three supporting players finally getting a stab at lead; a wonderful high concept used to its fullest potential, not to mention a great depiction of the title ailment; such unprecedented delights as a taser gun demonstration with two over-enthusiastic cops, a winking Rain Man spoof with a great and well-publicized use of the song ""Joker & the Thief"", and a rooftop speech from Alan that had me in stitches long after the movie was over."

","I saw this movie in theaters twice in the first week that it came out. Unlike most of the R-rated comedies released recently it has some sexual jokes, but never gets completely raunchy. Everybody in this movie did a great job, Bradley Cooper has been one of my favorite actors, since I first saw him in Wedding Crashers with Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. He was hilarious in The Hangover. The Hangover is definitely not like Judd Apatow movies, which should be kept far out of the reach of kids under 13, it is a movie for the whole family to enjoy, and will make a great gift for anyone of any age. All in all this was a pleasant surprise, and I hope to be seeing it winning many awards in the near future."

","The Hangover takes place in Las Vegas when Doug Billings, played by Justin Bartha, and Tracy Garner, played by Sasha Barrese, are two days away from being married. Doug's friends, Phil Wenneck, played by Bradley Cooper, Stu Price, played by Ed Helms, and Alan Garner, played by Zach Galifianakis, thought that now is the time for a bachelor party and where else better to party then Vegas. To their misfortune, after a long night of hard partying and great times, they wake up to the worst hangover ever, find the groom missing, and at the same time have no recollection of what happened the night before. It is now up to the three of them to find Doug before his wedding just a day away. With no time to waste they begin to look for clues to help steer them towards the right direction to find Doug and in doing so find out piece by piece the crazy night that none of them could ever imagine.<br/><br/>I believe ""The Hangover"" was one of the funniest movies I have seen since ""Superbad"", ""Step Brothers"", and ""Pineapple Express"". I laughed from beginning to end. ""The Hangover"" is a must watch in theaters. The character of Alan Garner is comical in the film. He brought a unique character to life with his funny scenes. Bradley Cooper, in the movie, is a teacher that would be awesome to have in real life. His character is what gets the group to be so much fun, by making them do all the crazy stuff with his frat boy like attitude. This movie is unquestionably one of the best comedy films of the year and a must see.<br/><br/>Director Todd Phillips has a unique perspective of the film. He likes the way the characters portray their bad behavior and feels that this is what makes a film so funny. He doesn't really have a moral or point to the film except to make it funny and something that everyone can enjoy and have a good laugh. The director portrays the characters funny characteristics through their great personalities and funny punch lines. I feel he does an excellent job directing and keeping the film funny throughout the entire movie."

Todd Phillips (known also for directing Old School) delivers a smash hit that will stick in my mind for a very long time.<br/><br/>The movie consists of many actors not very popular but they couldn't have picked better people to portray these Roles. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and the hilarious Zack Galifianakis are the best trio in any comedy movie I can remember. I have seen this movie 3 times in theaters and each time it felt like I had never seen it before because I was laughing out of my seat almost every scene.

Lines like ""She's got my grandmother's Holocaust ring!"" ""I didn't know they gave out rings at the Holocaust."" make this movie so wonderful. Every scene is almost always stolen by Alan Garner, played so well by Zach Galifiniakis. Every actor plays off each other in a seamless way. This is not a real subtle, ""smart"" comedy, but it is so awesome that it doesn't have to be. There are so many great lines and scenes in this movie that when your still laughing at one line, another comes up and you laugh harder, overlapping each line and making you feel so fantastic. This is a wonderful, hilarious and really push-forward comedy that makes you wonder if something like ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" was really that good (it still is).<br/><br/>10/10"

","Hell, another good 2009 movie. For all my grievances about not being able to see Up, Moon and The Brothers Bloom all in one week, it seems like all of it is finally paying off, as I found this movie very entertaining.<br/><br/>The comedy is hit and miss, but to be fair, it's mostly hit, with my only real criticism being that the characters are kind of stock - but then again, they're still enjoyable and really fun to watch, and surprisingly developed and well written in the end, too. The dialogue is good and the first forty five minutes or so are really good, with the random suspense mixture throwing you for loop after loop until the conclusion. The comedy, when it's really ""on,"" is delightfully vulgar and silly, and the pace of the movie is great, sending you on a wild adventure that you won't forget any time soon, full of laughs.<br/><br/>The ending seems to drag on a bit, but again, nothing that really hurts the movie. The Hangover isn't a modern classic, but it's definitely a good movie, and it kept me interested. Recommended. I really did like what they did with the ending credits, that was just great.

"Jonny_Numb","8","2","4","26 July 2009"," Fear and Laughter in Las Vegas
","More than once in my life, I have been accused of lacking a sense of humor, and lately I've been wondering if that's really the case, or if American comedy has become a sad case of settling for less (and just praising it more). I still don't get the fascination with Sacha Baron Cohen's outrageous publicity stunts masquerading as ""films""; nor do I manage many laughs at the efforts of box-office juggernaut Judd Apatow. My decision to see ""The Hangover"" was influenced by two factors: the praise some casual acquaintances had given it; and a genuine lack of anything else interesting playing. With a Sunday-afternoon audience of probably 30 people, I found that the American comedic film--not to mention my sense of humor--was more than alive and well. Directed by Todd Phillips (""Road Trip""), ""The Hangover"" is the tale of four friends: cocky elementary-school teacher Phil (Bradley Cooper); meek, whipped dentist Stu (""Daily Show"" correspondent Ed Helms); WASPy groom-to-be Doug (Justin Bartha); and his mentally deficient future brother-in-law, Alan (Zack Galifianakis), who trek to Las Vegas for Doug's bachelor party the night before he's set to tie the knot. After a rooftop Jagermeister toast that commences the night's activities, we flash forward to the next morning, with the friends' hotel suite in disarray (including a tiger holed up in the bathroom), and Doug nowhere to be found; while trying to remember what happened the night before, our trio of suddenly sober man-children embark on a quest that is as hilarious as it is unpredictable. Instead of a straightforward narrative where all the comedic beats are telegraphed in advance (such is the fate of most films of this sort; and the story is admittedly nothing new), John Lucas' and Scott Moore's screenplay mines the sort of surprise and revelation that marks a good mystery thriller (which the film could have easily been played for), transforming each punchline into an uproarious zinger as a result. One of the best films I've seen this year, ""The Hangover"" is also the funniest Hollywood comedy in ages."
"Christian-Loescher","9","2","4","17 July 2009"," The Opposite of a Headache
","The Hangover is a compelling anomaly of a comedy, one that easily could have been just another movie where a group of thirtysomething dudes get drunk and into all sorts of trouble. The method in which its story is told, however, sets it apart from its comedic kin and makes it all the more hilarious and brilliant.<br/><br/>A small group of friends, pretty boy Phil (Bradley Cooper), lady-whipped Stu (The Office's ""Andy,"" Ed Helms), socially inept Alan (awesome newcomer Zach Galifianakis), and groom-to-be Doug (Justin Bartha), decide to go to Las Vegas for a final free-roaming, binge-drinking evening away from their normal lives, two days before Doug's nuptials are set to take place. Predictably, the drinking begins early upon their arrival, and not surprisingly, the antics begin. The best departure about The Hangover, however, is the intelligent structure of the story from there on out. The bachelors awake the next morning to discover that not only do they not remember a single thing from the night before, but also that their man of the hour, Doug, is missing and nowhere to be found. It turns out that, for reasons the film so elegantly reveals, that the men had been drugged. Their hotel room is in shambles, a baby is found in the closet, and a tiger has set up shop in the bathroom. The three friends are in similarly puzzling positions: Phil finds a hospital bracelet around his wrist, Stu is missing a front tooth, and Alan yet again finds it difficult to locate a pair of pants.<br/><br/>From that point, as the viewer, you're taken on a journey throughout Vegas with the film's three main antagonists, to determine what happened to them and their ride home, Doug. You find out just as much as the three friends do, and at the exact same time, about their night out, which drives up the anticipation of whatever following humorous event the friends discover. The interaction and comedic chemistry between Phil, Stu, and Alan is amazing; the casting couldn't have been done any better. The Hangover also contains cameo appearances from several unexpected characters, including Mike Tyson and several actors who starred in 2003's Old School (one of director Todd Phillips's fantastic previous works). The dialogue and language is crude and offensive, yet appropriate and rip-roaringly funny, and there's even bits of karmic plot points that round out the movie as an extremely well-accomplished work of raucous, constant humor.<br/><br/>Up until this point, Old School only had a small handful of competitive equals, but The Hangover is so confidently funny that it eclipses many of said competitors with ease. Even if somehow you don't begin to enjoy the movie from its opening moments, you'll be unable to stop being washed into the swirling miasma of curiosity and humor that The Hangover possesses. Chock-full of one-liners and hilarious moments, The Hangover is a treat, and unlike hangovers we've all had, will be one you'll be more than pleased to undertake a second time."
"KUAlum26","9","2","4","11 July 2009"," Pretty much a composite of every wild,bachelor party story ever told;still very funny
","On a balls-out,let-it-all ride Bachelor party trip to Vegas,friends Stu(Ed Helms,unleashed at long last here to full comedic effect),Phil(Bradley Cooper,a career that's appeared out of nowhere to become money in the bank)and future in-law Alan(Zach Gallifinakis,in my mind the biggest scene thief of this show) run into one small problem after a night of inspired debauchery:the guest of honor,groom-to-be Doug(Justin Bartha,who's sorta there for the film)is missing. And now,three guys whose various poor or short-sighted judgments have left them disoriented and in some legal trouble,must combine their wits to go find their friend and future husband-to-be in an economy of time and an odd,sometimes disturbing set of clues left in wake to help them.<br/><br/>Director Todd Phillips,expanding upon the ""bad boys being bad boys"" formula that was modestly offered with star power to back it in Old School,now goes for a slightly more modest cast(from Will Ferrell,Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson to Helms,Bartha,Gallifinakis and Cooper)but a more ambitious,raunchier(if that can be believed)and adventurous story to make this largely funny,sometimes hard to believe comedy. A deft usage of actors in supporting roles--among them the now underused Heather Graham as a pleasant,bubbly single mom of infant,who just happens to be a stripper and escort;Ken Jeong as the wiry,foul-tempered and quite possibly gay Asian mobster who has it in for the heroes;Rachael Harris as Stu's brittle,domineering bitch of a girlfriend;and Mike Tyson as,get this,Mike Tyson--highlight this tour de force,and that's not even to mention the near cameos as some not-too-lightweight-themselves talents as Jeffrey Tambor(as the Bride and Alan's dad),Bryan Callen(as a thick-accented wedding chapel proprietor),Sasha Barresee(mostly in one-note fret mode as the unravelling bride-to-be),Mike Epps(as a discombobulated drug dealer),Rob Riggle(as a uniform cop,one of Vegas' NOT finest)and Cleo King(as his equally inept and cruel partner).<br/><br/>The summary line notes that this movie,as funny ands sometimes shocking(stay for the credits and try not to be caught at least a little off guard!)as this film is,at its core it is little more than a compendium of wild stories that guys have spun,whether based in truth or no,set around giving their buddies and/or enduring their last night of un-wedded fun. So while the originality of this particular movie isn't all that remarkable,the set-up,follow-through and denouement of it is! Good,raunchy,raucous fun for anyone(guys in particular)who appreciate good,solid immature tomfoolery before settling down and ""becoming mature"". Perfect film-going for summer!"
"EUyeshima","8","2","4","6 July 2009"," Outrageous Bro-mantic Comedy Maintains Surprising Consistency in the Laughs Department
","I would have never considered seeing this 2009 bro-mantic comedy were it not for the fact that it has been garnering such strong critical reviews. My curiosity was piqued since on the surface, the film represents a sophomoric genre that targets a more juvenile, male-oriented audience. However, director Todd Philips (""Old School"") infuses what could have been a tired premise with a no-holds-barred comedic sense which is refreshingly consistent and surprisingly human. The pacing is so frenetically furious that the filmmakers give a viewer little time to question the credibility of the often ridiculous plot turns. Written by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, the story revolves around a typical Vegas bachelor party where three close buddies get together for one last night of drink and debauchery. The trio of prospective groom Doug, straitlaced dentist Stu (who is engaged to a controlling harpy), and cynical schoolteacher Phil is joined by the bride's brother, Alan, a bearded, beer-bellied and socially awkward geek who turns out to be a little too desperate to be a natural member of this fraternal clan.<br/><br/>The newly established quartet drives from LA to Vegas and ends up staying in a palatial $4,200-a-night suite at Caesar's Palace. After a rooftop Jägermeister toast, we flash forward to the morning after with their room completely trashed. Inflatable sex dolls in the hot tub, a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in a closet, a hospital band on Phil's wrist, and Stu's missing front incisor are the only clues they have to figure out what happened the night before. Even worse, Doug is missing, and they have approximately 24 hours to find him for the wedding. What Philips does cleverly is turn his comic hi-jinks story into a detective story without sacrificing any of the raucous comedy. In fact, the subsequent plot draws broader and broader circles of implausibility with each development reinforcing the absurdist tone with sharp precision. Not too surprisingly, as the movie provides greater clarity on what exactly happened, the movie starts to lose momentum and becomes rather predictable with the inevitable climax of a high-speed scene. Nonetheless, some of the sight gags and set pieces are unapologetically hilarious, for instance, a stun-gun demo for a classroom of grade school children, a naked gangster pouncing from a car trunk, and a highly inappropriate rendition of 50 Cents' ""Candy Shop"" at the wedding reception.<br/><br/>Much of the film's success has to do with the easy rapport that the four principals have with each other. The absence of a dominating comedy figure like Will Ferrell or Steve Carell actually helps this time around. As Phil, Bradley Cooper (""He's Just Not That Into You"") somehow manages to make the standard role of the cocksure alpha male into a genuinely likable character. Ed Helms (Andy in the US version of ""The Office"") appears to be channeling a bit of Stephen Colbert in bringing out Stu's neurotic, self-protective tendencies. However, most of the laughs are supplied by stand-up comic Zach Galifianakis, who makes Alan not only the model social outcast but also a subconscious manifestation of all the well-intentioned actions that get us in trouble. Justin Bartha has little to do as Doug, as does Heather Graham as an obliging stripper/hooker who finds herself married to Stu. Ken Jeong, the cranky obstetrician in ""Knocked Up"", does a loopy turn as a gay gangster in a bit that goes on too long, and look for a very off-the-wall scene with Mike Tyson. The closing credits provide the details of the boys' notorious night through a hysterical series of increasingly outrageous photos."

The performances are good with all of the actors knowing their roles and getting really good laughs with the parts they've been given.

","I was not in a really good mood when I went to see this movie and I thought that I needed some mindless humor to cheer me up a bit.

The humor was more intelligent then I had expected and I found myself completely engrossed in the situations on the screen. Don't get me wrong, it was still raunchy guy stuff, but the writing and chemistry of this film are way beyond normal mass produced material. But the main reason that I am writing this review is because I don't understand the people that give this movie a rating of one or two. It is OK if you don't care for this type of humor, but it is something else to say the movie was real bad, even when the rest of the movie theater is laughing out loud throughout the whole film. Do you think the rest of the people in the theater are mindless freaks, or are you so self absorbed that you don't realize the rest of the people are really enjoying the film?

Most notably is Zach Galifianakis, who pretty much owned every scene in this movie with his awkwardness and witty dialogue. Another great newcomer is Bradley Cooper from ""Wedding Crashers"" who did a great job leading the rest of the cast.

Each plays off the other wonderfully and if any of them were not up to the task the film would have been the lessor for it. <br/><br/>What makes this film work when it could easily be dismissed for the way over the top scenarios that happen is that we, the audience, learn about the previous night of debauchery along with the guys as they learn about it (or more accurately ""refreshed"" about it). This makes the events a lot more fun because the audience shares in the emotions experienced with the guys. The plot is simple; 4 guys head to Vegas for one last party to celebrate/mourn the upcoming marriage of one of their own. But when our boys can't remember what happened when they awake the next morning, not to mention can't find the groom, things kick into high gear.<br/><br/>There are supporting players sprinkled through the film like Heather Graham, Mike Tyson, Ken Jeong (another scene stealing spin), Mike Epps. None of these removes you from the fun, even when Tyson enters the scene. His presence just seems to fit and makes sense given the previous night's party. Be sure and watch the ending credits for photos taken during the night that shed even more light on what went down.<br/><br/>The only complaint that could be leveled at the film is the anti-climatic ending. They do a great job of teetering the line of way over the top and plausible through the film. But the ending plays it safe, perhaps a bit too safe. The other complain is the waste of Justin Bartha. He plays the groom to be ""Doug"". His character is pretty much the straight man and is lost for most of the film with his character being lost. Bartha has shown great comic timing in previous supporting roles that it would have been nice to utilize his talents a bit more.<br/><br/>This is one of those films you have to go and see again because you inevitably miss something from everyone in the theater laughing. I will be seeing it again myself."
"st-shot","7","2","4","12 June 2009"," No headache, just laughs in Hangover.
","The Hangover is a reckless comedy that follows the usual male bonding road trip formula but with an edge that makes it stand out from the rest of the pack of sophomoric comedies made in this vein.<br/><br/>Stu, his two best friends and his rather odd brother in law head for Vegas to celebrate his bachelor party. On the rooftop of the Bellagio they drink a toast to the night ahead. Flash forward to the next morning where three of the four awake to a trashed suite with a tiger in the bathroom and a baby in a bedroom. Stu is nowhere to be found and everyone's memory (due to spiked drinks) of the night before is a blank slate. In order to find Stu and get him to the church on time they must piece together the night before.<br/><br/>Hangover's ability to maintain a degree of suspense, albeit comic, throughout while remaining irreverently hilarious as it goes in an out of bounds of credulity and taste is what makes it a refreshing entertainment. So a wedding chapel owner gets shot in the shoulder with no repercussions or the hapless trio agree to be tasered by police in a classroom who then give students a turn. Ridiculous? Yes? Hysterical? That too. <br/><br/>It's clearly a guy film with it's un PC chauvinism, insensitivity and actions by the eclectic band of jerks in full display of extended adolescence but women's laughter was every bit as evident as men the day I caught the show. It was easy to see why."

"MHS_Movie_reviewer","7","0","0","25 May 2020"," Great movie, watch it friends for more laughter.
","Plot: 7-7.5, based on just the title and poster for this piece, you'd expect the movie to be about 3 drunk characters waking up the next morning dizzy and confused. Well that's exactly what you'll get and much more with it. Furthermore, with most comedy movies you start predicting what's gonna happen and often times this ruins the delivery of the joke. With hangover it is the opposite, you can't predict any scenes making the jokes more enjoyable.<br/><br/>Execution: 8-8.5, what made hangover a masterpiece was purely the overall direction of the movie. Everything felt almost perfect, from the casting decision, the scenery, the camera work, the writing.....everything was up to standard. Although, at certain points some scenes should've been added for more context. Additionally, If the movie were to just focus a tad bit more on the relationships of certain characters.....Stu & Jade, this would be a 10.<br/><br/>Comedy: 8-8.5, 90% of the jokes were funny on a first watch basis, the rest were slightly cringey but needed to be there to create the awkwardness amongst characters. If i were to change anything i'd probably give Alan (Zach Galifianakis) more screen time.<br/><br/>Music: 7-7.5, was mostly in theme with scenes. The decrease in rating is because of personal preference for certain songs which would be better.<br/><br/>Acting: 7-7.5, if you're expecting an Oscar-worthy performance from this movie turn away. As good as Hangover is, the acting is good/commendable at best.
Alan portrayed by (Zach Galifianakis) and Mr. Chow portrayed by (Ken Jeong) carried the movie when it comes to acting display. The rest of the characters merely had to put in a above average effort since they were outshined by these two.<br/><br/>Overall: 7.5, good movie.

","The Hangover is a very innovative and brilliant comedy, you will never stop laughing during the movie thanks to an amazing cast which represents an entertaining group of friends ready to face every unexpected event.
After watching the movie, you will get attached to each character due to their strong foolishness and their usual inappropriate jokes, but everyone has on own different peculiarity, starting by ""Phil"" (Bradley Cooper): a badass teacher who manages to handle every difficulty with such an enviable calm, ""Stu"" (Ed Helms): a quiet doctor with a demon inside and last but not least ""Alan"" (Zach Galifianakis): a crazy preppy who is also a drug user.
After 10 years from its release I always love watching it and in my opinion is still one of the most hilarious Hollywoodian comedies of all time.
I would also like to highlight Zach Galifianakis' astonishing performance, who gave birth to one of the most iconic and funny characters of pop culture, despite he interprets a stupid and mad over-seized man, he did it in a very unique and clever way.

","It's well written, the acting is spot on, the premise is good. The night after is somewhat familiar even, though minus the baby and tiger. I guess my problem with the film is something it can't help - being so totally American! American humour in these kinds of comedies is always pretty extreme, usually sexual in some way and a bit gross out. And most of the international audience love that, and that's cool! It's probably a boys film more than a ladies, not that ladies won't be amused but boys will relate to the kinda awkward friendship circle, the hazing, the humour. Unless you're a stripper or a psycho bunny boiler gf there's not many people for ladies to relate to, but hell, it's a film.

"TheMovieDiorama","6","0","0","28 May 2018"," The Hangover creatively embeds a flashback structure which creates infrequent laughs.
","""The funniest comedy of the 00s"" this is not, and I'm tired of other modern comedies referencing ""from the producers of The Hangover"" as if it's a work of art. It's watchable, with a few laughs (none from me though...nothing new there) that will appeal to the majority of viewers. A group of friends party the night away before a wedding but as they wake up with a killer hangover, they quickly realise that they had an extremely eventful time where their friend is missing. With no recollection whatsoever, they must retrace their steps which often results in absurd encounters. A tiger in a bathroom, stealing a baby, unknowingly piercing a mattress atop a rooftop statue and missing a tooth...which happens to be the most realistic outcome. Look, I'm sure we've all had terrible hangovers, but none this stupidly absurd. The lunacy of these situations is what supposedly creates the laughs, to which I give credit for the inventive use of the flashback narrative structure. But I was left feeling dumbfounded rather than joyous. Sometimes less is more, and in this case fewer silly scenarios would've made the story tighter and more cohesive as opposed to just being a montage of events. The dynamic friendship between Cooper, Helms and Galifianakis was thoroughly developed and conveyed with buoyancy. There's banter, emotion and fights, enhancing how the reckless night has affected them mentally. Acting was charismatic from everyone, except Helms who I just do not like. He is just so plain in everything and typically unfunny. The screenplay does have some quotable dialogue, often recited by many teenagers thinking it was cool to say ""paging doctor f****t"". Oh yeah, and Mike Tyson has a cameo. So if that hasn't tipped your glass then I don't know what will. Unlike most hangovers, this is rapidly entertaining with some humorous lines and committed performances but remains mostly unfunny leaving a bland beer aftertaste. What I do want to know is what they were drinking, because I'll have what they had..."

"eric262003","9","0","0","25 December 2017"," A Real Man's Film
","Under the direction from Todd Phillips, ""The Hangover"" truly personifies what it's really like to be a man (in its assets and liabilities). Comedies have personified men in ways where they can be seen as overly melancholy or too crude in their demeanour, but Phillips like he did with ""Old School"" and ""Starsky and Hutch"", here he knows his psychology towards the male gender without making by avoiding the traps of making them fun-loving, vulnerable and yet sincere. What makes Phillips successful as a director is his sincerity, even when his films don't always score high at the box office. o me ""The Hangover"" is one of the funniest films of 2009.<br/><br/> When you think about it most men behave the way that the characters in this movie are depicted. They can be crude, eccentric, and macabre in nature, especially when they are on the road together. While at the same time, they could be juvenile in their wild sexual urges, but also nourishing once they've settled in. But the reality is hat most men especially the married ones would rather feel comfort bonding and opening up to other men over their wives, to get a better understanding of what it's like to be a guy and to solidify their role as an alpha male.<br/><br/> The simple plot of ""The Hangover"" is about four friends who venture off to Las Vegas partying off like there's no tomorrow...only to wake up hungover and blanked out about the events that happened yesterday only to find their hotel trashed, an abandoned baby, a Bengal tiger roaming around loosely and chickens scattered all over the suite. To be blunt something doesn't quite add up.<br/><br/> An early scene describes the importance of male-bonding. We have one of the four guys named Stu (Ed Helms), a well disciplined dentist who is living with a self-absorbed control freak girlfriend named Melissa (Rachael Harris), whom he plans on marrying. She finds it uncouth that he's hanging out with his friends even though she think they're going to Napa Valley to indulge in wine testing. In her eyes, Melissa believes that men are practically disobedient women who need female partner to set them on the straight and narrow. But in reality, Stu being more level-headed than the other guys just really wants to socailize with someone of his gender.<br/><br/> The events that proceed might turn into the worst two days of their lives while at the same it's also the best two days of their lives. While the well-disciplined Stu hangs out with his three friends, which are Doug (Justin Bartha), the groom-to-be who's very protective of the Mercedes his father-in-law lent him (Oy vey!) Then there's Phil (Bradley Cooper) a cool customer who's not very comfortable about being domestic. And then you have Alan (Zach Galifianakis), Doug's future brother-in-law who steals the show as their simple friend who's there for the ride, but has well intentions.<br/><br/> The opening scenes in ""The Hangover"" are funny not only in the situations these characters are facing, but the dialogue is also both clever and witty. Phillips along with screenwriters Jon Lucas and Scott Moore call all in the humour that at times boarders on grotesque (one characters serves his breakfast with a side of vomit) but it fits well into the story. These are just average guys who just want to have fun, although they found it more complex than they could imagine because it's harder to have fun when you're older than compared to when you were a teenager. By the time they wake up, Stu's front tooth was extracted, Phil is seen sporting a hospital bracelet around his waist and Doug is MIA. The fun was sweet but the hangover is the least of their problems.<br/><br/> The search for Doug gives the gang a reason for staying their welcome in Vegas and helps the story flow quite naturally. As they come to their senses, the gang start to realize how everything turned out the ay it did and will stop at nothing to correct themselves and their situations.<br/><br/> The weak areas of the film come during the last act where the comical factors get watered down. But it never loses its focus or meanders off in another genre. It's a dark comedy that stays true to its genre. Many sitcoms and other comedy movies can learn a thing or two from ""The Hangover"".<br/><br/> In its duration, the crew from ""The Hangover"" took the liberties to offer the film with vulgar and tasteless jokes and scenarios and outrageously deliver plot twists that unpredictably come from out of nowhere. Just when they think they got everything under control, they pull back, which is not all that bad. ""The Hangover"" is movie that never delves into anything remotely horrible, but rather the horrible events they encountered that created memories that could pass on to their kids when they're older."

The answer is most of them, what ""The Hangover"" has done is taken every element that is considered 'cool' or 'awesome' and thrown them together into a pot (the pot of course being the film); it's dazzling, it makes your heart race at a thousand miles per hour, it makes you want to be part of the film itself... ...Bingo!<br/><br/>Each and every viewer is invested. Regardless of age, gender or creed, you cannot deny that ""The Hangover"" isn't a fine piece of film making.<br/><br/>The acting is sublime, each of the four protagonists bring something different to the table; you have the stupid and simple Alan, the cool and trendy Phil, the geeky and put upon Stu, and the level headed and somewhat smart Doug, who just so happens to be the groom. The variation of character contributes to the overall success of the film, their styles are different but their antics end up the same, pure genius!<br/><br/>It's pop culture at its most stylish, appealing to a main stream audience, that's why it did so well at the box office, well surpassing the general level of what comedy films average..., it was such a success that two sequels were commissioned making ""The Hangover"" a trilogy of films. <br/><br/>Opulence and elegance take a back seat, this is the modern century at its most disturbing, so buckle up and be prepared for one Hell of a ride!"

","Do not expect to see anything 'new' in ""The Hangover"", which is played for good, old-fashioned bawdy belly laughs. It has no real plot, although is very easy to pitch; possesses very little in the way of characterisation, although lots of people are frequently coming and going from the frame, and on top of everything else, does not seem to have a single thing to say on any particular issue whatsoever. We have already experienced quite a lot of what transpires here in an ""American Pie"" film, or some such other contemporary comedy about adults who should know better. Cameos by famous boxers and maybe a liberal use of various pop songs aside, there is very little actually going on.<br/><br/>Justin Bartha plays Doug, who is about to be married to Tracy (Barrese), in what promises to be a lavish Californian wedding between two people very much in love. In the opening scene, Doug and his brother-in-law to-be Alan (Galifianakis) are sizing up their wedding day apparel: Doug is shaven, handsome, has a good build and looks smart – he's worn suits in the past and he'll wear them again. Alan, by comparison, is flabby; unshaven and childlike – we do not sense he has ever worn a suit in his life, nor that he has ever had many friends.<br/><br/>Ahead of these two men, and before the wedding, is a trip to the Nevada city of Las Vegas, which they are lining up with two more of Doug's friends so as to provide the husband-to-be with a final night of bachelor driven fun and frolics. Of these two men, one is Bradley Cooper's Phil, whom we do not believe for one second is a teacher, while the other is Stuart (Helms), whom we do believe is a dentist and might possess a nice house in a good part of town with a sensible girlfriend who espouses conservative views on gambling and prostitution.<br/><br/>Discounting Alan, who is now family and present by default, we are unconvinced that each of these three men would really meet one another in life and hit it off to the extent they would entrust one another on a booze-cruise to Vegas. The film is not especially interested in who any of these people really are or what they think, just that Phil is very bohemian and aggressive; Stu is ultra-defensive due to a white-lie he has told his partner about going in the first place; Doug seems to be a kind of 'glue' which keeps everything from falling apart and that Alan is a little retarded.<br/><br/>Once in Las Vegas, the night out gives way to a morning after characterised by a wrecked hotel room and a total lack of memory of what happened. The major problem is that Doug did not wake up in the hotel suite with them. Consumed with panic, the three take to the daytime streets of Vegas on whatever meagre clues they have as they frantically try to piece together just what it was they did last night.<br/><br/>The set up allows the film to 'drop' various things on us which we might not otherwise find funny, such as a police car matching their valet ticket; two gangsters popping out of nowhere with baseball bats ready to do serious damage and a nude gentleman jumping out of a car boot. Other films would need to depict why these things are as they are, and would thus lose a lot of impact.<br/><br/>""The Hangover"" is not without one or two genuine laughs, with the very sudden homage to ""Rain Man"" being one of them and a very amusing scene of confusion whereby an exchange with some unruly gangsters returns the 'wrong' Doug. Yet the overriding item permeating throughout is the strange sense of disassociation we feel as Phil; Alan and Stuart charge around various hotspots looking for the groom while essentially trying to save their own skins from various wives and in-laws finding out: Do we care if they find Doug, or that he gets to the wedding? Who is anybody in this film anyway? Why does any of this even matter in the first place? <br/><br/>Prior to their losing him, care is taken to set up a series of items which exist to then later be knocked down: Stuart's girlfriend, Melissa, hates Las Vegas and thinks he's gone to a winery; the gang's mode of transportation is an antique silver Mercedes lent to Doug by his fiancé's father, while Stuart's ring belonged to his grandmother, who survived Hitler's Final Solution. Are we surprised, or even amused, when any of these delicately poised things become tarnished or threatened by the chaos which begins to unfold around our leads? <br/><br/>The Hangover's director is Todd Phillips, who wrote 2006's ""Borat"" and before that directed ""Road Trip"". He later made ""Due Date"" in 2010, and ""The Hangover"" very much falls into line with that 'Phillips-ian' road movie-comedy-perpetual chaos 'aesthetic' which he seems to enjoy penning and making. ""Borat"" was often very funny because of the outlandishness of the central character and what he had to say to real people in real situations. ""Road Trip"" was about someone who had to learn to appreciate what he had, while ""Due Date"" depicted somebody learning to accept those different to him.<br/><br/>""The Hangover"" isn't really about anything or anyone. Its opening montage of Vegas set to the gloomy tones of Bill Withers, followed by a shot of the four roadside and looking pretty desperate, seem to set something up on the nature of Vegas, but by the end the consensus seems to be that it's a pretty darned great place to go and that pole dancers make for better wives than conservatives. Once it's finished, we have seen a series of moderately unfunny scenes of no real order or coherence; have laughed maybe twice and been offended at least once. Skipping this particular Hangover is advisable."

","Waking up in their Vegas hotel room with a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the cupboard and no memory of the events of the night before, three men desperately try to piece together the events of the previous evening in order to locate a friend who has gone missing in this Golden Globe winning comedy. Given the importance of wild, drunken shenanigans to the plot, one might expect 'The Hangover' to be a juvenile comedy full of laughs of the gross-out variety, however, while there is some over-the-top vomiting and toilet humour, the vast majority of gags in the film are surprisingly well scripted. The screenplay is in fact quite clever and innovative with many mysteries beyond just the baby, tiger and missing friend - most of which only gradually begin to surface as the friends delve deeper and deeper into the events of the night before. The shot of the friends by the side of the road before the film begins to flash back is thoughtfully done too to disguise one of the main twists towards the end. Not all the gags work, with several telegraphed too far in advance (Bradley Cooper mentioning that only the interior of the car is damaged) and some of the characters are a little grating, but the film is more amusing than most R-rated movies out there. A photo montage during the end credits additionally provides a pitch perfect note for the film to conclude on."
"willcundallreview","7","0","0","16 September 2015"," A good and funny if not overrated comedy
","The Hangover, crude possibly overrated film, well maybe that is true but I still liked this movie and found if funny enough to be good. The whole story revolves around a bunch of friends who go to Las Vegas to celebrate a guy named Doug's soon to be marriage and well, get in a lot of trouble along the way. The plot not only has people going missing but also it has in such a humorous movie actually not that bad a story, kind of exciting in a certain way. Overall really the whole film is one continuous laugh placed over an actual story but it works somehow and even though I do feel people love this a bit too much, it's still more than OK.<br/><br/>The movie stars Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Heather Graham and also Zach Galifianakis who is by far far far the best character of the movie, very funny and he does exactly the kind of job you would want from that kind of personality. Now I'm not saying that the cast are bad, the acting is good no doubt but my only problem was that some jokes aren't that funny, or at least the one's given to the main cast other than Galifianakis. If you follow the story closely and become really engaged, the only real big laughs will come from Zach and although actors like Ken Jeong have their moments; it is the man playing Alan who is supreme.<br/><br/>The script is one of the other great things in this movie, a fine screenplay from Jon Lucas and Scott Moore who seem to mix the right amount of crude humour with an actual plausible story(kind of). Todd Phillips directs and does a good job, I never felt his vision truly was great and some attempts to get a joke across are flat, nevertheless Phillips continues his career in crude comedy well and I can't say his work is anything but fine. One thing that I really noticed was the cinematography, absolutely brilliant skyline shots mixed with some fantastic angles when trying to simulate being drunk, getting into a fight etc.<br/><br/>As movies go in popular culture, The Hangover trumps many a movie in the way of memorable quotes and that is pretty much all because of Alan. I think what makes him so memorable and also likable is not just the writing and the acting but also the direction in which Phillips gives. The jokes are timed so well it is impossible for Phillips not to have had a hand in making them stick, of everything he does in this movie; this is truly the only part I feel he got truly very well done. I'm not discrediting Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms etc but it is only the comedy stems from one character, and I think the laughs have to revolve around Alan to make this movie funny, and I think it does that just about enough.<br/><br/>In conclusion the Hangover is maybe not the most funny comedy ever (nor the smartest), but it is what it is and it isn't shy about that. Of all the jokes the crude ones never get out of control except maybe once with the needless one's such as the one aimed at Ed Helm's character Stu right at the start. Other than some of those jokes the movie is pretty intelligent and the story well thought out, I know at the time of this review that the second and third movie in this now franchise are very badly reviewed, so maybe this is one to savour."

","Well the story sure presents something fresh at the time this movie was released. The story combines the classic element in comedy, mischief, and adding in the newer ingredient of the retarded friend in the character Alan to offset the whole situation. I must say that the comedies are really not that funny. Despite the movie being very much unpredictable, I only find some of the jokes kick in and made laughs. The ones in the police station and the ones with Mike Tyson are really the ones that made me laugh hard. But the movie is still quite a good comedy in overall. Having Bradley Cooper act in a quite crazy of a comedy here is surely a nice touch. It really adds to the acting overall, which is slightly above the standard for me. Zach Galifianakis nicely plays the retard, having most of the comedies originate from. Ed Helms balances the three main characters as the one who tries to sober the other two. Justin Bartha nicely played out his part on the opening part that it feels like his character really is an integral part of the movie, which he really isn't."

So if you want a mood allowed for children, look for another film.<br/><br/>Part of being an adult humor is no demerit in any sense. Actually it does with that is the funniest movie of the year so far. It makes you laugh from the first minute until the last. And I doubt that any movie that will debut can overcome it.<br/><br/>The film opens with Phil telling the bride that her wedding will not happen. The groom is missing. ""Fucked up everything,"" he says. We returned two days of this event. The groom, Doug, is departing to Las Vegas with his two groomsmen and his brother for his bachelor party in ""sin city"".<br/><br/>One of the groomsmen, Phil (Bradley Cooper) is a college professor, married with a son, who says he hates his life. Stu (Ed Helms) is a dentist who tells everyone who is a doctor and is completely dominated by the female (vixen) that betrayed at a party on a boat. Alan (Zach Galifianakis) is the half brother of the bride ""slow"" mentally that, legally, can not get too close to schools, ""He looks like a Gremlin. Comes up with the instruction manual.

Since we do not find it anywhere, they begin to retrace your way through clues they find. To make matters worse, when the valet will deliver them to the car, a brand new Mercedes-law of the groom, delivers a police car.<br/><br/>The search for the groom makes one visit Chapel Weddings, overtake a Chinese mobster effeminate, enter the house of a prostitute, make a stop at the hospital and met with Mike Tyson. This tour for a long day for Vegas looking groom, causes are slowly reconstructing what happened the night before. And notice I did not use the word reminiscing.<br/><br/>Director Todd Philips has in his hand a film filled with bizarre characters in absurd situations. Of course, the trip to ""Sin City"" serves as a shock therapy for all characters. And this is the best movie. Looks like his previous films, Awesome Day and Road Trip, were just the outline of what was to come.<br/><br/>In the end it was just a question: what the hell does that chicken there?"

The problem is, the stag is missing and nobody can remember what went on the night before. There are a lot of things wrong when they wake up the next morning. The stag is missing, the room they are in is wrecked, the dentist is missing a tooth, there is a tiger in the bathroom and they find out they have as police car!

You have no idea, just like the characters, what has happened and it is a great adventure what happened the night before.<br/><br/>I loved some of the twists in the story. It does just keep you laughing throughout. Just when you think it couldn't get worst something else comes to light and you realise it is a lot worse than expected. The characters were not very likable. Every one of them has something about them that makes them the worst friends in the world. But they do stick together and do not stop until they get their friend back. The acting was really good throughout. It makes a change but the casting was perfect. The film stars Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, Justin Bartha, Heather Graham and Ken Jeong. There was even a great cameo by Iron Mike Tyson. Mike can't act to save his life and he definitely can't sing but it did add to the comedy in this movie.<br/><br/>The adventure in this film plays along so well that it is a roller-coaster ride to watch.

","The Hangover is a comedy that is centered on four friends. Doug is about to get married and the four friends head to Las Vegas to celebrate Doug's impending marriage. These friends are Doug, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and Alan (Zach Galifinakis), who is the future bride's brother. They are headed to Las Vegas for Doug's bachelor party. After a heavy drug-induced night of partying Phil, Stu, and Alan awake to find that Doug is missing. The men then run around Las Vegas trying to locate their friend. The entire adventure is filled with chaos and action. Throughout the adventure they piece together their night while simultaneously running into absurd situations. Phi and Stu also learn that Alan gave them all roofies, which lead to their inability to remember anything that happened the previous night. <br/><br/>Although in the end all four men become friends, this was not true in the beginning. Alan is the odd man out. Yet throughout the film he begins to fit in with Phil and Stu. It is truly a movie about the bonds of friendship in the most comedic sense possible mixed with adventure and action. Consider the very final scene after Doug gets married where they all gather around the camera to see the pictures of their mysterious night. It symbolized the growth of their relationships. They had overcome the most extreme of circumstances because of their bonds. Granted the object is more to entertain than anything else, I would certainly argue that the director was not emphasizing the bonds of friendship. <br/><br/>In a way this film reminded me of Old School. These films are both comedies and considered cult classics. In Old School a group of friends came together to overcome very tough circumstances. Their bonds kept them together and in the end they overcame their obstacles.<br/><br/>One motif that I spotted in the film is Stu's missing tooth. Throughout the movie every time we see Stu we are reminded of the craziness and impulsiveness of this film. It represents the chaos that surrounds this film. It could also represent the obstacles that Stu, Phil, and Alan face in their quest to locate Doug. <br/><br/>I felt the soundtrack for this film was very appropriate as well. Much of the focus is on the action. So much is going on and the film keeps moving on at a rapid pace. The music helps to facilitate that mood of jam-packed action. It was also appropriate that Alan sang a song about the ""Three best friends that anybody could have"". It signified the growing friendships within the group after their disastrous bachelor party."

The simple plot device of a bachelor party weekend in Vegas can provide so much fodder to work with, and I am sure that a great writer could have incorporated numerous scenarios into place to make a great flick, even coupling the events of the night with the escapades of the day after, but instead we are kind of left sifting through the unknown aftermath, and while it may come off as funny a lot of jokes don't work like they should because you don't know what led them to that particular point.<br/><br/>It is still an enjoyable watch, but it does leave a lot to be desired."

In a way it does remind me of 'Dude Where's My Car' but with a more interesting storyline (not that I'm putting down the aforementioned example which was funny in its own right). The story itself is told well and the selection of Vegas, which itself is a city full of mysteries and excitements, is a clever choice. Of course the situations are pretty extreme but that only builds the humour rather than destroy. The cast that includes Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, Justin Bartha and Heather Graham form a solid cast.

All goes pretty smoothly until they check into the hotel and decide that they would get a $4000 per night suite instead of the room with two beds they had booked. OK, maybe they can afford the extra cost, but it seemed like a dumb move.<br/><br/>The main story gets rolling the next morning when the three guys wake up in various states of hangover, don't know where Doug, the groom is, and can't remember anything from the night before. Add to the confusion there is a chicken running around,a full-grown, live Tiger in the bathroom, and a baby in the closet. Eventually the Tiger and the baby are explained, but I don't remember the chicken being explained.<br/><br/>So most of the middle of the movie has the three friends trying to track down the groom and the mother of the baby.

They also track down that they had been to a wedding, one of them got married to a stripper, and they also had made a stop at the hospital.<br/><br/>Overall it is a cute premise and a funny movie, I just wish it had not been so dirty in places, that isn't necessary for a well-written comedy.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: As various thugs come after them they figure out that they ended up with $80,0000 worth a chips someone else had won, they had stolen the Tiger from Mike Tyson, and a few other irregularities. Assisting in a taser ""demonstration"" to young kids they avoided arrest for the cop car. One of the guys turned out to be an idiot savant and won $82,000 for them at blackjack. They eventually found Doug on the roof of the hotel, with a bad hangover. They got to the wedding just in time, assisted by tuxes delivered on the freeway.

","A bromance movie following in the Hollywood tradition of recent years, The Hangover stands at the crossroads between 2 Hollywood genres - the ""what stays in Vegas"" movie, and the road trip movie, as 4 male friends go away for a weekend of pre-wedding debauchery, but end up losing the groom and the plot. Indeed director and co-writer Todd Phillips' first feature was in fact 2000's Road Trip, and his second was the hilarious 'Old School', and it particularly shares the latter's theme of misbehaving buddies old enough to know better.<br/><br/>The girls are an afterthought, either villains, super bitches, or sweet caring and perfect like Heather Graham's hot stripper/mom. But the accusations of misogyny are missing the point. This movie's not about the girls, but the friendships between the dudes.<br/><br/>If the territory is familiar, the execution is not without its' charms. In particular, the charming weirdness of Alan, Tracy's brother, with his fat Jesus appearance and his sweet, innocent yet insane personality (Zach Galifianakis) a counterpoint to the worldly cool of Bradly Cooper's Phil, and geeky dentist Stu (played by Ed Helms). These 3 musketeers spend most of the movie trying to piece together what happens the night before (when Zach's character accidentally slipped them all a date rape drug instead of Ecstasy), which somehow involves a real life tiger, an actual baby, a missing family heirloom/wedding ring belonging to Stu, and the mysterious disappearance of their friend and husband-to-be Doug (Justin Bartha).<br/><br/>As road movies go, The Hangover is a fun ride, hitting all the right notes with such fun ingredients, including a cameo from an air-drumming Mike Tyson, but the film never quite lives up to its' potential, and is likely to provoke laughter among the more literal-minded American viewers at which it is aimed, as the US reviews of this movie largely confirm. For the more discerning British viewer, however, some goofy ingredients like a tiger, a hooker with a wedding ring and date rape drugs will not compensate for the hit and miss humour of the movie, and a slight shortage of wittier banter or richer characterisation. For me, Phil isn't enough of a bastard, Stu isn't enough of a dork, and Alan could be just a touch weirder - in the directors' similar former movie Old School, the characters played by likes of Owen Wilsion, Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn are just bigger and brasher, making for more fun. The Hangover, then ; like a great breakfast with some awesome ingredients after a great, messy night out, only slightly undercooked."

","When a movie is funny, even though you have seen some of it's funniest moments in the trailer, you know you have a winner. Hangover, which does have some similarities to the movie ""Very Bad Things"", but does not sport the same dark humor, is a comedy that works for many reasons and was therefor successful.<br/><br/>The actors: Be it Bradley Cooper, who deservedly gets the main (active) role here, was a hoot when he was on Alias (JJ Abrams TV Show). Here he can display his comedic potential more than in ""He's not that into you"". Zach Galifianakis is a bit odd and might scare a few people off, but he is a perfect fit (no pun intended). Ken Jeong, whom I've seen in several comedies in the last few months and many other comedians (and a cameo here and there) really make a wonderful ensemble (if you can avoid it, don't watch the trailer, before you see the movie, one cameo in particular is just so much better, if you don't know what's gonna hit you ... again no pun intended).<br/><br/>The story is pretty simple and you have to stretch your disbelief a bit, but it's all for the sake of really good comedy. And the ending is just perfect too. Everything fits and even though I don't know what they really would do in a sequel (there are rumors), I'd love to see one! :o)"
"zetes","6","4","12","7 June 2009"," It's okay, but if you've been bombarded by the ads you've mostly already seen it
","I was wary of seeing this, because I've really disliked Todd Phillips previous films, which include Starsky & Hutch and Old School. I just find them tremendously poorly written and directed. And, yes, that does matter, even in a comedy. Timing is everything, and Phillips hasn't any timing. The reason I did go see this movie is for one of its actors, Zach Galifanakis, one of the funniest comedians of today. Bonus points for Ed Helms, who was probably the best of his generation of Daily Show correspondents. Galifanakis is one of the most oddball guys around, with a low-key style that's definitely a breath of fresh air in an industry now lead by Dane Cook. So does he overcome Phillips general horribleness? Yes. Well, he does. He runs away with the movie without trying. The movie doesn't triumph in the end, though. I have to admit, that's due a lot to the fact that the ads for this film have been relentless. The first trailer gives away about 70% of the movie's best jokes. And I was watching The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien most of Friday morning on Hulu, and the ads there filled me in on about 15% more of the jokes. So, yeah, they gave away about 90% of the jokes in the ads. And of the remaining 10%, there's only maybe one gag that floored me. This movie will definitely play best to those who haven't heard anything about it. Trying to judge it objectively, as if I hadn't seen all the ads, I'd still say that a ton of jokes fall flat anyway. Like I said, timing, and Phillips doesn't have any. He likes to continue on for too long a lot of the time. I also greatly disliked the movie's lead, Bradley Cooper. I guess it's not too big of a problem, as Galifanakas is never upstaged by him. Nor is Helms, even if he doesn't get the best material. Cooper is there, I think, to draw in women. He's the kind of guy women love and men hate. In short, he's great looking, but a total jerk. The film tries to play him off as a semi-sensitive man when all is said and done, but I never bought it."

I've been to see this in theater and everybody laughed.. <br/><br/>don't mind me wrong, but this is almost a story for X-files, as usually if I'm trying to attend a movie, which was described as ""comedy"" most of the people are turning their heads and don't believe, how dumb you must be laugh at it.. <br/><br/>so people, go for it, its worth trying, you wont be disappointed, you actually find out yourself laughing.. :) I give it a solid 9, a big surprise for me.."

","I as well as my wife truly enjoyed this movie and neither of us expected to. In fact, the entire theater broke up laughing more often than not - and at the appropriate times too. One odd comment is that a family brought their son, perhaps aged 3, to this one and even he laughed at several funny slapstick sort of moments. This kid's laughter caused others like us around him to laugh even more.<br/><br/>As a note about kids; this movie definitely earned its R rating. I suppose a 3 year old isn't badly affected by this movie because all the R stuff went over his head, but if you are offended by sex jokes or situations, avoid this one at all costs. Both my wife and I were surprised at how much one can get into an R rating. We thought we'd stumbled into some other rating but then again, I don't know what else their is either.<br/><br/>Mostly what's fun about this movie is that it has a good spirit. It's not mean although some of the situations the 'boys' get themselves into can feel pretty tense. If you'll enjoy this movie depends if you have a sense of the absurd as well as if you feel comfortable with openly sexual situations. If you say ""No"" to either of those, you just can't enjoy this thoroughly modern absurdest comedy."

","Four friends go to Las Vegas to give one of them, Doug (Bartha), a bachelor party he will never forget. The next morning three of them wake up with no memory of what happened the night before and they can't find Doug.<br/><br/>This movie is a perfect example for not believing the hype when it comes to comedies. The new rule is if the movie is hyped too much (and it was), don't go see it, or leave the DVD on the shelf. This new rule should become a law. I'm working on that. <br/><br/>No good lines, just the usual banter when not one of them can remember anything. Eventually, they find clues that tells them things, but not the whole story. No good physical comedy either. Nothing was funny. No one stepped forward with the kind of timing comedy demands. No one. Oh, there are some gross comments, but I wouldn't call them funny or even humorous. I guess they were expected to be made. <br/><br/>And, here they are in Las Vegas. One would think there would be more shots of Vegas than there was. Total loss here. At this point I am wondering if the director was one of the three and forgot he had a movie to direct. Sad is all I can say.<br/><br/>I would simply call this a slice of life as would happen to you and to me. Nothing funny, just straight up concern for what happened and where is Doug? That kind of slice. No one even tried to be funny. See? Also, I am convinced there was a reason that the actors weren't nationally known. Well, except for Jeffrey Tabor, but his character didn't go to Vegas. <br/><br/>Wait a minute. I did laugh once. When the three are hauled into the police station and to get out of the damage they did, they made a deal and volunteered to be tasered to show school children what happens when someone is tasered. Kind of OMGish, but I have to admit to laughing.<br/><br/>Now I must issue a warning. They find the camera and the camera pictures tell them all they need to know about that night when they couldn't remember what happened. These pictures run during the credits and do show nudity, and simulated sex. Again, there is also nothing funny in these pictures. Just some are crude.<br/><br/>After watching many of these so-called comedies I just know I need to find my real home planet. In the meantime, I am going to abide by the new rule.<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, via the pictures at the end. Nudity: Yes, via the pictures at the end. Language: Yes."
"jefbtheone","10","2","5","19 December 2009"," critique for the critical critics
","From reading the reviews on IMDb and looking at the ratings of many movies, I now understand why it always seems a bit skewed. It is because generally the critics look for certain things in a movie, such as originality, creativity, great plot....but also decency. <br/><br/>Tasteless comedies, pointless action movies and gory thrasher flicks get destroyed by critics. People need to appreciate a movie for what it is and have an open mind. Face the fact that you cannot be a critic for all types of movies unless you generally like those types of movies. I'm not going to post a rating for GI Joe because I'm not into military movies (other than maybe Full Metal Jacket which is in a category of its own). <br/><br/>If you don't like dirty, unrealistic, ridiculous rated R comedies then why are you posting a rating? I would guarantee the same close-minded people that gave The Hangover a rating under a 6 probably also hated Knocked Up, Grandma's Boy, Porky's, and Clerks 2. <br/><br/>The Hangover was funny, fun-filled and wild from beginning to end. Zack Galifanakias is a stand up comedian and is well-respected. If you don't think he's funny (for some odd reason) then give your sense a humor a sanity check. Ed Helms is on The Office. He is also a real comedian and actually The Office is a funny show (at least most human beings I know think so). If you don't think he's funny neither so be it. <br/><br/>Okay - so the movie had a similar theme as Dude Where's My Car. The concept behind The Hangover is actually a bit more interesting considering it involves a bachelor party (if you think bachelor parties are lame and offensive then I seriously doubt you would like any dirty rated R comedies), a Vegas stripper, a cardcounter, a baby caught up in the mix, a mattress on a roof, and Mike Tyson, Ken Jeong and Mike Epps having a whole lot of fun cracking jokes and whatnot. A combination of an idiot savant, alpha male and a feeble nerd is actually a lot better than Ashton Kutcher and Sean William Scott acting like boneheads. The comedic brilliance behind this movie runs a lot deeper than some of these straight-to-the-point, predictable, basic comedies like The Proposal, What Happens in Vegas, and I Love You Man (which I respect all 3 of these movies). <br/><br/>If you open your mind and truly enjoy a nice, dirty comedy, you might actually think it's funnier than classics like Airplane, Blazing Saddles, 40 yr Old Virgin, and Clerks. It is up there with the best of the best. I saw it twice and laughed throughout the whole movie."

","While THE HANGOVER has ONE fun moment it's quite illogical. Even a comedy should have some logic to it. I know it made lot's of money and had some critical acclaim, but there are too many odd moments that don't make sense. SPOILER ALERTS: A) THE SUITE. After the big night, the room looks like a tornado went through it or even a major earthquake...but later in the day when the guys return, the suite is just as it was when they originally arrived. No way could the room have been fixed up in a few short hours. It would have taken days of weeks to re-new it. ILLOGICAL. B) THE BABY. How could a baby be miss placed in a cabinet for such a long time. It would have suffocated. The Mother should have been arrested for child abuse and be put up for adoption. And leaving the baby in the car for so long a time? And what happened to it later in the film after it's so called ""mother"" got it back? ILLOGICAL. C) THE LION. It was dangerous and wild when they saw it in the bathroom. When the guys took the lion back to where it belonged,no one NOTICED it? Incredible. When in the car it clawed and damaged the inside of the car. Earlier then the ""kidnapped"" the lion, how then did they get the tiger out of the house, into the car, into the lobby to the Hotel without people noticing and not being clawed and mangled or harmed at all. If it was wild when they discovered it, how was it tame enough to get it in the room? ILLOGICAL. D) THE CHICKEN. How did a chicken get into the room in the first place, and what was the purpose of it, other than being stupid. ILLOGICAL E) THE Asian. What gives here? How did they get him naked and into the police trunk? Why did he wait a whole day before pounding and making himself known? He didn't suffocate? ILLOGICAL.<br/><br/>In movies of this ilk, don't the writers READ what they write? Doesn't the director or actors question these insane and bizarre circumstances and inconsistencies? Doesn't anyone CARE to make a movie that makes sense, even if it's just a little sense? Maybe it's let's make an inane movie, hope the young people of America fall for it and TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN.<br/><br/>I'm sure for those who loved this movie will have to agree to the above plot holes.<br/><br/>Oh, and performances are really bad, especially the guy playing the fat, dumb airhead. Ugh!! What planet did HE come from? An the ""masterbating"" baby was obsence.<br/><br/>."

","I heard from ""word of mouth"" that this was to be a must see, hilarious comedy. It started off really well, and I give it credit for ""reversing the process"" versus the standard formulaic screenplay ""structure"". Somewhere in Act II it began to get a bit flat. The caricatures over ""characters"", the implausibility issues, and most of all THE VULGARITY. To me the movie deserves it's place (albeit, as does the other 99% of comedies and romantic comedies) in the ""bin of mediocrity and cheap gimmicks"". The reason for the negative review is due to the expectations I had going in. I was expecting something truly remarkable. It was not that. I'm 35, and haven't quite figured out this ever growing paradigm: ""vulagarity-is-funny"". I couldn't believe there were 5 year old kids in the theater.

","The Hangover centers around four friends and their attempt to understand the events of the previous night. Doug is getting married and he and two of his friends Stu, who is henpecked, and Phil, who doesn't appreciate what he has, are going to celebrate his bachelor party in Las Vegas. Alan, Doug's annoying soon to be step brother, wants to tag along and Doug says it's okay much to the chagrin of Stu and Phil. The four toast on the roof of their hotel and the next thing they know they are waking up without any idea of what happened the night before and they can't find Doug. Stu, Alan, and Phil must figure out what happened and find Doug before his wedding later that day.<br/><br/>The plot of The Hangover is much more original and complex than most comedies. The fact that they have to figure out what happened with what they find makes for an interesting almost backward telling of the story. They and the audience are given the end result and both have to figure out what led up to it. It's also fun because you get to find out what everything means as the characters do. Another really amazing aspect of The Hangover was the amount of jokes they would cram into each scene. Whether they were funny or not every scene would just have joke after joke.<br/><br/>All the characters are funny and interesting in their own way. Zach Galifianakis' performance as Alan is one of the best break out comedy performances I have ever seen. Ed Helms and Bradley Cooper also do great in both of their first big roles. Even the minor characters that only get a few lines manage to squeeze some comedy out of their very small roles, which is another thing that sets this apart from other comedies.<br/><br/>I was somewhat disappointed in the ending however. I found it to be a bit predictable and a tad too perfect. Rarely will a comedy have a good ending though, so that isn't a big deal.<br/><br/>So in short, The Hangover is not only one of the best movies of 2009, but one of the best comedies ever."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","2","5","13 June 2009"," Foul but fresh, ""Hangover"" is unforgettable
","It's nice to thoroughly enjoy a comedy this decade without catching a single whiff of Apatow. The fact that audiences are eating up the boundary-crossing humor of ""The Hangover"" this summer and the famous producer of ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad"" nor any of his cronies (Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd, Jonah Hill, etc.) don't have so much as a finger print on it might be over half the reason for its praise.<br/><br/>Starring rising leading man Bradley Cooper (""Wedding Crashers,"" ""Yes Man""), Ed Helms (""The Office"") and stand-up comic Zach Galifianakis, ""The Hangover"" doesn't boast the stylings of any comedic actors that we've already been beaten to death with by Hollywood in the last ten years and they're all extremely talented. Their characters are incredibly well-developed and free of too much stereotype, their comedic timing excellent and the concept they're thrown into so perfect you can't believe it hasn't been done before.<br/><br/>Two days before their friend Doug's (Justin Bartha of ""National Treasure"") wedding, the aforementioned characters head out for a night in Las Vegas as do many a bachelor party. But ""The Hangover"" doesn't show their night out, instead it takes us straight to the next morning where they wake up to find strange animals in their room, one is missing a tooth and the groom-to-be is missing. And of course they don't remember a thing.<br/><br/>Todd Phillips, director of ""Old School,"" another comedy that for its time brought us new comedians and situations keeps the timing and revealing funny moments at a healthy pace. Every time we think it doesn't get funnier or more ridiculous, it does. The writing team of Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, who delivered last winter's notable flop ""Four Christmases"" really hit it big here. Having character retrace their footsteps and discover their debauchery of the previous night rather than showing it gives the trend toward R-rated comedy a new set of wheels. The gags here are nothing all that foreign to us, but with an unfamiliar cast of talented actors it feels pretty new. Everything is just revitalized, given new life because the script really fits the characters.<br/><br/>I didn't particularly like Cooper previously, but he gets more of a chance to exercise his range with a character that's not stale. Helms can truly be a foul-mouthed funny kind of guy, but his nerdy girlfriend-whipped character Stu is perfect because it forces him to hold back, therefore making the moments he explodes funnier and more believable. Galifianakis is something else. He's the new funny we've been looking for. Alan is a horribly dumb, outrageously gutsy but sweet character with a child's heart. Galifianakis plays a wide range of comedy perfectly whether needing to hold back and be dumb and cute or go all out physically.<br/><br/>There are some gaping holes in ""The Hangover"" like the fact that they are apparently hung over but do not eat or drink the entire film. Also, only Helms' character gets a true subplot - - everyone else is just there to make us laugh. This isn't one of those comedies with heart. Instead, we learn to love the characters because they're funny and we empathize with their ingeniously funny situation quickly. Still, some of the most original comedy I've seen in years. And don't forget the best and most boundary-pushing credits sequence ever. No question now that this is the era of dirty comedy and ""The Hangover"" delivers some of its finest."

","Clearly lots of people enjoyed this movie and even found it funny, so I certainly don't intend to insult what appears to be the majority, by suggesting that they don't know what they are talking about. Taste and humour are very personnel, so please read this review as one man's opinion.<br/><br/>The humour on display here, strikes no cultural accord with me, yet is clearly popular in the US, which leads me to assume that this is idiosyncratically American humour (or should that be 'humor'?), though I mean no disrespect in drawing this conclusion. To me it was unsubtle and based almost entirely on put-downs and pratfalls - it was not sympathetic or comfortable; one would definitely have to laugh at someone, there was never that warm inclusive moment when one felt included in a instant of shared humour.<br/><br/>As one would expect from the title the story as a whole was very predictable: This film was always going to rely on the set-up and delivery with the punch line, being less relevant, but not unimportant, since this is where the the audience would expect to find satisfaction: the themes, plot and sub-plots need resolution and vindication at this point and the extent to which this gives closure and satisfaction to the viewer is ultimately what helps to inform our overall impression. <br/><br/>The idea of this movie is fairly well used, but still has plenty of life left in it: we start with a seemingly impossible and certainly implausible scenario and then unwind the story to show how it came about, finally winding it on to the point at which all the issues are resolved. Ideally we should find as the story unfolds relationships and pre-existing problems are also solved and resolved as the characters we come to love, grow as a result of their trials and vicissitudes. Unfortunately I didn't like any of the characters and at best I could only claim to have come to tolerate some of them by the end of the movie. To this extend there seems to be something of a groundswell agreeing with me from my perusal of other comments.<br/><br/>The set-up when it finally happened - it would have been so much better as the opening scene - was reasonably inventive and certainly had scope, but... We had already met the characters by this stage - opinions were formed! I can not believe I am alone in finding the juxtaposition of the Alan Garner character and the baby as anything other than uncomfortable. For me as for every parent, I would assume, the idea of a baby with a character that has told us he is banned from going near schools is completely drained of humour.<br/><br/>From here on the film proceeded as a succession of vignettes and comedy sketches, with the main characters taking a level of damage that would have finished Wile E. Coyote, yet carrying on little scathed. There were uncomfortable moments, but there were no moments of tension. It wasn't that one did not care what happened to these people (though I didn't much), it was more a case that the 'comedy' seemed to imply the characters were indestructible in a cartoon-like way and therefore not requiring of our care or sympathy. <br/><br/>Which leads to the denouement (the punchline) which for me was sloppy and hurried. It was more a mad-cap ticking off of items on a list than a careful and satisfying final weaving of the various story threads into a triumphal and complete ending.<br/><br/>This is definitely for those who enjoy sight-gags and humour that tends to the slapstick end of the comedy spectrum. Those looking for dry humour, one-liners, satire, pastiche or the more cerebral styles will not be so well catered for.<br/><br/>I cannot pronounce against what is clearly not my cup of tea, but by defining what did not work for me I would hope to help others who's tastes might be more conformant with mine own."

I heard a lot of hype before going to see it, left the movie with a smile on my face, but my sides and cheeks didn't hurt. Thats how you can tell if a movie is really funny. Comparing it to recent comedies to come out I would rate it below the likes of Tropic Thunder, Pinapple Express, Borat, Superbad, 40 Year Old Virgin. It was probably on par with Step Brothers, Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Knocked Up (also overrated), etc. It was a solid, good funny movie, but has no business being on the top 250 list, and being one of the top comedies of all time (according to the list).

","In recent years, Judd Appatow has become a major influence on comedy films. His R-rated films that he directs and produces are what seems to be in style, comedy movie-wise. Despite Appatow's popularity, his films all seem to have one major flaw, and that's his characters. Seth Rogen has yet to play a likable character, and never in any recent R-rated comedies, do we actually get the consistent feeling that people care for each other. The Hangover, along with being a dirty comedy, also contains likable characters, and heart. It's a refreshing addition to recent R-rated comedy films.<br/><br/>Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms) are friends going to Vegas for their friend Doug's (Justin Bartha) bachelor party. Also going along is Doug's odd soon to be brother in law, Alan (Zach Galifianakis). After a wild night, the guys have forgotten what happened the night before, and Doug is missing. They have to follow various clues to figure out how they got to where they were, where Doug is, and various other amusing plot points.<br/><br/>It's hard to label this film. It's not really a sex-comedy, as there's not any overabundance of sex. It's not a drug comedy, because these guys aren't drug addicts, and the night before it not entirely their fault. It's more of just a comedy about 4-guys that happens to be rated R because of it's foul language and occasional nudity. It's nice to have an R rated comedy not out here to push the limits of the R-rating. Really, this is like the buddy comedy family film of rated R motion pictures.<br/><br/>The actors are great, and have a lot of chemistry together. Zack Galifianakis as Alan is really the one who brings most of the laughs with his performance as a complete moron, who's out of touch with reality, but completely likable. These guys may be profane and goofy, but they're still normal guys...again something Seth Rogen doesn't like to perform as. He always has to be angry.<br/><br/>There are a few problems in the film. It's got some spots that are missing laughs, and Mike Tyson is quite a bad actor, but aside from those, it's actually a well done buddy comedy and mystery. The box office has been gracious to this film, as well it should have been, and hopefully this R-rated comedy will show other producers of R-rated comedies, that comedies can still be successful even if the characters are likable (Amazing but true).<br/><br/>My rating: *** out of ****. 100 mins. R for some sex jokes, full frontal nudity, language and some drug use."

The result is the chaos only a fiancé could dream of: lost tooth, child, and tiger; marriage to a hooker; $80 K of debt; and some very perturbed waiting women at home. <br/><br/>The premise of their retracing the evening is a good one, providing a flashback with a detective edge.

","We've all been there. There have been nights where we've drank too much and can't remember everything. For Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and Alan (Zach Galfianakis), this happens on the bachelor party for their friend Doug (Justin Bartha). Unfortunately, the morning after, they realize that they lost Doug.<br/><br/>The humor in ""The Hangover"" comes from the bizarre situations that the characters find themselves in. Or more specifically, that they got themselves into the night before, and are just now remembering it. This type of humor can work, although a film that completely relies on it (like this one) runs the risk of making the material get dry and tired. Fortunately, director Todd Philips keeps things brief enough and the pace quick enough that this doesn't really become a problem.<br/><br/>It's hard to address the acting, because the actors play very familiar types (this is the film's biggest problem). Bradley Cooper is no stranger to playing a jerk (he got his big break in ""Wedding Crashers,"" although he's more sympathetic here). Ed Helms, while not being a stranger to comedy, is not a well known name. He's the worrywart who turns into a doormat whenever his over-bearing girlfriend is mentioned. Zach Galifianakis is the black sheep of the group, who's only along because he's going to be Doug's brother-in-law. Nevertheless, the comedy works because all of the principal cast members have a sizable amount of comic aptitude.<br/><br/>Not everything works (the movie feels underdeveloped--with a little more care, it could have been a masterpiece), but most of it does, and there are some very big laughs to be found throughout the 100 minute running time (the end credits alone are worth the price of a few admission tickets).<br/><br/>""The Hangover"" is comedy pure and simple. Nothing is understated, and it's not quirky. It's just plain funny."

","Hilarious storyline + Great Cast + Amazingly written <br/><br/>=the funniest movie in recent memory<br/><br/>This is not your average summer comedy. This is what i call the perfect medium of low and high comedy. With the exception to Zach Galifianakis, the cast is not full of colorful characters and hilarious antics, but rather letting the mysterious wonders that Las Vegas has to offer unfold for these gentlemen. This genuine work of art has some much of the high comedy that many of today's comedy's are missing, putting ordinary people in extraordinary situations. But also including the guilty pleasure that we all enjoy, the low comedy, especially Zach's hilarious performance and dialog. Actually, I am a firm believer that this film will be a jump start for Galifianakis's long career ahead.<br/><br/>This won't be one that will be forgotten anytime soon. You will find yourself going right back to the theater to watch it again. Can't wait for The Hangover 2!!"

Not bad, but what it could have been. Shame Shame. Lost op on this one. Could have been a Classic. Would have really enjoyed seeing how they stole the cop car, didn't have to be an elaborate chase scene with 10 cars following close behind like a Tony Scott or Michael Mann picture, just something for us to latch onto that's all. Also would have enjoyed seeing why and how they were so crazy at the wedding chapel. What went down so unusual that the proprietor is totally beside himself of the night's (before) events. What did the guy with no tooth do that made the guy consider him the craziest m—f—he had ever met. A 10 to 20 second outrageous clip would have sufficed, but no, we were denied that also. And why not show us a flashback of how they were kids and how they did that sleeping bag trick on their friend. Why not spend a half a day and get a couple of kid actors and do that for us. Why all the talk about last night and not show us?"

","In the first part, before Doug gets married, Philip, Stu, Alan & Doug travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor's party. However, on the very next morning, none of them have any memory of the last night and they must find Doug before the wedding can take place. It is the best part of the whole series. It is engaging to see their excursion all through Las Vegas, their experience with various individuals, some exceptionally odd as well and the peak, regardless of whether they can discover Doug or not is fascinating. The film is loaded with funniness and holds your breath. Music, direction, and screenplay are excellent. It's nice to have a virtual tour of Las Vegas and you might also wish to hang up with your friends thereafter watching this movie."

There are four men going to LA for a bachelor party before the wedding of a guy belonging to their group . The first night , instead of having alcohol they took a specific drug which make them unconscious and when they wake up in morning a guy is missing and they started finding him....
so the whole story is about this that what happen in that night after taking that drug which was unknown to them ...

Great USA comedies from over the years easily spring to mind; Some Like it Hot, Harvey, Nelson Dynamite, Brother Where Art Thou and on and on.

It has some very good comedy and the story itself is very interesting. I was laughing all the way from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Lets start with the characters. The three main leads are great.

You get that cozy feeling of belonging to the group that you get when watching TV sitcoms.<br/><br/>The things that happen are way over the top, but in a good way. I never expected all of those things to happen. The story is also very interesting, you want to know what happened as much as the characters in the film.

The script is pretty great too, I loved how little exposition there was and we still understood a lot of things.<br/><br/>In the end, The Hangover is just one of those movies that will keep you entertained throughout the whole run-time and you will really remember.<br/><br/>Don't watch the second and third one though, those really suck."

","It's not very often these days that a comedy film comes along that is a) genuinely hilarious and b) like no other comedy movie that has come before it, but that's exactly what we got in 2009 when the first Hangover movie was released. This is a hilarious film all round, from the plot to the script and characters - whoever was behind the casting for this film got it absolutely spot on.<br/><br/>Part of the reason why this film is so funny is that it doesn't even take itself seriously. The plot is so ridiculous and it's almost like they were trying to cram as many stupid scenes into the film as possible. 'The Hangover' is an example of how a comedy movie should be done... aim to make people laugh and the rest will take care of itself.

"tankace","9","1","2","17 April 2016"," This how R-rated comedies should be
","Hangover is a great comedy for a number of reasons.Firstly its story is original ,but understandable at the same time: four friends have a bachelor party in Las Vegas and the next morning have no idea what happen, how and why. A simple story,in a comedy, is great because you can add on it whatever you like and it will ,still, work.Secondary the majority of the characters that our protagonists meet ,are either likable or hilariously over the top. Third and last the jokes are at times quit cruel and when someone react ,in that crazy situation, he or she starts cursing, which is logical if you think what has happen and in the duration of a single night!! To be more analytical, the last part is were the R-rated comes and gives the felling of realism ,be honest here even the most calm person you know ,found himself( lets be real girls' hangovers are boring) in such a situation, he would in hulk mud for a long time. In a sense Hangover is masculine comedy with the proper humour.The only problem that, this movie has is its sequel, those movies ,which should not exist at the first place,overload this open and shot case with out any good reason apart from the studio make more money, in other words the usual weakness of the comedy and horror genres, after a great movie came out unnecessary sequels and bad imitators. In the end, I really like this movie and if you are a man , it should be in your favorites comedies."

These three guys are hilarious together on the screen, and they brought so much to the screen with their individual roles and characters. I think that having Ken Jeong in the movie was just great, because he is hilarious and really spiced up the movie tremendously.<br/><br/>The movie is nicely paced and never really slows down once it hits the high gear. So strap yourself in and get ready for a hilarious ride through Las Vegas.<br/><br/>I was more than genuinely entertained by ""The Hangover"", and I was laughing a lot throughout the course of the entire movie.

","The film features four friends and is about a stag night gone very bad in the city of Vegas. The comedy is strictly a R- rated comedy. They get drunk and wake up next morning in their hotel room to find the groom(Doug) missing. There's a chicken wandering around, a baby in the cupboard and a tiger in the bathroom. The entire hotel room is in a disarray and they simply cant remember anything that happened to him last night. With time passing by, they slowly come to know about the adventures they had last night including a showdown with Mike Tyson. Meanwhile, a mafia gang orders them to give them money in return of their missing friend. The gang leader Chow(Ken Jeong) delivers one of the best comic performances. The final show is a race with time as the 4 friends just manage to reach in time for Doug's marriage. All of the 4 characters has a story to tell regarding their situation in their personal life. For example, Stu, the dentist is ruled by his bitchy girlfriend and he wants to let go of her. Alan(Zach) delivers a breakthrough performance and carries the film on his shoulders. The film is a laugh riot with a lot of vulgarity and it deserves every letter of it's R rating. The sequences that happened in the night leading to Doug's absence are hilarious and something not to be missed. Go, watch the film, it's a gem of a comedy."

","The Hangover (2009): Dir: Todd Phillips / Cast: Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, Justin Bartha, Heather Graham: The dawn of devious excitement for a bachelor party gone wrong. Four friends travel to Las Vegas only to wake up with a tiger in the washroom, a baby in the closet, and the groom completely misplaced. They search frantically for answers leading to extremely hilarious encounters and plot turns. One of the best comedies of the year with a screenplay with endless hilarity in the exaggeration of alcohol intake. Directed by Todd Phillips who previously made such comedies as Starsky and Hutch, School for Scoundrels and Old School but this is his masterwork particularly during the closing credits when a digital camera fills in all answers. Bradley Cooper plays a school teacher and ladies man. Ed Helms is involved in a controlled relationship until this trip leaves him suddenly married and with one less tooth. Zach Galifianakis steals every scene he is in with his ignorance to good fashion and an inability to say or do the correct thing. Justin Bartha plays the misplaced groom full of promise of the glories ahead. Heather Graham is a gem as a stripper whom Helm's learns that he married during the night's events. They are in way over their heads as innocent fun becomes a road trip of consequences led on by drugs, alcohol and absolutely no recollection of any of it. Score: 10 / 10"
"Gideon24","7","1","2","9 April 2015"," It's Not Art, but it is funny.
","The Hangover is a raunchy, ridiculously over-the-top, yet consistently amusing 2009 comedy that isn't concerned with political correctness, logic, continuity, originality, or realism, but still delivers the laughs. I am classifying in it my ""Just put your brain in check and enjoy"" file.<br/><br/>The story bears more than a passing resemblance to a 2000 comedy called Dude, Where's my Car?, though it takes the premise of that film to a more detail-oriented level. This film is the story of Doug (Justin Bartha), a guy getting married in a couple of days who takes off to Vegas for a bachelor party with his friends Phil (Bradley Cooper), a married schoolteacher and dad and Stu (Ed Helms), a dentist you can serve on pie he is so whipped by his girlfriend (Rachael Harris), and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) an insecure and neurotic mess who has trouble keeping his pants on and is also Doug's soon to be brother-in-law.<br/><br/>The story then cleverly skips over the party itself and as we enter the guys' hotel suite the next morning, we see Stu and Phil passed out on the floor with a chicken crawling over Stu's head, a woman sneaking out of the room, a tiger in the bathroom, and Doug is nowhere to be found. The guys than wake up and actually find a baby in a cabinet. <br/><br/>As the guys venture out to find Doug, further investigation reveals that the guys stole a cop car, that Stu married a hooker (Heather Graham) and that the tiger belongs to former heavyweight champ Mike Tyson.<br/><br/>Though I think I may have already revealed too much, I still think there are plenty of raunchy and unexpected laughs found along the way here. Director Todd Phillips somehow manages to keep a tight rein on Jon Lucas and Scott Moore's screenplay, which really can't stand a lot of scrutiny.<br/><br/>The cast serves the story well with standout work from Galifianakis and Helms and Phillips keeps things moving at a nice pace so that you don't find yourself looking at your watch. Make sure you stay tuned through the closing credits. Looking forward to the sequel."

Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis are all fantastic in the film and their chemistry together is insane and really carries this film into the legendary status it has become. The rest of the cast does a really good job as well with the meetings with these characters being really enjoyable and helping fuel the adventure.

","The genre of this film is comedy and it hits the nail on the head. It is typical comedy but it also raised the bar on future comedies. The storyline of this film was classic. The film starts out with a distressed bride getting a phone call that her soon to be husband, Doug, is missing. The film then backtracks to two days before the phone call. We now see the groom and realize that he and his friends, Phil, Stu, and Alan, are preparing to head to Las Vegas for his bachelor party. When the four friends get to Vegas they check into their hotel and toast to a great night. The film then progresses to the next morning when Phil, Stu, and Alan realize that they cannot remember anything from the night before and Doug is missing. The next day and half consists of the three friends finding out clues as to what they did that night and trying to find the Doug. They go on wild adventures to find Doug but on the morning of the wedding Phil calls the bride to tell her that they cannot find the groom. While he is on the phone Stu finally figures out where Doug is and takes the phone from Phil and tells the bride they are on there way. They make it to the wedding and the groom and bride are finally married. At the end of the film, a camera is found from the night the four friends cannot remember so they go through the photos one time and then delete all the evidence of the crazy, wild night they had in Vegas.<br/><br/>The editing of the film was appropriate. Fade in; fade out was used for many of the scenes to get the affect that time was passing. For example, when the four friends toast to a great night the scene fades to the next morning so we know we will not actually see what happened during the night. There were also a couple of establishing shots. For example, when the friends first enter Las Vegas we see a shot of the whole city and when the friends are rushing to get back to get the wedding we see full view of the desert to see just how far they have to go. Continuity editing was the major editing of the film though. Majority flowed together and the transitions were smooth and appropriate.<br/><br/>The cinematography supported the mood of the film. Panning was used quite a lot, mainly when the friends were planning on what to do next which is through most of the film. A steadicam was also used so the actors looked as if they were walking towards us. It made us feel involved in the film. Close-ups and medium close ups were the main angles used throughout the film. All these shots supported the mood because it made the audience feel as though we were apart of the crazy night and trying to figure out what exactly happened.<br/><br/>The sound was very effective. Majority of the film used a soundtrack. The soundtrack was mainly party songs so that we got the feel that it was a wild night and the friends had the time of their lives. When music wasn't playing, actual sound was used. It was a balanced blend. The score made me want to gather my friends and party so we could have an epic night.<br/><br/>The film was meant to be funny and show the viewers that crazy, wild nights always seem to happen Vegas. It also gives the impression that if you want to have fun nights like the one depicted, you should head to Vegas with your best friends. I also have biases towards Vegas because I have been there several times with my own friends. Although we did not have nights to the extent of The Hangover, we had nights that we will never forget. Overall, this film was quite enjoyable because it will have you laughing the whole time and I would recommend the movie to anyone who asked about. They are sure to be in for a lot of laughs."

The idea of a group of guys waking up after a night of boozing with no memory of what happened and having to retrace their steps is done well, following a certain logic for all its craziness. The performances are quite good, and in spite of its mix of booze, drugs, prostitutes, boxes, tigers, chickens, and tasers, there's actually something kind of sweet about this story, although I'm not quite sure why.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's funny, watch it."

","This is one of the funniest movies of recent years-much funnier than the sequels. Four friends head out to Las Vegas for a bachelor party before one of them has a wedding. They wake up the next morning-with no memory of the previous night, one friend and one friend's tooth missing, and a tiger and a baby in the room. They spend the remainder of the film trying to piece together the events of the previous evening.<br/><br/>My favorite scenes are the ones in Heather Graham's apartment, the one with Mike Tyson, the one where ZG tries to make ""blood brothers"" with them, and the wedding scene.

"The-Sarkologist","8","1","2","5 November 2013"," A tribute to those wasted nights out that we have all had
","This is one of those movies that will appeal to those of us who have woken up in the morning and cannot remember a thing about what happened the night before, but one thing you know is because you feel so bad means that you must have had a lot of fun. However, this film turns that experience into a murder mystery – minus the body (and the detectives). Rather, the heroes of The Hangover wake up in a hotel in Las Vegas with a bunch of stuff, and a missing groom, and have forty eight hours to work out what happened to him before they have to tell his bride to be that he is not coming back.<br/><br/>This movie is great the first time around, but even when you know what has happened, and the solution to the puzzle, it is still a heaps fun movie to watch. In a way it sets a standard that other movies of a similar genre are going to find hard to beat. In a way it has set a new standard with the good old detective movies, namely because it appeals to those of us who have got so wasted the night before that we simply cannot remember a thing about that night, and then spend the next day, and sometimes your entire life, trying to piece all of the clues together to actually try and work out what it was you did that night and why it was so fun."

","""The Hangover"" is the first movie of one epic trilogy. I think that this movie is the best of this trilogy because it was something that I had never seen. When I first watched this movie I laughed very much I found it a very interesting and pioneering movie.<br/><br/>Zach Galifianakis makes a really great interpretation and I learned him from this movie. I also liked the interpretations of Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms and I think that both of them had a great time while filming and that is something that appears in whole of the movie.<br/><br/>As you can understand from the title of the movie, all the movie has to do with a big Hangover and the memory of these three friends who lost their memory..."
"jimbo-53-186511","7","1","2","21 October 2013"," Plenty of laughs and likable characters makes the Hangover a winner in my book
","I first watched the Hangover about 3 years ago and absolutely fell in love with it. Having watched it again this evening, I must admit that I didn't love it quite as much as the first time I watched it, but it is a still a winner in my opinion.<br/><br/>The plot is very simple and focuses on four friends Alan (Galifianakis), Phil (Cooper), Stu (Helms) and Doug (Bartha) all heading to Las Vegas for a bachelor party prior to Doug's wedding to Alan's sister Tracy (Sasha Barrese). Once in Vegas, the lads decide to celebrate Doug's last night of freedom in style which involves plenty of booze and plenty of gambling in the casinos. The following day the men all wake up worse for wear (as the title of the film implies), but there's a problem the groom Doug is missing and the lads can't remember what they did the night before and therefore they have no idea where to start looking. The men find themselves in a race against time to try and find Doug in order to get him back to LA in time for his wedding....<br/><br/>There are several aspects that make the Hangover work. Firstly there is the script - John Lucas and Scott Moore have clearly put some thought into the script as there were many surprises along the way (most of which are as a direct consequence of the lads drunken behaviour). I found some of the twists in the Hangover to be pretty effective and as a result I found myself more and more engrossed in the film. Secondly, all the characters had a certain likable quality about them. Although, they still cause mayhem 'post hangover' they all still have a certain charm about them and a lot of the time they find themselves in ridiculous situations and doing ridiculous things all in a bid to try and find their lost friend so for that reason it is hard to dislike them. Thirdly, the chemistry between the 3 leads was also really good. Cooper, Galifianakis & Helms all worked well together - they are all very different characters who all think very differently which caused them to bicker quite a lot (which was funny in itself).<br/><br/>The Hangover is a very funny film with a few surprises that can be found along the way. Whilst, I don't believe it is the funniest film I've ever seen, it certainly is a funny film that you should definitely check out."
"CinemaClown","Null","1","2","7 October 2013"," Where Most Comedies Fail, The Hangover Succeeds.
","Freshly envisioned, skilfully directed & brilliantly performed, The Hangover is a roller-coaster ride of quality entertainment that simply ranks amongst the finest comedies to come out in the past decade for the film is full of hilarious moments, crazy characters & an engaging storyline that never goes dull for a moment.<br/><br/>The Hangover tells the story of 4 friends who travel to Las Vegas to celebrate the bachelor party of one of their own only to wake up the next day with no memory of what happened the previous night & discover that the bachelor himself is missing. The plot follows their search as they try to find him before his impending marriage.<br/><br/>Directed by Todd Phillips, The Hangover brims with freshness that's not easily found in the genre of comedy today and is crafted with deft elegance. Phillips' direction does complete justice to its quality screenplay & balances all aspects of storytelling from start to finish for there are enough genuinely funny moments that never feel forced & characters are finely refined as well.<br/><br/>The Hangover also benefits from its dynamic camera-work & effective use of warm colour palette that captures Las Vegas in all its glory. Editing is one of its finest aspects for the story is briskly paced, trims out the unnecessary moments & keeps the entertainment going throughout its 100 minutes of runtime, and the soundtrack incorporates songs that simply fit its narrative.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, Ed Helms & Justin Bartha in the role of four friends, and all of them chip in with breakthrough performances with Zach being the highlight. However, what makes this film amazing isn't its characters but the interplay between them, and the chemistry between these actors goes a long way in making that part work in the film's favour.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Hangover is a highly enjoyable, wildly entertaining & endlessly fun cinema that's polished in all aspects of filmmaking, manages to retain its quality all the way & is a welcome addition to the genre of R-rated comedy. It's not without its shortcomings but the positives far outweighs the negatives while the charm of its cast brushes away the other complaints. And where most comedies fail, The Hangover simply succeeds."

","With the exception of one character (more later in this review), I found this movie filled with male, sophomoric humor. Having said that most of the females in the audience also enjoyed it; kind of an equal opportunity movie to offend all sexes equally.<br/><br/>Unlike most trailers that show all the humor in a 60 second clip, this movie will throw so many funny situations at you so quickly that you will be giggling non-stop for the first hour.<br/><br/>Then, the introduction of the Mr. Chow part - essential for the plot, but played WAY over the top by Ken Jeong - became distracting. Up to that point, Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Justin Bartha, and Zach Galifianakis carried the movie briskly and with real chemistry. Zach Galifianakis, in particular, was brilliant. Who is this guy???! The last 30 minutes were not as good as the first hour and I found the ending somewhat forced.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, everyone I talked with after the movie will be seeing it again. This is one movie that is as funny as advertised.<br/><br/>Of course, I will get flamed by those who find this kind of humor too low brow for their tastes. Hey, just know what you're getting into when you see this."

","I saw this movie a year after its release. During that year, The Hangover was being talked about by everyone. Everyone was saying how good and funny it was. <br/><br/>After seeing it, I must say that I was disappointed. I laughed a couple of times. But only because I was in a good mood and some jokes were smart. But these were forced laughs. The movie was well written with a good cast and story line. But it wasn't that funny. I didn't laugh on impulse once. For me, a good comedy is one that really makes you laugh, and you get really connected with the characters. Cause that's what comedies are supposed to do right? Make you laugh.<br/><br/>The Hangover just didn't do that for me. I'm giving it an 8. For a couple of reasons. 1. It was well written. 2. Good story. 3. Good cast. 4. Many people seemed to enjoy it.<br/><br/>Maybe if I saw it when it came out, I would have enjoyed it more, but I don't think so. Personally I didn't like it because it didn't make me laugh once. But humor is subjective, so I'm not being too hard on it."

","This movie is just funny beyond belief and wait for it, it actually has a decent script to add on to it (We're calling it a movie at the request of Mr. Todd Phillips). Now what made this film great wasn't the scenarios that the Wolf Pack got themselves into, even though they were hilarious, but it was the dialogue that lead us into, through, and out of Vegas. The dialogue was so creative and in the end was hilarious and is almost instantly quotable (at least it was back when it came out in 09). With that and a cast that basically made everyone rich particularly Bradley Cooper and Zach Galifianakis, everything worked out. Much like every great movie that is marketable, it became the victim of a less then worthy sequel that wasn't written by Phillips and in the end will keep this film from being remembered as one of the best comedies of all time. Praying that this last sentence will be wrong but only time will tell."
"piratecannon","9","1","2","27 December 2012"," Modern Raunch at its Best
","Ever since Wedding Crashers, there seems to be a winning Hollywood formula for comedies: include as much shock value/gross out humor as possible, and intermittently sprinkle in some scenes that allow actors to deliver equally shocking (and, of course, witty) dialogue that doesn't give the audience much chance to catch its breath for the duration of two hours. The Hangover sticks to this formula in many ways, but it also surpasses it on several levels. The random, seemingly haphazard nature of the events which occur in The Hangover are just enough to separate the film as a worthwhile entry into the ever- expanding catalogue of R-rated comedies.<br/><br/>If you've seen the trailers for The Hangover, you're already familiar with the plot. Doug Billings is getting married, and his buddies Phil and Stu have decided to treat him to a pre-wedding weekend bash in Las Vegas. Also along for the ride is Doug's soon to be brother-in-law, Alan (more about the brilliant performance of Zach Galifianakis later). Once there, the group quickly heads out for a night on the town. When they awaken the next morning, their $4200 per night villa is completely demolished, and there's a tiger in the bathroom. Strangely, they have absolutely no memory of the previous evening's occurrences. They soon discover that Doug is missing, and realize that in order to find him–and ensure that he's home in time for his own wedding–they have to play ""detective"" and figure out exactly what happened.<br/><br/>This is one of the few movies I've seen that actually benefits from a plot that feels cobbled together. It literally seems as if the writers decided that they needed: A) a baby in a cabinet, B) Mike Tyson singing, C) a stolen police car, D) a scene with the main players getting shot with a taser. All of this serves to highlight the eccentric nature of The Hangover and its characters, especially that of Alan Garner. Honestly, everyone else in the movie pales in comparison to Alan and his antics, be it his decision to use Carlos the baby as a puppet; his assumption that wearing white pants, a tee shirt, and satchel out onto the casino floor is perfectly acceptable; or his questioning the clerk at the front desk of Caesar's Palace about whether or not the actual Caesar lives there. Galifianakas delivers each and every one of his lines with an uncanny amount of deadpan wit that you almost feel sorry for everyone else–essentially, they're all playing the ""straight man"" to his character.<br/><br/>To avoid revealing too much about the developments in The Hangover, suffice it to say that there's no way they would've ever gotten out of Vegas given the stunts they pull. The movie is aware of its own ridiculousness, which is perhaps just as well, but I would've liked to have seen these guys really sweat things out and get their just desserts. With the exception of Alan, they all throw a few temper tantrums, but we all know how things will conclude–and, in the end, things do play out exactly as you'd expect them too, making this not quite as risky as, say, another ridiculous, self-aware comedy: Pineapple Express.<br/><br/>So, all of that taken into consideration, what's the verdict on The Hangover? It's funny–at times downright hilarious. In many ways, we've seen it all before, but the quirky nature of Alan–and the seemingly random plot developments–make it stand out. If you're looking for a carefree night at the movies, The Hangover is a sure bet."

","The thing that made this movie so good is that nobody saw it coming, these three guys who seemed to be lost in a world of adulthood get stuck with a baby and a missing Groom and a wedding that they need to get too, while they have no idea of what happened the night before. The movie delivers a shocker in the acting area and the script was funny to the core, that you don't feel you have seen this movie till you watch it a second time.<br/><br/>The Hangover was a big financial success and it helped propel the careers of the three lead actors, making more than 12 times its production cost, the studio just had to make a part II, which was not as good as this initial one, as it featured same people doing practically the same thing that led to what happened in the first hangover.<br/><br/>The movie plot was inspired by a real life event that happened to Tripp Vinson (a movie producer); Tripp had gone missing from his own Las Vegas bachelor party, blacking out and waking up in a strip club. Jon Lucas and Scott Moore took the tale and drafted a script which they sold to Warner Bros. for over $2 million. The movie director Todd Phillips, went ahead to add additional elements to the script to put in more life into it and extra adventures, he added such like Mike Tyson and his tiger, the baby, and the police cruiser.<br/><br/>The movie plot is about Vegas gone wrong; Doug (Justin Bartha) and Tracy (Sasha Barrese) are about to get married so Doug's two best friends Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms) decided to take him for a bachelor party in Vegas tagging along was Tracy's brother Alan (Zach Galifianakis). <br/><br/>While in Vegas, the four had a night out, and then the worst thing happened they woke up the next day knowing they had the time of their lives but can't remember what happened. To make it worse, there is a Tiger in the bathroom, the groom Doug is missing and they are with a baby whom they know not where he came from.<br/><br/>The movie was shot in like two weeks and it is a must watch to all movie lovers that is for sure, there is plan to make a third Hangover movie, the part II was released in 2011 it was not as critically accepted as the first, but the box office sales was just as impressive so with that on their side the studio will be taking a chance with a part three.

I have found most comedies over the last couple of years to be extremely worth to watch and I started to worry that I didn't have a sense of humour but this film proves that I was right and all the other comedies that have been made recently were wrong. The Hagover made me think that I should watch all the series of film in the future.

","No offense to Seth Rogen, Johan Hill, Paul Rudd, Will Farrell, et al, but what a refreshing sight it was to see a buddy/bromance movie without them starring in it. The guys, especially Galifianakis, in The Hangover all could hold their own and crack me up. Each had their own depth, each was interesting, though somewhat clichéd, and each I rooted for, despite their downfalls. What could've been the same ole, same ole bachelor party in Vegas movie turned out surprisingly original, funny, and at times, a suspenseful mystery. Three guy friends (and a future brother-in-law) head off to Vegas for the said bachelor romp two days prior to the groom, Doug's wedding. After a night they did forget, and loosing Doug, they must put the pieces together to find him and return him to LA and his bride. Along the way, they, of course, encounter the kooky characters you would expect from this type of comedy, as well as, a rooster, a tiger and Tyson, oh my. Being over-hyped prior to its release had me worried, as did the Tyson cameo, but both the movie and the former boxer delivered, tenfold. Even the movie, itself, was well shot. Vegas is shown as it really is: consistent construction – though they were as updated as they could be, still some unfinished projects in the film, such as Westgate at Planet Hollywood, have already been completed. Still, it was the most realistic footage of Vegas I've seen. Sure, it had some stock shots, but mostly it was real. All the men were hilarious, and it was nice they were given depth. But the bearded third wheel, Alan, really stood out with trueness and sympathy. Instantly one of my all-time favorite Vegas movies and I could see this becoming a future cult classic."

Two days before the wedding, the four men in the wedding party - Doug, Doug's two best buddies Phil Wenneck (Bradley Cooper) and Stu Price (Ed Helms), and Tracy's brother Alan Garner (Zach Galifianakis) - hop into Tracy's father's beloved Mercedes convertible for a 24-hour stag party to Las Vegas. Phil, a married high school teacher, has the same maturity level as his students when he's with his pals. Stu, a dentist, is worried about everything, especially what his controlling girlfriend Melissa (Rachael Harris) thinks. Because she disapproves of traditional male bonding rituals, Stu has to lie to her about the stag, he telling her that they are going on a wine tasting tour in the Napa Valley. Regardless, he intends on eventually marrying her, against the advice and wishes of his friends. And Alan seems to be unaware of what are considered the social graces of the western world. The morning after their arrival in Las Vegas, they awaken in their hotel suite each with the worst hangover. None remembers what happened in the past twelve or so hours. The suite is in shambles. And certain things are in the suite that shouldn't be, and certain things that should be in the suite are missing. Probably the most important in the latter category is Doug. As Phil, Stu and Alan try to find Doug using only what little pieces of information they have at hand, they go on a journey of discovery of how certain things got into the suite and what happened to the missing items. However they are on a race for time as if they can't find Doug in the next few hours, they are going to have to explain to Tracy why they are not yet back in Los Angeles. And even worse, they may not find Doug at all before the wedding.<br/><br/>There's even another character named Chow who comes toward the end of the movie.The reason why I mentioned the character is because he is one actor for whom Hangover must be watched!He is so damn funny! The direction is marvelous.<br/><br/>The dialogs are the icing of the cake.Special mention of those delivered by Chow in the end or even delivered by Zach Galifianakis at several scenes.<br/><br/>Performances: Hangover also works because of some superb performances delivered by its cast.Special mention of Zach Galifianakis who just simply stands out with his amazing comic timing.Bradely Cooper is very good.While Ed Helms is funny.Heather Graham,Sasha Barrese,Jeffrey Tambor and Rachael Harris are fine.

Sometimes it's good to watch something like Down the Periscope, Police Academy or the like. But usually those movies have a corresponding rating on IMDb. I do not see how Hangover is in any way superior to any of the movies of its kind. It is forgettable and bland. I do not say that it is completely unfunny, but neither is it original. If you need to waste about 2 hours of your life, while drinking a couple of beers with friends this movie is not a bad choice (although not the best in my opinion), but you would also not miss a thing if you never watched Hangover."

The movie manages to combine the smarts and observation of ""Juno"" with the absurdist situations of Marx brothers movies and frames all of it in an R-rated Las Vegas romp. The non-linear narrative structure makes for a re-watchable film that is destined to be a cultural touchstone along the lines of ""Stripes"", ""Better Off Dead"" and the ""Revenge of the Nerds"" series.

He's the sane and normal one so surely our world will be righted once we find him.<br/><br/>""The Hangover"" achieved greatness because people weren't expecting it. Hollywood didn't produce it, so to the masses, it came out of nowhere. It made Bradley Cooper a movie star, Zach Galifianakis a fearless comedian and gave Ed Helms the respect he deserved. I'm hoping Part II will do the same for Justin Bartha, but it's hard to come out of nowhere after Hollywood has hyped it for two years."

","""The Hangover"" is the newest hit comedy about a bachelor party gone wrong, when the groom goes missing, and the group of friends tries to remember what happened the previous night due to a terrible hangover. The film goes through Vegas, drugs, strippers, herpes, and so many things drinking can cause, as they try to find their friend before the wedding. ""The Hangover"" was a completely hilarious take on the famous bachelor party flicks. The film has the highest laughter, and the best expectations to be found. The casting of Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifanakis, Justin Bartha, and Ken Jeong were hilarious and impressive, but it's Galifanakis who stole the show in every scene he is in, with his quirky dialouge, and timing. Director Todd Phillips arranged the movie so well, and he made a movie that made me laugh out loud throughout. The film had a hilarious well-written script and a super cast, and the film will remind us what will happen if we take a ""guy's night out"" too far. This film had so many funny moments, we can't stop remembering them. The film was an awesome and hilarious flick. Now, I learned a valuable lesson on what will might happen at age 21, in Las Vegas, with bottles of beer in your hand, and containing a mother-loads of drunken herpes. ""The Hangover"", in my review, ""a truly hilarious flick to watch again and again."""
"french13-18-668469","8","1","2","27 April 2011"," Summary: A must see film that will have the entire family laughing.
","Todd Phillips (Director) has done a good job with ""The Hangover"" just as he has in a previous movie ""Old School"". Phillips previous movie pertaining to ""Old School"" is filled with good actors/actress, dialogue, and comedy. Both of Phillips movies ""Old School"" and ""The Hangover"" are full with comedy and action that will have tears coming out and on your knees. Phillips along with writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore have set out to do what they planned to delivery. Throughout this movie you will see the different in low-key lighting/high-key lighting, motifs, and angles (low/high) and the music as scenes are being transiting. The Hangover was filmed in Las Vegas, Nevada. Doug Billing is about to marry one of his friend's Alan Garner sister Tracy Garner in two days. Doug and Alan along with two of their other buddies, Phil Wenneck and Stu Price are off to Las Vegas for a couple of days for some male bonding. Phil, a high school teacher and married, tends to acts childish when with his pals. Stu, a dentist has a girlfriend by the name of Melissa. She's very controlling and is very much against Stu going on this male bonding trip. One day he hopes to eventually marry Melissa. However, Alan seems to be on another level with the social graces of the western world. The next day after arriving in Las Vegas, they all wake up with the worst ""Hangover"". The suite is in stumbles and things are where they shouldn't be and missing. They can't remember anything that happens within the last 12 plus hours. One element for sure is that Doug is missing. Therefore, they are running out of time before they are due to be back in Los Angeles. If not back than they will have to do some explaining to Tracy what they haven't returned. In one scene you will see where all four of them are on the roof top in Las Vegas toasting to Doug last night as a single man. The scene is relevant to the theme because it takes place in Vegas and the scenery is great. Just imaging the lighting along with the setting it's great. The other technique that was used in this movie, angles. The scene was when Phil and Stu were outside looking in the truck of the car and there goes that great shot of the sky and Mandalay Bay hotel. It's funny to watch men to exploit their insecurities. The Hangover was a smash for 2009. I hope to see more of Doug, Alan, Phil and Stu in upcoming movies because they were great. Phillips when will we see ""The Hangover II""?"
"shakesmcgillicutty","Null","1","2","26 April 2011"," One of THE Funniest Movies Ever - Epic!!
","This movie was absolutely one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I laughed so hard I almost choked and died; and it would have been a good way to go.<br/><br/>This movie is EPIC, like up there with Spinal Tap. I kept laughing for days. The only way I can think to describe it: If Pulp Fiction had a baby with the Wedding Crashers and gave it up for adoption to the Three Stooges. The movie has that weird, skewed-world feeling to it. The language is outrageous - there's not a ton of violence, but what's there is like, ""omg!"" Things don't quite make sense. You have to just roll with it and embrace the randomness - but it's easy to do that because the wackiness is pee-your-pants hysterical. The characters are utterly irreverent and so likable. A few times I couldn't catch my breath I was laughing so hard. Oh sh*t..just watch it."

","Four friends go off to Las Vagas for a Bachelor party, only the next morning none of them can remember what happened the night before. What makes matters worse is that the soon to be Groom, Doug; has gone missing...Now Phil, Stu and Alan must re-trace their steps and find Doug and take him to the church in time!<br/><br/>I had my reservations about 'Hangover', I just felt that it was not going to live up to the hype; but I was wrong. The storyline is not the most original, but the characters and script, dialogue make it one of the best. The actors are perhaps the greatest asset of the film, Zach, Ed and Bradley have amazing chemistry, something that truly shows in the film, I am especially fond of Stu's song, pure brilliance, Tyson's cameo was quite funny as well...But one thing I loved about the movie was, every now and then there would be a scene in slow motion, with an amazing soundtrack...like the 'Rainman' scene as they come down the steps.<br/><br/>Brilliant."
"greenday-cooter","7","1","2","24 April 2011"," Overrated...................Moderately funny
","I am a teenager, and every day at school kids would talk non stop about The Hangover. How funny it was, etc. I finally got the time to watch it and was very disappointed. I expected the movie to be the greatest comedy of all time. Instead, I got a moderate comedy with a bad story line.<br/><br/>The plot for the movie is very unoriginal. They copied Dude, Where's My Car? and a Simpsons episode ( Homer and Ned travel to Las Vegas with hilarious consequences.) The flashbacks were very clichéd and not funny.<br/><br/>Their were a few jokes in here that made me chuckle, but not laugh. Zach Galifinafkis had a very unfunny part, and Bradley Cooper didn't have any funny jokes, neither was Stu.<br/><br/>I expected a great comedy, but got a flopper. Did I expect too much with this movie, or did I just not get how this movie was a masterpiece?"
"whitenereb","Null","1","2","31 January 2011"," The Hangover
","The Hangover has got to be one the funniest movies to come out. Between the dirty humor and the constant stupidity, it had everyone cracking up. <br/><br/>The movie is mostly about these four guys who set out to go to Las Vegas for their buddy's bachelor party and end up losing him. They spend the whole movie looking for him, because they have no memory of what happened, hence the movie name the hangover. <br/><br/>I mostly enjoyed this movie because it keeps people my age super entertained, and excited for the next one they come out with. In my mind there will never be a funny movie to beat this one, and there isn't one that even comes close to touching the fantastic acting played in this movie.<br/><br/>I would recommend that everyone see this movie, once they reach the appropriate age."
"slokes","4","1","2","21 January 2011"," Wedding Bell Blues
","The first time I saw this film, I was in a packed Norwalk theater, the woman next to me was grabbing my arm, and I nearly ripped a gut laughing so hard.<br/><br/>The next time I saw it, I was alone with my DVD, the woman had long ago married another guy, and geez, somehow my enthusiasm barely crept into canter mode.<br/><br/>So was I at fault, or was it really a ""Hangover"" hangover?<br/><br/>It's probably the fault of ""Hangover"" being such a party movie. If you are having a party, you are only going to enjoy the Vegas decadence, the numbskull wisecracks, the whiplash plot twists. If you are watching this from something of a socially-isolated remove, you might find it more of a laugh-begging lowest-common-denominator comedy that doesn't work hard enough to make you care.<br/><br/>The idea of four men celebrating a final night of bachelorhood has been done enough times already. ""The Hangover"" shakes things up by making the comedy a bit of a mystery at the outset. Where did the groom disappear to, and why is there a tiger in the bathroom? The groom's two best friends and prospective brother-in-law have less than 48 hours to find out.<br/><br/>If there was one thing I was really amused by the first time, it was Zach Galifianakis's turn as the goofy hirsute manbaby Alan Garner. ""Don't let the beard fool you, he's a child,"" as Dr. Stu (Ed Helms) tells a would-be attacker. But the next time I saw the film, I stumbled over the previously-overlooked-fact Alan is presented as a child molester with a record.<br/><br/>I guess that's the film's way of being edgy, like by mentioning 9/11 and the Holocaust. Other jokes seem less winning, too, particularly a segment where the core trio is picked up by the law and another where they run into Heather Graham, who would be the worst actor in the film if not for a former heavyweight champion.<br/><br/>One thing that improved my enjoyment the third time around was the realization, from reading the IMDb comments, that Bradley Cooper's star character Phil is supposed to be a jerk, and not just a cool guy who wears fantastic sunglasses. He actually fits into that part quite well, without delivering an overbearing performance like Dr. Stu's fiancée, who director Todd Phillips makes sure we hate from the first minute she's on.<br/><br/>Good things in the film include a speech from Alan about forming a ""wolfpack"" and some stray surveillance footage involving a tiger. As I said, the whole opening section develops an interesting story, but the rest of the film lets this slide for cheap laughs. Alan even asks a pretty hotel clerk at Caesar's Palace if Caesar himself really lived there.<br/><br/>A good comedy, like any other movie, is a film for all seasons, not just when life is good and everyone is laughing. ""The Hangover"" feels too much like the title condition by the end."

","Okay, look. I'll admit that it is a little funny, and I am okay with the stupid, sophomoric humor, after all, that is what makes a lot of movies great. But COME ON, PEOPLE! A 7.9 rating? 270 million in box office sales?!!! Let's get real here. Not only is this a blatant rip-off of so many movies, but its the same tired old stupid humor. More importantly there is a very similar, yet very witty, brilliant movie out there that has been criminally neglected, while this mediocre, dime-a-dozen film achieves so much acclaim!! <br/><br/>People, do not waste your hard earned money on a movie that the masses say you should like. Instead check out the movie, Very Bad Things! In case you don't remember it, this little gem came out back in '98. It is about a group of guys taking their soon to be married buddy to Vegas for a bachelor party (much like the Hangover). They have an outrageous party with booze and drugs and... a hooker. The hooker ends up dead and the group decides to cover the whole thing up so they can get their buddy back home to be married and to continue their lives as normal. Of course things are not that simple, and the cover-up leads to more death, and the web of lies getting spun even tighter. <br/><br/>Christian Slater leads a awesome cast of familiar faces, including Cameron Diaz, in this hugely under rated black-comedy by director Peter Berg! If you loved Heathers you'll, at the very least, like this movie. I promise most of you will like it better than the Hangover! Give it a try. Let me know what you think! This might not be the best comedy ever, but the offbeat humor, along with good story telling, genuinely funny characters, and witty dialog, put the Hangover to shame."

","This movie has it's moments, but I will never really get what makes this one of the greatest comedies of all time. None of the verbal humor was funny, only the physical gags made me laugh, and I really wish there was more of them. The only ounce of talent in this film is from Zack Galifianakis, who is actually a good actor and is worth watching. But the other characters in the film are some of the most annoying, talentless, unfunny people I have ever seen. I really tried to give this movie a chance, I watched it twice. But it just didn't click with me, and in my opinion it's really over-appreciated. Try it out for sure, its not my kind of comedy but it might be yours!"
"gigan-92","8","1","2","14 December 2010"," Incredibly Funny
","this film delivers solely on its premise, and basically just that. However, it does this incredibly well with a flowing plot that delivered constant laughs. The cast consist of Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, although Zack Galifianakis definitely was the funniest person in the whole picture. Justin Bartha didn't end up doing much, but I enjoyed his moments in the flick as well. As anyone knows the plot is as simple as they come, leaving no real character development, aside Ed Helms' character. And so with that said, this film definitely delivers in the aspect of sheer, outrageous comedy, in a way that was nicely natural and unforced, but I could not rate it as high as ""Super Bad"" or ""Pineapple Express"".<br/><br/>Mike Epps and Ken Jeong were actually more memorable than the actual cast of protagonists, but it all blends together as probably the funniest film in a while. And oh yeah, Jeffrey Tambor was in it. Wish he'd had a larger role because as I've seen in the ""Hellboy"" films he can be pretty funny at times."

","The Hangover a comedy film was written by Jon Lucas and Scoot Moore and directed by Todd Phillips. The plot of the story is how four friends decide to go to Las Vegas to have a Bachelor party for their friend Doug (Justin Bartha). When they wake up from their crazy night of fun, Alan (Zack Galifianakis) the brother-in-law to be, Stew (Ed Helms) his friend the orthodontist, that doesn't have a backbone when it comes to his girl friend and Phil (Bradley Cooper) the school teacher that bribed money from his students in order to go on the trip, low and behold Doug is gone and they cannot remember a thing that happened that night. With little time to spare, the three hazy pals try to re-trace their steps and find Doug so they can get him back to Los Angeles in time to walk down the aisle. We have to find our friend, and soon? Is a theme of what has the grooms wedding party in this situation of not being able to locate their friend Doug? Having to hurry up, remember what has happened, and to get back to Los Angeles in time for the wedding. Lighting for ""The Hangover"" was always very bright and colorful. There was never a scene were everything seemed dark or gloomy. Even after they woke and realized that Doug was gone the lighting was still bright. At night when their car got hit by Mr. Chow, the street was very well lit to show that Vegas is a town that never sleeps. There wasn't a lot of music when it came to this movie. Most of the sound came from the silly things that they guys did throughout the movie. Whenever they would go to another scene there would be no noise so that the audience would be able to focus on the actors and what was going on.<br/><br/>The Hangover's theme closely resembles the theme of ""Road Trip"". Road trip is about a guy who mailed a video off of him cheating on his girlfriend and him and his group of friends deciding that they would go with him to go retrieve it. They both tie end together because they both show how mistakes can happen and how far people will go to fix them. The Hangover's theme focused on how three friends having to backtrack their night to find their friend, before they miss his wedding."

","THE HANGOVER There was going to be a marriage ceremony between Doug Billings and Tracy Garner. Dough and his two other friends Stu and Phil and Tracy's brother Alan decided to go on a trip to Las Vegas. Alan Garners Tracy's brother always acted like a kid whiles Stu had a wife who always gave him a hell of a time and never liked him to hang out with friends and Phil a high school teacher liked to act like his students when he was out on trips. The theme was basically based on some issues people faced after having so much fun and too much drinking and was also based on comedy. In the movie Stu, Alan and Phil encountered and issue where they woke up to not find Dough in the hotel room and had to look for him. They were so knocked out that they didn't remember what had happened earlier on. Alan and the guys woke up to find a chicken in their room running around and Mike Tyson's tiger in their bathroom. In a scene, Mike Tyson came looking for the friends and knocked Alan out after seeing them on his security cameras. References in the movie were so much based on what happened. Stu and the rest of the guys in search of Doug kept on asking themselves what just happen. They were so knocked out that they never realized a single moment of the night and anywhere they went in search of Dough everyone will ask them don't you remember all this? The angle they shot the movie was in proportion to the detail of the scene. They were able to really make sense and actually communicate to audiences. Also the movie not shot on premises actually had enough lighting for anyone to believe it was actually shot location. Even at night they were able to produce enough lighting to actually look like Vegas. The theme actually explained itself in the movie"

","Ah Todd Philips. Oh I remember when you were just beginning in the business. You've made such timeless classics as ""Road Trip,"" ""Starsky and Hutch,"" and of course ""Old School."" But now you have a new title, a new story, and cast of new comers who work well together on the big screen. The acting and dialogue is very clever, and the stories twist was the best twisted ending of the year. I particularly enjoyed how the drug ruffian and roof were tied in together to make the twist in the end even more spectacular than anyone could hope for. <br/><br/>The films swearing could have been toned down a tad, and the film does drag on some scenes but then when you least expect it BOOM! out of no where there's a tiger in the bathroom. I also feel that the film's realistic style gives it a greater sense of humor (because things are funnier if they seem like they are really happening.)<br/><br/>Keep it up, make more great films, and you are awesome!"

They stole a police car, stole Mike Tyson's Tiger, married a stripper, parked their Mercedes in the middle of the road leaving a note that they cannot locate a parking meter, they heard a baby crying inside their villa, Doug was nowhere to be seen, there is a Chinese man tied up inside their car's trunk, they owed the Chinese $80000 and they have no idea when, how they did it. I love the scene at the bathroom where Allan was trying to pee and the tiger gnarled at him like it was his territory. I love how they were trying to solve the mystery on what happened to them and at the same time trying to locate their friend who was supposed to get married in 5 hours and the worst thing is they do not have any clue where he is..

"DKosty123","8","1","2","18 October 2010"," Where Did The Groom Go? Woof Woof
","While I looked at other reviews of this after watching the film, it is interesting the extremes that I have seen. This is a comedy movie so while I understand folks being offended by some of the humor, still humor is supposed to be on the edge in order to be funny. Maybe the script might have been done before, but I have not seen the prior efforts so I will address this film.<br/><br/>I kind of like the formula here. The movie starts two mornings after the bachelor party was supposed to have started in Las Vegas. It seems no one know where the groom is. While talking with the Bride too be on the phone, she is in a panic. Then, we get the Hollywood style flashback beginning 2 days earlier. <br/><br/>This film centers around the groom to be & 3 friends including the Brides Brother who went to Vegas for a Bachelor Party. As the film develops, they are on the trail when they wake up after the first night in a hotel suite that is a total wreck with no idea what happened. On the path, they are trying to explain a Tiger in the suite bathroom, the grooms bed being thrown off the hotel roof, a cop car they stole from the Vegas police that night, a missing tooth & a missing groom.<br/><br/>What is fun about this movie is how it slowly but surely explains what happened. The cameo by Mike Tyson is on the trail & is very funny. There are several women in the cast, but the main one is a Vegas Stripper/Escort who gets the most screen time, & one of the Bachelor's Fiancé. After that, there is little time even given too the Bride to be. <br/><br/>There is some humor here that is politically incorrect, but is funny. Realistically, it does come off as a major hangover. The thing is, why no one can remember is (spoiler) not alcohol, but drugs. One thing never explained is the chicken in the hotel room, but there is some really sick Tiger humor, & a crazy gangster that is in the picture.<br/><br/>This film really is fun, as long as you have a bit of a thick skin. Not as thick as you need for Borat, but skin where you can laugh at a joke as the cast performs really well in this movie."

","This movie is comedic gold. It is filled with great characters, an awesome setting, a great cast, and a well told story.

So we learn along with them all the crazy stuff they did the night before. It seems strange, but having he crazy stuff that happened not being shown to us or remembered by the characters is more funny than us just watching them doing the stupid stuff right in front of our faces. We feel the same kind of surprise that they do, and that gives way more laughs than if we just followed these guys through their night of being drunk. Also I found myself very wrapped up in the mystery itself. Not only was I laughing throughout, but I also really wanted to learn with these guys what the did the night before. You feel like you were with them in that one crazy night, and you want to find out everything that happened too. ""The Hangover"" is much more than your average comedy. It manages to breath life into the almost dead genre. This and ""Zombieland"" are both excellent comedies from 09 that signal a possible return of good quality hilarity.<br/><br/>4 stars out of 4"

","When Todd Phillips announced the viewing of his newest movie ""The Hangover"" my first instinct was to reject it immediately, because my track record with this director hasn't exactly been the best. Don't get me wrong, Todd has given us some exceptional stuff over the years. ""Road Trip"" was a bit dodgy, but overall a funny movie, Old School wasn't too bad either, it did have it's moments of enjoyment. But I think the moment where Phillips really lost my respect was with his 2006 film ""School for Scoundrels"", I can't even begin to describe what a bad movie that was.<br/><br/>Anyway, my mind was set. I wasn't going to set myself up for disappointment again. However my friends would not give up until they got me to sit down and watch this movie. At one point, I believe they even threaten to tie me to a chair and tape my eyelids to my head and make me watch it. Course I knew they were bluffing, but I wasn't going to take the risk. So that same weekend I finally I gave in and decided to buy a ticket for ""The Hangover"", and with great surprise I came out of the cinema cracking myself with laughter. It's time's like this I'm glad that my friends are dangerously obsessive.<br/><br/>The Hangover is a huge come back by Todd Phillips. It's a breath of fresh air that outwits most of the modern comedies you see now a days. The title makes it pretty obvious that it's about a group of blokes that have one hell of a night and as a result suffer from hell of a hangover, with one of its main symptoms being memory loss. After waking up in a trashed apartment with one guy missing, the three friends make their way to the streets of Las Vegas making several stops and gradually putting together the pieces of the puzzle that will hopefully solve the mystery of what happened at the bachelor party as well as mark the location of the soon to be married groom.<br/><br/>A great thing about this movie is that you don't ever know what's going to happen. These guys just go from place to place with no idea of what lies ahead, and that in itself leaves for a very funny effect. Phillip's is also very careful to make sure that he doesn't expose too much information about what happened that night, the supporting cast only gives a limited bit of info to three main characters, so that way, it doesn't ruin the ending for the audience, as well as maintain the hilarious effect of not being able to determine what kind of unexpected occurrence will take place.<br/><br/>Apart from it being genuinely funny, The Hangover also succeeds in delivering an equal balance of character and crudity. Although they appear somewhat stereotypical, Stu, Phil and Alan are all consistently amusing figures. The chemistry between them is convincing, effectively funny, and very well portrayed by Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis.<br/><br/>With a clever script, efficient direction, and hilarious auto-play between characters, ""The Hangover"" makes for an overall considerably funny movie about the modern concept of road trip to Las Vegas."

","I enjoyed this film, it was hilarious and one of a kind. It made me laugh throughout the entire movie. Defiantly a must see. My favorite part was when they found out who's animal it was in there hotel room and the guys reaction. I especially found it hilarious when the owner of the animal was found in the room. Oh and can't forget the random infant that was found and the baby's mother. Good film, again a must see. I really liked Bradly Cooper's character and Stu who was so uptight but loosened up during the film and truly became himself and seemed happier while being wild. Most movies I don't give such high reviews but this movie defiantly deserved a ten."
"ThreeThumbsUp","9","1","2","14 September 2010"," Side-splitting
","Over half of the movies I watch are comedies, and The Hangover is by far the funniest film I have ever seen. From start to finish, this production will have you out of your seat laughing. Everything from ironic to dry to crude humor, this movie has it all. No one will leave disappointed. The Las Vegas setting is perfect too. Anything is possible in the City of Sin and this movie proves just that. Also, having been filmed on the strip and in the actual hotels just adds to the film's authenticity and allure.<br/><br/>After a hilarious introduction of the characters for the first 20 minutes or so, this sidesplitting production heats up really fast. After each of the four main characters takes a shot of Jagermeister on the roof of Caesars Palace, everything fades to black and the next thing we see is a several thousand dollar a night penthouse in complete ruin. The TV is busted, there's a chicken running around the room, hundreds of beer cans are littered throughout and furniture is tipped over as the three remaining characters wake up after what apparently was a wild and crazy night on the town. One character has a missing tooth and another wakes up wearing just a skin-tight shirt (no pants). To make matters worse, a real-life tiger has found its way into the bathroom and one of the guys from the group is missing, setting up the premise for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>In their attempt to find their missing buddy, the three remaining friends get themselves in, and out, of serious trouble. One is smacked in the face by an angry Mike Tyson while another finds himself facing the reality of 'accidentally' marrying an exotic dancer the previous night. A surprise in the trunk of their car sets up an entire sequence of hilarious and zany events.<br/><br/>Please, do yourself a favor: RENT THIS MOVIE! You won't regret it! What happens in Vegasdoesn't stay in Vegas. We get to see it all! Warning to parents: At the end of the movie when the four look through the digital roll of photos from the wild night, some extremely sexually explicit material is shown."

","Slightly concerning time for me to go and see this film as my brother was in Hungary on his stag do at the time but this didn't stop me rolling in the aisles.<br/><br/>Set in Vegas this tells the story of Doug (Bartha) embarking on his stag night with his 2 best friends - cool teacher Phil (Cooper) and geeky Doctor/Dentist Stu (Helms) and his soon to be 'weird' brother in law Alan (Galifianakis ). They head out for a night they will never forget and it turns out they do just that.<br/><br/>They wake up the next morning with a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the cupboard and a missing Groom. The hilarity ensues as they retrace the previous night's steps in a bid to get Doug back in time for his wedding. Cue shot gun weddings, camp Asian gangsters, plenty of gambling and of course Mike Tyson.<br/><br/>Where the film lacks in recognisable faces it certainly makes up for in humour and suspense. The story is uncomplicated but keeps you on the edge of your seat as the plot thickens. With all that it has to offer it's little wonder they didn't feel the need to use an all star cast. For me Zach Galifianakis is the star of the show with his character's lack of social grace and weird dress sense.<br/><br/>I fully recommend seeing this film with a crowd."

","I loved this movie and have seen it a dozen times. Lots of one liners and funny scenes. My favorite scene is with the taze gun. I lmao at that one. This was a great cast but Galifinakis really made me laugh the hardest. He's so offbeat. It's great. I'm really a fan of Ed Helms too and he always comes up with some funny stuff. There was a lot of hype surrounding this movie when it came out, but it most definitely delivered for me. So many great quotes in this movie too. I don't know where to begin. The cast really did mesh well together though. Great supporting performances by Rachel Harris and even an appearance by the great Dan Band. They perform a couple songs at the end of the movie when the wedding finally occurs. I recommend this movie only if you want to laugh your arse off."

","Take strippers, alcohol, drugs, gambling, Vegas, and combine it with a witty script and you get the base for The Hangover. Of course that's not the entire recipe, you still have to add a baby, Mike Epps, and Mike Tyson, oh and a tiger. While having a good recipe won't guarantee that you can follow it and make it work, Todd Phillips did a great job. The actors are what you would imagine, if you read the script and tried to picture the character. A . O . Scott simply said ""The immaturity of ostensibly grown-up American men is an inexhaustible subject, or at least one that has yet to exhaust American movie audiences and the well-paid guys who cater to their entertainment needs. Todd Phillips, the director of ""Old School,"" ""Road Trip"" and an HBO documentary called ""Frat House"" as well as a writer of ""Borat,"" has shown himself to be an adept and tireless connoisseur of male boorishness and stupidity, though the crude humor he dispenses is frequently leavened by nuggets of inventiveness and wit.""<br/><br/>Roger Ebert says ""Now this is what I'm talking' about. ""The Hangover"" is a funny movie, flat out, all the way through. Its setup is funny. Every situation is funny. Most of the dialogue is funny almost line by line. At some point we actually find ourselves caring a little about what happened to the missing bridegroom -- and the fact that we almost care is funny, too."" and I definitely have to agree with him. The movie opens up with Phil, played by Bradley Cooper, calling Doug's fiancé to tell her that Doug, played by Justin Bartha, is missing and that the wedding won't go on. The movie then rewinds to the beginning and right away the dialogue brings you to a chuckle. And when the laughter begins, there seems to be no end to the laughter in sight. One hilarious scene after another, The Hangover provides its audience with very explicit humor. This movie definitely wasn't written for children or very philosophical people who look for a deeper meaning in the movie. Although there are some things that can be interpreted more deeply then intended. Such as when Mr. Chow, played by Ken Jeong, says ""fat guy falling is funny. Is only funny because it is a fat guy."" Fat people have been made fun of since I can remember in comedies, and don't let me get started with the falling part. Our entertainment is based around other people getting hurt, just look at all the videos on YouTube and Americas Funniest Home Videos. Another instance in the movie where we laugh from someone else's pain is after the crew steals the police car. They get locked up in county jail and are given an option to participate in an exhibit in exchange for their freedom. The four men enter the room with a class full of younger children and then see that they are talking about taser guns and hand tasers. Needless to say, the men are in for a surprise. As much as I loved the movie there are a few things that I am not too fond of. The script by itself isn't really anything special. I am highly sure that a lot of improvising took place on set between the actors, as well as the director. As well as the script not being the greatest, the movie also felt ""too short"" in a way. I believe they could have extended a few scenes to grab the audience and pull them deeper into the movie.<br/><br/>All in all I give the movies a strong four and a half stars out of five. The movies not perfect, but it's a comedy. If you go to the Movie Theater or rent it on DVD with the intent of just laughing like a child for an hour or two then this movie is perfect for you. Just be sure to put the kids to sleep or possibly even stay the night at a friend's house just in case."

","The Hangover, a Must See If you are looking for guaranteed laughs and a movie that will be entertaining the second and third time then I recommend that you go see The Hangover. It's a laugh-out-loud comedy about a rather eventful bachelor party. It starts when two friends, laid-back school teacher Phil (Bradley Cooper), and overly cautious dentist Stu (Ed Helms) plan a bachelor party for their friend Doug (Justin Bartha). They are offered a sweet ride by their father-in-law to be but it's under one condition, that they take his chubby, comically dim-witted son as well Alan (Zach Galifianakis). They take a trip to Vegas and decide that taking ecstasy will make this a night they'll never forget. Ironically enough it ends up being a night that any of them can barely remember as what was believed to be ecstasy was actually the memory erasing drug rufilin. Soon afterwards, the movie cuts straight from them toasting to the night to waking up in their room with chickens, a baby, a wedding ring, a missing tooth and a missing groom to be. Alan awakens first to use the bathroom and to his surprise there is a tiger in there that doesn't look too pleased. What follows next is a hilarious journey full of unexpected twists and turns with the ultimate goal of finding their lost buddy. Michael Rechtshaffen wrote it best when he said ""Pretty much all will be explained over the course of the outrageous hour-and-a-half -- and what isn't will be quite graphically dealt with over the end credits."" The three buddies and a baby to be explained later starts off to find Doug and they go about it by attempting to retrace their steps. The first twist comes when they ask the valet for their car and he brings them a police car. They're then led to a hospital by the medical bracelet on Stu's wrist. That is where they find out that they actually took rufilin. What follows next is a further hilarious sequence of events including a naked small Asian man jumping out of their truck and beating them senseless with a tire iron, and Alan getting punched by Mike Tyson. The blend of diverse characters in this side-splitting comedy is perfect as Alan's antics are just the thing that sets off Stu and only someone as laid back as Phil could balance out the situation and keep the movie going. Along with great writing, the physical humor was just as hilarious especially during the scene where they found their selves in some pretty hot water down at the precinct. Joe Leydon of Variety writes ""The humor is unapologetically raunchy -- a closing-credits photo montage includes some borderline NC-17 naughtiness"". The story is tied together pretty well which makes it an overall good movie and if you are looking for frequent laughs The Hangover is a great choice."
"dunmore_ego","7","1","2","26 July 2010"," Vegas Knights (without amor).
","What happens in Vegas... uhhh, what happened in Vegas?...<br/><br/>It's not exactly BACHELOR PARTY (1984), but THE HANGOVER is a raunchy surprising stab at lewd, crude, nude immortality.<br/><br/>Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) are three friends who wake up in a Vegas hotel room the night after throwing their pal (Justin Bartha) a bachelor party. The room looks like it was just visited by Hunter S. Thompson, there is a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the closet and they can't find the groom.<br/><br/>THE HANGOVER reeks of two writers (Jon Lucas and Scott Moore) getting hammered one night and trying to talk their way out of getting bitchbeaten by Chinese gangsters. Which is kinda what THE HANGOVER is - one long excuse, wrapped in a rationalization and pinched on the bottom of ludicrous. Todd Phillips (co-writer BORAT) directs this descent into surrealism.<br/><br/>Justin Bartha, who had nothing to do in those Nicolas Cage movies, here finds that even in a movie where he's got something to do, they can't find anything for him to do, as he disappears for most of the movie.<br/><br/>Through tiny successive clues - a hospital bracelet, the fact that they've got a police car instead of their hire car, receipts from various vendors, the name of a wedding chapel - the three friends work their way backwards, revealing their night of debauchery piece by piece.<br/><br/>They discover they were victims of the ""date-rape"" drug, ""roofies"" - which their doctor calls ""Ruphalyn"" (upon looking it up, it is called Rohypnol or Flunitrazepam) - which accounts for their lack of memory.<br/><br/>The three friends have such a tight dynamic we feel we've seen them before - and we have. The Three Stooges. The smart, nominal leader, Phil is obviously the Moe of the bunch (I've not seen Bradley Cooper in a more funny, more likable role, proving he's got the A-List chops to carry a movie), the wacky cuddly pudding bear Alan is Curly (Galifianakis uses every ounce of his over-weight to milk the hilarity, also shooting his star into A-List territory), and the middle one - er, whatsisname - is whatsisname here-- uh, Stu, the redheaded child of the bunch, proxy for literal redhead Larry (and like Larry, Ed Helms does nothing special except bridge the other two).<br/><br/>But he does marry Heather Graham. She's the stripper who owns the kid in the closet. (And guys, she gets her knox out for mammary purposes.) Mike Tyson cameos and shows us why he's still not an actor.<br/><br/>In a laugh out loud movie reference, when they need to buy back the groom from Chinese gangsters (Chinese kingpin played ever so scrotumly by Ken Jeong), Alan convinces them to gamble for the money, so descends to the casino dressed like Rain Man. (To make it come full circle, Justin Bartha did play a retarded guy in GIGLI. Now it all makes sense!) <br/><br/>Rob Riggle (THE DAILY SHOW) as a taser-happy cop with the best line, as he calls for a ""volunteer"" from our friends, ""Come here, handsome,"" and chubby, bearded Alan steps forward - ""No, not you fat Jesus, slide on back there."" <br/><br/>Shot in and around sunny Las Vegas, with its snappy dialog and breezy, insouciant verve THE HANGOVER exudes a heady excitement and an overall feeling of blissful meaningless fun - after all, we all relate the Vegas skyline to good times; few of us work there, and even if we had bad experiences there, the boundless possibilities of Vegas still stir our blood to boiling.<br/><br/>And thankfully, as the friends drive into Vegas, with perfunctory aerial establishing shot, the source music is NOT Elvis's obligatory ""A Little Less Conversation""; instead ""Can't Tell Me Nothing"" by Kanye West. Someone alert Nicolas Cage. The Elvis song, awesome and apropos though it is, has become such a cliché, that for this original departure alone, THE HANGOVER can date-rape me any night."

","There isn't a real flaw in this movie! It's great comedy. I had to laugh a lot! This isn't one of the movies which are simply too silly to be funny. Even though it's comedy, this is no stupid movie at all! Great conversations, a great and unusual story - with lots of surprises. Yeah yeah, of course, a lot is predictable once you understood the logic of the movie, still, it's great fun! And the most fun are all the crazy characters in this movie.<br/><br/>So why didn't I give this movie 9, or 10 points? - The main reason is probably, that I prefer different kind of movies. I like movies that try to teach you something, or movies that move you emotionally in an extreme way. Visuals and the music are very important for that. In this movie, visuals and the music hasn't been impressive at all. And beside, I did laugh harder in other movies.

","Definitely did not expect this to be anywhere near as good as it was. The drunk buddies doing dumb stuff format is a good formula for comedy, but it has been overused. However, this movie refreshes the premise with some clever humor and innovative situations.<br/><br/>The three groomsmen who take their engaged friend on a wild bachelor party adventure to Vegas at first appear run of the mill stereotypes of the boozer-buddies genre. The dumb fat guy motif makes you think, ""Here we go again,"" but they balance routine gags like that with a story that makes some roller coaster twists that usually work. As things unfold as to what actually went on during their ""black-out,"" the plot gains more and more steam. The story is constructed well, showing believable and likable characters. In other films of this type, too often the heroes are made out to be obnoxious jerks, which ruins the humor. They really are concerned for the safety of their missing friend, for example.<br/><br/>Minor flaws: Tyson isn't funny, even when he mocks himself. The Asian stereotype seemed thrown in as if they felt they were obliged to do it for whatever reason. It didn't add anything to the comedy, which was already great in this film.<br/><br/>Hangover is probably the best comedy of this type since Animal House."

Most movies are overly hyped and consequently never live up to expectations but this movie hit on every cylinder. It's one of those movies that magically finds it's way into o my DVD almost on a weekly basis. The script was hilarious, it was well shot, but I have to give most of the credit to the actors. The comedic timing enhanced the hilarity of the storyline ten fold.<br/><br/>I knew of Bradley Cooper from Wedding Crashers and he played a very similar role here. He's the cool, jocky guy...likable even though he's a bit of a jerk. He did a great job but the star of them all was obviously Zack. The guy steals every single scene. I can't go much into detail, it's just something you have to experience. Easily my favorite comedy of at least the past 5 years."

As a comedy it was a perfect blend of dirty,nasty jokes and fun adventure (comedic adventure i might add). The chemistry between Cooper, Helms, Galif(whatever), and Bartha was beyond awesome, and Mike Tyson too, he was actually really good. Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong), holy crap, Mr. Chow was one hell of an annoying dude but he definitely made a perfect villain for the guys. The only problem i found was that towards the end it did get rushed a bit. I felt that they could have slowed it down and explained a it a little bit but this was the only problem i found. The end credits were by far the greatest end credits in the history of movies.

You got the fat guy, the nerd, and the wise ass, it follows the clichés, but it still stays fresh. Ironically my favorite character was Doug who was only in 1/4 of the movie, but that's just because I love Justin Bartha.

","The Hangover takes a standard premise and turns it into a hilarious comedy that combines raunchy humor with ""what's going to be next"" mystery. After the crazy bachelor party, the three guys can't remember virtually anything about what actually has happened and where the groom can be. This simple concept appears to be very productive and the team of screenwriters squeezes all the juice out of it providing plenty of laugh-out-loud scenes. The humor not only stems from frequently absurd situations the guys come across, but also their mostly hilarious interactions. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis make for a great comedy trio playing characters of totally different personalities. Phil (Cooper) is a party animal; Stu (Helms) is a pragmatist; and Alan (Galifianakis) seems to live in his own bizarre world. They all bring different elements to the film. Galifianakis is especially hilarious delivering totally unhinged, yet perfectly likable performance. Even though The Hangover is not sufficiently heartfelt or powerful to be a classic in my book, it still delivers more than enough laughs by keeping the comic tension tight all the way through."

","After Todd Phillips rather disappointing debut in this genre of low-brow comedy, 2003's 'Old School' not many people would be expecting a lot from 'The Hangover'. How refreshing therefore that despite taking a tried and tested formula, 'The Hangover' manages to be consistently funny and emerges as a strong contender for the funniest film of the last few years.<br/><br/>Focusing upon husband to be Doug (Justin Bartha) the film begins with his three best friends; Stu (Ed Helms), Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and Phil (Bradley Cooper)waking up in Vegas the morning after their friends stag night, only to find there mate has gone missing. What adds particular kudos to Phillip's film is that unlike most films in this genre we are spared the pre-amble of the drunken night itself and instead have no further clue than the characters themselves, only piecing together the previous nights evidence as we go along. Finding a baby in the closet of there hotel room, Mike Tyson's tiger in the bathroom and one of the main characters missing a front tooth are just some of the bizarre clues we are given at the beginning.<br/><br/>Another problem with most films in this genre is you see the sixty second trailer, laugh hysterically, only to go and watch the film to find all the funny bits were within the trailer. Not so with 'The Hangover', with the laughs coming thick and fast; from Mike Tyson's cameo to the guys finding a naked Asian man in the trunk of there car, the film really does have it all! If I had to pick one thing that I think makes the film the success it is however, it would be the chemistry between the main leads. You really do care about the situations they find themselves in and that the ending is a happy one. You have Phil the alpha-male, Stu the neurotic nerd who gets everything wrong and the hilariously weird, bearded Alan. It is arguably Galifianakis role as him that his the star role, watch out for the hysterical moment when Mike Tyson knocks him out singing along to Phil Collins. In conclusion this film is hilarious and also features one of the best credit sequences ever when the guys find a camera after Doug's wedding that explains everything unanswered up to that point."

Adults, these days <br/><br/>Phillips expertly takes the solid script penned by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (""Ghosts of Girlfriends Past"", ""Four Christmases"") and reinforces it, making sure it doesn't go off the tracks like some of the works of Judd Apatow, yet the film can be recognized as an unofficial sequel of ""Superbad"", due to the similarities of the films' heroes.<br/><br/>The cast works so damn well, it wouldn't be any surprise if they had real war stories of indecent revelry. Cooper and Helms shine as man-children on different levels; the former feeling trapped by his job and family, the latter being pussy-whipped by his shrewish girlfriend (Rachael Harris). Due to their predicament, they man up. Galifianakis's the resident goof, making the late John Belushi look sane while Graham spunky reps healthy womanhood, giving relief to Helms, my favorite of the three.<br/><br/>There are nice bits by Jeffrey Tambor (""Arrested Development"") as Alan's dad and Mike Epps (""Next Day Air"") as a drug dealer. I could do without the R-rated wedding singer, who's no Barry White in the art of seduction. Phillips has a fun cameo. Photo evidence of the party decorates the end credits scroll perfectly.<br/><br/>""The Hangover"" shamelessly and smartly proves Las Vegas is a nice place to party, but not to lose your friend, get blasted and have a tiger in your hotel room's bathroom while taking a whiz."

It's a tremendously clever idea where the comedy is in the unraveling of the mystery as to what happened to the protagonists during a bachelor party which they cannot recall.<br/><br/>In the Act One setup, we're first introduced to the principals: Doug is about to be married and along with his brother-in-law, the off-the-wall Alan, joined by Doug's buddies, Stu, a dentist, and Phil, an elementary school teacher, decide to go to Las Vegas two days before the wedding for a surreptitious bachelor party. We then cut to five hours before the wedding, with Phil making a desperate call to Doug's fiancé informing her that they've lost Doug and it looks like the wedding is off. Then we flashback to the revelers' arrival at Caesar's Palace in Vegas, where they go up to the hotel roof where loose cannon Alan toasts Doug by cutting himself with a knife—he invites everyone to join in a little blood letting as a sort of initiation rite but the others turn him down as they all think Alan is a little bit off the wall.<br/><br/>The break into Act Two occurs with Alan, Stu and Phil waking up in a trashed hotel room sans Doug. To make matters worse, there's a live tiger in the bathroom, a crying baby in the kitchen and Stu the Dentist is missing a tooth. They go downstairs and give the parking valet a stub, only to have him drive up with a police car, with the valet addressing the bumbling threesome as 'officers' and 'wishing them a good day'.<br/><br/>Soon it becomes clear why Alan, Stu and Phil can't remember anything that happened the night before. Alan thought he was slipping a tab of ecstasy into their drinks but it turns out that it was Rohypnol (aka ""Roofies""), a date rape drug, which he bought from a confused drug dealer (also named Doug who later figures in the plot). I'm not sure if I recall the exact sequence of what happens next but basically the three end up at a wedding chapel where they discover that the night before Stu got hitched to a Vegas stripper. They locate her and fortunately she's the baby's mother. When the bumbling buddies return to their hotel room, waiting for them there is Mike Tyson himself along with one of his handlers. It seems that the boys stole Tyson's pet tiger and in a rather amusing scene, drug the tiger and drive it back to Big Mike's mansion. More outrageous obstacles soon are placed in the protagonists' way.<br/><br/>It seems that the night before, Alan was playing craps with a Chinese gangster, Mr. Chow. He ends up taking off with Chow's gambling winnings amounting to $80,000. Chow and his thugs confront Alan, Stu and Phil and reveal that they are holding Doug and demand that they come up with his money or else they'll never see their buddy again. In one of the few long-winded scenes in the film, Alan wins $80,000 by employing card counting techniques while playing blackjack back at the casino. They all drive out to the desert where they give Chow the money but he hands over a black guy named Doug who happens to be the drug dealer who sold Alan the 'roofies'.<br/><br/>We're back at the point where the flashback began toward the beginning of the film. Phil is calling Doug's fiancé informing her that Doug cannot be located and the wedding is off. But suddenly Stu figures it all out. Earlier, the guys had noticed that Doug's mattress was impaled on the obelisk in front of the hotel. He realizes that Doug could not have thrown the mattress from the hotel windows since they don't open—the only conclusion is that they had brought Doug up to the roof the night before and he's been stuck up there since nightfall. All's well that ends well when the prospective groom and his three buddies drive back to Los Angeles just in time for the wedding (in a hilarious scene while they're driving on the highway, they have their tuxedos thrown to them from a tuxedo company van--obviously having ordered the tuxes beforehand from the car, using a cell phone and credit card). <br/><br/>The final scene is one of the best—they discover a digital camera with all the pictures of the groups' hi-jinx the night before. They all agree to look at the pictures once and then erase all of them. As the credits roll, the pictures reveal the machinations of the bumbling threesome during their crazed night out on the town.<br/><br/>Of all the characters, I thought Stu the dentist was the funniest. We finally do find out how he lost that tooth—and the scene where he stands up to his overbearing girlfriend at the film's climax was hilarious. I expected a little more with Alan's character as he was introduced as to be the really crazy one at the beginning—but somehow I wanted him to do even more crazy things at the end. Kudos especially to Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow, the foul-mouthed Chinese gangster, who was truly a hoot! <br/><br/>Some of the jokes in ""The Hangover"" don't always hit the mark—the bit about the police tasering the hapless trio in front of a bunch of schoolchildren just seemed a little too much. Nonetheless, 'The Hangover' has proved to be the sleeper hit comedy of 2009 with its one welcome bizarre situation after another."

","This movie has been done to death. Bachelor Party, Bachelor Party In Vegas, The Groomsmen etc. etc. etc. You know what , this film worked. It did not pretend to be a deep movie with a script you had to graduate from an Ivy League School to understand. This was just a silly movie, with silly antics and funny gags and predicaments. There was a lot of originality in this film. It was hilariously funny from start to finish. Fine acting and even finer screenplay. One lost groom with his 3 knucklehead friends trying to piece together what happened. This film was one of the funniest films of all time and well worth anyones time. Somehow Mike Tyson was worked into this film and even his couple of scenes were outstanding. Some supporting characters along the way, most notably sexy Heather Graham and an even funnier Chinese gentleman that stole a scene or 2. The hangover from this one will be most pleasant."

","Without any doubt this was definitely one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Don't expect a cinematic masterpiece but if you're looking forward to an entertaining movie full of unpredictable jokes and situations this could be it.<br/><br/>The Hangover tells the story of four guys who take off to Las Vegas for a bachelor party. After a tough night they don't remember anything and above all is the groom-to-be missing. The other three men start reconstructing their passed night, trying to find their lost friend.<br/><br/>The extremely funny story is supported by well-known and very entertaining music as well as by the impressive and beautiful scenery of Nevada and the famous city of Las Vegas.

Enjoy yourself!"

","Admittedly, and perhaps obnoxiously, I'm one of those who would normally never see a movie like this. I haven't really liked any of the other films by the director (those I've bothered to see), and I'm not a big fan of goofy, drunken, frat-fare contemporary American comedies.<br/><br/>Thank goodness my roommate downloaded this one and I could see it for free. Hey, why not: I had a free Sunday morning.<br/><br/>I don't think either of us stopped laughing throughout the film. Ever. Which is especially surprising, as even some of the funnier movies I've seen over the years tend to wane a bit toward the third act. Suddenly, the plot really comes to the fore and the movie goes from being a comedy to being an action-packed extravaganza or a drama or a romantic farce or whatever. <br/><br/>Not this time. You will continue to laugh without stop, even through the credits, thanks to a hilarious photo montage.<br/><br/>I was elated that such a movie could be made, and that it could receive so much praise and commercial success. I have found the Apatow movies to be boring, pointless, long-winded, and annoying at best, and have been confused by their success. Thankfully, there are still movies like The Hangover that show normal guys in fantastic situations and how they cope in a realistic matrix (yes, I just used the word ""matrix""--without being capitalized--in an IMDb review of The Hangover).<br/><br/>And I also agree that although all of the actors in the film were top-notch (even the bg guys who will fool you every time: what a terrific casting job all around), Zach Galfianakis (sp.?) is the far-and-away MVP of this film. I remember thinking from Moment One, ""Goodness, if he acts like this through the whole film, the movie will already be a winner."" He does, and it is (and he's not the only gem of the picture). <br/><br/>Kudos, Todd. You finally made one that's truly hilarious, surprisingly original (there is a lot here you WON'T see in Very Bad Things), thoughtful, well-structured, and--yes, I'll say it--even intelligent. Keep it up, we need more movies like The Hangover. Save us!"

"callanvass","8","1","2","7 February 2010"," The Hangover is great and raunchy fun!. It's one of the best comedies to come out, in a while.
","The Hangover was a movie that everyone hyped about, to be one of the best comedies to come out in ages, and I agree!. I'm very picky on Comedies now a days, because most of them turn out to be the same old stuff. The Hangover takes raunchiness to the next level here, I was amazed at how far they went, past the line. They even go as far, as to joke about a baby, jerking off!. What really makes The Hangover though, is the likability of the 4, and the astounding chemistry they have. Each one of them is different, but funny and likable in there own way. I enjoyed the Rain man spoof very much, with Phil and Alan, it was very funny and cute. I also really enjoyed The Las Vegas scenery, since it reminded me of my trip. It's also one of those movies that surprises you, because despite the hype, the trailer didn't look all that impressive to me. There are so many unbelievably crazy moments here, it's insane, if you like off the wall humor, you will love The Hangover. It's raunchy, it's dirty and just plain fabulous!.<br/><br/>Performances. Bradley Cooper has shown the ability, to be a great versatile actor, I mean the guy is in everything now a days. He is funny, while remaining the cool sport of the bunch, always wanting to have a blast. Ed Helms is a hoot as the nervous wreck, always worried about what his girlfriend will do, if she finds out. He's the nerd of the bunch, but instantly likable, and very funny himself. Zach Galifianakis is insanely funny as Alan. He's clearly off his rocker, but that is what makes him so funny. Justin Bartha, does not have as much screen time as the others, but makes a big impact himself, when he is. Heather Graham is a favorite of mine, due to her beauty and versatility. Here she is great fun, while being a likable support. Jeffrey Tambor is funny as Alan's dad. Ken Jeong tested my patience once again, he was funny in doses I suppose. Mike Tyson is actually sporadically amusing with his screen time, I was really surprised, with his adequate performance, I see potential in him. Rachael Harris plays the funny, yet nagging woman to a T.<br/><br/>Bottom line. The Hangover really does live up to most of the hype. It's one of the funniest movies, I have seen in some time. It's raunchy, it's nasty, and downright Magnifique!. I'm all for the rumored sequel, I can't wait to see what these guys do next. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>8 1/2 /10"

","So I decided to watch the Hangover on the internet today because I've heard many great reviews and claims that this movie is one of the funniest of 09'. Well I gotta agree, i haven't seen many movies in 09' but this was pretty funny. Although it honestly could have been funnier, I didn't laugh all the way through the movie like others claim to say. I laughed at many moments but I was expecting more. The beginning was kind of weird but towards the middle and through the end, it was hilarious and got good. So much funny and weird things that normally wouldn't happen, do happen. So it starts with the four friends (Phil, Stu, Alan, Doug) going to Vegas to celebrate Doug getting married. Then when there at Vegas for a while, they all witness the worst hangover of their lives. When they wake up, they literally cant remember anything...there is a tiger in the bathroom, Stu loses a tooth, a baby in the closet, and other weird things including them stealing a cop car, Mike Tyson makes a funny cameo, an accidental marriage, and many more.

As a rewatch 04/05/18') and after over 8 years of rewatching in full, opinions remain about the same. The Hangover remains a great and entertaining watch. Knowing the twist ending made it less appealing but on a rewatch, was more understood and picked up clues and hints had not noticed in original viewing.

","""The Hangover"" is a fun movie. It's consistently entertaining, even when a few of its jokes fall flat. The plot is predictable, the characters are familiar, and the film says nothing. Still, it works as an enjoyable movie to sit down to after a long day.<br/><br/>The plot is simple. Doug is getting married, so his two best friends and brother-in-law-to-be take him to Las Vegas for a weekend of hard liquor, strippers, and gambling. Things escalate quickly when Phil and Stu (Doug's friends) wake up in their hotel room with Doug's brother-in-law, a tiger, a baby, and an assortment of random odds and ends. The only thing missing is Doug.<br/><br/>""The Hangover"" tells the story of the men's quest for Doug; they need to find and recover him before the time of his wedding. The plot doesn't matter all that much; it's more of an excuse to put in an endless flow of gags. Fortunately, the gags work, and so does the movie. It never tries to be poignant or PC, and it has a bunch of laugh-out-loud moments. Accusations of racism, sexism, and homophobia seem a little out-of-place; all three issues are treated in intentionally absurd fashion.<br/><br/>All three of the main actors give good comedic performances, and the script clips along smoothly. This is not a 'great' movie, but it doesn't try to be."

","The Hangover is an enjoyable, laugh out loud movie that will go down as one of the better comedies to come out of Hollywood in recent years. There isn't much needed in terms of plot as four friends head to Vegas for a stag party and subsequently wake up 'the morning after' with only strange mementos of the night before to leave them wondering what they did. The fact that the clues include a real life tiger in their bathroom and a baby in the cupboard only add to the intrigue. Cue a series of set pieces and some glittering one liners and it's easy to see why this film was a big hit on both sides of the Atlantic. Anyone that has suffered the agony of not knowing what happened the night before, and then the acute embarrassment when you gradually realise just what you did will identify with this movie. And watch out too for a great turn from Heather Graham and a hilarious appearance by Mike Tyson - yes, THE Mike Tyson."

Similarly, the actors bringing the script to life are competent but mostly seem to be the budget versions of more recognizable (and talented) actors.<br/><br/>The storyline keeps us interested due to its unpredictable nature but there's nothing that really ties any of it together in a clever way. This doesn't really become apparent until we reach the end and see that everything that preceded it was fairly arbitrary.<br/><br/>The presentation is good enough with the direction servicing the story and the soundtrack supporting the vibe but there's nothing truly outstanding there either.<br/><br/>In short, this is a movie that somehow produces a winning combination from commonplace elements.

"MaxBorg89","8","1","2","12 January 2010"," What happened in Vegas?
","Parties, people getting drunk, embarrassing moments: all classic components of American comedy, all done to death. And yet The Hangover managed to become one of the big hits of summer 2009, with some critics and viewers even praising it as ""the funniest movie in years"". While that definition is entirely arbitrary (and used a bit too often), it is true that Todd Phillips' latest achievement manages the near impossible: to take an overly familiar topic and turn it into an unpredictable, hilarious ride.<br/><br/>What's it all about then? Well, there's a guy named Doug (Justin Bartha) who's getting married, and as per American (comedy) tradition his friends want to make sure his last days of ""freedom"" are spent in the best way. Hence a trip to Vegas - where else? - in the company of fun-loving school teacher Phil (Bradley Cooper), uptight dentist Stu (Ed Helms, aka Andy from the US version of The Office) and the bride's ""weird"" brother Alan (stand-up comedian Zach Galifianakis), all prepared for a night of fun they will never forget. Until the next morning, that is: the hotel room is a mess, Stu's missing a tooth, there's a tiger in the bathroom and someone left a baby in the closet. Oh yeah, and Doug has disappeared...<br/><br/>From there on, The Hangover turns into a comedic whodunit, with the guys trying to retrace their steps so that the wedding can actually happen. Cue encounters with the police (ouch), a stripper (Heather Graham on top form), a naked Chinese gangster (Ken Jeong) and Mike Tyson. All this is handled expertly by Phillips, working from a script by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (the writers of Four Christmases; don't ask) that brings him back to the more ""juvenile"" territory of Road Trip and Old School after the big-screen ""revisit"" of Strasky & Hutch. The difference is this time greater care has been put into the writing, with a great combination of clever plot structure and endearing characterizations. Sure, the three leads are essentially comedy types (especially Alan, who at times channels John Belushi), but they manage to remain real, believable and, most importantly, relatable.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, there are a few minor defects that prevent the movie from being the outright comedic masterpiece some claim it to be. For one thing, it's very much a guy movie, with the female characters (including Graham) reduced to scenery-filling beauties or, as in the case of Stu's ""sweetheart"", annoyances. Also, the film doesn't really go all the way with the madness, opting for a safe, hollow final-reel solution instead of the truly dark and insane material the premise - and the R-rating - could and would have allowed (think Scorsese's After Hours with more sex jokes).<br/><br/>But hey, why complain when most of the film is absolutely hilarious? The Cooper-Helms-Galifianakis trio is a genuinely adorable bunch of losers, and Phillips elicits laughs with all kinds of humor, both verbal (""What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Except herpes."") and physical (all the bits with the tiger and/or the baby), by subverting some clichés - much like Reservoir Dogs was a heist movie without the actual heist, this film deals with the aftermath of a night we never see - and indulging others (""He's funny because he's fat"" one character says of Alan, and he's got a point). Throw in a bunch of funny references (Star Trek's ""I'm a doctor"" gag is used brilliantly) and one of those absolute rarities in recent comedies (i.e. closing credits that aren't skippable), and you've got one hell of a fun, funny movie."

The set up is different - a conceit that you are looking at the present as three guys try and remember - in time - where the misplaced groom is, having taken rufies by mistake and being unable to recall a thing about a bachelor party that went completely out of line. The acting is not smug or egotistical, eg not like those endlessly unfunny Ferrell, Rogen etc movies, the plot does not go too far out of reality, and the minor characters are not star vehicles for a drop in bit part. It rolls along, but some bits do not work - cue overplayed gay Chinaman, grotesque joke about masturbation with a baby, and leads to a happy ending all round.

","This movie is certainly aptly titled. Essentially it tells the story of four buddies who head out to Las Vegas for a couple of days for a bachelor party (because one of them is about to get married) and then have to spend the second day figuring out what they did on the first day because they got so totally wasted that they can't remember. One of them (the groom) has disappeared, one got married to a stripper, one ended up in the hospital and one found a tiger in their hotel bathroom! It was quite a weekend!<br/><br/>There's no doubt that it is funny at times. The scene where ""Mr. Chow"" jumps totally naked out of the trunk of their car had me in stitches. Having said that, it was also rather crude much of the time and sometimes came across as very much similar to a sophomoric-type comedy, which I don't think it's intended to be. It seems more inclined to be going for a more mature audience, but for me at least too many of the characters and situations just came across as ridiculously implausible rather than funny. The first twenty minutes or so I found especially difficult to get through, as it takes that long for anything even remotely funny to begin to happen, and the same can be said for the last few scenes, although I did appreciate the moment when Stu (the guy who married the stripper) finally kicked his obsessively controlling girlfriend out of his life. It's not a disastrous movie, and - yes - it is quite funny at times. Just not enough of the time. 4/10"

","If you are looking for a laugh this movie is awesome. It is not an ""I was laughing so hard I peed my pants"" type of movie but it is definitely a great comedy. The movie starts with Phil (one of the four guys) calling the bride to be and telling her that they can't find the groom. So you basically know what has happened right from the start and it is not difficult to guess how the movie is going to end. But all the crazy and unexpected things that happened to them like for instance finding a tiger in the bathroom evens it up a bit. Like many other comedies it is slightly trite, for instance the ""nerdy"" guy always turns out to be kind of wild and the stupid moron conveniently turns out to be smart. But even though it is predictable it is very funny and I strongly recommend you to see it because it is awfully entertaining."

That is not forgetting the original songs 'Stu's Song' and 'Three Best Friends' which were worth a chuckle. Not to mention Mike Tyson's cameo...

The confidence of the acting and direction in ""The Hangover"" is easy to tag along with, and the ride is worth it. The story doesn't seem like anything new – four guys go to Vegas for a bachelor party and things go horribly, horribly wrong. The quartet wakes up the morning after to find they can't remember what happened and the state of their hotel room is chaotic.<br/><br/>The biggest enjoyment of this film is watching reveal after reveal as the guys discover just what mayhem their night consisted of. And the rabbit hole gets deeper and deeper as the plot unfolds, and the movie gets funnier and funnier. This film is a great starring vehicle for perennial supporting actor Bradley Cooper, whose turns in ""Wedding Crashers"" and ""Failure to Launch"" first got him noticed in the movies. The other main members of the crew are Ed Helms (SO funny on ""The Office"") and Zach Galifinakis, (funny in comic circles for years, finally getting his due in a big movie). It's a great casting turn to use these guys 'cause the scenes don't get dominated by the routine antics you'd expect from someone like Will Ferrell, Adam Sandler, and even Seth Rogen, to a point. Every lead guy in this film is a wild card, and that's a huge asset to the movie.<br/><br/>""Bromance"" seems to be the theme to many of today's comedies, and despite a male-centric story, ""The Hangover"" avoids lapsing into forced sentimentality and as a result finds more time for more laughs. Especially hilarious is the security cam footage from Mike Tyson's house and a visit to the wedding chapel where a particularly drunken event occurred the night before. The Mike Tyson cameo is hit and miss. It seems like the filmmakers wanted to exploit his eccentricity, having him sing along with a Phil Collins song, but he works best as a straight man to the madness of the party-goers.<br/><br/>Maybe Tyson should've been more imposing, 'cause if I had one storyline issue, it was the lack of really threatening characters that would add a whole new level to the mystery of what happened the night before. Two police officers question the boys, but their relationship soon devolves into SNL-type characters and the guy's first run-in with Asian gangsters is hilarious in that what-have-they-gotten-themselves-into kind of way, but it's disappointing to learn that their boss (despite a hilarious entrance) is more cartoonish than intimidating. Watching our heroes squirm out from under a more ominous gangster might've been a more compelling choice.<br/><br/>Those are minor issues with an otherwise funnier-than-hell movie that has dialogue I wish I spoke and characters I wish I knew.for one night.<br/><br/>SPOILER TALK: I'm curious what women think of the result of all the debauchery in ""The Hangover"". In the end, the guys get away with EVERYTHING! They don't get scolded for their actions, the one stripper they meet has a heart of gold, the ""bitch"" of the story gets tossed to the curb, they make the wedding, everything seems to go right. For me, a guy, watching this, it's a cathartic tale of scruffy heroism. But what does a female think? Should the boys have ANY comeuppance?"

","When I first heard word of this film, I had my doubts (oh no,not another Porky's gross fest with zero laughs). I did,however, ended up checking it out,due to plan changes one night after work. When four friends,one due to be married in a couple of days,ends up heading to Las Vegas to gamble & party for one debauched night,trouble (and laughs)ensue when the four toast with drugged liquor. The day after,three of them are in their hotel suite,totally trashed (and the hotel suite wasn't faring any better,what with furniture trashed,a live chicken drifting about,and an even more live tiger in the bathroom),with no recollection of what happened. The worst part is that they seem to have lost the groom. The following makes for a laugh filled film (that does supply the gross jokes,but are funny,none the less). The trio of boneheads have to find the groom within the next couple of days,or else... Todd Phillips ('Old School','Road Trip','Hated:G.G. Allin & The Murder Junkies'---believe it or not!)directs from a screenplay written by Jim Lucas & Scott Moore. The film has a cast of relative unknowns,but does feature at least a couple of familiar faces in the crowd (Heather Graham from 'Drugstore Cowboy' & 'Boogie Nights',among others,and Mike Tyson...yes,THE Mike Tyson,as himself). This is an all out funny comedy for adults who are looking for a few laughs on a Saturday night. Rated 'R' by the MPAA for vulgar language,nudity,sexual content,drug content & all out gross out humour."
"maecorn","7","1","2","24 August 2009"," Great mixture but not a milestone
","A great movie, good comedy, with fun and laughter, with drugs and dough, with obscenity and perversion, with a light and harmless storyline. A great mixture of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and some Guy Richie imitation. Expect no deep emotions, no love line, it's a film to watch with friends and beer.<br/><br/>The story is strong with a retrograde mapping of the happenings, but has nothing new to say, neither has this way of decoding the confusion some newish style. It is a simply watchable movie, with a 'don't expect a ka-boom at the end' ending. Once is enough.<br/><br/>What really impresses is the cut and rhythm of the movie. It is well balanced, no real slopes and hills, just evenly tense till the end.<br/><br/>There is one scene that had some sort of introducing function, a nice idea: after drinking Jägermeister and forgetting the whole blood-brotherhood crap from Brother Alan, they raise their glasses to Cheers, than the camera swings on to the Vegas horizon showing the accelerated dawn behind the skyline. Let's the story begin!!! Harmonic few seconds...<br/><br/>The characters, especially Alan are lovable, not to mention here, that the actors appeared until now in low-budget, somehow neglected films, which gives some extra taste and virginity to the film and the evolution of the characters.<br/><br/>Summarized up I can only tell You, watch this film, it's worth. But keep in mind this won't alter the ways of movie-making in the future.<br/><br/>...at least in my opinion. Enjoy!"
"seghers","9","1","2","1 August 2009"," Best Comedy since Animal House
","I almost gave this movie a 10. But comedies are hard to do, and there are some slight imperfections. The characters were not really well defined before the fun starts. It might have been a little more interesting if we'd known more about the groom and the best man, who I guess was a bad teacher who doesn't like kids? Not sure. Anyway... that's not what this movie is about. In short, I loved this movie. My wife and I laughed our heads off. It has a great ear for the way people talk, and the one-liners fit well into the story and connect with the personalities of the characters. I love the way it starts the morning AFTER (hence the title) and the characters have to piece back together what happened. I guarantee this- you have never before been so compelled to stay seated for the closing credits as you will be for this movie- I wont say why. I laughed HARD from start to finish, and VERY strongly recommend this comedy to anybody who has just once understood what it was like to party JUST a little bit too hard...."

","The Hangover is a funny grown up version of Dude Where's My Car without the bubble wrap or the space men or the Chinese fast food drive in or that guy from That 70s Show. It's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas except there is a plot instead of Johnny Depp and they've taken drugs unknowingly. It's Pinapple Express but with roofies instead of marijuana and there is a Wedding Crashers ending instead of a John Woo shoot out. It's The Big Lebowski if you took all the Chinatown elements out of it and just made a movie about intoxicated people running around trying to figure out what happened. It's pretty funny, I'll give you that."
"anhedonia","8","1","2","17 June 2009"," A genuinely funny movie
","""The Hangover"" is boorish. Vulgar. Brash. Crude. Offensive. Twisted. Politically incorrect. And it is unexpectedly and, often, side-splittingly funny, and one of the best comedies to come out of Hollywood in a long time.<br/><br/>Here's the thing about Todd Phillips' movie: It has no pretensions about what it is. Phillips' directorial credits include ""Road Trip"" (2000), ""Old School"" (2003), ""Starsky & Hutch"" (2004) and ""School For Scoundrels"" (2006). But this is clearly his best and most consistently funny movie.<br/><br/>Who gets the credit for this film working? Phillips or screenwriters Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, who, let's face it, didn't exactly hit home runs with ""Four Christmases"" (2008) or ""Ghost of Girlfriends Past"" (2009)? What are the chances they happened to strike gold with this one? And much has been written about how Phillips rewrote the script for ""The Hangover."" How much of that is apocryphal is unknown.<br/><br/>What makes ""The Hangover"" work - other than a welcome change of not seeing Will Ferrell - is the cast of ""relative unknowns."" We've seen them in movies before, but they tend to fall more into the category of ""that guy"" than anything else. It's unlikely they remain unknown, given how hugely successful this film is.<br/><br/>But no one in this cast - at least among the main leads - is hamming for the camera or acting as if they know what they are doing is funny. The trick here is that Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis play much of it dead pan, taking the situation they find themselves in very seriously. There is a reason why we find Frank Drebin of ""The Naked Gun"" films so funny: Because Leslie Nielsen plays all his lines straight.<br/><br/>That's exactly what Cooper, Helms and Galiafianakis do. (Compare what they do to what Ferrell did in, say, ""Old School,"" and you'll see what I mean.) Just watch how Galifianakis treats a line about the Holocaust or what condiments Tigers like. They are both good lines, but what makes them very funny is that he says them so matter-of-factly.<br/><br/>I have been a fan of Galifianakis for years. His stand-up routines are awfully funny and, most recently, I have discovered his ""Between Two Ferns"" online talk show that is funnier in two minutes than most 30-minute TV sitcoms. (If you haven't seen ""Between Two Ferns,"" do yourself a favor and seek it out online.) In fact, that show is a fine example of how to do comedy well. Talk about playing it straight!<br/><br/>""The Hangover"" should rightfully make Galifianakis a sought-out figure, as popular as Seth Rogen, except he's a better actor and more tolerable than Rogen. Galifianakis deserves all the success this film should bring him. He brings a certain naiveté to his role of Alan Garner, the bride's brother. He isn't shy, but there's a sweet charm to him that makes him awfully endearing.<br/><br/>When ""The Hangover"" stumbles, it is because supporting actors Ken Jeong and Rob Riggle play their roles for laughs, over-acting and trying too hard to sell their jokes. The story bogs down when it gets too wrapped up in exposition: A needless sequence involving Jeong's Mr. Chow. Too bad, because his introduction is absolutely hysterical and the writer(s) could have included the expositionary stuff right there when we first meet Mr. Chow. The bit with Riggle seems unnecessary and too forced. His shtick works in sketches on ""The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,"" but, here, it falls flat.<br/><br/>Frankly, I was (pleasantly) surprised that I so enjoyed ""The Hangover."" The concept of bachelors heading off to Vegas for a bachelor party replete with strippers is so tired that I thoroughly expected another routine boys-will-be-boys movie. But Phillips wisely never shows us the revelry the boys got into. Instead, what we see is the aftermath as the guys try to reconstruct the previous night's events.<br/><br/>Much is left to our imagination as the guys try to solve a mystery. They find clues, some more enticing than the other, some more revelatory than the others. Along the way, they meet a physician, Mike Tyson and a hooker (Heather Graham), who is more than a mere hooker with a good heart - she wants to meet Mr. Right. It's lovely to see Graham in a movie like this, though she isn't given much to do. She deserves to be in a hit film, considering some of the junk she has done for the past few years. Truly, clunkers, such as ""Cake"" (2005), ""Gray Matters"" (2006) and ""Miss Conception"" (2008), do not do this woman justice. Give her good material and she shines. Her too-brief appearance on the TV show, ""Scrubs,"" proves that. I hope she shows up more in ""The Hangover 2.""<br/><br/>The humor is often rude, coarse and can be offensive. But the thing about Phillips' movie is the humor - visual and verbal - is grounded in character. We care about Alan, Stu and Phil and what happens to them as they try to find their buddy, Doug. We root for them, because, despite their boorishness, their characters have heart.<br/><br/>""The Hangover"" is funny from the very beginning. It stumbles occasionally, especially in the third act, when some of the lesser characters try too hard. But those are forgivable sins, considering how hilarious the rest of the movie is.<br/><br/>However, if you are one of those people who frowns at low-brow humor - and some of ""The Hangover"" stoops low - or is easily offended by myriad foul jokes, then might I suggest you skip this film and go see, say, ""My Life in Ruins,"" a wholly insipid movie brimming with thoroughly inoffensive milquetoast characters?<br/><br/>But if you enjoy genuinely funny movies that earn their R rating because they go for broke with their jokes, then I heartily recommend ""The Hangover."" I might be hard-pressed to see a funnier film this year."

"moviemanMA","8","1","2","10 June 2009"," Blame it on the alcohol
","Todd Phillips, the writer/director of Road Trip, Old School, and Starsky & Hutch, brings us another rowdy trip through manhood with The Hangover. We follow Doug (Justin Bartha), his best friends Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Stu (Ed Helms), as well as Alan (Zach Galifianakis), Doug's future brother in-law, who plan on making Doug's bachelor party one to remember. It's certainly memorable, but not the night itself.<br/><br/>The morning after Phil, Stu, and Alan find themselves back in their hotel suite with very little clothing, a chicken, a baby, a missing tooth, and no Doug. Oh, and their is a tiger in the bathroom. The three set out in search for the missing groom who has a day to be back in L.A. in less than two days for his wedding. They take the baby, shake off their hangovers, and hit the strip looking for clues that lead them to the hospital, a wedding chapel, and Mike Tyson's house.<br/><br/>The story is as ridiculous as it sounds, but I was still completely engrossed in what was going on. I couldn't believe how messed up their night was, yet I was completely focused on what would happen next. It's the kind of film where from the start you just accept that crazy things are going to happen and you just enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>The three leads, Cooper, Helms, and Galifianakis could not have been better choices. Cooper has the looks and charisma to handle his ""too cool"" character. Helms, more commonly known as Andy Bernard on NBC's ""The Office"", is perfect as the nice guy with a mean streak (and missing tooth). Galifianakis could not have made me laugh any more than I did. His looks alone let you know you can't take him seriously. He is pudgy, childish, and completely engrossed in his character. <br/><br/>Unlike some filmmakers who make similar films, Phillips has not fallen off his game. He didn't get lazy and go through the motions. Each scene, each line, and each set up follow through in their delivery and add to the flow of the film. There were times when the action might get a little too serious, but he brings us back from reality and throws a one liner or situation you can't help but laugh at. It's so enjoyable.<br/><br/>I really didn't know what to expect coming into this film and I sure am pleased with the results. I didn't anticipate liking The Hangover as much as I did and it is probably going to be one of the best films I will see this summer. If you are of age and are in need of a good laugh, go see this. I take that back. If you are of age go see it anyways. It's worth the price of admission and then some."

","Don't get me wrong, ""The Hangover"" entertained me and didn't bore me at all, but to see this movie in the top 250 and to hear all these ""rave"" reviews it's been getting doesn't make any sense.<br/><br/>It honestly wasn't really that funny. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the majority of the funny moments. I chuckled, but this movie was definitely NOT laugh-out-loud throughout material.<br/><br/>I guess what kind of turned me off of the movie was the characters...I was very wishy-washy on who i did and didn't like throughout the film. I also felt that some of Allen's random and bizarre outbursts were unneeded, and he closely reminded me of Steve Carrel's ""Brick"" from ""Anchorman"".<br/><br/>Beside these gripes, the film was alright. A good summer movie, but I would probably not see it again, and I wouldn't pay more than 8.99 for this movie. But, don't take this review to heart. Go watch this and form your own opinions."

The movie's only funny scene (the Taser) was cruelishly humorous, which the movie desperately needed about 100 more minutes of.

Then, Alan (Zach Galifianakis), who is the child of the bunch. one cannot say he is outgoing, as he doesn't intend to be. This can also be applied to his humorous comments.

"powermandan","10","1","3","24 December 2014"," An Immediate Classic!
","2009's The Hangover launched the careers of Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifinakis and Justin Bartha, as well and revamping the career of comedy director, Todd Phillips. The four stars did star in several things before this, but where always pushed in the back and not very recognized, unless you've seen the movies many times. Todd Phillips did other classic comedies in the past such as Road Trip and Old School, but not a lot of good ones after Old School. I remember watching the trailer for this bout three times and knowing that it would be one of those typical, nowadays, dumb comedies. I actually thought this would be worse because of the lack of well-known stars. When I went to the theatres to watch it for something to do, The Hangover became one of my favourite comedies ever and one of my favourite movies in general. I was not expecting such a great flick at all.<br/><br/>The Hangover follows Doug (Justin Bartha), who is just about to get married and goes to have a bachelor party in Las Vegasfor the night with his two best friends (Cooper, Helms) and soon-to- be brother-in-law, Alan (Galifinakis). By morning, Doug is missing, the three boys can't remember anything and see things they did that are best kept in Vegas. When Doug is found, it is a major surprise, at first. After many watches, Doug's whereabouts become very predicable, but the laughs stay the same.<br/><br/>I remember watching this and thinking this was similar to Dude, Where's My Car? In that, two dudes search for their car with no memory and danger headed their way. In this three friends search for their groom with no memory and danger coming their way. But this is more serious since Dude was part sci-fi.<br/><br/>Since its release, The Hangover has become the benchmark and measuring stick of R-rated comedies. Because if I'm not mistaken, The Hangover is the biggest R-rated comedy ever. MacGruber, Hot Tub Time Machine and We're The Millers have all been compared in some form or another to The Hangover. I thought it was much better than MacGruber, a bit better than Hot Tub and as good as Millers. The Hangover may last as comedy's big benchmark until there's another sleeper hit.<br/><br/>What really makes this is the four main guys. Phil (Cooper) is a prep-school teacher who is the coolest guy of the group. Stu (Helms) is a geeky dentist and in great possession of his girlfriend. Alan is a stupid and highly immature man-child who grows attached his new friends. Doug has the least amount of screen time, but is pretty awesome when he is on screen. The chemistry and development is what makes these guys so cool. Other known stars include Heather Graham, Jeffrey Tambor and Mike Tyson who make the movie even better.<br/><br/>4/4"

It is a fluffy comedy that is for sure. I will not waste time on it. Typical fluffy comedy plot, Las Vegas and all.<br/><br/>Acting is rather good, except Mike Thyson.

","This was the biggest comedy for 2009 and for the most part it deserves all the hype it got. It was ballsy and had some hysterical moments and kept me entertained and amused all the way through. This comedy was such a big hit that it even made few of the actors in this get more roles and stand out even more in other movies they will be featured in later. Especially Bradley Cooper and Zach Galifianakis, also even Ken Jeong. Zach Galifianakis on the other hand tries a bit too hard after this flick though, he was good in this movie though. To sum it up this movie is a instant classic comedy that will be remembered for a while even after you finish watching. This movie had just about all the right comedic element to the point it's most definitely worth seeing if you like comedies. Yes, some of the jokes might be a bit crude for some audiences.

I do think a lot of critics are gave this movie too much credit. I can't see how this is great, rather than merely good. Another thing: The night before the hangover, these guys sure don't do a lot of drinking. I'm thinking to myself: ""Small glasses? That's it?""

","So this is my review of the Hangover. My older brothers and I had been wanting to see this movie ever seen it came out in 2009 (two years ago). But my oldest (17 year old) brother, still hadn't seen this, went with a friend to see Hangover Part 2. He liked it a whole lot and kept talking about it, so, about a month later, it was very rainy outside, so we did nothing but watch the t.v. We were going through the guide and the first Hangover was going to come on in about an hour on CineMax. My brothers and I still had not seen it. We were so excited. The movie wouldn't be half as good without Alan, Chow, or Mike Tyson. (The nerdy hillbilly) Stu was a little funny but Alan is hilarious. I think Phil is just cool. But I am not allowed to see Hangover Part 2 until it comes on DVD. But I asked my brother which Hangover was better. He says they're about the same. The IMDb rating is 7.9/10. I have read a lot the user reviews and it looks like the rating should be 6.6. The Hangover Part 2 has a present rating of 6.9. But that could change because it is still in theaters and there are stills more reviews to come. Because of the user reviews (so far) looks like it should be 5.9/10. Well, thats my opinion of the Award-Winning ""Hangover""."

All the most impossible things, happened in so many ridiculous ways, and, when you look back, also so reasonable(yeah, it's Vegas...)<br/><br/>The story is told in a very clever way. Hurry with the guys to be shocked by what had happened the night before, witness the faces of ""how could I/he have done that"", rediscover the romantic accident, tumble into unexpected meetings, experience dangers, and embrace the happen endings. <br/><br/>I also like the way those characters interacted in the movie. Sometimes they got very angry, sometimes they were obsessed with crazy ideas, just what I thought most people would do in Vegas, but sooner or later, some of them would get the better judgment, try to cope, and to make their way out.<br/><br/>Finally, this is not a movie just for guys."
"StevePulaski","9","1","3","30 May 2011"," What took them so long?
","In a sea of comedies that are absolutely humorless, idiotic, and ones that only have their moments every hour, The Hangover stands out as a fresh piece of the modern day world of comedy. Obtaining the top three status for most successful R rated films, this film reminds us that with the right mix of characters, a cute story, and some highly eventful antics, comedy films can still be made like they used to be.<br/><br/>It's the day before Doug's (Bartha) big wedding, and before making a lifelong commitment, his friends Phil (Cooper), Stu (Helms), and Alan (Galifianakis), the soon to be brother-in-law of Doug take him out on a Bachelor Party in Vegas. They toast on the roof and next thing they know, they wake up hungover, their room destroyed, a tiger and a chicken in the livingroom, and they must figure out ""what the hell happened last night."" The best part is, they lost the groom. So Phil, Stu, and Alan must search the entire Las Vegas for Doug while piecing together the events of the previous night.<br/><br/>The true fun of The Hangover is the fact that the fun comes from the events in the film. The characters try desperately to find their friend, but so many unexplainable events keep popping up and interfering with their plans it's hysterical.<br/><br/>You can tell when a comedy is trying to hard to squeeze laughs out of its audience. Some work, some don't. With The Hangover, the first time you see it, you will laugh a lot. It's consistently funny. There is never a dull moment. All four actors have great chemistry, and we wind up actually caring about their fates, not just watching them unfold with no emotion.<br/><br/>It plays like a hazy detective story where we know only as much as the characters. Normally in movies, we get a side story of others, or the movie will give you hints to what will happen. In The Hangover, we go from their final moments alert, to when they wake up in their hotel room. We know nothing of the events last night. We have to wait for them to uncover the events.<br/><br/>The character that delivers the most laughs is easily Zach Galifianakis's character. Sweet and simple Alan has tons of quotable lines that are maybe far too quotable. The Hangover will most likely do to Galifianakis's career what Animal House did to John Belushi's. He has now became a household name, and will likely be compared to his role in The Hangover if he does future comedies. Hopefully he'll do one very serious drama film to show he is multi-talented rather than being the charming simpleton in all his movies.<br/><br/>Because of all the buzz, The Hangover was dubbed ""overrated"" and ""not funny"" by many who saw it late. I saw the film around the time of release. Hearing nothing about it and just getting out of school, I was in for a positive movie. I just expected a few good laughs and all around, a decent movie. What I got was a wonderful comedy with heart, humor, and a huge rewatch value.<br/><br/>Starring: Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper, Zach Galifianakis, and Justin Bartha. Directed by: Todd Phillips."

","*** This Review May Include Spoilers*** The Hangover is a film about three friends and a brother-in-law that go on an overnight trip to Las Vegas. Phil Wennick (Bradley Cooper), Stu Price (Ed Helms) and Alan Garner (Zach Galifianakis) take the Doug Billings (Justin Bartha) to Las Vegas for his last fling before he gets married. However, Stu, Phil and Alan wake up the following day in their hotel suite and cannot remember any of the events from the night before. To make things worse Doug cannot be found and so they spend the rest of the film trying to recreate what happened the night before with the hope of finding their friend Doug.<br/><br/>The theme of this movie is about loyalty to your friends, sticking together and taking care of each other during stressful times. This theme resonates throughout the entire film. Specifically, the plot is about Stu, Phil and Alan recreating the events that occurred during the previous night in order to recover Doug. They could have easily given up; however, all four arrived together and they were going to leave together.<br/><br/>Whether it was returning Mike Tyson's tiger, paying Mr. Chow's $80,000 ransom for Doug, or submitting to being ""stun gunned"" at the police precinct, Stu, Phil, and Alan did whatever it took to locate Doug. They were not going to return home without him.<br/><br/>Irony was illustrated throughout the film. Alan's Irony of Character was demonstrated through his mathematical genius at the Blackjack table (up to this point Alan was presented as a person with questionable intelligence). Moreover, the entire film was an Irony of Situation illustrated by the backfiring of events that started shortly after their arrival to Caesars Palace. Their grand plans for a final bash for Doug resulted in one bad experience after another.<br/><br/>Albeit vastly different plots and era, the theme for this movie is similar to that of Saving Private Ryan. The themes are similar because they both establish focus on unit loyalty, sticking together, and taking care of each other while under duress. <br/><br/>Finally, the theme of the movie was well illustrated at the end of the movie during the final scene. The scene showed the four friends sitting together on the patio, away from the rest of the wedding guests, enjoying a moment alone with each other. Crickets were in the background, feet were kicked up, and the four of them relaxing together on the patio away from the wedding guests. Moreover, they were all together at the end just like they were on the outset of their trip."

","Debuting in 2009, The Hangover is a masterpiece of comedy by director Todd Phillips. The Hangover results in a comical chemical reaction as Bradley Cooper (Phil), Ed Helms (Stu), Zach Galifianakis (Alan), and Justin Bartha (Doug) descend on Las Vegas, Nevada for Doug's bachelor party.<br/><br/>As the title alludes to, the mayhem doesn't start until the morning after. As Phil, Stu, and Alan go on a roller-coaster ride through the streets of Vegas, dealing with an assortment of characters piecing the night before together in search of Doug who has gone missing. Inevitably proving that bachelor parties can get out of had and that friendship can be indelible. This movie truly was a non-stop, laugh out loud success!! Phil, Stu, and Alan are on a race against time to find their friend Doug the groomsman before the weekend ends. As they recover from the chemicals of the night before they must face orthodontic issues, a baby , a wild animal, a heavy weight champion, irate officers and various other mishaps in search of their buddy.<br/><br/>The Hangover puts me in mind a movie filmed over a decade earlier starring Christian Slater and Cameron Diaz entitled Very Bad Things. Very Bad Things was a much darker comedy and in addition a crime- thriller, a group of friends head to Las Vegas for a bachelor party and the drama unfolds. Like The Hangover, Very Bad Things proves that bachelor parties can get out of had and that friendship can be indelible. In both movies partying gets extremely out of control and the friends have unforgettable moments.<br/><br/>In The Hangover lighting, make-up work ,and off-screen or invisible sounds were effectively employed to enlarge the boundaries of the visual frame. These combined elements create mood and atmosphere in The Hangover that recreates the urgent feeling expressed throughout the film in which the three friends Phil, Stu and Alan race against the clock to piece together the events of the night before and find Doug.<br/><br/>There are plenty of movies out there with bachelor parties gone awry and the indelibleness of friendship as the theme. However, I haven't seen a movie in a long time that has kept me laughing out loud from one well crafted scene to the next. From the beginning to the end The Hangover takes the audience on a hysterically action packed ride of endurance and camaraderie. Never have I seen a move that has the characters play so well off of one another. Phil, Stu, and Alan are wonderful together. The Hangover is phenomenally funny!!"

","...though, really, nothing could spoil this movie--IT'S ALREADY ROTTEN.<br/><br/>THE HANGOVER doesn't even deserve a 1. What a waste of time. Four revolting morons drive to Vegas and have a series of adventures that they cannot remember because they were given a date-rape drug by their fat, completely disgusting buddy who thinks it's Ecstasy. That brings up about a thousand issues in my mind, not the least of which is the question, ""Why they didn't leave him on the side of the road when he admitted to drugging them?"" <br/><br/>As several people have mentioned here, THE HANGOVER is not only derivative, but has clearly ""borrowed"" material from other movies as well. Example: The tiger trashing the car = the deer trashing the car in TOMMY BOY. The scene is filmed in exactly the same way. Add into the mix bits and pieces of THREE MEN AND A BABY, THE FRESHMAN, American PIE, VERY BAD THINGS, etc., etc., etc., and hey! You've got several funny movies rolled into one, boring, stupid, nasty mess.<br/><br/>I could go on, but I've wasted enough time with this execrable film already. Nothing new under the sun here. It's all been done before."
"MovieEnthusiast13","9","1","3","4 August 2010"," The funniest movie in years!
","The Hangover is perhaps the funniest movie I've ever seen. I would gladly see it again, and again.<br/><br/>The film begins as the main cast is sitting in the Mojave Desert. One of the main characters, Phil (Bradley Cooper), calls a bride. He informs her that they screwed up, big time. He tells her that the wedding isn't going to happen because they have lost the groom. The movie then flashes back in time two days as a group of friends are preparing for a bachelor party in Las Vegas. The group includes schoolteacher Phil, dentist Stu (Ed Helms), the groom Doug (Justin Bartha) and Doug's future brother-in-law Alan (Zach Galifianakis), an eccentric and slightly crazy guy with a round belly and Jesus beard.<br/><br/>The group goes onto the roof of Caesar's Palace for drinks, and then wake up the next morning without remembering a thing. I was both glad and upset to not see a party scene, however, the way the movie does it fits perfectly. Anyway, they wake up the next morning with their $4,200 suite trashed, a tiger in the bathroom, a crying baby, a chicken and a missing tooth. The gang's search for what happened the night before provides content for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The group then realize that Doug, their best friend, is missing. They set out to find him in Sin City, where anything is possible. The search takes them to a Wedding Chapel, a Police Station, a stripper's apartment and Mike Tyson's estate. The entire journey is fueled with laughs which never stop.<br/><br/>This movie is directed by Todd Philips (Old School & Road Trip), this is by far his best film. The cast, with no huge stars still worked incredibly well together and created an unstoppable team of comedy. Although Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Ken Jeong, with the small role of Mr. Chow, were all funny, nothing prepared me for Zach Galifianakis. Before The Hangover, Galifianakis was virtually unheard of. This film was a make or break movie for him, and I say he scored perfectly. His character, Alan, is lovable but incredibly dumb-witted and is hard to hate. Overall, this is the comedy event of the year, maybe even the century."

"jacob-l-williams","8","1","3","13 June 2010"," Fantastic comedy brilliantly made
","The Hangover is a comedy which you can watch over and over and still find in it funny things you've never noticed before; from the opening scenes it is instantly hilarious and it is the first film in a long time that has actually made me laugh out loud.<br/><br/>The absurdities of the situations that the characters got in the night before cover over some of the plot loop-holes (and there are many like what happened to the guy at the wedding place who got shot and how did they know where Mike Tyson lived?). These are just a few of many things that let it down, however not enough to ruin the experience.<br/><br/>The Hangover has fast become one of my favourite films to watch when I'm ill it is now in the list of comedies that I enjoy to make me feel better along with Johnny English, Dude Where's My Car, Monty Python's Life Of Brian and Mike Basset: England Manager; it has become one of my five favourite comedy genre films.<br/><br/>The only other bad thing is that all of my other favourite comedies are much more satirical, they were made with a purpose of attacking something and getting some sort of social point across to the audience for example Life of Brian attacks the trivialities of religion and the fickleness of human nature. In The Hangover there is none of this, the narrative has no depth, granted it is very very funny, but once the jokes are taken away it is nothing at all.<br/><br/>The film's script and narrative are incredibly well devised so that even when there are no slapstick jokes there are so many witty things that the characters say it doesn't matter.<br/><br/>The Hangover is in essence everything a comedy should be; it makes the audience laugh consistently and is easy to watch and enjoy whilst offering no real depth and making no points.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Fun. That is the first word that comes to mind when I think of this movie. It was a blast to watch, funny and strange all at once! The premise is that a group of friends head to Vegas for a bachelor party. They wake up the next day with hangovers, none of them recalling events of the night prior and noticing that the groom-to-be is mysteriously missing. What follows is their adventures in Vegas to make sense of the strange surroundings they have awoken to (a tiger in the bathroom and a baby in the closet is the tip of the iceberg), their quest to find their missing friend while also trying to remember how it is they got into this mess in the first place. Bradley Cooper is an up and coming 'It' boy, you can tell, and yes he is charming and great in the film. But so are all of the actors. The writing is solid, the film will make you laugh. A great comedy for adults to enjoy."
"bobsgrock","8","1","3","13 February 2010"," The 'Citizen Kane' of modern comedies.
","With all due respect to Judd Apatow and his outrageous filmography, The Hangover is probably the best comedy of the decade, maybe the best since The Big Lebowski. What is so good about this film that it was heaped upon with critical and box office acclaim, not to mention a Golden Globe for Best Comedy? Of course there are terrific one-liners and other jokes you will be quoting long after seeing the movie, but there is also the reason for how innovative of a comedy this actually is.<br/><br/>A very common plot of many modern comedies involves people getting drunk, going to Las Vegas, letting completely loose before a wedding; these are plot elements that have become so simple and common it is almost impossible to realize just how serious and dangerous they can be. Although the film makers will probably deny this, there is a definite part of this movie that is anti-drug/alcohol. This film shows the true nature of the Vegas lifestyle: crazy, wild and totally unpredictable in terms of what situations you can get yourself into. Certainly no one will see this as something to glean from the movie, but it certainly separates this comedy from all the others.<br/><br/>Not to mention the story line of this movie and how it uses the flashback to bring us along. This is a plot technique usually reserved for dramas, thrillers, more 'serious' films. Yet director Todd Phillips and writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore make it work because they take their time setting up the situations, pacing at just the right speed, never punching home the jokes and set-ups like a sitcom. Through a series of interviews and searching, the guys slowly start to unravel that crazy night they have no memory of. This makes it funnier because we learn at the same time the characters do so their reactions are funnier.<br/><br/>Of course none of this would be possible without the terrific cast led by the talented Bradley Cooper, proving he can play a multidimensional character. His support group is Ed Helm of The Office, very funny as a whipped dentist and newcomer Zach Galifianakis as the slow but very funny Alan. The groom in distress is Justin Bartha, very strong as Doug and other supporting actors include Heather Graham as a stripper with a heart of gold, Ken Jeong as a mysteriously creepy Asian crime boss, Jeffrey Tambor as the all-understanding father-in-law and Mike Tyson as... himself.<br/><br/>With all innovative plot techniques and subtle messages aside, this is a very funny movie. The writing as a strong dark tone to it which makes you laugh but also think about these characters and their motivation. Unlike films that just go for the big laugh like Wedding Crashers, Old School and Anchorman, well this film does too. But it does it in such a fresh and exciting way for comedies, the standard has now been raised."
"p-simondet","6","1","3","27 January 2010"," Unoriginal and cheap
","When the sum of a film's entertaining parts fit into its widely distributed trailer, you know something is wrong. The humor it devised itself is absurdly sophomoric, and while that can put a smirk on your face as you reminisce on your college binge-drinking years, it just doesn't justify an entire film. The rest of the humor, which is presented awfully, just isn't original. The cast is simply bad. Racial stereotypes are always a winner in movies, and this one just proves it. Why are we so keen to praise such a film? We'll only get more crap like this if we incessantly tell Hollywood it has us rolling on the floor. A good concept does not necessarily a good film make, which is damn unfortunate."
"jboothmillard","8","1","3","21 January 2010"," The Hangover
","When I saw the advert I thought it was going to be some sort of low laugh and low budget comedy, with the same kind of premise as Dude, Where's My Car? But when I heard it was a surprise hit at the cinemas, I changed my mind about seeing it, from director Todd Phillips (Old School, Road Trip). Basically Doug Billings (Justin Bartha) and Tracy Garner (Sasha Barrese) are going to be married in two days, and to celebrate, Doug and his buddies have borrowed the beloved Mercedes of father-of-the-bride Sid (Jeffrey Tambor) for a 24-hour stag party in Las Vegas. His buddies are immature school teacher Phil Wenneck (Bradley Cooper) and worrying dentist Stu Price (Ed Helms), plus Tracy's unhygienic brother Alan (Zach Galifianakis) are going to Las Vegas. The next morning the three guys wake up with a really bad hangover after the long night of drinking, with no memory of what happened, and Doug has gone missing. After leaving their trashed and tiger filled suite, they begin looking for Doug, as well as having their steps retraced with clues, going to the places they went and meeting the people they don't remember. Along the way they find out they had been to hospital, stolen a police car, Stu had pulled his own tooth and married stripper Jade (Heather Graham), she is the mother of the baby they had, they stole the tiger from Mike Tyson, and much more besides. Alan realises they do not remember anything because he put what he thought was ecstasy in their drinks, but it was actually the ""date rape"" drug Roofinol aka ""roofies"", and it is when they meet the man who gave them, by paying a ransom to Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) for the exchange of a Black Doug (Mike Epps). There is the point when they are sure they can't get Doug back and have to tell Tracy the truth, but then they realise where he is and was all along, and they race to get back in time for the wedding. After the whole experience there is a happy ending for pretty much everyone, as well as a montage of photos of the whole night they do not remember, accompanied by the song ""Right Round"" by Flo Rida feat. Ke$ha. It is one of the funniest films I have seen for years, it might be a slightly familiar format, but it is done so well and the jokes and script are so well crafted that you just go with the flow. The three leads are great fun to watch, the visual and written jokes are hysterical, and a great soundtrack including Baha Men's ""Who Let the Dogs Out""; the Usher, Ludicrous, and Lil' Jon song ""Yeah"" and ""Live Your Life"" by T.I. feat. Rihanna accompanies the action, so all in all, a fantastically hilarious comedy. It is nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Very good!"
"jpozenel","6","1","3","20 January 2010"," Definitely over-hyped
","It's hard for me to believe that this movie has a rating of 8 stars, while I feel that I'm being extremely generous giving it 6 stars. It kind of reminds me of when I saw Slumdog Millionaire last year which was also a movie that was over-hyped until it actually won the best picture award. That was a complete travesty. This movie, though not nearly as bad as Slumdog, certainly doesn't deserve the praise that I've been hearing.<br/><br/>It won the Golden Globe award a few nights ago for ""Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy"". Now that I've seen it, that is so hard to believe. The only other movie that was nominated in that category that I have watched so far was ""Julie & Julia"", which I thought was a better movie. I'm sure that after I see the other movies nominated in that category, there will probably be a couple more that I would rate higher than ""The Hangover"". I can't say that positively, but I feel pretty certain that will be the case.<br/><br/>This movie, like Slumdog will be forgotten in a few years by most, but will still unfortunately be in the record books. And all the 10 star ratings? I think a lot of people saw this movie drunk because they felt that it was the appropriate thing to do!"

Fat Jesus).<br/><br/>The night doesn't turn out as planned and they wake to find their hotel room trashed, a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the closet and the groom missing. With no memory of what happened the rest of the movie is a hilarious trek through Vegas trying to put the pieces together.<br/><br/>There are no big name comedians, instead a chemistry that develops quickly between the guys which makes the comedy work, especially from Zach Galifianakis who really shines. Heather Graham is as hot as usual, and Mike Tyson has a cameo which is the only part I didn't like. A lot of improvisation can be felt through out the whole film and there are some great photo's at the end credits that looked like they really did go on a wild night in Vegas."
"John_Truby","8","1","3","7 January 2010"," Don't underestimate this Comedy
","Comedy is the most under-estimated of all genres. Most writers think they can write a good movie comedy if they're funny. They think all you have to do is string together a lot of jokes and gags and you'll have a successful comedy script. How wrong they are.<br/><br/>It's not just amateurs who make this mistake. Many of the top comedy screenwriters in the business write ""front-loaded"" scripts, meaning they try to pack as many jokes in the first ten minutes as they can. That seems like a good idea; once you get the audience laughing they're bound to keep laughing. In reality, these scripts hit ""the wall"" about ten to fifteen minutes in and miraculously they're not funny anymore. The writers don't realize that they've made the classic mistake of starting with the small - the joke - and trying to go big. Instead they should have started with the big - the right comic story structure - and the jokes would have come naturally, from the character.<br/><br/>The Hangover is a textbook example of how to write a comedy script the right way. This is the story of four guys who go to Las Vegas for a bachelor party and end up in a nightmare. The normal approach to writing this story is to follow them throughout the night as they make one mistake after another.<br/><br/>To see why writers Jon Lucas & Scott Moore didn't use this approach, take a close look at the photos of this horrible experience that play over the end credits. What you see are four drunk guys doing outrageous things. The fountain. The tiger. The baby. The wrong guy. Ha ha ha, right? Wrong. First of all, drunk people aren't funny, at least not for longer than ten seconds. It's similar to the old actor's rule: if the actor cries, the audience won't. If the actor laughs, the audience won't. A drunk making a fool of himself may be hilarious to him, but not to the sober people watching.<br/><br/>But there's a bigger reason this wouldn't have worked It's all the same story beat. Those outrageous events may seem different on the surface, but comically and structurally, they're all the same thing: drunk guys doing stupid things. And that means that there would have been no narrative drive and no plot. The script would have hit the wall after fifteen minutes and all we would see is actors trying to top what just happened in an increasingly desperate attempt to generate laughs.<br/><br/>Notice also that that story strategy would have broken another key comedy rule: comedy should come from character. Once four individuals become mindlessly drunk, they turn into a single character: the drunk idiot. So not only would we have no plot, we'd have no character.<br/><br/>So let's look at the comic story structure these screenwriters did use. Amazingly enough, this is a detective story told with a storyteller frame. The desire line: to find out what happened to Doug, the groom.<br/><br/>It's rare for a comedy to use this structure (Fletch and Who Framed Roger Rabbit are two). But it's a very good idea. The detective story has one of the strongest narrative drives of any genre. Which means you can hang a ton of jokes on it without being afraid of collapsing the storyline. And because the story tracks the three friends while they are sober, all of the jokes can come from character, from the unique flaws and personalities of the three guys.<br/><br/>The detective structure gives this script another huge advantage that most other movie comedies lack: a plot. The detective form is the most reveal-heavy of all genres, and reveals are one of the keys to plot. Where the normal approach to a raunchy comedy would have provided almost no plot, the detective form told with a storyteller frame gives the heroes, and the audience, an almost unlimited supply of surprises as they slowly piece together what really happened the night before.<br/><br/>In the Comedy Class, I talk extensively about the 11 key story beats for comedy, the beats for the seven major comic story structures - action comedy, traveling angel, buddy picture, romantic comedy, farce, black comedy and satire - setting up and paying off jokes, and the many ways you can make the comedy come from character. This script uses a lot of those techniques. The Hangover is not perfect. Even with the detective structure, the story and the comedy both flag for a while. But this script does show clearly how choosing the right comic structure at the beginning makes all the difference between a blockbuster comedy and the thousands of other comedy scripts that never even make it to the screen.<br/><br/>FOR MORE REVIEWS, visit www.truby.com"

","I have to say that it was so refreshing to watch a comedy movie that had all the right elements going on and kept you there laughing even as the credits were rolling. Unbelievably good, very refreshing to see a great comedy when it seemed as if the whole genre was getting stale. What I liked most was this story just kept throwing one twist after another, your just completely left guessing as to what was going to happen next. The premise is the group has lost one of their foursome overnight and none of them can remember where he might have ended up. It's a great plot vehicle because you find yourself so intrigued as well and it almost plays out as a mystery, albeit, an extremely hilarious mystery movie. Just brilliant, inspired writing here, they took a great premise and really went with it and the movie does not let up. You get really hooked on the characters and I found myself rooting for them all and it makes for a really great ending. Simply great, best comedy I have seen in years."
"brando647","9","1","3","16 December 2009"," The Must-See Comedy of Summer 2009
","Let me start by saying that this film was the absolute funniest movie of 2009. Director Todd Phillips has created comedic gold in this buddy comedy about a bachelor party in Las Vegas that goes horribly wrong when the groom goes missing; now, his three friends must piece together what happened over a night none of them remember to locate him in time for his approaching wedding. Similar to DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR but in a more adult vein, it's hilarious to watch the events unfold as the guys find out just how insane their missing night was. I'd been excited to see this movie when it came to theaters, having heard all the hype building behind it and it lived up to all I'd read.<br/><br/>The cast was phenomenal in this movie. The three main characters (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Zach Galifianakis) were hilarious, especially the character of Alan (Galifianakis). Future brother-in-law Alan was the requisite outcast character who's slow-witted nature never seems to fit with the cool Phil (Cooper) or the high-strung Stu (Helms). Supporting the main trio are a slew of cameos as the guys retrace their steps to find the truth. Jeffrey Tambor, Heather Graham, Ken Jeong, and Mike Epps pop in for a few laughs and even Mike Tyson has a few scenes where he's surprisingly funny.<br/><br/>There isn't too much I can say about the film without risking dropping spoilers, as the film is just as much a mystery as it is a comedy. The film ranks as one of the funniest raunchy buddy comedies I've seen and was a much appreciated surprise when I caught in in theaters. It's an intelligent comedy with the perfect level of immaturity and some great performances, which should be enough to entertain anyone. Check it out and be sure to sit through the first half of the end credits where they show photos from the missing camera and shed some more light on the most insane bachelor party."

Toasting to a night they will never forget, Alan wakes up and finds a Tiger in the bathroom, Phil calls Doug because he is nowhere to be found, and along with Stu woken up too they find a baby in the closet. None of them remembering anything that has happened and Stu somehow has lost a tooth. They all begin to empty their pockets and find traces of what they did last night to find the groom Doug.<br/><br/>All throughout this movie there is a lot of funny scenes to keep you intrigued from start to end. I last saw Cooper in the movie ""What about Steve"" where he plays a guy being chased by Sandra Bullocks crazy character throughout the movie. Which you can also see Cooper in some episodes of Nip/Tuck and the movie ""He's Just Not That into You"". Helms you can find in the show ""The Office and recently was in the movie ""The Goods"". Galifianakis you can find in the movie ""What happens in Vegas"" and is in upcoming movies G-Force, Up in the Air, and Youth in Revolt. Bartha is in a couple movies I have never seen one being ""New York, I love you"" and the others I am unsure of really, but what I most remember him in is the ""National Treasure"" movies which were fun to watch. All of these guys play really great funny characters and I will look forward to seeing them again sometime soon!"

","Stu Price: Why don't we remember a God damn thing from last night? Phil Wenneck: Obviously because we had a great F-ing time.<br/><br/>Todd Phillips is a director who has become well known for creating movies that appeal to young people who want to see a movie about drinking too much and partying hard. The Hangover is no different from some of his past movies.<br/><br/>The Hangover follows four best friends, Doug Billings (Justin Bartha), Phil Wenneck (Bradley Cooper), Stu Price (Ed Helms), and Alan Garner (Zack Galifianakis). The men are headed out to Las Vegas for one last crazy night before Doug gets married that weekend. As the title would suggest that is just what the men have one crazy night. The rest of the movie is spent trying to figure out just what happened the night before. If you have never seen a Todd Phillips movie in the past this one is no different. The Hangover contains all of the dirty humor that fans of Phillips' movies have come to love. If you have never seen a Todd Phillips movie be forewarned that you are in for lots of crude humor and non stop laughs! <br/><br/>Each character brings their own form of comedy to the screen. Alan is Doug's soon to be brother in law. He is the black sheep of the family and is constantly saying inappropriate and stupid things that keep the laughs coming. Phil is the one who constantly pulls the group back together. He may not be the most level headed one in the group but he is just what the group needs to throw caution to the wind. Stu is the quiet friend who gets picked on and just tags along. He may not like the decisions that the group is making but he follows along because he is too passive to disagree. Finally there is Doug, he is the most grown up of the group. Doug is the whole reason for the group coming together as he is the one getting married. Take Alan, Stu, Phil, and Doug mix them with way too much alcohol and a night in Sin City and now you have The Hangover. Once again Todd Phillips has made a movie that makes every viewer wish they were there for the party."

If there was some kind of brilliant twist or tour-de-force, it would redeem the exercise. Unfortunately, the development is a surprisingly prosaic, vanilla treatment of the premise.<br/><br/>I know this approach works OK for some folks.

"Boba_Fett1138","8","1","3","19 September 2009"," A comedy-odyssey, though the weird world of Las Vegas.
","I really like Todd Phillips as a director. He knows how to bring teenage lame humor as something hilarious and also convincing. His movies have the power to be likable and even credible ones due to its likable main, anti-hero, characters, not matter what crazy situations they are being put in.<br/><br/>This movie is basically one movie to goes from the one crazy event into the other one. Yet it doesn't loose it's focus on its main plot and also knows to find the time to work on its characters as well. The characters are all being handled and build-up well into the movie. It's the same type of comedy approach Phillips used earlier for movies such as ""Road Trip"" and ""Old School"".<br/><br/>The movie relies heavily on its main concept. It feels like though that the entire story got based around the writers idea of having a couple of guys wake up in a wrecked hotel room and things are missing and other things suddenly are in their room and most importantly one of their buddies who is about to get married is missing. It's like they first come up with this idea and then decided to write and base the entire story around this. This has as a result though that not all things reach a satisfying closure. It also has as a result that things get raveled at times, as can best been seen during its end credits when gets revealed what happened all during their long night, they remembered nothing about the next morning.<br/><br/>So well, no, the movie isn't perfect but still it's one of the more enjoyable ones of recent years, along with ""Tropic Thunder"". The movie is throughout funny and even during its weaker moments it knows to entertain, which is also due to its characters. The movie has a sort of adventurous feeling over it, since the movie jumps from the one extreme event into the other one. It's a comedy-odyssey.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't really feature any well known comedy actors in it for its main parts. This works well though for the story I feel, since in cases when movies have big comedy-stars in it, the movie and its humor mostly rely on the performances from those stars and puts most of the emphasis one them. In this case it can rely more on its story, situations and the characters as individuals. The movie still features some well known actors in it though, mostly in some cameo-roles. There are not too many though, which is a good thing, so it doesn't ever get distracting.<br/><br/>It's a real good and fun movie!<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","I did not have very high expectations going into this film. Like many others, I figured that the previews accounted for most of the humor. I was wrong in that assumption. However, much of the humor was extremely predictable and many of the scenes resembled what you can find in Old School, a much MUCH better movie overall. This is especially apparent in the wedding reception scene when the same wedding singers from Old School (which I have no problem with) are performing. If you watch the father of the bride (Jeffrey Tambor) as he reacts to the singer's own special version of the song, you'll find that it is eerily similar to ""Frank the Tank's"" reaction to the same situation in Old School. I can't hate on Todd Phillips too much because I think he makes good movies, but I really wish he would have made this movie a bit more original with less predictable scenes. 5/10 since I've seen Old School 7/10 if I hadn't"
"DICK STEEL","7","1","3","25 July 2009"," A Nutshell Review: The Hangover
","I guess you'll probably know by now the yardstick I use for comedies, and that's if I don't laugh until my tears flow uncontrollably, then it's not 5-star funny. Granted that there wasn't any comedic situation here that had warranted my laughter from the belly and opened my tear ducts, it did have some classic moments that would bring out some genuine mirth, albeit sporadically, though the film managed to fuel itself up to last the 100 minute distance.<br/><br/>Doug (Justin Bartha) is about to get married, and as a rite of passage, his best male pals in schoolteacher Phil (Bradley Cooper), dentist Stu (Ed Helms) and brother-in-law-to-be Alan (Zach Galifianakis) decide that they should have a no holds barred bachelor's party in sin city Las Vegas. After all, whatever happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. But who would've counted upon a rag-tag group to deliver him there and back safely and on time for his big day, since Phil's pretty much the frat boy leader of the group, just too eager to let his hair down, Stu's toeing the thin line of being the party-pooper, having to deal with an overbearing girlfriend, and Alan's just plain Rain Man dumb, which of course is perfect for some nonsensical one- liners and moments.<br/><br/>After a wild night out which we don't get to see (and so to keep you guessing), Doug's found to be missing, and to add to that, Jon Lucas and Scott Moore's story sets everything up for the events soon to follow, planting elements such as those which you've seen in the trailer – a broken tooth, a baby, a tiger in the bathroom, a hotel suite totally trashed and a stolen police car. Every element links to something that happened in the last 12 hours, and it's up to the trio to establish the series of events from the clues presented, so as to find out where their groom could possibly be.<br/><br/>It plays out like fusion of a comedy and a light hearted mystery, since none of them could even remotely remember what they did (and that too is not a stone left unturned). The fun factor came from how the trio of Cooper-Helms-Galifianakis share some incredible chemistry as boys who discover their hand firmly within the cookie jar, having to untie the knotty mess that they find themselves in. And to add to the delight, a lot of events happening in proper chronological order, have plenty of random bits to keep you tickled pink, before you realize that they all actually made sense, especially when you have enough clues to piece them all together. After this I'm on the lookout for future Galifianak projects as it seemed that he's now a contender up the Jack Black's niche alley.<br/><br/>Director Todd Phillips had thrown in plenty of the staple profanity and token nudity commonly found in Hollywood mass comedies, and not forgetting racial stereotypes such as drug dealers and effeminate gangster chiefs all for the sake of eliciting some laughs. Something you can credit Phillips for though, is trying to sustain a comedy but unleashing the funny bits in a restrained manner so as to evenly spread out laughter, though the last 20 minutes to its inevitable finale did seem to fizzle out a little, until the end credits roll for that photo montage.<br/><br/>The Hangover boasts a contemporary pop soundtrack, though the winner in the film is of course Las Vegas itself, with the film being quite a shrewd city promotional video, with its glitzy night time neon lights, and showcasing a host of activities one could get into, such as casinos that never sleep, and quickie-weddings in small specialized churches for that purpose. Having spent a week at the same city, it's a treat of course to revisit on screen some of the places I've previously set foot on, and if opportunities present themselves again, I'm pretty sure I'm going back.<br/><br/>Comedy of the year this may not be in my books, but it does have enough to make it pretty delightful to sit through, especially if you're in the company of buddies who share the same traits as the characters, or sharing the same sense of humour."

","Similar to actors, when a director puts out several movies that I enjoy (e.g.; Eastwood, Spielberg, Bay, etc.), I tend to follow their projects closely. Not only their current projects, but also their future ones. Phillips is the next great director and his genre is comedies. His first movie I enjoyed was Road Trip (2000) which he then followed with what I considered not only his personal best, but probably the funniest movie of my generation Old School (2003). These were followed by a couple of so-so movies Starsky & Hutch (2004) and School for Scoundrels (2006). These two were not terrible, just not up to par with his prior gems. Well, my friends, Phillips is back and with a bang with The Hangover. Unlike his prior movies, there are no bona fide star, but I can assure you that this movie will launch the four main characters, Cooper, Galifianakis, Helms and Bartha, into stardom. The movie has a simple premise; four friends go to Vegas to celebrate a bachelor party only to have everything go completely wrong. Like that hasn't been done before. But what makes this film special is that from the time you sit down to watch the movie, until the very end (make sure you stay for the credits), you are laughing non-stop. The dialog, the situations, etc. had me laughing hysterically. The other thing that makes this movie great is that even after you leave the theater, you might be watching TV, working or doing some other activity, a couple of lines from the movie will cross your mind and you'll start laughing again. That is what I consider a great movie. When you think about a movie and enjoy it as if you were watching it. Of course the movie is not for everyone, as Phillips tends to push the envelope (some people may consider some of the scenes offensive), but I think it really works. This movie won't win any Oscars, but others will now be following Mr. Phillips' career very closely."

","The Hangover is one of those rare gems that surprise you. Not much hype for this movie, but once the trailer hit the theaters advertising ""From the guy who brought you Old School"", I was ready for a hilarious comedy. And a hilarious comedy is what I got. Right from the beginning of the film, the story sucks you in and makes you wonder, ""What the hell happened?"" And so they begin to explain. Everything. You just have to be patient. The best character that just had me laughing so hard was Adam, played by Zach Galifianakis. A bit of a newcomer when it comes to films, but definitely has what it takes for a successful career in Hollywood. Go see this film.

The film will, however, deliver two out of three (minus ""clean"").<br/><br/>Director Todd Phillips (Old School, Starsky & Hutch) offers as much raunch, wit and general shock value in his newest comedy as the typical laugh seeker could ask for, and though The Hangover doesn't quite reach the same level of true humor as Old School, it comes close.<br/><br/>The film centers around the aftermath of a Vegas bachelor party, the events of which unfold as the celebrants – sans the missing groom to be – investigate their nocturnal circumstances in order to find their friend amidst the worst hangovers of their lives. What they find far surpasses the embarrassing photo or puke-stained clothes that usually accompany the day after woes of a night of bad decisions.<br/><br/>Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms deliver solid comedic performances, but it's the uniquely odd yet amusing qualities of Zach Galifianakis' performance that transform the film into the laugh-out-loud movie it is. A supporting role of bubbly Heather Graham also brings the film some charm.<br/><br/>Watch for appearances by Mike Tyson; Matt Walsh, Bryan Callen and Dan Finnerty (some of Phillips' staples); and Mr. Phillips himselfall of which add an extra ""hey!"" factor to the keen observer.<br/><br/>The Hangover doesn't breach the cosmic levels of comedic genius we always hope for, but it makes for an amusing evening.

The right blend of humor and comical suspense could elevate this to one of the comedic greats of recent decades. But, they just missed the mark, barely missed the mark. Oh, but it was so close. The Hangover is an excellent story about escapades and mayhem in Vegas and their consequences, but gets hindered because of the overload of crude humor, softer second act, and an under-written character that wasn't funny at all. Despite these setbacks, The Hangover is worthy of a viewing, especially if you enjoyed Todd Phillips' brand of crude adult humor.<br/><br/>In the surprise-sleeper hit of the summer, we follow two good friends of the groom and the bride's brother taking the groom to Vegas for a bachelor party before the wedding. All of a sudden, it is morning, three of the four wakes up to a disastrous room; and a random baby nearby. Oh and there's a chicken and a tiger in the hotel room as well. One is missing a tooth, the other has scratches everywhere, and one is missing pants. The groom is missing. The rest of the movie is spent picking up clues as to what happened, how it happened, and where on earth the groom went. The setup is crazy, and the events that unfolded the evening before was just as crazy. This is a sort of script the mainstream hasn't experienced in quite some time. The movie becomes mostly comedy, but with hints of mystery as well.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie is most definitely the screenplay, which was molded well by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore. Instead of a Ferrell or Apatow production which creates a situation and improvisation fills in the gaps, The Hangover relies strictly on plot and what twists and turns are thrown to our main characters. The hangover peeps encounter an angry Mike Tyson, disgruntled cops, gangsters, and much more in the span of 48 hours that follow the mysteriously drunken evening. This is the first raunchy comedy script I've seen that deserves at least an Oscar nod for its creativity since The 40-Year-Old Virgin several years ago.<br/><br/>Of course, it's the premise that sold the tickets, since virtually nobody knew who was actually in the film. Nonetheless, Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms steal the show with their outstanding performances as the frontrunners in the chase for the truth of the previous evening and the groom. Everyone else (even Mike Tyson) does a respectable job, with the exception of one. Zach Galifianakis' role as the screw-loose brother of the bride just falls flat most of the time. His character comes cross as a mix of a pedophile, a druggie, and Brick from Anchorman (in terms of the random statements and questions). This mix fails because Steve Carell perfected the dimwit role as Brick, and there virtually no consistency with Alan's character. He is the one role that was not fleshed out.<br/><br/>Your other drawback is the amount of crude humor. Crude humor is best in small doses (see: Blazing Saddles, Airplane, Dumb and Dumber, 40-Year-Old Virgin). In The Hangover, it's a bit overblown, and sometimes is used to try to save a scene. Todd Phillips improved upon his pacing abilities and good shots of Las Vegas, but still relies too much on crude humor and not enough on other ways to make the audience laugh. The tale didn't need the gross comedy, and would have been a great production altogether if they had toned down on the nastiness. The final scene makes you want to cringe almost.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Not as funny as everyone is making it out to be, but it's still a hilarious movie full of unpredictable moments and insanity. This sleeper hit proves you don't need big stars to make money; just deliver a premise too fun to pass up. The writing is superb, the acting (for the most part) is great, and the surprises keep you engaged with what is going on. If you can get past the crude, then you'll find a gem that's a few polishes away from truly shining among the greats. Instead, it settles for Phillips' best film since Old School, and one of the funniest raunch fests of the decade."

","this movie had me laughing from beginning to end. there were some really funny moments such as: when the naked Chinese man jumped out of the trunk and beat them up. i really liked that mike tyson was involved in the movie. since they stole his tiger. i didn't understand that when they were drunk the tiger came easily but later when they took it back it wasn't. i also loved the ending. it was possibly the best comedy ending i ever saw. when they showed the pictures from the night before. when this movie comes out on DVD i will definitely buy it unrated. i want to watch it over and over. also all the actors did amazing. they were definitely the ones for a hangover. waiting for the hangover 2."
"jaredmobarak","8","1","3","20 June 2009"," Couldn't find a meter, but here's four bucks  The Hangover
","The success of Old School pretty much vaulted Todd Phillips onto the A-list for comedy directors. We waited and waited for his second hit, but only got the mediocre Starsky and Hutch and, what I can only imagine as disappointing, School for Scoundrels. The Hangover lives up to the exorbitant amount of praise being tossed around everywhere; the buzz is running rampant online and rumors of a sequel have already started months before the film is even released. Movies pertaining to the alcohol induced shenanigans that can occur at a bachelor party two days before the wedding—in Vegas no less—always bring something funny to the table. The Hangover, however, trumps them all on sheer absurdity, craziness, and all-around hilarity.<br/><br/>Doug is about to marry the girl of his dreams, a woman with wealth, but also a family that seems grounded in reality. It is a couple days before the nuptials and Doug is on his way to Vegas for a night of fun with his two best friends and soon-to-be brother-in-law. This foursome is such a mixed bag that you believe them to all be real friends. Doug is the successful, who knows what, (we sadly learn very little about his character as he is a mere pawn for the evening to occur); Phil is the married teacher that hates his life, marriage, and children in general; and Stu is the nerdy doctor—sorry, dentist—without a backbone, but who you know can be wild when a few drinks have been imbibed. As for Alan, the bride-to-be's brother, he is the wild card of the bunch. Only having met Phil and Stu a few times and a bit off in the head—he is not a ""rah-tard"" though—you never know how he may interact with the others, nor what he may do or say about his wolfpack brothers.<br/><br/>The evening starts with the four going to the hotel's roof to take a shot of Jager and toast the groom on one last night of partying. It is right after this exchange that Phillips brings us to the next morning: Stu minus a tooth, Alan without pants and in the company of a tiger, and Phil with no recollection that he was in the hospital sometime during the night. Well, I don't want to knock Phil too much; no one remembers anything of what happened, nor can they find Doug. In fact, rather than their friend, they find a baby crying in the closet. Amidst the strewn-about debris, smoking chair, and random chicken, the boys realize that they have less than 48 hours to find the groom and get him to his wedding. The adventure that commences takes them on a journey through the many locations they visited the night before, compiling a timeline while allowing the audience to enjoy the laughs that come with the evidence of what happened and the reactions to it all from the threesome. Throw in a newly married stripper; a gay Asian with crimeworld pull, angry and naked from being trapped in the trunk of a car; a kidnapping; a stolen police car; and yes, Mike Tyson singing Phil Collins, and you can only imagine the uproarious laughter that will be emitting from your body.<br/><br/>But it is Galifianakis who surprises the most and completely shines as the off-kilter Alan. I'll admit to mostly being turned off by his brand of humor, generally jokes that run on too long and are too dry for their own good, (although he is the best thing in Out Cold). Here, however, it all works beautifully. Even when he risks going too far, like with his wolfpack speech at the beginning, Phillips seems to have been able to cut him to the perfect length in order to maintain the joke and not destroy it. He is a little child—""don't let the beard fool you""—and his innocence and ambivalence to what is going on around him is priceless. His emotions get the better of him, he wants nothing more than to be Cooper's best friend or carbon copy, his delivery of absurd lines is so straight-faced you become as dumbfounded as Stu and Phil, and his props add even more to the character. His satchel, his Blackjack book, and his roofies, among other things, enhance the jokes and the plot. A moment with him and Cooper mimicking Rain Man brings the laughs as does a slo-mo sequence between he and a little boy on a field trip to a police station. When Galifianakis is on screen, you truly have no idea what will happen next.<br/><br/>I know I have spoken little about the plot, but really, besides pertaining to three guys trying to remember what happened to them the night before, and where their best friend went, there isn't much else to say. The Hangover could have easily fallen prey to the ""SNL"" syndrome of just being skit after skit, loosely connected into a story, yet too disjointed to really enjoy, but the cast and crew never let this happen. Bringing in actors like Heather Graham, Rachael Harris, and a scene-stealing performance from Ken Jeong only expand the story rather than derail it. The jokes come so quick and successfully that you have little time to question what is happening, and you are laughing so hard that you are probably missing dialogue anyways. And don't even get me started on Mike Tyson's lisp; he deserves a high-five for sure. The only thing I can say is that you will laugh, because, honestly, who wouldn't enjoy watching a night of excess that went so overboard it's participants can only recall what happened through the X-rated photos on their digital camera? Yes, you do get to see those gems in all their glory during the end credits."
"bramb600","7","1","3","15 June 2009"," The funniest movie of the year!
","I just got back from viewing The Hangover, a movie I had never heard of until yesterday when I saw a commerical on television and several positive reviews. I'm really glad I saw this because I had so much fun.<br/><br/>Of all the actors in the movie, they were all exceptional but the one that really stood out and stole the show was definitely Zach Galifanakis. Somehow I had not been familiar with his standup routine but in this movie he was hilarious. It's a heavily quotable movie and 95% of the quotes that are going to be repeated would be things that he said. All four (or 3) of them worked together with so much chemistry, actually having me believe at times that I'm watching real friends.<br/><br/>The plot was totally absurd, but that was sort of the point. The audience is in on the joke that we don't even know what they possibly could have done last night and it's a great mystery to unravel every tiny detail of it and laugh because it's exceptionally bizarre.<br/><br/>The only complaint I could have was that it started off a little slow, like maybe the first 25 minutes until they wake up with The Hangover. After that point, the laughs keep coming but the first quarter may persuade people to walk straight out of the theater.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt the funniest movie of the year and destined to become a classic. What could beat it? Year One? The Proposal? Nah. Maybe Funny People."
"blaughlin75","9","1","3","14 June 2009"," This movie uses a formula that is rarely used in comedies
","This movie takes a familiar plot and turns it on its head. You don't see the bachelor party. You see the guys wake up with no recollection of what happened. Their hotel ""villa"" where they wake up is trashed and includes a tiger, a chicken and a baby. The groom-to-be is missing. You don't know what happened and neither do they. You just know that something crazy happened. As the guys try to piece together clues to find their friend, they encounter the consequences of their crazy, intoxicated behavior. They are just as shocked as the audience as they encounter the people they dealt with the night before, when they unknowingly consumed a powerful drug. They have a strict time deadline to find their friend as the wedding is two days after the party, one day after the hangover. So every turn they take gets more outrageous since you don't know how they know these people that know them and either hate them and want to hurt them, or love them for reasons they don't know. Eventually, things start to add up, but only after the guys encounter situations that are completely bizarre. The guys are relatively stereotypical--the nerd who is whipped and uptight, the stud who has a bit of a chip on his shoulder, and the weirdo who makes everyone uncomfortable. None of them is ready to deal with the trouble that they created while drugged, so they are freaking out with what they encounter, and the audience empathizes with them because we all have had that night where we have done something we regret while under the influence. Only it seems these guys have messed with some really crazy people. This movie moves from laugh to laugh consistently, and you don't know how far it will go. The chemistry with the very different characters keeps getting better. At the end, you finally get to see what happened to set these events into motion. At that point, you realize these guys were just extremely drugged-up guys who were trying to have a night to remember and were so messed up that they did some pretty stupid things. This movie is great fun and a bit uncomfortable for those who have had nights where they have done things they don't remember."

"charlytully","7","1","3","10 June 2009"," The Hangover versus The Magnificent Seven
","THE HANGOVER and THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN are the two most recent feature movies I've seen. There are several significant points of comparison. Firstly, according to this site--IMDb--HANGOVER is the 126th most popular film of all time, while M7 does not make the top 250 as of June 10, 2009 (even though M7 is popular enough to be selected the second most often for presentation on television by network executives the past four decades). Secondly, film studio execs marketed 1960's M7 primarily as a ""western,"" while this summer's HANGOVER is billed mostly as a ""comedy."" However, Steve McQueen constantly tried various comic gambits to upstage Yul Brynner in M7, while HANGOVER's bachelor party crew looks east (from L.A.) toward Las Vegas' ""Sin City"" reputation as the last vestige of the amoral ""wild west."" Thirdly, Charles Bronson is looking after three kids in peril throughout M7, while 75 per cent of the bachelor party quartet must take responsibility for a baby in peril during the first half of HANGOVER. Though there are many other eerie parallels between these two movies, I must fight against public opinion to express a preference for M7, with Elmer Bernstein's classic musical score providing a clear edge to the earlier flick in terms of likely staying power (though HANGOVER did better at the box office its initial week out, even adjusting M7's gross for inflation, thanks to the later movie's better marketing campaign)."

I had seen the trailers and had wanted to see the movie, but now I was stoked to see it. My girlfriend and I went to see it because she had also heard it was a great movie. This movie provided tons of laughs for the both of us. I would definitely say this is a comedy you can take your girlfriend to, and if she has any sense of humor, will enjoy herself immensely. The only bad thing about the movie was that a lot of the funny scenes were shown in the trailer. I wish I had never seen the movie trailers. There were also a few scenes that I was saying to myself ""I cant believe they are showing this in a movie"", but I left unoffended. Overall, a funny movie worth seeing.

"thewillt08","9","1","4","28 May 2013"," An Epic Comedy
","What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, unless there is a Hollywood film crew there to capture it. What was supposed to be a bachelor party turned into a race against time to find the groom. The Hangover is a unique kind of comedy that is one of a kind. It is easy to say this movie was the best the first time thru but is still funny every time I watch. The crazy antics portrayed in this movie are hysterical and have nonstop laughter. From that awkward scene in the beginning with Doug and Allan till the pictures during the end credits, I laughed at every joke and almost all of them hit dead on. The plot to The Hangover is simple. Doug is getting married so three friends take him to Vegas for a weekend they will never forget, or remember. They have a drink and the next thing they know three of them wake up in a destroyed hotel room, Doug missing, a baby, and a tiger in the bathroom. Chaos then ensues from there as they try to piece together the night and find Doug before the wedding. Let's start with the characters. Allen is the lovable idiot who says and does stupid things but is the clown of the movie. A lot of the comedy comes from him and he nails it. His stupid comments bring a nice chuckle and his actions bring stomach aching laughter. No spoilers bit most of the misfortune is his fault and the other two have to deal with his stupidity. Allan is easily the best character in the story and the fan favorite. Then there is Stu, now I hate Stu. There I said it. He is a dentist who is whipped by his girlfriend and all he does throughout the movie is yell, be obnoxious, and be a Debbie downer. I may hate his character and may not be a big fan of Ed Helms, the actor, but his role meshed into the movie perfectly. The movie needed a man like that in this situation and he played as the voice of reason and a maniac at the same time. He is kind of a jerk but at the same time funny. Watching him and Allan butt heads was hysterical. Stu says, ""You are literally too stupid to insult."" ""Thank you."" Says Allan. It is little things like that which made the movie even better. Like I said, I don't like Stu but at least he had one of, if not the funniest, moment in the entire movie. That of course is the scene when he plays the piano singing his song. Then we come to Phil. Bradley Cooper is fantastic in this movie. He plays the cool and handsome guy who tries to keep things under control and deal with the situation. From his first scene he sets the tone for his character. Watch the movie and if you pick upon it you will know what I mean. Phil is a great character who fits well into the story as the guy who can laugh at the situation but still understand how serious it is. Stu is an extreme and Allan is beyond that but Phil is in the middle and he is very entertaining to boot. The movie opens with him on the phone explaining the situation and the mess they were in was funny because it made me think how they got there. It made me want to see what happened and made me invested in the movie. The Hangover is a comedy but it is a different type of comedy that works so well. You laugh but at the same time it has a strong story and a great script. You are along for the ride with these three and you want to find where Doug is. It is exciting and the twists and turns are something you see in a drama and not so much a comedy. The story was so well written and kept the audience interested in the movie while rolling on the floor in laughter at the same time. To that I say touché to the director and writers. There was a major flaw in the movie and that, my friends, is Chow. Now I know your reaction and people think Chow was hilarious and possibly the best part of the movie but I disagree. Chow is a good character who needed to be in the movie and play his part but he was so over the top. He tried so hard to be funny and at times he was funny and other times I thought it was forced. His voice and his demeanor annoyed me. When he rolls up the window making weird noises I couldn't laugh because I thought it was way too ridiculous. I will give him credit because he has one of the most interesting and funny entrances into a series that I can think of. I like the character Chow, I like his role in the movie, I like how he wasn't over used, I just thought he tried to hard to be something more than what he needed to be. Overall, The Hangover is possibly the funniest movie I have ever seen. Dumb and Dumber was the funniest until I saw this. I think Dumb and Dumber was funnier but I liked this better. Problem solved. I liked Tysons cameo and when he sang Phil Collins, In the Air Tonight, I think I cried. This movie wasn't only funny but fun at the same time. I liked piecing together the events from the previous night and finding out where Doug was. Really good actors, great characters, an amazing script, basic but strong plot, endless funny moments, a high re-watch rate, but a little bit of over acting at times gives The Hangover the WillyT Seal of Approval."

","Three close friends and the groom's strange brother-in-law travel to Vegas for a bachelor party they will never forget. Teacher Phil (Bradley Cooper) is a womaniser with a wife and kids, Stu (Ed Helms) is in an unhappy marriage with an overbearing, abusive wife, Doug (Justin Bartha) is the groom hoping for a send-off to end all send-off's, and Alan (Zach Galifianakis), is a naive man-child hoping to make friends. When they wake up in the morning, they find their suite demolished, a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the closet, and most worryingly of all, Doug is missing. They clean themselves up and set out to find Doug, and using the various clues lying around, they begin to piece together the night.<br/><br/>Of course, bachelor party movies are hardly hard to come by, and they have been a staple of the gross-out comedy circuit since the 1980's. The Hangover finds its originality in the fact that it focuses on the morning after, rather than the actual night itself, which we see none of. It also has a sense of believability, as if three of the characters have genuinely been friends for years, and are gradually accepting the increasingly strange Alan into their wolf-pack. After all, Alan is often unnervingly strange, but the group find him funny too, and why wouldn't they? Cult stand-up comedian Galifianakis has been around for years, starring in various failed pilots and never quite getting the attention he deserved, but he is by far the best thing in The Hangover, with the mixture of his quite sweet innocence and his random one-liners fitting in with the film's heartfelt moments.<br/><br/>It also keeps the gross humour thankfully down to a minimum. Sure it's often bad taste, but there's a noticeable lack of bare-breasted women and any jokes involving bodily fluids. This is still R-rated, but the humour is in the script and the performances, and doesn't resort to someone shitting themselves for desperate laughs. It's similar in many ways to 2007's Superbad, where the language was filthy, but the laughs were genuine, and the situations, however absurd, still felt somewhat real. And when the credits rolled, I was left with that unfamiliar desire to spend more time with these characters. Special mention must also go to Chinese gangster Mr. Chow (played by Ken Jeong, who simply needs to be in more films), who has one of the best comedy burn lines in history, ""so long, gay boys!"".<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","Hangover, The (2009) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Four buddies head off to Vegas for a bachelor party but the next morning they wake up not knowing what happened the night before and discovering one is missing. They must then try to retrace their steps and locate the missing buddy. I'm always a bit hesitant to fall into the mass market when it comes to something popular because a lot of times I end up watching the film and it turns out to be a major disappointment but that's not the case with this gem because it lived up to its reputation and in my opinion passed them. I'm not going to call this the greatest film of the year but I might add it's the most original. You'd think a comedy about getting messed up in Vegas would be ""been there, done that"" but this takes a familiar set up and does something original with it. Instead of showing us the crazy party night, we don't see a second of it and instead we're thrown into a mystery and the laughs come from trying to figure out that mystery. For my money the screenplay is nearly flawless as it does a great job at building up our thoughts on what happened but the film then takes us to places that you certainly won't see coming. The majority of the laughs come from things that you normally wouldn't expect like a masterful scene involving a trunk. Even the jokes that you do expect (strippers) is done extremely well and with hilarious results. I won't ruin many of the jokes because of the ""mystery"" behind them is what makes them work so well but there were several scenes where tears were running down my face from laughing so hard. Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis give terrific performances and their chemistry and comic timing with one another helps push the film even further. The three make for an excellent team and watching this film makes it look like the trio had been working together for years because they come off so well together. Heather Graham isn't too bad in her role and the great Jeffrey Tambor even gets a nice laugh. You really have to respect a movie that takes a familiar plot and mixes it up to the point of it being completely original and most importantly, downright hilarious. I hate labeling films when they're so fresh but I would be shocked if this movie isn't looked at in ten years the same way we look at ""dirty"" comedies like NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE and PORKY'S today."

The movie has a very simple plot line. Four guys go to Vegas as a bachelor party and wake up hungover. The thing that I liked about this movie that really had nothing to do with how funny it was, was that it was well made. Some comedies have horrible lighting and visuals and only focus on the jokes. But this movie looks great, sounds great and was edited fantastically. Having said that, it was naturally funny. It didn't feel forced at all and and there was no political agenda behind it unlike shows like Family Guy and movies like Harlod and Kumar. Overall this movie was one of the funniest, well done comedies I have ever seen. Everyone in the cinema was laughing and having a great time. If you like to laugh, which everyone should, you will love this film."
"EijnarAmadeus","4","1","4","17 June 2009"," Better to see, than to recall, which is quite unusual for most American comedies.
","'The Hangover' is undoubtedly one of the best mainstream comedies of 2009 so far. With that said, it's important to remember that comedies are rarely very funny, and especially American ones. And naming 'The Hangover' one of the best comedies of 2009, it's also important for me to say that I didn't find it very funny, it was very entertaining and joyous, but rarely laugh-out-loud funny; most of the gags or jokes seemed somehow familiar, and the sketches drawn into the script were occasionally misplaced (the Taser scene). With that said, the three main performances does everything to this movie; Bradley Cooper as the cocky alpha-male with a twist, Ed Helms as the pussy-whipped nerd and Zach Galifianakis being somewhat of a baby inside a grown-up man, and they were all great in their characters. The whole atmosphere of the movie works greatly, like ""what exactly happened last night?"" and you pulsate in the same manic rhythm as their Las Vegas trip simply goes more and more terribly wrong. And after a 100 minutes of Las Vegas meltdown it's nice to see that the movie's got a heart (Heather Graham shines as a shattered stripper) and the end credits are greatly provided with pictures from the night we never experienced."

","A simple, familiar setup is actually made worthwhile in this amusingly raunchy comedy. Four friends from Los Angeles, one soon to be married the other three his loyal groomsmen, take a trip to Las Vegas to have the time of their lives and give the would-be groom a night he'll never forget. It actually turns into a night they all forget when they awake the next morning with a bad hangover, no recollection of what occurred the previous night, and a series of misadventures that only grow stranger as they try to piece together the events of their wild ""bachelor party."" What initially sounds like a variation on the dreadful stoner comedy Dude, Where's My Car? actually produces some very clever results with more than enough vulgar and very funny gags, appealing characters, and a feel-good tone. Slow at first, but the more out of control the jokes get the more laughs they produce, even though it does arrive at an inevitable conclusion. Beyond that it's wildly good fun. ***"

Of course there are some formulas every movie must follow but it must use it cleverly and in a way not used before. They give us the conservative guy, the adventurous guy and the insane guy.

I am not used to watch this kind of American movies and I was shocked by the sexism. The movie starts with a quick joke about gays (admittedly, I made these jokes too when I was 13). Then you see pieces of women (beautiful legs, buttocks, some breasts in bikini), a girlfriend explicitly called a prostitute who does not like sperm, a sexy girl on the street who thanks one of the main characters after a moderately obscene compliment on the street (cause women like that).<br/><br/>I gave this movie 2 starts because I guess the detective part of the story where they try to discover the past night is original for this sort of movies."

","It's one of the most hilarious movies i've ever seen. I laughed so hard and had extremely fun for the entire movie. And you know, some people can say that there were ""too many below the belt jokes (such as; Alan's joke with the baby)"" and which is true. But four guys go to Las Vegas for the bachelor party. Actually, what would you expect other than this?
They woke up in the next morning, none of them can remember a thing and realize that the groom is missing. Alan, Phil and Stu try to find Doug who is the groom-to be.
It can say that all of the things that happen to them is incredibly farcical. I think that's the reason makes it so funny. There's a well-written screenplay and by the leading of Zach Galifianakis, Ed Helms and Bradley Cooper have great chemistry and they are really funny. Zach Galifianakis is extremely hilarious for the entire movie and he fits the character.
Personally, i can say that i love it very much. The genre is comedy and all and usually, it can make lower the expectations somehow about the quality of the movie. But i think that it is the one of the most amazing examples of the genre.
I can recommend to the people who love to laugh. And also this movie presents Bradley Cooper to the world as a fine actor completely."

","My initial review of this was ""Eh."" Here it is:
""A dramatically sound comedy with a disappointing solution. It, and several other comedic moments in the film, are reliant on distractingly contrived and implausible variables. In other words, the characters would have to be more stupid than they are presented to be in order for this plot to be possible. So, it's funny, and I watched the whole thing, but overall... eh.""<br/><br/>However, this review does not fully account for what you are delivered as a result of these contrived plot points. Sure, a plot hole or two-rather, an impossible scenario or two-can make a story very challenging to agree with. But when it delivers you something like Stu's resolution, or like the photographic sequence during the credits, perhaps it is worth it. Those two things wrap this story up in what I hazard to call...
Comedic Realism.<br/><br/>Something I think this film is, perhaps, a pioneer of. I remember this changing American comedies. Now I see why."

Unfortunately, one of the party members makes sure that everyone's memory stays as well. And the reconstruction of the events of the previous night's events makes for almost slapstick hilarity.

","Since I'm not a big comedy fan, it probably is unfair for me to review comedies.<br/><br/>But let's look at the film for what it is. The story is about three guys who can't remember what they did the night before. Interesting enough concept. However, the film dishes up more than it can handle, and more than what is remotely possible for these guys to have done in a single night. Therefore, it is completely unrealistic - almost like a fantasy even. Stu marrying a hooker is unbelievable enough, let alone the wedding planner managing to print mugs, caps, coasters and other memorabilia in a matter of a few hours, and have it ready for them. That's just not possible, and no-one would believe this. Unless you turn a blind eye to the reality issue, off course.<br/><br/>The acting is ok, although maybe a bit over the top at times. The film is demented and chaotic, which is not entirely a bad thing. Only, for a comedy it just wasn't all that funny. More often than not I just shook my head in disbelief thinking ""Really? You expect me to swallow all this garbage you're feeding me?""<br/><br/>Some scenes were pure slapstick, and I hate slapstick. My favorite character by far, was Mr Chow (Ken Jeong). He was funny.

","II is the funniest; I comes second (despite being the original); III is not funny at all.<br/><br/>Having seen this movie twice now, I can report that it is generally a lame and unbelievable film, but one that succeeds in generating a stream of chuckles and the occasional guffaw.<br/><br/>The humour is generated almost completely by Alan (Zach Galifianakis) and to a lesser extent by Mr Chow (Ken Jeong). Stu (Ed Helms) is funny but some of his scenes are forced. He's there to be the geeky normal guy who has abnormal things happen to him. Phil (Bradley Cooper) is there to add physical appeal, magnetism and leadership to the group. It's an odd grouping, but it works to a certain extent.<br/><br/>This ""man movie"" is low-brow escapist humour based on the absurd conceit that ordinary straight American white guys who lead rather boring lives are, deep down, wild party animals who do the funniest and most amazing things when they get wasted in Vegas.<br/><br/>The movie reflects the experience that most male moviegoers have had of getting wasted in their youth and doing stupid things. ""It wasn't really stupid after all! It was pretty cool!!"" Sorry, but throwing up on the lawn is not the same as stealing a tiger from Mike Tyson.<br/><br/>Part of the morality play at the heart of this movie is ""boys will be boys at a bachelor party"" and ""you're not really responsible for what you do if you got so wasted that you can't even remember it"". The title is misleading, because the memory lapse doesn't come from alcohol but from ruphies. Most of us who have gotten wasted can (unfortunately) remember the stupid things we did. <br/><br/>At the end, I was thinking that another part of this American morality play was this: ""nothing must ever be allowed to disrupt the bride's perfect wedding"".<br/><br/>This movie took almost an hour to set up the hangover. Too long."

","I rented this movie with an open mind. When it comes to movies, my memory can be fuzzy and all I remember when this film was released was that it was about a trip (travel and drug) that went awfully wrong. These characters had no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I suspect that the film's subtext is what the story is really about rather than the sophomoric antics that initially give the movie a comedic flair.<br/><br/>For starters, Alan (Zach Galifianakis) is a registered sex offender whose sister is getting married to Doug (Justin Bartha), the groom. He even tries to make a pass at his unreceptive future brother-in-law, Doug. Doug suggests that a sexual relationship with Alan would be borderline incestuous and politely declines. There are scenes that suggest that Alan is into bestiality, is bisexual, and a drug addict with ties to drug dealers. <br/><br/>Doug is the insipid nice guy who reluctantly accepts Alan into his circle of friends. <br/><br/>Stu (Ed Helms) is a nerdy and spineless dentist with an Oedipus complex. His relationship with Melissa is that of mother and son, not future husband and wife. Out of all the men, Stu lost it the most during their drug and alcohol trip. He married a local stripper with a newborn and is very quick to turn his back on the morals he pretends to uphold. <br/><br/>Phil (Bradley Cooper) is the quintessential pretty boy who is a douchebag. He is a grade school teacher who fathered a child with a married woman. Phil hates his job as a teacher and for the most part has no soul. His attitude really irked me because there are many men who are that way. He's the ringleader of the pack even though Stu and Doug are the ones with the money. I'd say Phil has the makings of a hustler; he pretends to know it all yet knows nothing and is more than willing to use your assets to make this possible.<br/><br/>The scenes with Mike Tyson are crazy! There's a lot of symbolism in his role. The men literally chase the tiger (slang for cocaine use). Tyson, a man with a troubled history, plays the role of an avowed animal lover. The band of ""brothers"" (in reference to Alan's failed blood brother ceremony atop the roof) behaved more like animals than the ones Tyson keeps. By the way, he was gently cradling a French Bulldog at home.<br/><br/>Mr. Chow is highly stereotyped as an effeminate ""Chinaman"" with ""small Chinese balls"" who is also a homosexual. His presence was troubling and it was not due to his ""orientation"". <br/><br/>The only reason why I gave this movie 3 stars was because of the beautiful images of Las Vegas. The cinematography's lovely in these scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, my impression of this movie seems to be a closer look into the relationships of bachelors and the dark secrets that they keep. It feels like more of a black comedy if one looks at the film from this perspective."

Just trying to suck in the sheep to make a quick buck, the script will probably suck but I wont judge till I see it.<br/><br/>Back to this one, I saw it opening night with little expectations, I only really knew of Bradley Cooper from Hes not that into you, the dick from Wedding Crashers and a cult horror film, Yes Man Midnight Meat Train.<br/><br/>This was clearly Coopers time to shine, after this he went on to do thinks like date Anniston, appear in Limitless and Oscar nominated movie which was great Silver Linings Playbook. (Two movies with my favorite actor De Niro to boot)<br/><br/>Ya know this was my sisters favorite comedy at the time right after she saw it, claiming it was the funniest movie ever. It did not end there...my brother saw it 6 times in the theater, he never DOES THAT AT ALL so he must of liked it obviously. It really helps me and my friends just stayed at Caesers Palace the year before I saw this and I am from Canada and do not travel a lot. What was also cool was I went to Vegas a month after opening night of this film once again and stayed at MGM and every time I passed by Palace I thought of the film.<br/><br/>I do no think this is as funny as Superbad, Knocked Up, Horrible Bosses or even 40 Year Old Virgin, and of course my favourite comedy the Big Lebowski by the legendary Coen Brothers. If you enjoyed the movies I just named, perhaps you will agree that this movie is arguably close but not better then what I named. Well maybe it is right on Par with bosses. I like to class this movie in the likes of classic comedies like There is Something About Mary, or Meet the Parents.<br/><br/>Great Fun just not the funniest movie of the decade like some claim!"

","The Hangover to some is a masterpiece, to others, it is another pile of crude sex jokes that is American comedy. The reason for this, in my opinion, is the result of years and years and countless numbers of low budget, cheesy, and low quality comedy movies you have probably seen on Comedy Central. The Hangover on the outside seems to be this, but if one digs deeper into the movie, they will discover that it is indeed a remarkable movie including the quest of 4 men, (all possessing unique traits), to have as much fun they can have before Doug gets married. It is all a matter of perception. Before I saw this movie, I expected another one of those few-laugh, crappy movies shown on TV practically 2 weeks after the release. I assure this is not the case. However, some say this movie is the ""best of all comedies"". Well, this is definitely not agreeable to most avid movie fans (especially ones above the age of 18). This reaction is because of the number of moviegoers who have not been exposed to some of the earlier, greater comedy works. Instead they have been exposed to the cheesy and low quality works with little or no effort to organize a reliable plot as well as other movie needs. It is instead stuffed with stupid and out-of-date punchlines and tasteless humor to arouse a younger audience who will pay for a movie ticket to get some cheap thrills. Think of this movie as a ""breath of fresh air"" to the disasters in comedy in the past 5 years."

","Against my better judgment I decided to see this film because of the success of its sequel and the high ratings here. Surely if a sequel was made for a film, then the original film must've been good enough to warrant that, right? Well... no, it wasn't. I should've remembered the Resident Evil and Scream series. (They just keep pumping these out, don't they?)<br/><br/>Anyway, I can't say I was disappointed. I pretty much got what I expected: a bunch of guys getting together to do something wildly stupid so that we could laugh at them. OK, I was hoping for more because of the success of the sequel but, unfortunately, that was it. It was about as funny as watching some guys trying to tip a cow. In the words of Seth from Superbad, ""That's not even clever!""<br/><br/>This film could've been funny and the jokes sound funny on paper, but on film, they weren't. I mean, an image of some guys waking up from their stupor to find themselves in the middle of a disheveled room with a chicken and a tiger and no clue as to what they've done does sound funny. So why wasn't it? Probably because there was no chemistry among the main characters. It was just a group of individuals experiencing unusual circumstances. I felt nothing for them.<br/><br/>The only time I actually laughed was during that scene where the bearded guy was playing with the baby. That was roughly 20 minutes into the movie and that was pretty much the only, really funny, though somewhat vulgar and tasteless, scene. The rest of the time I was only interested in finding out how the movie would end. <br/><br/>I didn't find much humor in this film but it did keep me interested enough to finish watching it which is why I'm giving it a 7."

","Comedy is a hard genre. It's really hard to find talented comedy actors that make us laugh without feeling empty in doing it. I'm not talking about the easy laugh of an arranged false situation where you just laugh at the awkwardness of the scene. True comedy is closer to true drama than to anything else. That's what i think. But once in a while, one can find a decent comedy, that succeeds in the performances. More rare is to watch something that does something interesting on the narrative level. This is the case.<br/><br/>The performances are standard routine in what concerns today's physical acting and word timing. This is the part of the thing that usually gets outdated so soon, so i suspect that in 15 years we'll no longer laugh at the phrasing, timing, or even most of the written jokes. Zach Galifianakis is the exception. He acts really funny because he's the only character who doesn't act to be funny. He doesn't force his comic act into the audiences. He stands outside the comic forces of the film, quite literally, as his character is an alien forced upon the well acquainted group. So he just stands there, and there resides the fun of his performance.<br/><br/>The nice thing here is done on the narrative structure of the thing. The story is about a group of guys who don't remember what happened the night before (drugs, booze, etc.). They are given clues (the baby, the tiger, the police car) which are the links to those unremembered events. Following those leads, in a sort of a twisted detective story mechanics, they will be able to retell the events they don't remember. So, the narrative structure is that these characters will reveal a story that has already happened, to Them! This is a fun concept, and a clever device. And it is really rare to find clever structures applied to mainstream comedy.<br/><br/>Well the unveiling of the missing puzzle pieces of their night is not as great as it might have been. The Mike Tyson episode is forced upon the narrative, probably there to include Tyson and sell some more tickets with his presence, but it just feels out of place, a scene from another movie. But overall, this is OK.<br/><br/>My opinion: 3/5<br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"
"hall895","6","0","2","29 January 2011"," Doesn't match the hype
","The Hangover is one of those movies which doesn't live up to the standards suggested by all the breathless hype. It's rather overrated, most definitely not one of the funniest movies ever made as so many of its ardent fans would suggest it to be. It's an OK movie, no more, no less. It has a smart, interesting setup but the setup proves to be better than the execution. You get the sense a lot of truly hilarious things happened over the time frame of the story. But we never actually see those things. We missed the debauchery and saw only the aftermath. It was an interesting premise, having the characters try to piece together what happened during the night of madness they can't remember. But it feels like we missed the good stuff. And what we're left with isn't enough to compensate. It's a movie which has its moments but what should have been the best moments are pretty clearly the moments we never see.<br/><br/>The story surrounds a wild, crazy bachelor party. Doug is the groom, his wedding a mere two days away when he, his two best friends and his bride-to-be's rather strange brother head to Vegas. Note to future grooms: going to Vegas two days before your wedding...bad idea. The movie opens on the morning of the wedding with one of the friends calling the bride to deliver the bad news. They can't find Doug. Flash back a couple of days and we see the gang of four preparing for their excursion. We see the drive from California to Vegas, their arrival in Sin City and a toast to a night they'll never forget. And then it's the next morning. And all hell has broken loose. And Doug is gone. And none of the other three can remember a thing. And there's a tiger in the bathroom.<br/><br/>There's the tiger. And a chicken, a police car and a mattress impaled on a statue. There's a baby. And a stripper, a naked Asian man and a former heavyweight champion of the world. How do all these things tie together? What the heck happened last night? And where is Doug? Our gang, now down to three, begins a seemingly futile attempt to make sense of the madness. As they try to piece together the puzzle we're treated to some laughs. But not nearly as many laughs as this movie's reputation would suggest. The movie just is not consistently funny enough, it's very hit and miss. And while the setup sounds like it makes room for all kinds of outrageous stuff the movie actually ends up being much more tame than you would think. The fact that the three main characters are as a group rather bland doesn't help. The characters of Phil and Stu, played by Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms respectively, are pretty much straight men, there to play off the really funny characters. And that's where the bride's brother Alan, played by Zach Galifianakis, comes in. He's clearly meant to be the most memorable character, the wacky, strange, outlandish funnyman. But while he's clearly funnier than the other two the character doesn't make as much of an impression as he really needs to for the movie to be as riotously funny as it promised to be. Supporting players, on the screen for only a few minutes here and there, really outshine the three central characters. And that's a problem. The Hangover is the story of one wild night. But it's one wild night which the audience missed out on. Much of the funniest stuff the film has to offer doesn't come until the closing credits have begun to roll. And by then it's much too late. Not a bad movie. But one which has a reputation which far exceeds its actual quality."

","""The Hangover"" is basically about four dudes who go to Vegas for a bachelor party, but things don't go as they planned. I have to admit I had some few laughs in the film, but it showed nothing original or different from what we've already seen. After the first night in Vegas, they forget everything they did last night because they have mistakenly taken Rohypno instead of an ecstasy. From there on, all the scenes were about three of them looking for the other missing dude and all we have is a memory of ""Dude Where's My Car?"" with older guys and another town. But at least the movie was good at showing true friendship among men and the problems we have to face with our wives. Therefore, I found no reason to watch ""The Hangover"" again or recommend, but will surely watch with friends after some beers"

","I can't exactly remember who recommended this on to me, maybe I was drugged, but I can't say I was overly impressed. I'm not a huge fan of American comedies anyway (sorry guys, I just don't get your sense of humour) so I guess that wasn't the best start. I found many things I didn't like about 'The Hangover', but it's not all bad, there were one or two good things. But more of that later, here's a short synopsis first.<br/><br/>Doug is getting married and, as is the tradition, he and his friends, Phil, Stu and the bride's brother, Alan are off on a bachelor party in Las Vegas. The evening starts off well with impromptu drinks on the roof of Caesar's Palace, but from then on it gets kind of messed up. Phil, Stu and Alan wake up the following morning in their hotel room. There is no sign of Doug and there's a tiger in the bathroom. They also find a baby in a closet. It's now a race against time to piece together the events of the previous evening so they can find Doug and get him to the wedding. On the way we discover, amongst other things, that they stole a police car, Stu got married to a 'dancer' called Jade and a Chinese man called Mr Chow is after them for some reason. Throw in an appearance from Mike Tyson and that's your movie folks! Do they ever find Doug?... What do you think?... I guess it's not too hard to figure out.<br/><br/>Unfortunately a lot of comedy filmmakers decide to make the characters so much larger than life that they just become gross parodies of themselves. For example, the character Phil is a teacher who is married with a son. He steals money from the kids in his class to finance his trip to Vegas. To me that's reprehensible behaviour, but to some people that's just funny. So, I found the humour in this film was pretty well wide of the mark to put it mildly.<br/><br/>OK, so what was good about it? I thought the cameo by Heather Graham as Jade was good and I found Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow very funny. Other than that there's not much to recommend, the performances of the main cast were OK but the loathsome characters and the mindless plot just left me cold. I know there are a lot of people out there that may disagree with me on this one, but not recommended IMO.<br/><br/>My score: 5.3/10"

We even laughed and thought some parts were quite creative and amusing!

The premise here is that 4 guys probably from LA take a car ride to Vegas because one of them is getting married in a few days. They get wasted and drugged. When three of them wake up in their hotel suite they can't remember what happened the previous night, find a tiger and a baby in the room but the groom to be is missing. And that is not the half of it. !! The three guys ( Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis and Bradley Cooper) bounce all over Las Vegas trying to find their buddy and they end up finding out a couple of other things that they have no idea had happened to them while they were whacked out of their minds. Maybe, at least one of the characters discovers something worthwhile about himself that he didn't realize before. Unless this theme is really up your alley, we suggest that you pass on it."

","This movie is hard to evaluate. It has some very good points, but it is not as great as it might sound. It's just good. The story is creative, with weird and curious mysteries to be unveiled. Although not at a slow pace, the film goes at a slower pace than it should, considering the various things happening. Most mysteries are explained, but the things done by the characters are not believable. Most things that are supposed to be funny are just plain dummy. So, in the end, this is a pretty average work.

","The Hangover is about four guys who go to Vegas for a bachelor party. In all recent comedy fashion and just what you would expect from the title, these guys wake up, after having spent a night of being blown out of their minds in Vegas. Unfortunately, one of the guys is missing and they start out on a terribly misguided adventure to find out where he is.<br/><br/>So in other words, The Hangover follows the formula of Dude Where's My Car, with comedy that is overall more shocking and less about stupid comedy and more about shock comedy. If you can let yourself go for a little while, and try not to think about the thousands of moral implications brought on by the storyline, then you're liable to enjoy some good dirty fun, and one of the funniest comedy movies this century.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, there are some down sides. This movie really is ONLY about the misadventures brought about by their actions from the night before, nothing deep or meaningful here. While you do have to let yourself go every once in a while, it's a shame the movie didn't take more of a shot at the corrupt morals it takes to ruin your life in Vegas, and simply promotes Sin City's decadence of stupid young twenty something lifestyle being played out by mid thirty aged actors.<br/><br/>That being said, the actors do a great job. The shining role here is played by Zach Galifianakis, as the brother of the bride, and his lines of really screwed up shock comedy, rather than every other actor in the movie. Ultimately the second best actor is the guy you see the least of, the groom.<br/><br/>The Hangover is good for some nice, not so clean, fun. Basically it is what it sells, and that is what every other after-the-party comedy sells, and that's decadence in a lifestyle that really isn't that great. Still, let yourself go, and you'll find some belly busting laughter several times at this movie."

","From the beginning, I kept getting the feeling that the movie's story and laughs were due to kick in any minute, right around the corner, about to happen in the next scene. This never happened.<br/><br/>I did manage to force a laugh once or twice and the plot kept me interested to watch to the end but it was a bit of a chore. The only character with any depth and realism was the dentist. The other lead actors did not have enough substance, in order to draw humour out of the situations they were planted in.<br/><br/>I think this is a brand of American humour which is not to my taste, though I can see why it would appeal to some other tastes. It's very much about exchanges of 1-liner insults, so if you find this funny, the movie will probably appeal.

","Todd Phillips' ""The Hangover"" is a concept comedy that presumes the idea of being so drunk you can't remember the night before is inherently hilarious, and so relies on the absurdity of its constituent scenes for big laughs. It's essentially a free pass for comedic situations, and the film feels all the more disappointing because of it.<br/><br/>You know the premise; four friends trek to Vegas for a bachelor party they'll never forget-- cue the irony. They wake up in their suite the next morning to find the room trashed, a baby in their closet, a tiger in the bathroom, and Doug (Justin Bartha), the groom-to-be, missing.<br/><br/>""The Hangover"" wants to be a character comedy, but our remaining three protagonists are too transparently archetypical to ever compellingly drive the film. You have Stu (Ed Helms), the high-strung, nerdy dentist with a bitchy girlfriend you know he's gotta dump, Alan (Zach Galifianakis) the fat, weird one whose oddball antics often feel forced, and Phil (Bradley Cooper), the self-loathing elementary school teacher and leader of the pack.<br/><br/>The film's biggest woes are in its payoffs (spoilers ahead). Phil says he hates his life, he pays for the trip to Vegas with bogus field trip money conned from his students, but it's never addressed thereafter, and when he returns to his wife and child by the film's end, he's been inexplicably changed by the experience. Stu has it out with his bitchy girlfriend, but it doesn't become the debilitating power-shift that the film or the characters deserve. Worst of all, it's clearly established in the first act that Doug's stepfather's borrowed car is to be handled with extreme care, so when the crew speeds to the wedding with the beaten heap of the car's remains, we expect a climactic explosion that never comes. It's bottom-line lazy comedy writing.<br/><br/>But ultimately, the movie wasn't written for snobs like me. It is its premise. If the phrase ""People act dumb when they're drunk!"" sounds like an anthem to you, you'll likely to enjoy the film Phillips has crafted here. Comedy is the most subjective film genre, to the point where even theater experience and conditions play a large factor in etching an opinion. The Monday, mid-afternoon crowd of twenty may not have been the best litmus test for the successfulness of the film's gags, though the audience did laugh more frequently than I did.<br/><br/>Still, ""The Hangover"" has some inexcusable story problems, clichéd protagonists, and if you'll pardon the expression, a forgettable story. Recalling some of my favorite recent comedies (""Sideways,"" ""A Mighty Wind,"" last year's ""Tropic Thunder""), the stories are just as successful as the jokes, and if I'm not laughing, I'm engaged. ""The Hangover"" is certainly good for a few chuckles, but offers little of substance beyond that, more akin to a stand-up comedy routine than a credible piece of visual storytelling."

"JoeytheBrit","Null","0","2","22 March 2010"," Good plotting, but not as funny as the trailer.
","I enjoyed this daft comedy well enough, but it isn't the funniest film to recently come out of Hollywood – in fact it would probably struggle to make it into the top three even though it serves up a regular supply of laughs. I suppose that's the trouble with funny trailers – they tend to be a double-edged sword because they draw the people into the cinema but fail to achieve the level of laughs suggested by the trailer that many might expect. The film follows the misadventures of a group of average guys on the stag night of one of them who goes missing following a night that none of them can remember. The guys wake up in their trashed penthouse villa with monster hangovers and discover a tiger in the bathroom and a baby in a cupboard.<br/><br/>I liked the fact that the guys here weren't sex-crazy teens but thirty-somethings with the attendant baggage a few more years under the belt inevitably brings, even though it fails to sidestep some clichéd situations. The film goes out of its way to undermine preconceived notions: the funny cops are also sadistic and vindictive, the outwardly respectable girlfriend is a foul-mouthed harridan who cheats on her partner while the seasoned Vegas stripper/escort is a sweet girl, Mike 'ear-biter' Tyson (who I feel comfortable saying is looking decidedly porky these days, seeing as he is more than an ocean's distance away from me as I type this) is a good guy, the vicious villain is camp and weedy, and so on. It's no doubt a strategy to keep things fresh, and it works for the most part. The four friends make a likable bunch, even as they bicker and fight, and the mystery at the core of the film means that the pace only occasionally flags."

As I was watching this, I could not for the life of me believe that Phillips and everyone else involved were this incredibly unimaginative. Vegas? Marrying Hookers with golden hearts? Even the Vegas tourist board is more creative! The plain fact is, the movie was one of the most tired and flat films i've ever seen.

A good deal of the comedy borders on the surreal, taking in a call-girl and her baby who gets hitched Vegas-style to the put-upon dental doctor, an Oriental crime-lord who wants his casino winning restored in return for their kidnapped buddy and unbelievably washed up boxer Iron Mike Tyson and entourage, including his pet tiger. All the missing gaps are restored to the guys in a clever montage of still photographs as the titles roll as the groom gets, just, to his wedding on time...<br/><br/>It's all performed with great gusto to an almost ever-present modern-day soundtrack and I can certainly see how the film would take with thirty-somethings and under. Being myself, however, much the wrong side of thirty (or forty come to that), I found the humour just too broad and slapdash for me. Going by the movie's box-office take, many millions of cinema-goers and from the high average mark, a great majority of IMDb reviewers obviously beg to differ, but at least I was spared the total-gross-out experience I feared at the outset."

How will the friends be able to recover from such a seemingly disastrous night? <br/><br/>I had heard some positive buzz on ""The Hangover"" from a variety of people, and figured why not watch it? And I will say that while I'm glad I did, it's not quite on a par with other comedies, despite several humorous and outrageous moments. The first twenty minutes is a bit slow, and although it quickly recovers, I just didn't end up feeling as entertained as I had hoped when it was all over. Maybe the characters weren't lovable or something... I don't know. I see this film's popularity declining in a year or two. I'd much rather watch ""Slackers"".<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. The cop car bit is hilarious, the Asian guy from ""Community"" is pretty cool, and the tiger... well, there's a tiger! In fact, my favorite part is Ed Helms' song about the tiger (sometimes referred to as ""Tiger Snooze"", though the actual title is unknown to me). Oh, and a Holocaust ring. My biggest complaint is Heather Graham. While she does fine, I just never cared for Graham and I heard that the part was offered to Lindsay Lohan. I much prefer Lohan, and it's a part that could have helped her collapsing career. Oh well.<br/><br/>If you like ""Old School"" and ""Wedding Crashers"", this is probably your sort of film.

","Despite all the hype behind it, I did not go into The Hangover with anything but mild expectations. Was it funny? For the most part, yes. Was it laugh-out-loud funny? Not really, at least not for me. The premise is quite funny itself, but the jokes that follow were rather lackluster. It did shine in some aspects, I mean, it had modestly good performances. It just never really packed any kind-of punch one would think from a film like this. The characters don’t go anywhere either, only one person in the entire cast shows some growth and that was Stu (the dentist), the others are one-dimensional through and through. All in all, The Hangover was a decent comedy. I did laugh, but I never connected with the characters, and some of the situations seemed rather illogical – I know I should suspend some disbelief with a film like this, but I didn’t believe it warranted such a thing. It’s an okay film, but forgettable."
"DrLex","6","0","3","4 December 2009"," Entertaining, but overrated
","I'm surprised to see that this movie rates 8.0 at the time I'm writing this. Not surprising is that 'Aged under 18' gave the highest scores, because that's the perfect target group for this kind of movie. If you haven't seen a whole lot of good comedies in your life yet, this will be funny. However, if you've seen more movies, it will be all too obvious that the main ingredients of this movie are derivative and/or cheap.<br/><br/>The 'doctor/dentist' gag comes straight out of Wild Hogs for instance, and many of the other situations come from other movies which in most cases did a better job at it. For someone who has watched 'Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas', it feels like the makers of this movie wanted to duplicate the hotel suite scene but were too chicken (pun intended) to do actual damage to their film set. When the humor isn't derivative, it often stoops down to puerile level instead.<br/><br/>This is a 'trailer movie': the best parts are in the trailer and the rest is mostly filler. Don't get me wrong: it's not terrible as a whole. As a kind of remix of existing movies it was entertaining enough not to get me bored. It just doesn't deserve the 10 or even 8 stars many people give it. 6/10 seems much more reasonable."
"voltK","5","0","1","20 September 2009"," The end credits are funny - the movie isn't.
","Did you think the scenes in the trailer were funny? Well, they're actually not very funny at all; it's all slick editing. And yes, as expected, these are the only highlights (if they can be called) of the movie. IMDb's top 250? You've got to be kidding me! Remember that old Tom Hanks movie from 1984 called Bachelor Party? Well, the writers tried to put a new spin on the concept of a crazy bachelor party as movie material but with one big difference: they left out the bachelor party! Now, this fact is not concealed in the trailers. It is made very clear that this movie is about a group of buddies trying to piece together what exactly happened the previous night during their wild bachelor party from which they can't recall anything. However, the writers didn't really make that into a particularly funny story.<br/><br/>So, here's my spoiler: during the credits, you see photos that were taken during the bachelor party. This is just about the only funny part of the movie. And it makes glaringly clear how the movie would have been so much fun if they had simply made it about the bachelor party. Spoiler over.<br/><br/>My advice is to wait until it's out on comedy central. There really isn't much inappropriate material to get cut out for network television anyways."
"poker-jolski","6","0","5","7 August 2009"," Well made but not good
","I seriously don't know why this is rated so up. First annoying thing: this is full of radio-top-list music, though it's good music I cant find a single spot with something happening and without music that i heard 5 times earlier on radio this week. I think people's reactions is one of the most important things in movies, are those realistic and well acted. Well those wasn't realistic and events of the film wasn't so realistic neither.-> So they somehow borrowed some gambling money from "" ""funny"" "" Chinese guy. If they won with the money then they should return 100% of winnings. Okeey... This movie is full of unrealistic things but i can't say this wasn't entertaining, not boring whatsoever. Not a must see but worth of watching.<br/><br/>6/10"
"mostark45","5","0","4","22 July 2009"," too much foul language and sexual innuendos
","I thought this was a decent movie, and I do like Zach (whatever his last name is), normally. He doesn't have to be foul to be funny. Why do so many movies have so much foul language and such. Hey, I don't mind a little, to be realistic. In my opinion, many of the movies would be just as funny, if not more so, without so much of it. It's like, they throw the ""F"" word just for a few more laughs. Has the opposite effect on me. The scenes with the baby were not necessary. I think it would have been funnier if they had tried NOT to say so many! (As in a few scenes). As for the plot line, I enjoyed it. It did have me wondering what was going to happen next. Also, as in previous posts, the Asian guy was a bit over the top. I was not overly impressed with this movie, the previews made it look funnier than it actually was. I have no intention of watching it again."
"mm-39","6","0","4","22 July 2009"," Not as good as old school!
","Not as good as Old School. The Hangover is an okay movie, but falls short of the gold standard. The cast was not as strong as in Old School. One can tell who in the script of the Hangover would be Wil, Vince, and Luke. Too old and expensive is the old cast from Old School. The script in the Hangover is funny in spots, but they showed the best moments in the trailer. I liked the movie but the Hangover is more of rental. I would give the film a six or seven out of ten. One sees some of the cast from Old School in the Hangover, and few of the Old School gags were added into the film. I think they were paying homage to the classic Old School."
"maxmik-1","8","0","2","10 July 2009"," Not that great but pretty funny
","This movie made me laugh even at times when I didn't fully understand why. So for that I am grateful & got my money's worth. I look forward to the DVD with its deleted scenes etc. The central trio of the movie are such a sad sack bunch of losers they really look funny without having to say or do anything. I also appreciated some of the supporting characters: Heather Graham who deserves better parts, the Asian dude who sparked up events, & even Mike Tyson who I normally would not like at all. Plus the baby Carlos who was so cute.I liked the ending especially with the series of photographs which goes a long way to explain what happened."
"tdub154420","2","0","4","8 July 2009"," Funny with Friends
","This movie certainly is a funny comedy, and deserves to be the comedy of the summer since no other film in its genre has yet to compete with its series of humorous events. But having said that, this movie seems to have gained a buzz that has transformed into a drunken mania. Filled with several WTF and OMG moments with quirky characters, this film leaves many reminiscing on their own drunken experiences with a great since of nostalgia and a thirst for their own crazy nights. In fact most members of the audience leave with one comment amongst their friends, ""We need to go to Vegas"". But behind the series of unfortunate and humorous events, when one analyzes the ""Hangover"" in sobriety, its not hard to see that its much like the movie, ""Dude Where's My Car"" but with a bigger budget. Perhaps when this movie is available for households and viewed far from the friends who remember those nostalgic party nights, some of ""The Hangover"" hysteria will fade, and sobriety will set in."
"michael_the_nermal","6","0","3","5 July 2009"," Super Gross, but Decent Comedy
","This movie makes ""Freddy got Fingered"" look like a Sunday school recital. This flick is sick to the nines. I was surprised they let this movie slide with just an R rating; there were times I thought an NC-17 would have been more suitable. DO NOT watch this with anybody under 18! I really mean that for this particular movie.<br/><br/>As far as the content goes, I thought the filmmakers were extraordinarily creative, making the ""hangover"" the main plot and having the audience piece together the ""wild night"" through the dialogue presented throughout the movie. This is a ""Pulp Fiction""-esquire approach I very much appreciated as unique and stylish for a raunchy comedy. The actors are decent, but the standout was the ""fat Jesus"" Alan, who does his damndest to be a bizarre, naive simpleton/man-child. He seemed to have taken his cues from Chris Elliot's ""Chris Peterson"" on ""Get A Life"", Reverend Jim Ignatowsky from ""Taxi"", and a little bit of Kelly Bundy. I'm all for innocent, mondo bizarro men-children in comedy movies, though Alan seemed a little bit mean-spirited compared to Chris Peterson. He looked an awful lot like Torgo from ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"", and seemed just as perverted! He's the highlight of the film, though he's not quite as good as Chris Elliot or Pee-Wee Herman playing the weird man-child character.<br/><br/>Honestly, the best stuff was in the previews; the Mike Tyson cameo was a bit of a letdown. Heather Graham plays a standard-issue ""whore with a heart of gold"" that we've seen a bazillion times. The Asian gangster was just weird. I thought the kids tazing our intrepid heroes was not that funny. Overall, a decent comedy with a notable man-child character, but it's a far cry from ""Cabin Boy."" Wait for the DVD to come out, and just rent it for a few days. Don't bother buying this sucker."
"jerryrblevins","6","0","5","23 June 2009"," Great first watch, Mediocre replay value
","This is a revised review of this movie. I originally gave it a 9, but after the hype and rewatching this movie, my views have changed. Afterall, the true test of a movie is time.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I loved this movie, the first time I saw it. But unlike other comedies, Tommy Boy, Old School, Happy Gilmore, etc. this movie doesn't have replay value.<br/><br/>The initial shock of the photos was epic for me in the theaters, but it lost a lot of weight after knowing they were coming when I watched it on DVD.<br/><br/>Great 1st time watch. Below average 2nd....."
"scottrodrigues","7","0","3","19 June 2009"," It's a let down because the writer and director didn't do a good job.
","Worth watching. I believe ""IF"" the cast was made up of.......<br/><br/>Paul Rudd , Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr, and Steve Carell and the Director , Writer , and Producers were better , then this Movie could've been one of the funniest movies of the Decade<br/><br/>The writers and director totally suck, they didn't utilize Mike Epps or Heather Graham at all. They could have given them way better lines and more of them.<br/><br/>The reason this movie is so highly regarded is because the premise is great and the potential is massive .<br/><br/>It's a let down because the writer and director didn't do a good job. The actors did their parts very well , but they were limited because of the poor producing. I don't normally trash people like this but I'm so angry at the missed opportunity with this movie. I almost felt like this about Oldschool , but this was a terrible miss. <br/><br/>It's like the underdog everyone is rooting for... getting to the Superbowl...winning at half time.... and then losing the game. 3.5/5 If someone else made it 6/5"
"PWNYCNY","7","0","2","18 June 2009"," Amusing
","This is a good movie, not great, but good. The movie has an offbeat story with an interesting twist, almost like a whodunit except that here it's a ""what happened."" Although the story has its amusing moments, it is not uproariously funny. Actually, the movie worked better when showing how three fellows are following up on all kinds of strange and weird clues to figure out what happened to them. There is a lot of slap stick, reminiscent of The Three Stooges, and if you like the Three Stooges style of comedy, then this movie will make you laugh. The funniest character is the Chinese guy played by Ken Jeong whose acting is definitely over the top and is a scene stealer. The three lead characters are amusing but do not come close to generating anything approximating a real loud guffaw. The best part of the movie are the end credits, which says something about the celluloid that preceded it."
