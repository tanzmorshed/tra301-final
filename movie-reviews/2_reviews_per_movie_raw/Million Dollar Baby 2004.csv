","""Million Dollar Baby"" has great characters, but it doesn't glorify them. It has a wonderful story, but it never tries to impress you. The photography, score and direction is superb, but never distracting. What this movie is, if I have to call it something, is passion. Passion for film-making, passion for storytelling, passion for its characters, passion for its actors, and passion for its story and the means at which it will go to tell it. Amazing.<br/><br/>Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) owns a messy boxing gym which is populated, mostly, by downbeat losers who he spends some time training. He runs it with his friend and former student Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman), who now lives contently at a room in the gym. One day a young woman named Maggie (Hilary Swank) walks in, looking for a manager and trainer. Frankie shafts her immediately (""girly, tough ain't enough""). Frankie has bigger things on his hands. He's managing a fighter who has a shot at a title bout.<br/><br/>But Frankie is old and weathered and not an appealing manager, so the fighter leaves him. Frankie is broken by this; it is another in a long line of rejections and separations. We can tell that, at this time in his life, he only gets really close with those he's training (Scrap is the only exception). We can tell that his loneliness  and a bit of persuasion from Scrap  cause him to agree to teach Maggie. Teach, that is the agreement, not manage. But, by the end of the film he will have devoted his life to her.<br/><br/>So the rest of the story follows these two people. There is no real 'plot' that you could describe in a trailer because it is constantly changingit is not the inspiring underdog story you may think of it as. No, what it's 'about' is these characters, and how they react to the circumstances around them, which change with each scene.<br/><br/>Narrating the story is Scrap, speaking like he's looking back to a time long ago when everything has passed. His voice seems flat, deadpan, but there is a working of subtle sorrow in it. Scrap is a sad human being, he sees himself as the result of missed opportunities in the past, and so he spends his time helping the others, offering them his wise advice, with a tone of deadpan humor and even cockiness. Scrap knows what should be done, and what will happen regardless, and he is sort of okay with everything, in a sort of passive way. But the man also knows what's right and he has a deep, inner strength which is displayed in one scene in particular where you just have to cheer. It is an intriguing character, and personally I think it's Freeman's best performance.<br/><br/>And Eastwood's best too. He is an elderly man; some might say too elderly to still be working. After all, most people are retired by his age. But if you had to guess when you're watching this film, you would never, ever say the man is seventy-four. You would say something closer to the sixties, because the man has such amazing energy and dedication, and above all, he has talent. It's been forty long years since ""A Fist Full of Dollars"" and film has come a long way, and so has this man. At seventy-four, passed all those years as an action hero, nearing what's could be the end of his career, Eastwood has made his best movie. I really, really hope he has time to make many more.<br/><br/>As for Swank, well, she must have found something big that she shared with her character, because this is not acting, it is existing. Swank is Maggie. That's all there is too it. This could be the movie she will be remembered for.<br/><br/>So, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a masterpiece. I saw it last night when it opened in my city, and everyone else was seeing ""White Noise"", and I was shaking my head. Everyone who is even remotely interested in movies should see this one, just so they can know how movies are supposed to be made. I'm trying to think, and there is not a single thing here where Eastwood went wrong. The acting, directing, writing, score, cinematographythey all accomplish precisely what they're supposed to with sublime perfection. Many of these aspects will certainly receive Oscars and all of them should.<br/><br/>You may cry through this film, you may cheer. Whatever the case, you will love it.<br/><br/>9/10."

","I didn't view this film until today because I simply wasn't interested in women in boxing; however, I wish I'd seen it years ago! Hillary Swank can never make another film and this one would be her crowning glory. It takes you on a wild ride of emotions from the beginning and Clint Eastwood's curmudgeon self is part of it all. Naturally, the ""voice of God"" in Morgan Freeman is there to explain it all and give some meaning to what each of the characters fell. By now, everyone knows the ending but I still won't spoil it for late-comers to the film like myself. I do believe much has been made about it and it's unnecessary. Yes, you will be torn about what is morally right but you can certainly understand how Eastwood's and Swank's characters feel! Please see this film. You will understand pugilism more than ever before and you just might see some of your own self in the film! It is well worth the time!"

","I don't know why, but I went into the theater thinking I was about to see a female Rocky Balboa kind of deal. I left the theater in a daze. Overwhelmed by the simple truth of its conclusion. My hat to Clint Eastwood. What an extraordinary career. An artist of enormous proportions so well camouflaged behind a shy smile and a charming, clumsy attitude. I remember focusing on Clint Eastwood through a very different lens after sitting through ""Pale Rider"" a mythological, lyrical western. Actors love him because he, clearly, doesn't lie to them, doesn't kiss their asses. He quite simply gives them room to maneuver. Even someone like Meryl Streep, felt freer and capable to stretch herself all the way to Italy under his wing. Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Tim Robbins, Jude Law, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman yes mostly men but there was also, other than Meryl Streep, Genevieve Boujold. Marcia Gay Harden, Laura Linney and now Hillary Swank with a performance that not even ""Boys don't Cry"" could predict. The film is a triumph in every department. My stomach ached from feeling. That's a compliment Mr. Eastwood. Thank you very much."
"delcash006","Null","473","649","20 December 2004"," Loved The Ride
","Million Dollar Baby is a movie about boxing like Braveheart is a movie about men in kilts riding horses. What it is is a movie to experience if you find yourself ever entertaining thoughts about loyalty, determination, talent, no talent, age, youth, courage, fear, fate, and the pain and joy of both living and dying.<br/><br/>I read reviews of Million Dollar Baby and expected to like it. Roger Ebert can be soft on movies because he is plainly a big fan, but even he does not lightly toss around the M-word, masterpiece. Yet he drops it on MDB, and justly so. The story is simple and searing. A gal (Hilary Swank) with much heart and no experience aspires to be the champion of the world. She is Rocky in a sports bra. A grizzled fight trainer-manager/gym owner (Clint Eastwood) reluctantly takes her on. His best pal and wise-man assistant (Morgan Freemna) stands alongside them, as the plot unwinds steadily, seamlessly, picking up speed, scene by scene, act after act. Eastwood and Freeman are artists at the top of their profession and they, along with the brilliant Swank, present you the very worthy lives of three people you will care about and remember. The arena is boxing, but it might as well have been boating or baking. It is a story about values and truths that far exceed sports and movies. I walked into the Lowes Lincoln Square theater last night knowing Million Dollar Baby was taking me on a ride and willing to hop aboard. What a beautiful, memorable ride it was."

","Flawlessly written, acted and directed, MILLION DOLLAR BABY is being hymned and wreathed by the critics as the best film of 2004. They're absolutely right. ""An old master's new masterpiece,"" the NEW YORK TIMES said in a review that was more of an open love letter to Eastwood than anything remotely resembling a critical analysis of the film itself. For once such honey-tongued critical adulation is fully merited. Dark, edgy, subtle and at times emotionally devastating, MILLION DOLLAR BABY represents the apotheosis of Eastwood's art - the most lucid and intelligently limned expression of his philosophy of the outsider, the noble loners whose personal codes of honour set them both above and apart from the compromised, corrupt societies they inhabit. The Boxing Ring As Metaphor For Life is a hoary trope almost as old as Hollywood itself, employed to varying effect in films as diverse as THE CHAMP, GOLDEN BOY, REQUIEM FOR A HEAVYWEIGHT, THE GREAT WHITE HOPE, FAT CITY, ROCKY and RAGING BULL. In MILLION DOLLAR BABY, though, Eastwood the director brings a fresh eye and an entirely fresh approach to both the setting and characterisations, virtually re-inventing this venerable sub-genre rather than simply recycling its conventions. Eastwood the actor is in fine form - a commanding if increasingly weather-beaten presence - as gym owner Frankie Dunn. A case study in loneliness, Dunn's creased face is a map of places you'd rather not go to and disappointment has clearly been a life-long companion. Co-stars Hilary Swank and the magnificent Morgan Freeman, playing Frankie's unlikely protegee Maggie Fitzgerald and friend ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, give what are without question the best performances of their respective careers: deftly underplayed, their roles provide emotionally overwhelming impacts more powerful than anything glimpsed in the film's riotous fight sequences. Forming an iron triangle forged from mutual dependence, Dunn and Dupris school the impulsive but untutored Maggie in both the techniques of boxing and the tradecraft of survival in a world pre-disposed to pulverise individualism. The canvas-floored square ring becomes the arena in which all three characters confront their various demons, battling for both victory and personal redemption. Paul Haggis' screenplay is itself a masterwork, improving on its source material without betraying the concise but compelling situations and superbly drawn characters found in F.X. Toole's short stories. And, finally, Eastwood the composer's elegiac but unobtrusive score is a minor classic of its kind, a requiem to both lost souls and lost causes. MILLION DOLLAR BABY is not only the best film released in 2004 it is also the most fully realised and richly textured major studio movie of the decade."
"thedwork","Null","387","558","22 December 2004"," Best boxing film since ""Raging Bull""?
","Clint Eastwood is a man of faith. He is an artist who is confident and experienced enough to have a deep faith in the audience that he is trying to reach. He is also a master of omission, of the left-out detail/line, trusting in his gut that his audience is willing to participate in his films by exercising their imaginations; that they never want any aspect of the story to be 'dumbed-down' for ready consumption. In fact, his trust in the audience to use their own minds to fill in gaps is like a gift of part ownership in the film. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a beautiful gift, and a masterpiece if film-making.<br/><br/>Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, an elder boxing coach, manager, and expert 'cut man' who runs a gym and is learning Gaelic on the side. He's a nice enough guy, but he can't seem to shake the guilt from ghosts in his past (some we're in on, some not quite). His guilt/shame is a constant just beneath the surface and gives him something of a cold exterior, sometimes frozen. Yet, as played by Eastwood, you know Dunn's aware of his own plight, but just doesn't know how to melt the ice. Or more importantly, if he's deserving of such a meltdown.<br/><br/>Enter Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank). She's a thirty-something trailer trash woman from southwest Missouri. An unlikely hero for sure. But for my money, Maggie is this generation's Rocky. That may seem an easy, simplistic, and over-reaching comparison, but the parallels are deep, obvious and myriad. Like many people, Maggie's dream (being a professional boxer) is always just out of reach, yet she cannot give it up. She works as a waitress to make ends meet (or at least the ends are almost touching), but spends all her spare time training. Like Dunn, Maggie has her own ghosts haunting her, and through these ghosts they bond tighter than super glue. The heart and work (incalculably huge amounts) that Swank put into becoming Maggie are unnoticeable. It's a silly phrase but it's as if she was born to play this part. It fits like a glove. The real life parallel of her relationship to Eastwood no doubt played a part in her ability to connect with the character's relationship to Dunn. Yet this in no way diminishes her accomplishment. She is brilliant.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman plays Dunn's right-hand man (Scrape) at the gym, and reprises a role similar to Red from ""Shawshank Redemption"". He also voices the omniscient narration to the story, a la Red. Like Dunn and Maggie, he's similarly bruised, but somehow less deeply. He's there when both of them need support and helps to bring them together. I can think of nobody acting in film today who can embody kindness and wisdom through friendship and support better than Freeman. He also serves to bring in another Eastwood trademark – 'Banter'. Even when themes are heavy, Eastwood's sense of humor is never entirely absent and he and Freeman have a good time with each other, as did Bacon and Fishburne in ""Mystic River"". These three characters together create a beautiful and true, albeit small, family unit Eastwood's lifelong themes and 'blurring of lines' are on full display: good vs. evil, right vs. wrong, the role of violence, redemption, guilt/shame over previous acts, even god and death. Never one for easy answers, his version of the truth lies in the shadows, quite literally. Cinematographer Tom Stern crafts characters in shadow, shifting in and out of light. There is a grey area between the light and the dark where something approaching truth lies waiting, and this is where Eastwood takes us, then leaves us there to ponder. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a shadow play. As accomplished as ""Unforgiven"" and ""Mystic River"", yet even more personal, this film is a triumph of human storytelling. As Bacon's character says in ""Mystic River"", ""and the hits just keep on comin'."""

","Saw ""Million Dollar Baby"" in Manhattan last night. Clint Eastwood, one of the all-time most famous actors -- and directors -- has more than enough money where he could choose to pull the strings on block-buster, mindless action pictures, ala Jerry Bruckheimer, or comic books. Or, hell, in his twilight years he could just lay back and enjoy his millions. But no. He has chosen instead to make quieter, lower-budget, heart-felt, character driven films like ""The Unforgiven"" ""True Crime"" ""Mystic River"" and now Million Dollar Baby. And the world is a better place for it. Eastwood uses his multiple talents to make films that have something valuable to say. In the emotionally powerful, Million Dollar Baby, he tells an allegorical tale of boxing to subtly express themes of hope, redemption, sacrifice, persistence, and belief in one's self. The movie emphasizes that failure is a more honorable and personally fulfilling trait than never having tried, while also frowning upon laziness and leeching off others. But see the movie and judge for yourself. I personally consider great films as the ones where I leave the theater with a better understanding of human nature, or a desire to improve the world by even a little bit. Eastwood's latest more than succeeds on those counts."

","The movie is excellent. Hillary Swank deserves to receive the Oscar for her performance. I haven't seen much of her lately and am so glad that she was picked for this movie. She seems a natural for this role. Like she didn't even have to act, she just let her own emotions take charge. She stole every scene when she was on. Clint Eastwood is one heck of an actor and his directing of movies is even better. He is 75 years old and hope he has another 10 years of good movie making in him. Morgan Freeman is a great actor who never seems to receive the recognition he deserves. Tell others to see it because it isn't in the top 10 listing of viewed movies last week. I'm concerned the subject matter is too deep for most people and it will be pulled to make room for some lame-brain movie like Fat Albert."

","Clint Eastwood is a legendary film personality. I am a great fan of his. As an actor, I had my reservations with him, but as a storyteller, I have truly inhaled him. 'Million Dollar Baby' is amongst his finest films, a superb film, that almost reaches a Landmark level!<br/><br/>About a hardened trainer/manager works with a determined woman in her attempt to establish herself as a boxer. 'Million Dollar Baby' begins with some humor, then it improves itself into becoming a motivational punch, but ends as a dry and depressing saga. I adored almost everything about the film, except the final 20-25 minutes. The culmination is very depressing. In fact, one just doesn't imagine it would have to end this way! But in all fairness, this one is a winner! <br/><br/>Eastwood's understanding to the subject is objective and that's biggest plus point. Tom Stern's Cinematography is splendid. Joel Cox's editing is razor-sharp.<br/><br/>In the acting department, Hilary Swank delivers a Knock-out performance. She is the life of the show. Morgan Freeman is wonderfully restrained. Eastwood's performance, is a pure of example, of apt multi-tasking. Jay Baruchel as Danger, is flawless. Anthony Mackie is his usual self. Brian F.

","Million Dollar Baby, 25th feature directed by masterful storyteller Clint Eastwood, brings the art that is boxing and implants such raw emotion into it, not one person will leave the theatre with a dry eye.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby tells the story of an old boxing trainer, Frankie, disowned by his daughter, left by his boxer, and has been attending mass almost daily for the past 23 years in the hopes of finding some sort of solitude from the sins he can't seem to forgive himself for. eastwood has never been a more finer actor, who's skills only seem to improve with age. Mr. Eastwood has for so long been honing his acting skills, he disappears into the role of Frankie, played with such remorse, such pain, the audience immediately sympathizes with him over the events that have happened in his life. once he meets Maggie, he tries so hard to not let her in, but due to her strong will to succeed, he gives in, grows and builds a relationship and a love that is so deep, he sees a light at the end of the tunnel, that maybe life is worth living after all. Mr. Eastwood took full control of his character, taking his acting to such depths that it's amazing to think of all the other aspects he put into this masterful film besides his extraordinary acting.<br/><br/>Which brings up Hilary Swank, who in the past few years has experienced a bad run of scripts since Boys Don't Cry, again proves to Hollywood that when given the right material, she is absolutely stunning at becoming and knowing her character. Her face is so expressive the film very well could have been carried off of her facial expressions alone, she was so open to what she was feeling. Swank has cemented an Oscar nomination with this performance and quite possibly her second win as well. Just stunning...<br/><br/>Which of course also leads to the wonderful Morgan Freeman. How this talented actor has not been recognized for his achievements by the Academy is astounding, as he again turns in a tremendous performance as Scrap, an old boxer Frankie feels responsible for for the loss of his eye. freeman plays the exposition or the narration in this film, and given to any other actor the performance would have been average. Yet Freeman has such a presence, such power on the screen, that he turns a semi-small part and makes it a standout.<br/><br/>The score was poignant, thoughtful, and enduring. the screenplay was stunning, the words these characters said to each other, the story, the plot, the list goes on and on. Do not come into this film and expect not to be moved in any way. The film touches you, stays with you, and makes you think of the own decisions you have made in your life and how you've dealt with the consequences.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is hands down THE BEST film of 2004, bar non. See this extraordinary film while it's still in theatres, and prepare to be moved by it's emotional story about overcoming adversity, and fighting with all your heart for what you want in your life.<br/><br/>HIGHLY Recommended.<br/><br/>MJR"

","If anyone had doubts about the genius of Clint Eastwood, they should run, not walk, to see ""Million Dollar Baby"", perhaps the best movie that came out of Hollywood is past year.<br/><br/>Mr. Eastwood has that rare quality in choosing an odd story to bring to the screen. With this film he accomplishes what could be, perhaps, the best movie about boxing in history. In the first place, the story by F. X. Toole, in which the movie is based, is an odd choice. We have seen, so far, men boxers, but there is a world out there where women boxers compete in this sport that is not well known, or not commonly seen. The adaptation by Paul Haggis is excellent.<br/><br/>""Million Dollar Baby"" has a rhythm of its own, seldom seen in boxing formula pictures. Thanks to Tom Stern almost black and white cinematography, this sordid world of second class gyms in the poor areas of the inner city, makes the film more interesting in its texture. Enhancing it all is the great musical score that Mr. Eastwood, a jazz enthusiast, has created. Music has always complimented Mr. Eastwood's work, but never in such a way as in this movie.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the film, please stop reading now.<br/><br/>Frankie Dunn, is a man who has trained boxing champions. He is a man at odds with himself. He has demons within him that are tearing away at his soul. We watch him going to mass on a daily basis, but does that qualify him as a devout Catholic? Not according to Father Horvak, who sees a troubled soul in search of redemption.<br/><br/>Frankie's letters comes back, returned from a daughter that wants nothing to do with him. Frankie, at the beginning of the film, loses the services of one his better boxers because a richer competitor is willing to pay the fighter much more. Frankie keeps the older Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris employed in the gym because he feels guilty in having let this former boxer down at the highest point of Scrap's career.<br/><br/>Into this world comes Maggie Fitzgerald. She is a young woman who wants to make it as a fighter; she comes from a white trash background and everything is against her. The only reason she has been allowed in the all-male gym is because she has paid six months worth of membership. We watch Maggie as she struggles on her own without any help from Frankie, the man she would like to interest in coaching her. Frankie realizes there is potential in this young woman, who he sees on a daily basis practicing, and he relents. Maggie proves she follows his instructions well. Then we watch her progress as she wins fight after fight until the million dollar fight with the vicious title holder.<br/><br/>The ironic twist toward the end of the movie arrives out of nowhere; it shakes us up because it was totally unexpected. It makes Frankie and Maggie become father and daughter. Because of the guilt he feels in his own life, Frankie does the right thing in accepting the responsibility of the situation.<br/><br/>The ending is the only thing that feels a bit manipulative in the film, although it's handled with a lot of taste, as it would have been worse in the hands of another, less capable director. The only other complain is that Mr. Eastwood speaks in a whisper, which distracts from what is going on, as we strain our ears to catch every nuance of the brilliant dialog. Also, the voice over by Morgan Freeman's character is at times, unintelligible.<br/><br/>This is a film totally dominated by Clint Eastwood. As an actor, he brings to the role total credibility as the tormented soul inside Frankie. Hilary Swank makes a brilliant Maggie, the ambitious girl that gets much more than what she bargained for. Ms. Swank has the best moment of her career after her work in ""Boys Don't Cry"". Working with the right elements, Ms. Swank is an actress that works with little gestures to achieve her input in the character she is playing.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is excellent as the beaten Scrap, a man who ""could have been a contender"". He underplays this character with sensational results. Brian O'Byrne, a theater actor who has been seen in two important plays this year in the New York stages, makes an impression as Father Hovark, who seems to understand Frankie. Margo Martindale is convincing as Maggie's mother.<br/><br/>Sometimes it takes a lot for a film to be good. All the right elements were gathered by Clint Eastwood for this movie. It makes one wonder what will his next project be, or if he can surpass the milestone he created with ""Million Dollar Baby""."

","It would be difficult to imagine a more perfect trio of performers the likes of Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman in their respective roles in the emotionally-charged ""Million Dollar Baby."" <br/><br/>My favorite scenes were the early sequences in which Maggie (Swank) visits the dowdy boxing gym and co-opts Eastwood's crusty boxing trainer Frankie into becoming her mentor. Along with the veteran, retired boxer Eddie, played by Freeman, the performances were as electric as the Ali shuffle.<br/><br/>In the overall arc of the story of ""Million Dollar Baby,"" there were three extraneous subplots: (1) Frankie's visits to church and his talks with the priest; (2) the story of the mentally-challenged young man named Danger, who appears in the gym and is taunted by the boxers; and (3) Maggie's family members introduced in two scenes filled with such vulgarity that much of the film's hard-earned credibility was lost. Not only would the film have worked effectively without the subplots, it would have been a much better film without them.<br/><br/>While Eastwood's direction was superb, much credit should also go to the designers, especially the stylish work with lighting. I cannot recall a film as dimly lit as this one, and the subdued lighting contributed substantially to the characters and mood evoked in this sensitive film. The three main performances were standouts. But this film was also a very successful team effort."

She convinces the experienced hardened box trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) to couch her and be her manager, with the support of his old partner Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman), who sees her potential as a boxer. Frankie has a problem of relationship with his daughter, and practically adopts Maggie along her career, until she is seriously wounded in a fight for the championship and he has to take a decision.<br/><br/>This unpleasant and sad theme, in the hands of another director, might have become corny. But the awesome Clint Eastwood deals with such touching story without final redemption, very realistic, making a future unforgettable classic in the genre. The characters and the dramatic situation are perfectly developed, and in the end, the viewer becomes sad, but never depressed.

The last 45 minutes are some of the most powerful film-making I can remember. Eastwood is also in top form but allows Swank's performance to trump his own. Freeman is outstanding and might have done enough to earn a Best Supporting Actor nomination. This is so much more than a boxing movie, but it's right there with ""Raging Bull"" and ""Rocky"". I saw ""The Aviator"" two days ago and enjoyed ""MDB"" more.<br/><br/>However, the film is not without fault...Eastwood has a tendency to allow scenes to go on too long and to fill them with too much dead air. The dialogue at times appears a little too ad-libbed. There are some minor logical inconsistencies. But the positives far outweigh the negatives."

","Clint Eastwood has been directing films ever since the late 80's and has won twice for best picture. The first time was for Unforgiven, which I have to see someday. The second time was for Million dollar baby, which I just finished today. For a while, I thought that Mystic river was his best. But after seeing Million dollar baby, it's official. This is his crowning achievement.<br/><br/>Eastwood in his long life has never acted or directed better. I have never been more moved,touched, or tragicly heartbroken by any movie other than Million dollar baby. Maybe My sister's keeper. No, Million dollar baby. I loved the characters so much in this film. Million dollar baby is easily the best boxing movie of all time. Better than Rocky,Raging bull, or any others.<br/><br/>Eastwood plays Frank, a boxing trainer, who, as he says in the beginning,""Doesn't train girls"". After lots of persuasion by Maggie(played by 2 time Oscar winner Hillary Swank), he does train her. Maggie wants to be a boxer because she is incredibly broke. So broke, that at the restaurant that she works at, she picks up people's leftovers and eats them for her dinner.<br/><br/>The film shows the solace between the two, and it also shows wannabe boxers(such as Jay Baruchel) and has been boxers, like Frank's friend(played by Morgan Freeman) and how gritty the boxing life is.<br/><br/>This is such a moving story. All of the characters are so lovable. Lots of the scenes just want to make you stand up and cheer. The film is so sweet,and so touching,and so powerful,and so sad. But yet it's more than that. It's actually well writtenly funny, and extremely entertaining. It's sad to think that this is a true story.<br/><br/>I loved all of the characters. Especially Frankie and Maggie. They are so sweet. Eastwood deserved the Oscar that night. He deserved the win, along with Freeman and Swank. Those are three great actors, starring in one great movie. I, like the rest of the world, loved Million dollar baby.<br/><br/>A+"
"nycritic","10","23","35","30 January 2006"," Another Subtle Story by Clint Eastwood
","Three people carrying their own injuries and baggage meet and form an unlikely friendship that slowly becomes familial. Frankie is a man who has lived his entire life in the service of boxing but for reasons left unknown, has an estranged relationship with his daughter, so he has little else to do but be at the boxing gym and train. Eddie is one of his better boxers, a quiet man who can still throw a punch, and who lost an eye in an ill-fated match. Though these two men have a close-knit friendship Frankie still bears tremendous guilt over Eddie's loss. And now, a girl of all people -- Maggie -- wants Frankie to train her. She has nothing going for her, she knows it, and boxing is a way out. While at first Frankie sees no future for her -- she's 31 and has no experience -- he gives in and decides to train her to become the best female fighter ever... until tragedy arrives and gives their lives an unexpected left turn that will change them forever.<br/><br/>What could have been a feminist's answer to ROCKY becomes something different, revelatory. Clint Eastwood, a film director that chooses to direct his films in a deliberate pace more akin to late-night jazz, takes F. X Toole's short story and re-shapes it into visual poetry that unfolds into a tight tapestry which by the end of the film will have stirred many emotions with nary a manipulative hand in sight. Clint Eastwood finds a quiet note with his performance as Frankie, the man who could have been a curmudgeon but becomes a surrogate father to Maggie. His final words to her, in Celtic, are whispered in such a fashion, yet convey an immense gravity. Maggie herself is a complicated character: her life is boxing, she has become to symbolize the sport, and in doing so she's achieved so much in a world where all she would have been is white trash. She has a family who thumbs their noses at her career yet want her money. However, she is not an aggressive woman. If anything, she is polite, humble, respectful even when she shouldn't be. Hilary Swank strikes every note in her own rendition of the character: a soft spoken fighter who is faced with a horrific turn of events and must relinquish her love of sports. Morgan Freeman's performance is also of note, mainly because much of it happens off-screen: his measured voice, the one who tells the story, evolves into one who brings much needed closure later on.<br/><br/>I felt that the film spoke to me for most of its run. Maggie's story was especially compelling (even if a little predictable) but what resonated with me were the reactions of Eddie and Frankie who have less 'action' and more 'reflection'. This is a much better film than MYSTIC RIVER in the way that much of the focus is on the three leads' bonding as a quasi-family in a world that doesn't care about people like them. It takes its time, then captures your full attention, and before you know it, you are immersed in these three lives because these are people you could meet in your lifetime. And that makes a great film, especially when about the little people who are looking for that special place to live out their final years."
"spake01","9","23","35","5 March 2005"," A Lot to Think About
","I just got home from watching this movie, and it has left me thinking.<br/><br/>I personally think the movie was wonderful. I've read reviews where people say that the euthanasia was unnecessary, etc. However, I feel that the euthanasia was extremely important to the film. Once Maggie could no longer fight, she had nothing else to live for. Her family was trash. She was happy, and wanted to die happy. I think it had a happy ending.<br/><br/>I'm tired of movies that have perfect endings and the ending is exactly what you expect when you walk into the theater. This movie proves that happy endings can come in a variety of ways, just depending on how you look at it."
"MinorityReporter","9","13","18","30 October 2005"," Genuine emotions!
","Or at least it seems like genuine emotions in this masterpiece of a film which incidentally is Eastwood's best drama so far and considering how good Mystic River is that's saying something. The storytelling is both fluent and well paced and all actors involved deliver some of their best work so far which is mainly because Eastwood is so good at bringing out the best in his actors. I think people who have watched this film and Mystic River will agree. Eastwood is a no-nonsense story teller and cuts right through to the bone which means that there aren't many subplots and this is a really good thing in this film because the main story doesn't need a large number of subplots to steal away attention. Also at a running length of 2 hours the film would undoubtedly have been too long if Eastwood had added any more subplots.<br/><br/>The acting is as mentioned earlier very, very good. Clint chose to appear in this film himself as he does in many of the films he directs but there is something different about him this time around. Eastwood isn't known as a director who pours his soul out on the screen but in this film he seems to add a few emotions to his range of acting. He is still a tough guy as can be heard from his voice but he is also just a vulnerable old man with an estranged daughter. Its hard to write about his performance without spoiling the film so I'll just say this: This is his most well rounded character to date in spite of the fact that it seems a little far fetched that Eastwood would want to learn Gaelic. Hilary Swank won an Oscar for her performance in this film and in my opinion it was well earned. She plays her character in a way so the character becomes almost instantly likable and you cannot help but root for her. This ability to draw the audience in and make them feel is very rare but Swank seems to have mastered it. Overall her performance is impressive. The last notable actor is of course Morgan Freeman who finally won his Oscar. He brings his usual authority and authenticity to the character and while he is ""only"" a supporting character in this film he definitely puts his signature on it with some very moving scenes. The rest of the cast is decent but as the emphasis is on the three mentioned above there is no reason to talk about them further.<br/><br/>The script is rather simple but its simplicity is a quality mark. The film takes you in one direction only to take a twist and turn into something completely different and as the audience had just gotten used to the direction the film was going the twist seems like a genuine shock. I'm not telling what the twist is you're just going to have to watch the film and find out for yourself. The dialog is both witty and intelligent and above all it seems real. Believable. And because of the first class acting it feels even better. When I say that the dialog seems real in fact I mean the entire film seems real. Genuine. Everything from the acting to the atmosphere is highly believable and real even though Swank's character's family and the character of Danger lean ever so slightly towards caricature.<br/><br/>The film really managed to draw me in and I felt with and for the characters of the film. The characters are the driving factor of the film and luckily the actors who portray them are skilled enough to make them seem real. Eastwood outdid himself in the drama genre with this film which is undoubtedly one of his best. It doesn't seem fair to compare the film to Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (or The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) as they are very different films in terms of genre and target group.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is undoubtedly one of the best films of 2004 and is deserving of the Oscar it received in the Best Film category as well as the other Oscars it was awarded.<br/><br/>9/10"
"twm-2","8","11","15","11 January 2006"," One of the Great Love Stories Trapped Within a Flawed Film
","There is both much to admire, and to despise, within this film. I believe the positives far outweigh the negatives, yet the negatives are so odious, so blatant, that they amount to a major defacement--all the more so because they could have so easily been corrected--marring what otherwise might have been a masterpiece of film making. As a drama about two lonely people who find each other and fall in love (though not in a romantic sense), this film is in a class few others share. As a drama about the sport of boxing, it veers wildly between insightful and ridiculous, and the film as a whole too often embraces caricature and melodrama, crippling our suspension of disbelief and leaving it floundering.<br/><br/>The film revolves about Maggie Fitzgerald--a 30 year old woman who attempts to escape a difficult upbringing in a single-minded pursuit of a boxing career--and Frankie Dunn, a down-on-his-luck manager/trainer and owner of a rundown boxing gym. She basically takes up residence in his gym, working out and trying to persuade him to take her under his wing. He wants no part of managing a ""girl""--especially one virtually over the hill--and puts her off with one caustic rebuff after another. She persists, and over time, stubbornly refusing to take no for an answer, finally persuades him to train her. Before long, reluctantly, a bond begins to grow between the crusty old trainer, permanently estranged from his only daughter, and this fiercely determined woman whose father, the only person who ever loved her, died long ago. It is this growing relationship that is the heart of the film, and it is magnificently played out between these fine actors. Hilary Swank is mesmerizing, every gesture, every expression is convincing. The fact that her character is so sweet-natured, so adorable (in an early fight, she shrugs her shoulders to Frankie's mock disgust in such a way that it had to have melted the hearts of anyone with a heart) that it might give us pause later after the lights go on when we might ask, ""How could this immensely genial character have been so alone?"" but Swank is so compelling that as we watch her, we never doubt her or her situation for a moment. Clint Eastwood is almost as good, and his brusque, brooding, deeply wounded old gym-rat provides an excellent foil to Swank's more hopeful character. We become ensnared in their emotional dynamics, much more than their pursuit of a boxing title. As we watch their love for each other grow (the love between surrogate father and daughter), our love for each of their characters grows as well, so that the ultimate tragedy that befalls them is almost unbearable to watch.<br/><br/>Or at least, it would be if you can ignore the intruding absurdities. First among them are some of the fight sequences. Most of these play well, though there are occasional moments when a punch clearly lands upon air, half a meter from the opponent's face, and yet we hear an accompanying sound effect as if there had been a solidly landed blow. But the principle problem concerns the fights involving a character called ""The Blue Bear""--a figure so ludicrous her appearance in a comic book would be jarringly idiotic. We see her perform acts of deranged mayhem in the ring that make the biting off of an ear seem pacifist. A Nazi Storm Trooper would find her embarrassing. Anyone displaying these traits in real life would be barred from prize-fighting years before reaching a title fight. To suggest that such a one could become champion is light years beyond far-fetched. Apparently, every one of her referees, and the two judges at court-side, are carefully selected for their inability to open their eyes. {Brief Spoilers Ahead} In the climatic showdown, we are told the ""Bear"" wins in spite of egregious violations, including the knock-out punch which occurs 10 seconds after the bell has sounded. {Spoilers End} I thought ""Cinderella Man's"" depiction of the fighter Max Baer was a bit over the top--but not compared to this. In a hundred other boxing films I have seen nothing to approach the outlandishness of this depiction.<br/><br/>There were other problems. Maggie's surviving family were overwrought, cardboard caricatures. Morgan Freeman, who plays Frankie's closest friend, provides the film's narration, and though he does his usual excellent job, his comments weren't as finely written (or were perhaps over written) as those he voiced in ""Shawshank Redemption."" Two or three times we hear him talk about being ""somewhere between nowhere and good-bye,"" which was two or three times too many.<br/><br/>In spite of the drawbacks, which are far from incidental, I found myself spellbound by Maggie and Frankie's relationship. There are other nice things about the film, not least of which is a crowd-pleasing ""interchange"" between Freeman and a bully/would-be fighter, and Eastwood's direction which, in spite of contributing to the lapses noted above, does a fabulous job of getting the most from his cast and providing a wonderfully paced movie--but it is the strength of the central relationship which buoys the film, keeping it afloat in the midst of its sea of weakness. I cannot help but mourn the loss of what could have been. A more realistic villain, a fine-tuning of the script, and this might have been both the greatest boxing movie of all time, and one of the great love stories. I'd like to shake Haggis (the writer) and Eastwood for failing to fully capitalize on their opportunity."
"maggotbrain70","5","131","247","31 December 2004"," Vastly Overrated
","I find the praise that MILLION DOLLAR BABY has received from critics baffling. I did not feel that the film connected on an emotional level, and that it was more like watching stock characters in action. Hillary Swank is very good, but her character moves from amateur boxer to championship contender while showing practically nothing in between. Clint failed to impress me with his performance (and I am a Clint fan), and Morgan Freeman continues to be highly overrated. The second half drags considerably, and I felt the whole third act to be very manipulative. I know I'm in the minority, but I felt a dissenting opinion should be voiced."
"deltahotel","10","9","12","2 June 2008"," This film deserves every good thing said about it
","This has to be a 10. This movie never loses it's impact, emotion, or ""wow"" factor every time I see it. I almost can't say a bad thing about it. As for story and content, I'd probably give it a 9, but the powerhouse trio of Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Hillary Swank push it to a 10. For one thing, I seem to enjoy movies that are narrated by one of the major characters, and Morgan does a fantastic job at this. It was just the right level of emotion to carry through the film. The boxing scenes were awesome!!! Clint Eastwood pulled off the perfect combination of hardened trainer and loving father. It was almost as if he had Maggie replace his daughter who would not talk to him. However, I must say that this is especially fitting for a boxing movie, two people need to be punched in the face. The first, and the most deserving of a punch in the face is Maggie's mother. She is a disgusting, lazy, selfish loser who wants to just sit and take handouts, living off the government while illegally accepting money and gifts from other people. Then she has the balls to hire a lawyer to try to take Maggie's money under the guise of ""protecting her assets."" Bullcrap! Also, to top it all off, when Maggie's family comes out to see her, they spend the day at Disneyland first! Some winning family she has. I almost cheered when Maggie told them all where to shove it. I really enjoy seeing stupid people like that get what they deserve. The second person that needs a punch in the face is the Blue Bear. The cheap shot she took cost Maggie her mobility and career, and eventually her life. We do not hear later what happens to the Blue Bear, but hopefully she was severely punished and banned from boxing. Somehow, I don't think so because she already had a reputation for fighting dirty and getting away with it, but I think I saw a hint of remorse on her face she she saw Maggie's neck break. All in all, amazing film, great music, story, characters, acting, awesome! See my profile to understand my rating philosophy."
"bkoganbing","10","9","12","17 May 2008"," It Doesn't Get Better Than This
","I'm not sure Clint Eastwood shouldn't have just retired after making Million Dollar Baby. Because films don't get any better than this or more poignant.<br/><br/>Maybe Clint was influenced by the career of his young co-star Hillary Swank. When Swank got the Oscar for Boys Don't Cry it was said that it was a pity she reached such a dazzling pinnacle in acting, that it wasn't possible to top it. She might not have topped it, but she certainly equaled it in Million Dollar Baby in every sense of the word.<br/><br/>Clint is certainly beyond the days of being an action hero, no more Dirty Harrys or the Man With No Name films for him in his seventies. But in playing Frankie Dunn as a senior citizen he's put a coda on his career with a role that leaves those iconic parts in the dust.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is a generational love story, but not romance, not hardly in that sense. Clint is a lonely old man, alienated from what family he has left which happens to be a daughter and involved in the running of his gym where prize fighters train.<br/><br/>Boxing is integrated now, women do participate against each other to be sure, but it certainly wasn't so when Eastwood was starting. So it was a fateful day indeed when Maggie Fitzgerald played by Hillary Swank showed up to learn the fine points of pugilism.<br/><br/>I'm sure that Swank took some of the points of character from Brandon Teena in playing Maggie Fitzgerald. It's not an issue of sexual identity for Swank, but both characters come from this white trash background and both yearn for something more in life. There are dozens of sports stories involving men and women who escaped drab lives through athletic skill. The only difference in Million Dollar Baby is that boxing was not open to women until recently.<br/><br/>To use that phrase from another recent film classic, Swank completes Eastwood. She gives him in the family he's lost even if it's ever so briefly and he provides a strong father figure that she lacked in her life. <br/><br/>It all ends so horrifically tragic that I can't say more, but that it's here where even the frozen Medusa would thaw out in tears at the powerful performances of Eastwood and Swank. <br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby won four of the seven Oscars it was nominated for in 2004. It won for Best Picture and Best Director for Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank just as she did for Boys Don't Cry just blew out the competition for Best Actress. And Morgan Freeman who was Eastwood's friend and live-in gym manager and trainer for Swank copped a Best Supporting Actor Award. It's he who narrates Million Dollar Baby, he's the chronicler of the unfolding tragedy.<br/><br/>I suppose the moral of the story is never settle for mediocrity, always strive for your personal best. Even if it ends bad you haven't really lived unless you live that way. And family doesn't necessarily have to have related genes.<br/><br/>This film will be a classic hundreds of years from now. We can all learn some life lessons from Million Dollar Baby."

","Of course, I must see ""THE BEST PICTURE OF 2004!"", I think every movie fanatic has too. Man, cry me a river, this was a good movie! I have to admit, I had my doubts. I'm not really into boxing movies, exception: Raging Bull. But so many people told me that this was a great movie and it was. Hilary Swank, what a performance! This movie makes you feel as if anything can happen. ""I got what I needed"" she says to Clint Eastwood. Clint and Hilary together were absolutely perfect. They made a great team. Clint really did a great job expressing his doubts at first but believing in Hilary, it was truly inspirational.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is a remarkable actor. I'M SO HAPPY HE WON FINALLY! Even though I feel sometimes his roles are typical, he's the disrespected man, but has knowledge and helps people, he's really good at it.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie, but just to let you know, it is a tear jerker.

"RachelLone","10","9","12","7 April 2005"," This movie is about the meaning of LIFE
","Once again, Clint Eastwood did it. 'Million Dollar Baby' has proved to be an overwhelmingly powerful film. Because of this movie, Hilary Swank won her second Academy Award after winning an Oscar for her role in 'Boys Don't Cry' five years ago. Also, Morgan Freeman finally won the same award for Best Actor in a Supporting role, which is well-deserved. I cannot help mentioning Eastwood's previous work 'Unforgiven' and 'Mystic River'. I think he is a brilliant film director.<br/><br/>Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank) is a 31-year-old waitress who aspires to become a professional boxer, despite her age. She finds Frankie Dunn (Eastwood), a boxing trainer with a fine reputation and who runs a boxing gym, hoping he will help her. But 'I don't train girls', says he.<br/><br/>Notwithstanding the fact that he has turned Maggie down, she goes to the gym everyday to practise on her own, even though she doesn't know how to do it right at all. Her strong will somehow impresses Scrap (Freeman), an assistant and caretaker at the gym, a former boxer who loses an eye during a boxing fight. He starts to encourage Maggie and teaches her some basic things. Eventually, Frankie decides to train her, out of her amazing will power. Maggie trains intensively, because THIS is her dream, her only pursuit, she wants to get there, and in the end, she does get there...<br/><br/>Within a couple of years, Maggie is ready for fights. She is indeed a natural, and it is owing to the fact that she works so very hard. Even though at times she has to confront tougher boxers, she makes it anyway. She never backs down. She becomes rich and famous, and she firmly believes her achievement would make her family proud. Now what she wants to do is to take good care of her family.<br/><br/>But her nearly penniless mother despises her, because she thinks being a female boxer is simply ridiculous. She is 'ashamed' of Maggie, laughs at her, and her other family members are totally indifferent.<br/><br/>By then Maggie and Frankie have developed a father-daughter relationship. As a matter of fact, the relationships between Maggie, Frankie and Scrap are quite intriguing. This picture portrays their interaction perfectly.<br/><br/>'Millon Dollar Baby' strikes you when it's least expected. There are many points which leave you wonder: what price dreams? What do you live for? For basic survival or for reaching your goal, so you can be your true self? Are you willing to pay for it? No matter what? And what is LIFE about? If you had seen the film, you would understand what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Maggie has a family who takes her for granted, and Frankie has a daughter who never sees him, who always ignores his letters. In the end, all they've got is each other, but after all they have gone through, after all the respect Maggie gains (Scrap says 'Boxing is about respect. You win respect and take respect from the other guy) and Frankie's being so proud of her, they have to lose each other.<br/><br/>This film makes people think. Deeply. This year's Academy Award Best Picture nominees are all good, I have seen all of them, but I would vote for 'Million Dollar Baby' without any hesitation."
"wainot","3","124","235","22 January 2005"," There's good, there's bad, and there's ugly - in sum, barely mediocre
","Please forgive the 'cute' subject line. Also, I never intend to throw in spoilers, but in evaluating the film with total honesty, it's sometimes necessary to do so. I also don't believe in plot summaries, as you can read hundreds of them elsewhere on this very site. In some ways, this evaluation reads best if you've already seen the movie. One or two more notes: I came into this film, as always, wanting to love it, and hoping to be transported, and at times it did take me for a good ride. Also, I happened to love Mystic River, the last directorial effort by Eastwood (Frankie),I could probably listen to Morgan Freeman (""Scrap"") do a voice-over of The Congressional Quarterly, and though I never saw Boys Don't Cry, I am convinced there is an earnestness and an inner beauty to Hilary Swank (Maggie) that impresses me. Okay, on to the evaluation:<br/><br/>The good: Swank's performance as Maggie -- she did all she could with the role, although it wasn't the most interesting character, and she was ultimately let down by poorly drawn peripheral characters and a very mediocre script. Freeman is always good, and Eastwood's acting was pretty good. The look of the film was OK, the 3 leads looked their parts, the gym looked authentic, and it gave some insight to the job of the cutman. And, at times (but not often), the voiceovers added to the film. Also, some of the byplay between Frankie and Scrap was good stone-busting, yet it never elevated to great drama or great humor - just okay<br/><br/>The bad: The voiceovers too often told you what to think, or what was coming. They did not enrich the story, a la Shawshank, but often were patronizing, and seemed to be a device to cover for what the ""action"" could not do. All of the other characters - outside of the big 3 - were poorly drawn, and two-dimensional --all of them! For a movie that gave you pretty good boxing scenes and insight, it made no sense that Maggie didn't win the title on The Blue Bear's obvious disqualification. The backstory between Scrap and Frankie was not very interesting or textured. We never get enough, or really anything, about why Frankie's daughter never reads his letters. (That's not minimalism - that's just sloppiness. And, it's not like the film doesn't hit you over the head at other times.) Also, why does Maggie - the ultimate fighter in life and in the ring - suddenly do a ""180"" and want to die? There are so many shortcomings here: Why didn't the scenes with the priest really come alive, intellectually or emotionally? I don't mind that the movie switched tones, but aside from a touching moment or two between Maggie and Frankie, it had very little to say, and it didn't really explore the issues with any depth.<br/><br/>The ugly: There was absolutely no subtlety to the depiction of Maggie's family (and they couldn't have been a minor force in shaping who she was) --just horrible, lazy, mean-spirited screen writing here. A little bit of the Danger character went a long way --was there any explanation as to why he was still doing his idiot act for months on end at the gym? Again, he was too stupid to be truly sympathetic, and too cartoonish to be anything less than pitiable. Not funny, not even dramatic - just ugly.<br/><br/>When I watched this movie, I thought it was about an '8"" or a ""b"". Every time I reflect on it, I get angry at the bad script, the two dimensional characters and the wasted talent, and the inability to really involve us, other than wanting to see Maggie (the ultimate diamond in the rough) make it. So, at best, this movie, on reflection, was a ""D"" -- I say this with sadness, and the feeling that if I keep thinking about it, its grade will plummet further."
"alistair_deacon-1","1","131","250","26 March 2005"," A true 'hollywood classic'
","Made-for-the-Oscars cinema at it's finest. This movie is total rubbish. Other than the Oscar(s) it won, it is sure to be forgotten in the annals of film history. Just like Gladiator. And thank goodness for that! In classic Hollywood tradition, the film focuses on a chic subject and a chic controversy -- women's boxing and 'mercy' killing of the disabled. Unfortunately, the film has nothing to say about either.<br/><br/>Since I am a former boxer and boxing connoisseur, and tend to be overly picky about such things, I won't go into the details of how they got the boxing aspects of the movie wrong. Suffice it to say that Rocky(I) was much more realistic.<br/><br/>The actors in the film turn in commendable performances, but Swank is horribly miscast and Freeman somewhat less horribly so.<br/><br/>Swank is far too beautiful, young, and fresh looking to play the part of a deeply scarred untouchable trailer park girl who no men are even interested in romantically. Total Hollywood bol1ocks. Only beautiful actresses need apply. Only the spoon fed masses can accept such nonsense. <br/><br/>Freeman is always Driving Miss Daisy, and he is great playing that part, but he's far too benign a face for the pragmatically backstabbing ex-fighter in Million Dollar Baby. But he has a name...<br/><br/>The plot of the film is horribly contrived. It was difficult not to laugh when the supposed 'heart breaking' ending of the movie revealed itself, unfolding like the nightmare scenario of a 15 year old pen trying desperately to shock his teachers and impress his peers. *yawn*<br/><br/>For the most part, Million Dollar Baby was one big collection of clichés, and they weren't even combined in an interesting way. ""Girly, tough ain't enough."" Are we really expected to take lines like this seriously? Tack on the bit at the end about how life as a quadriplegic is not worth living, and you have yourself a real film's film. At least somebody thought so.<br/><br/>If any proof was needed that Hollywood film-making is purely commodified and has completely lost it's moorings, Million Dollar Baby should suffice.<br/><br/>Hollywood's 'Best Picture'? I'm not surprised."

","I can't understand all the praise this movie has been getting. I think it's a case of jumping on the bandwagon for many of the critics. It seems like nobody wants to say anything bad about it just because Clint Eastwood is the director and star.<br/><br/>Where does this ""great relationship"" people talk about between the boxer and the trainer come from? I sure didn't see it developing during the movie. And what did Clint Eastwood do that merits a nomination for best actor? All he does is walk around, bear his teeth and growl. The only satisfying scene in the movie is when she refuses to sign the papers that would give her low-life family control of her finances and tells them to get lost. And then even that is negated by the ending which leaves her family getting all her money anyway. And what about the legal mess he leaves behind? After he kills her and disappears isn't there an investigation? And what happens with his gym?<br/><br/>People keep saying this isn't a boxing movie and they're sure right about that. I don't think there's more than ten minutes of boxing in it. There are few training sequences of more than two minutes. She just goes from someone that doesn't know how to hit a speed bag to someone ready for a shot at the title. All we here is that ""it's almost like someone has been helping her"". I would like to have learned something about the women's boxing circuit but they don't tell us anything about that either. <br/><br/>What was the purpose the whole sub-plot with the mentally challenged guy that keeps coming to the gym and getting laughed at by the other boxers? Was it just there to provide Morgan Freeman with his big scene of decking the bully?<br/><br/>The critics all talk about how great Hilary Swank's performance is but there must be a dozen actresses in Hollywood that could have done it just as well or better. Also they don't mention that for the last third of the movie she is flat oh her back with a tube sticking out of her throat.<br/><br/>Needless to say I will be hoping that by some miracle one of the other nominated movies will take the Oscar for best picture. I'm not holding my breath though, this is the same academy that picked Shakespeare In Love over Saving Private Ryan a few years ago."

","Most of the comments about this film on IMDb are extremely laudatory. And until the end of Ms. Swank's last match, this film does measure up to all the plaudits. The movie is serious in tone, but it also has innumerable funny moments, and it looks great. The film is truly magical until...<br/><br/>... until the major twist leading to the end comes, and it comes out of nowhere. That's not automatically a bad thing, but in this case it is. The end isn't organic to what we've witnessed preceding it. My friend said it was manipulative, and I agree.<br/><br/>There didn't seem to be any reason to take us where the beginning took us if we were headed where we ended up. What's the point in going so tragic for no real reason? Yes every acting job was flawless, I'm talking about the story here. It was so very odd where it went because there seemed no justification for it to do so. Happy endings are by no means a requirement for a film, but endings that are somehow the narrative extension of what got us there are, and this is far from that.<br/><br/>It's really darn odd."

","I thought I was going to see THE movie of the year. Must have been a bad year.<br/><br/>Aside from the factual inaccuracies of the portrayal of a quadriplegic woman, the stereotypical ""white trash"" family, the cartoonish boxing, and the ridiculous ""Danger"" character, it was OK.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie proves to be a cheap political statement, and sends a terrible message in the process. I was paralyzed from the shoulders down at age 18. I'm not on a ventilator as Swank's character is, but I am totally dependent on others for feeding, dressing, etc.<br/><br/>This movie just perpetuates the myth that sustaining such an injury leads to a meaningless life. Swank can choose between school and death, and she chooses death. Thank you for setting the disabled community back a few more years.<br/><br/>What have I done differently? I've gone to college, lived on my own, and work as a respected journalist in the community. Where is the story about someone like me? Why does every disabled person in a movie have to be a punchline in a joke or depressed and angry? For the record, my feelings about the message don't have any bearing on my feelings about the quality of the film. It just wasn't that great.<br/><br/>My opinion is the only reason it received such acclaim is a) Clint Eastwood, and b) it deals with a controversial subject. We know Hollywood loves to wax on political issues. If you watch this movie, please realize that the depiction of Swank as a quadriplegic is poorly researched. Hit me up if you want to know what it is really like."

","As a boxing film it is most certainly immersive in the sense that Clint Eastwood brings the audience into the story and uses them as an emotional punching-bag. Before going into this film it must be stressed that the film is not light even for a boxing film. At the end of the film there is no real hope left as we see the consequences of the events preceding. I am not a boxing fan and believe it to be a stupid sport where death lurks in every dark corner and whether Clint Eastwood is a boxing fan or not he deals with my problems with boxing in an intelligent and moving way which express the consequences of what can come from the sport. The direction from Eastwood is quiet and beautiful, something I greatly admire him for that is on perfect showcase here and in other films such as Letters from Iwo Jima and Gran Torino. There is a simplicity to this film which is both moving and harrowing. The acting is brilliant. Hilary Swank's ferocious intensity is perfect and she is the first character we connect to. She's an outsider coming into the realm of boxing just as the audience is an outside coming into the film. The film's narrator and supporting actor Morgan Freeman turns in another wonderful performance which isn't showy but is real and whole and Eastwood leads the ensemble in-front of the camera in one of his finest performances ever captured. His music is also beautiful as it too captures the simplicity of the story. At the end I just feel sorry for Cinderella Man, Ron Howard is probably thinking 'why did I have to release my boxing movie the same year the best one ever made was?'"

Hillary Swank steals the show a bit with a sad and brutal story of a very tormented woman's life with incredible power. Enough to bring viewers to tears in fact. Morgan Freeman is great as a supporting actor and he definitely deserves some recognition for his performance. Clint Eastwood himself deserves an Oscar for his excellent directing and own spectacular performance. His role was perfect, creating a strong yet vulnerable character people will embrace. The climax will touch you as his character is given a choice that decides life and death. The score is moving in itself and I simply love this film."

","It is a good thing I did not read Salon.com's review of Million Dollar Baby before I watched it. They derided it by stating that ""Clint Eastwood's boxing movie floats like a lead balloon and stings like a dead bee."" Well, I remember watching a lot of boxing at the National Guard Armory in Tampa 30 years ago, and I can assure you that this was not a ""boxing movie."" The boxing was incidental and only provided the backdrop. This was a story of dreams and failures, of backstabbing and cruelty, of wanting more than life gives you, working for it, and then having some slime ball steal it all when you are not looking because of jealousy. It was about those who take and never give, like the people who grabbed FEMA money in Miami for a hurricane that never came near them. It was the story of life. Real life in the trenches, not life as experienced by those who never worked for anything. It is not about Bush's or Kerry's life, it is about you and me. In that, it succeeded beyond all imagination and I plan to watch it again."

","I think everybody who criticized this film either have not seen it or take the controversy about the film out of context. Now that I have actually seen the film, I feel free to comment on the controversy.<br/><br/>Spoiler: Unlike in the Terri Schiavo case, in which the patient's desires are debatable, here it is not. Maggie wishes to die because she is not able to walk or move her arms. As a professional fighter, it was the only thing she was good at. Do I agree with her decision? I think it was her decision to make. Whether or not I agree with it is irrelevant. I do understand why she made that decision. If you put her decision in the context of the movie, people who criticize her decision will at least understand why. It is also not easy for Clint Eastwood's character to fulfill her wishes. This does not glamorize euthanasia, but sees it as a very difficult decision to make.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, it is a great story of a boxer, her manager, and a guy who works at the gym. They basically become a family. Clint Eastwood is the father, Hilary Swank is the daughter, and Morgan Freeman is the uncle. Since these three are estranged from their own families, they create a family of their own with their home in a boxing gym. All three of the performances are great and the film takes you on a journey where you want to follow these characters. I contrast that with Closer, which had good performances, but I didn't care the least about the characters or their situations. In this movie, you care very much. It deserved every award it got. 10/10"
"Foxterrier","9","7","9","20 February 2005"," An underdog movie with a surprising twist
","Million Dollar Baby (MDB) is about, among other things, a female boxer's fight to get to The Fight, and then her desire to go out swinging. In a sports culture that spits out phrases like ""second place is the first loser,"" Maggie realized that no, she didn't lose: she just forgot to protect herself. Far from feeling sorry for herself, she marveled at the ride she had: traveling the world, being featured in magazines, hearing people chant her name (or at least that name that Frankie gave her). Wow. And when she faced her biggest test, and worst opponent, she stood her ground. Like a prisoner of war defying her captors, she regained her self-respect.<br/><br/>Normally I'd conclude by saying, ""bravo Maggie."" Yet I'm hesitant. <br/><br/>As noted, isn't it ironic that MDB came out at the same time as ""The Sea Inside,"" which shares a similar conclusion? Which makes me wonder, what would Christopher Reeve think of all this? He could have died as a B-list celebrity and the answer to a trivia question. Instead he faced his situation and kept going, and thereby found a new life even brighter than his first.<br/><br/>A beautiful film, Mr. Eastwood. Yes, among other things, it's about boxing."

"FreddyShoop","1","111","214","10 February 2005"," Completely OVERRATED, and often cliché!
","Don't get me wrong, this movie is o.k. But it is completely overrated by professional and amateur movie reviewers alike. It is NOT the best film of the year, but it probably is in the top 10.<br/><br/>No sense in giving away any spoilers or much of the plot. However, the prevalence of spoiler warnings should let you know that there is a surprise gimmick at the end of the movie. Nice try Clint, but I ain't buying.<br/><br/>The acting is above-average, but by no means transcendent. Swank does well enough, and I'm not sure whether her unbelievable ""golly-gee Boss"" portrayal of the character comes from her or from the writer, but whomever is responsible should be cursed with bad gas (because that is what happened to me after consuming 1 1/2 hours of that sickly sweet garbage dialogue). Let's see Swank's poor white trash character travels 1500 miles to LA with no support, no money, no apparent skills, and was raised in a family of criminals, scoundrels, and welfare cheats. HOWEVER, we are supposed to believe she is some sort of saint, with a heart of gold, good morals and manners, hardworking and thrifty, and who talks like a house slave. Yeah, sure. If you had told me she was hooking or in the porn industry because she was down on her luck, fine. Bottom line, Swank's character has depth that is a mile wide and an inch deep. She says pithy fortune cookie type things, but we are never let in on how she reaches such sage realizations. Nice....but hooey.<br/><br/>Clint's character is o.k., and he plays him with his regular steadiness. He plays a grouchy old man, but everyone knows that deep down he has a heart of gold and is grouchy because he cares TOO MUCH rather than too little. Clint's buddy relationship with the Morgan Freeman character is a bit false. They did the same buddy thing in Unforgiven, but this time they didn't spend enough time developing the relationship (at least from Clint's perspective).<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is great per usual, but really gets the shaft with this character. For anyone who's seen The Big Picture, you can just imagine how this movie was developed. They wanted Freeman in it, but didn't bother to give him a character worth playing. Cobble together all his popular roles as the wise and good natured black man (e.g. Shawshank, Seven, Driving Miss Daisy, Kiss the Girls, and Glory) and you get the same thing here. No surprises. The use of his voice as a narrator is pulled straight out of Shawshank, and despite the fact that his voice has a depth, quality, and familiarity second only, perhaps, to James Earl Jones, the narration doesn't work that well and primarily serves to let the director off the hook for actually showing us something (instead of merely telling us). It's too bad really.<br/><br/>There are some minor characters, but they aren't relevant and do not advance the movie but rather serve merely as a pleasant distraction.<br/><br/>Bottom line: a likable movie, but not a great one. If it gets any Oscars, it will be because of the hype and not the movie or the performances."
"Bolesroor","1","54","99","9 February 2005"," No, It Doesn't Work
","*Spoilers Inside* (Please, don't read this review unless you've seen the film.) I saw Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"" after hearing glowing reviews from critics and friends. I heard that it spun a story you thought you knew into new and unexpected territories. I heard it was magnificent. I was ready to love it.<br/><br/>I left the theater feeling cheated, not only because of the jarring twist that renders all before it null and void, but also because of the genuinely shoddy direction, screen writing, and cinematography. Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) is a white-trash waitress with the dream of making it as a boxer... Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is the grizzled, crusty trainer who refuses to take her on as a client. Morgan Freeman is... Morgan Freeman, the noble, dignified black man that he plays in every film in which he's ever appeared. No surprises yet. After what feels like the longest first act in film history, Frankie finally agrees to come out of retirement and train Maggie. We are introduced to a harmless, semi-retarded boxer named 'Danger,' which was such heavy foreshadowing that I literally could not stop thinking about him for the rest of the film, positive he would prove to be the red herring that would kill, maim, or seriously injure one of our leads. The joke was on me- the character serves NO purpose in spite of his significant screen time. <br/><br/>The idea that Maggie becomes an international superstar and contender for the championship and still does not know the meaning of the Gaelic nickname Clint has embroidered on her robe is absurd. And painful. When Maggie finally gets her title fight, an illegal punch by her monster-like opponent sends her to the mat, landing head-first on her corner stool- an event which in real life would disqualify her opponent and possibly concuss Maggie instead wins her opponent the fight and renders Maggie paralyzed, bedridden and ventilator-dependent for the rest of her miserable life. Are we having fun yet? This third act is where the movie falls entirely apart. Morgan Freeman's character is revealed as nothing more than a narrator, a prop, as he serves no point in character or story.<br/><br/>Maggie's monstrously cruel family (ever notice how the antagonists in this ""brilliant character study"" seem to be pure evil?) abandon her and only Frankie will stay by her side, taking care of the once-strong girl who can now barely speak. When she does speak, she predictably begs Frankie to kill her, to end her life and put her out of her pain and misery. Frankie finally decides to oblige after the mandatory wrestling with his conscience... he slips in one night as quietly as the angel of death and wishes Maggie goodbye, finally telling her the true meaning of the nickname he gave her. First, there is no chance in hell she would not already know, and secondly, by this point in the film it's so obvious that Frankie loves the girl like a daughter that the point is moot. The scene could have been saved by Maggie warmly saying, ""I know,"" after Frankie tells her the meaning, but no... she's wide-eyed and surprised and moved beyond words. <br/><br/>So Frankie offs the girl and slips away, never to be seen or heard from again. Wouldn't the nurses in the intensive care unit be alerted when a patient's vitals flat-line? Wouldn't there be a criminal investigation as to who killed this girl? A funeral, even? Not in Million Dollar Baby, baby. All we get is the god-like Freeman narrating the epilogue, pondering where Frankie is and what he might be doing. Problem is, I genuinely didn't care. What I did care about was the fact that the movie was filmed in GlaucomaVision... poorly-lit, out-of-focus, and often underexposed. (There's an art to shadows, Mr. Eastwood, and this isn't it) If you don't believe me about the visuals take a look at the scene in which Freeman and Eastwood watch Swank's first bout from the back of the arena... Morgan stands there with his arms crossed over his chest and there seems to be a key light on his little belly, drawing attention to his little bulge and making him look more heavy than he really is. There are a number of Steadicam shots in which the subject of the shot is lost, and boxing matches shot so shaky that people in the theater couldn't tell who was fighting. (At least it wasn't just me.) <br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is not only mis-titled, it's mis-made. The film exploits the boxing genre and a sack of sports-movie clichés in order to justify the idea of mercy killing. It is unsatisfying, incomplete, and poorly-produced. It manipulates the audience by using an absurd fictional story in order to prepare us for the ""shocking"" ending... a better movie would have been less black and white and allowed us to decide for ourselves. The movie is nothing more than a calculated stunt, and Clint should have retired after ""Mystic River."" It's better to go out on top... just ask Maggie Fitzgerald.<br/><br/>GRADE: F"

I of course had to tell all my friends about it, and now we all want to see it together. I can't describe how touching this movie was, and I know that sounds cheesy, but it's really true. It seemed to make me forget everything going on in my hectic life for just long enough to indulge in the rare and beautiful story of a poor woman with nothing but hope and determination to be the best she can. Her innocence and sweetness adds so much to the plot. Also, Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman are awesome.. I recommend this movie to anyone, just have a box of tissues ready!"

","I watched this awesome movie last night on TV, and I could not stop crying for half an hour: its greatness and emotional power are really something rare and precious. It is simply incredible how the genius of Clint Eatwood was able to go beyond the physical violence of a boxing story and make it an astonishing metaphor of life. The mysterious and simple truth about life and death are so plainly but deeply concentrated in two hours. <br/><br/>Respecting and protecting yourself, distinguishing between the moment you have to fight and the one you have to wait, searching for the great shot of a lifetime, always recognizing one's limits, suffering till the utmost to prove one's strength, standing up after being knocked down but accepting defeat as part of life, enjoying success, but realizing that fair play is not always rewarded, and in the end, feeling when the game is over, for good: this both boxing and life teach. Also faith, however fragile and doubtful, plays a significant role, Frankie goes to mass every day to expiate some guilt of his past life, he needs to believe in something beyond man, although not being fully convinced and although there comes a time in everyone's life when you are alone with your conscience and no one but yourself can make the right decision (the priest, too, knows that religious teachings do not always go hand in hand with the troubles of life). <br/><br/>As the movie approached the end I seemed not to be able to stand the strong emotional engagement, I felt like changing the channel, but I did not, obviously, since it is a movie you have to feel until the utmost. Clint Eastwood is the prototype of true humanity, there are no sufficient words to express his greatness, and his pairing with the always impeccable Morgan Freeman make the story reach the deepest chords of the human soul. Hilary Swank proves to be a talented and courageous actress, in that she let herself be deprived of her natural beauty and femininity to convey the bare truth of life. It is a must see movie, one of those which make you think, cry, feel and cry again in an extreme way, a milestone in the history of cinema."

","MDB is a movie I adored when I saw it when it was released - even though my expectations weren't too high despite the raving press reviews, as I'm not interested in boxing. Seeing it again recently on DVD I loved it as much.<br/><br/>So I've sifted through the (quite numerous) ""hated it"" IMDb reviews to try to understand why so many people didn't share my sense of wonderment at what I think is another Eastwood masterpiece. Apparently bad reviews fall in 3 categories: - people who were expecting a boxing movie (Rocky VI) and were disappointed. I can respect that but hey, what can I say? Wrong expectations. - people who disapprove of euthanasia, or who don't like sad movies altogether. Thats' OK, ""tous les goûts sont dans la nature"" (there's no accounting for taste?) - lastly, quite a lot of people -obviously cinephiles, some of them even Eastwood-fans (as a director) thought the movie was clichéd (simplistic plot, bad dialogue, stereotype characters, etc). Well, I can respect that - probably the movie IS clichéd and simplistic. Clint Eastwood the director has sometimes been compared to John Ford, because his art as a director goes right to the heart of the matter (the heart of human nature?) despite/through a deceptive simplicity. Maybe being foreign (ie French) had something to do with the fact I didn't find the dialogs corny, as some people apparently did, or wasn't annoyed by the ""Southern White Trash"" portrayal.<br/><br/>Anyway... I just thought (still think) MDB is an absolutely wonderful movie, moving beyond description. It's compassionate but not melodramatic, it's beautifully directed and acted. It's a story of people who try to reach for the end of the rainbow, and ultimately fail - a parable of human condition, depending on your metaphysical outlook. Personnaly I can't think of something more moving or beautiful to spend 2-some hours with."

With ""Million Dollar Baby,"" Eastwood has crafted a powerful yet tender story of ambition and remorse, of fearless fighters and broken hearts. <br/><br/>Like ""Mystic River,"" it's a tragedy -- but unlike ""Mystic River,"" it packs an emotional wallop, punching into the viewer gradually, jabbing and hooking, weaving a bit, then slamming the audience hard with tragedy, knocking us out with a painful blow that never once rings sentimental, or false. Freeman is superb, as always, while Swank proves the genius demonstrated in ""Boys Don't Cry"" was no fluke. Eastwood gives one of the most sensitive performances of his career. His score contains elements of ""Mystic River"" and ""Bridges of Madison County,"" yet seems perfectly suited to this, a completely different story. Tom Stern's moody cinematography and Henry Bumstead's decrepit sets are superb, often evoking a sense of the past, while never revealing a specific era. The fight scenes are among the most realistic ever filmed. All in all this Eastwood at his very best -- a true American artist who not only refuses to take off the gloves and leave the ring -- he simply gets better and better with each round. 10 out of 10."

Disney provided countless similar moments in their live action movies of the seventies (See the Herbie series).<br/><br/>The boxing was utterly unbelievable for anyone who has actually watched boxing. However it was amusing to see Hilary knock out boxer after boxer much to her coach's- Clint's- exasperation.<br/><br/>The final opponent- the evil woman who cheats and knocks Hilary out- would surely have been suspended several times based on the behavior depicted in the film. This might not be obvious to everyone- but boxing is not professional wrestling.<br/><br/>Hilary's family is so ridiculously evil that I have to laugh when I remember them. The scenes of Hilary sitting by the hospital window day after day while her family went to Disneyland were painful- but not in the way they were meant to be.<br/><br/>The final scenes seem like a vote for euthanasia and I felt a little ripped off. There is a great deal that's implausible in these scenes. Where does Clint find the needle and the drugs? How does he know what to do? Why don't the nurses on duty catch on? Why isn't there an investigation? But even more importantly- there was no need for the secrecy. As far as I understand, Hilary needed to be on a ventilator or she would die. There is no law that says you have go on a ventilator- at least not in the province where I live. She could have requested to be removed from the machine and died peacefully, without Clint's apparent heroics.<br/><br/>Overall, very disappointing for a movie that was so hyped by critics. There was nothing outstanding about it. What was fun was far from original. What was bad was so bad that it seriously cripples the whole thing.<br/><br/>I can't imagine why intelligent critics loved it in such large numbers. Had this movie been released in February, I believe many people would have cooled toward it by the time Oscar season rolled around. Now I fear it may displace superior movies at the awards show, causing future critics and fans to scratch their heads."

","900 years ago, the Britons invaded Ireland with the intent on eliminating the Irish race. Those who weren't enslaved were killed. Irish women were forcibly mated with Scottish men so that they would bear Scottish children; their descendants are the Protestants in Northern Ireland.

But, hey, why do you expect her Gaelic-reading trainer to be up on Irish history when he doesn't even notice that her robe should read ""mo chuisle,"" not ""mo cuishle""?<br/><br/>Why doesn't Frankie just visit his daughter, and ask her what the hell her problem is? Maggie gets a title shot, but no reporters show up at the gym, nor does she get a single piece of fan mail! Even before she gets to that point, Maggie should have gotten representation, and Frankie should have been dealing with promoters, but I guess Don King and Bob Arum don't do girl fights! Even those who don't follow boxing know that the stool is put out after the fighter reaches his corner! Frankie doesn't raise hell with the boxing commission after the fight! Maggie tells her family to shove it then dies without a Will, automatically leaving them her estate!<br/><br/>But it was her ""If I'm too old for (boxing) then I got nothing"" that's the real hit below the belt!

","What in the world was the Academy thinking?!! Eastwood's movies get slower and slower, more and more tedious as he ages.

Moving on to Eastwood himself... You've already heard my opinion on his directing style and now the acting (and I use the term loosely). Clint adds this to a long and still growing list of broken heroes,has beens and other sad sack ""strong and silent"" types. I personally think he needs to retire from both sides of the camera. At least he didn't embarrass himself with a nude scene with someone young enough to be his granddaughter again. Uggghhh!!

"harry_tk_yung","Null","6","8","10 March 2005"," Oscar calibre, and yet
","ADDITIONAL SPOILER WARNING <br/><br/>Coincidentally, both of the best pictures in this year's Oscar are about choosing death against life, although the circumstances are markedly different. The mood is even more polarised. In Mar adentro, I've never seen a story about death that has so much life that while deeply moved, I left the cinema elated and thankful. With Million Dollar Baby, I cannot remember ever leaving a cinema feeling so depressed.<br/><br/>Many describe the first half of the movie a ""Rocky"" type of uplifting story. Director Eastwood however is determined not to give people who are looking for usual Hollywood cheap thrills what they want. Resisting numerous opportunities to melodramatic magnifications, he tells the story in a simple old style and with minimalism. In addition, some detachment is gained through voice over narration of an observer (albeit not an entirely detached one) one-time great boxer and now janitor ""Scrap"" (Morgan Freeman). The final acceptance of late comer (over 30) Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank) by trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) to pugilistic training does bring an emotional stir but even that tends towards underplaying. Then, except for one bout in which Maggie has her nose broken, all her victories are covered in such rapidity that can almost be mistaken for carelessness. But make no mistake about it. That is exactly the way it is intended to be, so as not to take the focus away from the characters, and their interaction.<br/><br/>Scrap and Frankie is a pair that have been through a lot together, and have reached a point in their life when there's nothing that cannot be said between them. And it's not what is said, by the way they say it, that counts. The spark between Freeman and Eastwood provides some of the much-needed easy and humorous moods in this movie.<br/><br/>Scrap plays a role that is almost like a guardian angel to Maggie. There is not a great deal of interaction between them but whenever there is, he is always gentle and understanding. Morgan and Swank light up the perpectually gloomy screen in this movie with the warmth they radiate.<br/><br/>It is course on the interaction between Frankie and Maggie that this movie rests. Through the initial rejection, the gradual acceptance, the intense training and the eventual sharing of success, we see the development of a mentor/protégé relationship that is quite common, even when superbly acted. It's the abrupt and tragic turn of events in the middle that brings into focus the father/daughter relationship that has been fermenting all along. Not even descriptions such as ""heart-breaking"" can do justice to the emotional turmoil the audience experiences through the second half of the movie. The depth of the emotion intensifies as the agony portrayed by Eastwood and Swank towards the end pierce the air like a silent scream.<br/><br/>While Million Dollar Baby is undoubtedly Oscar calibre in many respects, it is extremely depressing to watch. Final observation: here's a movie with absolutely no sex whatsoever (those who suggest otherwise may wish to consider consulting a psychiatrist), only one four-letter word (uttered, incidentally, by a priest), and a lot of guts in not trying to please the mass."

","Nothing about this film can be improved upon. I heard much of the controversy,but avoided all discussion regarding the surprise twist. So I went to the film expecting another Rocky. During the film I got the sense something unexpected was going to happen - the story was beginning to look like something that was becoming too good to be true for the fighter. Then I was pulled into the drama and the internal struggle the Clint Eastwood charter had to deal with. This film makes neither a pro or anti-euthanasia statement. There are many layers you can peel away and discuss - their meanings, morals, statements, messages and impact. I believed and could identify with the struggle both the Clint Eastwood and Hilary Swank characters went through. It's a powerful character study. You don't have to feel that it justifies euthanasia - it is a powerful drama with an abstract representation of how a handful of people dealt with triumph and tragedy. You can agree or disagree with the outcome, but that does not take away from the powerful impact. One sign of a great film is the controversy it can generate. And this film will be discussed for a long time. If you haven't already, go see it. Think about it and discuss it. It doesn't matter if you don't like or support the decisions made, but identifying with the depth of emotion and struggle will make you the better for it. 10 out of 10 stars."
"jryan-4","Null","15","25","29 January 2005"," Coping with Elevated Expectations
","It's always difficult to be objective about a film like Million Dollar Baby. It's winning all the awards and getting lots of tens. When I walk into a theater to see something like this, the flick is already competing with Citizen Kane and Gone With the wind (or in this case Raging Bull and Somebody Up There Likes Me) rather than Kangaroo Jack or the Ghosts of Edendale.<br/><br/>I tend to become hyper-critical on such occasions which negatively affects my ability to sustain disbelief. Since I am a boxing historian, this tendency particularly pervades my perception of boxing movies all of which seem way too fake and over-simplified as compared to the sport itself.<br/><br/>One time I was covering a fight for Ring magazine and I walked into the dressing room where a manager was trying to force his fighter's fists into a pair of thumb-less gloves.A ruling had recently been passed in New York that preliminary fighters must wear thumb-less gloves as a measure to reduce eye injuries. This fighter had never even seen a pair of thumb-less gloves until five minutes before he was supposed to go into the ring against a local betting favorite. The scene in that dressing room ( ""I ain't wearing those f------ things"") was far more dramatic than anything I've ever seen in a boxing film and these guys weren't even in the ring yet.<br/><br/>So boxing films can best be viewed as metaphors and as metaphors they can not be taken literally. Only in movies do fighters score one punch first round knockouts over and over again. Only in movies do fighters foul as obviously and flagrantly as do the heavies in the movies. On an on and on.<br/><br/>So I'm sitting in the theater, aware of the maudlin, manipulating nature of the metaphor. I'm sort of rolling my eyes at the phoniness of it all, the clichés, the straight from Of Mice and Men story about Axel the Dog and the foreshadowing implicit within the tale. The too familiar technique of Morgan Freeman voice over. Certainly, our nation's critics couldn't be falling for this crap could they? And then, somehow, I too began to fall for it. I gave up the resistance which was futile anyway.<br/><br/>I started pulling for Swank, the actress and Eastwood the director.Let's face it, Eastwood passed John Wayne as the the most iconic of American actors about five years ago and now he takes his place with Scorcese amongst our best directors and here he is playing an old man with no intention of getting the girl. At this point, I'm rooting for Clint more than ever and I've always been on his side ever since the days of Rowdy Yates in Rawhide.<br/><br/>Freeman, yeah, we've sen this before too but ya know what? The reason we see it so often is because it works. I don't know what the thing with ""Danger"" was all about but even that worked sorta.<br/><br/>And Swank. Top of her game.I'll be a fan forever.<br/><br/>By the end, I forgot about the thumb-less gloves and the career of Clint and Glory and Insomnia and everything else except that I was sitting in a movie theater watching a great movie with my wife and daughter and all three of us were getting something from the film, something different for each of us, something we won't be able to articulate but may come back someday and provide us with courage and resilience in the clutch when we're on the ropes."

","Until the Maggie's injury, the movie was a good-acting version of Rocky. From then on, it's nothing but drama, and trying-to-be one of those pessimistic disturbing dramas. Oh yes, the bad and sad ending is naturally inevitable, although sad doesn't necessarily mean bad every time.<br/><br/>Every other frame of the first and the second part is just guessable and expected anyway.<br/><br/>The first part is nothing but boxing, and everything seems to be a gift from heavens, until one disgraceful punch, where nobody in the movie could see it coming, even the referee, who warned the dirty boxer before. And this is where the second part begins: Nothing but trying-to-make-you-cry drama. Actually especially with the family acting so badly, and the family plot so bad, it actually *is* some funny drama, more like soap opera. (Yeah, you can come across the events in soap operas in real life as well)<br/><br/>Be prepared to be disappointed while watching, or just love Eastwood, you'll love this movie. <br/><br/>I wasn't well prepared, nor am I a big admirer of Eastwood (But I do admire him), so one of the most ""I was expecting much much better"" movies I have ever watched."
"Buddy-51","9","7","10","9 September 2005"," beautifully realized drama
","The thing that strikes you the most while watching ""Million Dollar Baby"" is just how confident Clint Eastwood has become as a director. Armed with a good story, he allows the drama to unfold at its own pace, never feeling the need to fancy it up or hurry it along to cater to audience expectations. In fact, in every key area, this masterful film finds Eastwood - as both director and actor - at the top of his form.<br/><br/>Eastwood plays Frank Dunn, an aging boxer-turned-trainer who has yet to hit the big time with any of his ""clients."" The gym he runs in a seedy part of Los Angeles seems more like a watering hole for outcasts and misfits than the launching pad for the next welter-, middle-, or heavyweight champion of the world. Then one day, into his gym, strides Maggie Fitzgerald, a wide-eyed girl from the Ozarks with dreams of making it big in the arena. Even though she has set her sights on Dunn as the man who will teach her, Dunn makes it clear to her that he has absolutely no interest in taking on ""a girl"" for training purposes. But when he sees her determination and fiery spirit, he agrees - however reluctantly - to show her the ropes. The film is an account of the warm relationship that develops between this old man - who has long ago lost contact with his own estranged daughter, and sees in Maggie, if only subconsciously, a chance to make some kind of amends for his own sins - and this feisty, full-hearted girl from the hills.<br/><br/>Even though ""Million Dollar Baby"" has all the earmarks of a typical underdog sports movie, the film far transcends its genre through the excellence of both its screenplay and the performances by Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, who, in the role of a former boxer himself and Dunn's closest friend, provides the voice of practicality and reason that permeates the film. His narration (as it did also in this summer's ""War of the Worlds"" and ""March of the Penguins"") lends the film the gravitas and classicism it needs to stand out from the crowd.<br/><br/>Basing his screenplay on stories by Rope Burns, Paul Haggis has written dialogue that is astute, dramatic and authentic, far more literate than what we are accustomed to finding in most mainstream American movies. And, in his direction, Eastwood establishes just the right rhythm in the speech patterns to draw the audience into the center of the drama. Of course, Eastwood would never have been able to achieve this level of greatness without evoking strong performances from his assembled cast. As an actor, Eastwood himself has never been better than he is here. Gruff and cantankerous one moment, he is tender and warmhearted the next. Dunn has many deep-seated regrets about the past, but, even though his choices have rendered him virtually alone in the world, he still manages to remain both decent in his treatment of others and optimistic about the future. In her second Oscar-winning performance, Swank provides just the right mixture of naïve sweetness, openhearted frankness and unquenchable determination to bring Margaret to vivid life. And Freeman, as always, delivers a beautifully understated performance as the man of quiet perceptions whom Dunn has leaned on for guidance and advice for nigh unto thirty years. Together, this amazing ensemble molds what might have been a cliché-ridden tale into a work of art.<br/><br/>Beautiful in its pacing and exquisite in its details, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is, without question, Clint Eastwood's finest film to date."

Others have pointed out that this probably stems from the naysayers objection to being asked to really feel and think during a film that they anticipated as another Rocky. Eastwood didn't suddenly change directions -- the last third of the film is the point of his film. He didn't betray his audience -- everything before that final 35 minutes or so was the foundation for that ending.<br/><br/>A movie that challenges us to examine our beliefs and preconceptions is a rarity these days -- at least in the US industry. By not supplying a lot of details about his characters, he was respecting his audience's ability to use little hints and nuances to grasp their backgrounds.<br/><br/>Again, this is a wonderful film."

","I hate to see everyone nitpicking at stupid details such as when Maggie goes down and hits her head on the chair, everyone is silent. ""In real life there is no way that would happen, fans would get up, throw things, the trainer would retaliate."" People, first of all, Eastwood isn't wasn't nor will he ever be a boxer. He could have chosen any sport or medium through which to tell his tale. Boxing and a woman just so happen to be great choices for a few reasons, #1 not everyday stuff (woman wanting to be a boxer) #2 great way to symbolize a desire and hidden feelings toward the unexpected for both the female boxer and the trainer. This movie was shot with such impeccable detail that you can bet 80% of most viewers have these things go unnoticed, and cannot identify them, yet almost all of these people are subject to the effect the cinematography has. THAT is truly brilliant. The subtleties like the noir-like voice overs and typical lighting (darker) and word choice in dialog esp between Swank and Eastwood as we see how Maggie truly loves her trainer as a father. And he the same. When Maggie falls down in the ring and gets injured, it is such a dark moment because Eastwood has realized the (in his mind) inevitable tragedy which he has led Maggie into. At that point in time, he already realizes retaliation would be of no use. I actually think that part is one of my favorites. Eastwood is so hit by the fall that he is already past anger and revenge. As if there was a part of him that knew this would happen and now he is feeling guilt and hopelessness. Its really an amazing scene. The filming of that scene also totally emphasizes his inner darkness and pain. This movie stays away from clichés and doesn't give the audience what it wants to see. It doesn't even deal with Maggies death in a ""noble"" way. Its very real. And that is shocking. This movie is 100% guaranteed to withstand the test of time. I don't know much about Clint Eastwood, but this is all I need to know. The man is brilliant. If you don't shed a tear in this movie, you have no heart. Swank deserves an Oscar, so does Eastwood for the directing. Freeman is the only Cliché (the wise old has been black guy) but if you study his character closely you will see how he is actually not clichéd at all. This movie is so powerful that you need a few hours to recuperate and that gut feeling you get during the movie sticks with you for days, and the appreciation will last forever. GREAT MOVIE. MASTERPIECE."
"dtucker86","Null","9","14","8 February 2005"," What a movie!
","I have always been a big fan of Clint Eastwood, both as an actor and a director. He is so modest and low key that people don't realize he directs the majority of his own films. I hope he retires because this is a wonderful swan song to a brilliant career. I felt like crying at the end of the film. Eastwood will be 75 in May and he looks every year of it, Morgan Freeman also looks terrible, but that suits them perfectly in the roles they are playing. In 1992, Eastwood and Freeman made movie magic in Unforgiven and lightning DOES strike twice in the same place here. Hillary Swank gives a knockout (no pun intended) performance as a woman who has nothing but a dream. Her youthful enthusiasm mixes perfectly with her trainers weary cynicism. Boxing is a seamy and brutal sport that this film captures perfectly, all the pain, hurt and dreams that never came true. The boxing scenes are a delight to watch. You have to wonder how many hours Swank actually trained to get all the moves down. It sort of reminded me of Rocky. However, in these movie fight scenes they throw more punches then in dozens of real fights! A boxer would be dead! SPOILER ALERT, SPOILER ALERT. Swank finally became champ in the end, only to have everything taken from her in the cruelest manner imaginable and forcing her trainer to make an unspeakable decision. Forget about the debate on mercy killing, it is just heart breaking to watch because Swank and Eastwood's characters were really like father and daughter in the end. Its all the more moving when it shows his wretched relationship with his own daughter and Swank's money grubbing, ungrateful white-trash family (I was hoping Clint would punch out that punk brother of hers). I think the movie would have been better off if Swank had just won the title and there had been a traditional ""happy"" ending. By the way, this is the only film where I have seen Eastwood weep on screen. He does it at the end when he unplugs her life support and gives her the injection. It is just gut wrenching. You just hope that Swank's character is wearing the crown of everlasting life instead of the championship belt."

Soon afterwards he takes her under his wing and trains her for the big time.After a rocky start they become good friends , she even takes him to Missouri to show her mother the new house she had bought for her from the money she won in various fights and tournaments. However her ungrateful mother throws it back in her face leaving Maggie to seek comfort in Frankie. As time goes on she takes part in more and more fights and even adopts the Gaelic term Mo Chuisle (which consequently means My Darling). Very soon she becomes famous among the Irish supporters who fly the green , white and gold at every match.<br/><br/>The films strong point is in the fact that the film is not primarily based on the popular sport of boxing. Many themes run parallel to this central event .It is because of these themes that the film is so good). As I said before the acting is top-notch . Hilary Swank won an Oscar for her excellent performance (her second prize for such a short career).Morgan Freeman also won an Oscar for his supporting role?narrator of the film . Although this is not his best performance it is a worthy accolade for a man who has previously been denied the big prize. If Jamie Foxx had not been in the running , Clint Eastwood would have a good shot at winning Best Actor but his awards for best director and best film more than make up for this. The film was also denied the best adapted screenplay award(which went to Sideways, which I have not seen so I cannot comment on whether it deserved it or not although director Alexander Payne has made such films as Election and About Schmidt).<br/><br/>Although this is one of my favourite films it will not suit all tastes. People who dislike boxing because of its violent nature should steer well clear as the boxing in this film is of a graphic nature(which earned it its 16 rating in Ireland).<br/><br/>Overall this is an excellent film so catch it if you can."

","This movie is not an action packed boxing movie, its not some random character drama. This movie is all of that and (no pun intended) a million times more.

It isn't original but this movie does such an amazing job of drawing you into the scenes and the characters and the fights that you will be cheering and crying throughout this journey. The best part is what you take away from this film, a mild sort of hope and despair. This movie blends it all so well that you get involved in the film and love every moment. The acting is some of the best of recent years and Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman, and Clint Eastwood all give powerful performances that are just involving. You really get to know these characters as the film progresses and the story opens up. I don't think there was any film last year that came even close to the level of perfection for this movie. Everything done by this movie was just on the dot perfect, and this is possibly the greatest film of Clint Eastwoods entire career."

","Clint Eastwood follows up last year's refined Mystic River, with Million Dollar Baby. The movie starts in a tired and kind of worn out boxing gym in a not too exclusive part of LA. Clint Eastwood's Frankie is the owner, a old and stubborn trainer for some boxers. His sidekick is Morgan Freeman's Eddie, he's the man that runs the gym, an old boxer himself that clean the floors, do some plumbing, give the boxers some words of wisdom when they are in need of it and so on. Into this gym trip's Hilary Swank's Maggie, energetic and determined to go as far as a title shot. What she also wants is Frankie to manage for her so she can get the proper training, but Frankie is made of the old school and that don't involves training girlies. But with her rock hard determination and maybe with some help from Eddie they can wear old Frankie down.<br/><br/>This movie was a satisfaction to watch from the beginning, the three lead actors are all at their peak. They have some really strong roles to work with here. Frankie has characteristics with roles we have seen Eastwood done before, he works every angle of it and it results in a well deserved Oscar nomination. Swank is also very good, thrust worthy in the hard-hitting boxing sequences and wonderful as the happy human being she is. Freeman's quiet but always observing retired boxer is another enjoyment to see, a supporting role and Freeman serves it with big chunks that go a long way.<br/><br/>With his 25th film as a director Clint Eastwood knows how to tell a story, he does it both sensitive and powerful. A moving film to carry with you. Million Dollar Baby has Oscar nominations in all the heavy categories, I hope it takes two or three statues with it home, it deserves it."

His performance is terrific and Swank is probably due her 2nd Oscar, but will ironically lose to Annette Bening who has never won (Swank edged Bening in 1999). Freeman is wonderful as well.<br/><br/>What will be interesting how red staters deal with this movie.

"ethanscarl","1","24","46","2 April 2005"," Highly over-rated movie because it is poorly understood
","I went to see Million Dollar Baby (MDB) with high expectations and a fondness for Eastwood's more compassionate works. I came out feeling mildly disappointed, but with an underlying uneasiness that gradually grew into distaste and even disgust.<br/><br/>MDB is two movies, back-to-back. The first is an almost typical sports story, like ""Karate Kid"" or a thousand others. The ""almost"" qualifier is only because of the intensity of the Swank character's extraordinary humility and dedication, and the intensity of the resistance against her from Eastwood's character -- this was so extreme that its inevitable reversal seemed equally unmotivated. Realizing that this more-or-less standard inspirational success story was insufficient for Oscar material, Eastwood tacked on the second plot as a shameless tear-jerker. Both halves seem fundamentally trite, except for their exaggeration of the well-worn themes they exploit.<br/><br/>It has been set so that dealing with any specifics of this second plot is considered a ""spoiler"", although I'm confident that by now anyone following the news knows full well what it is about. But it should be considered fair warning to prospective viewers to say that the protests from the community of persons with disabilities (against MDB's ""better dead than disabled"" message) were not only well-founded but given special poignancy by the recent death of one of Hollywood's real heroes (Christopher Reeves).<br/><br/>The one-word summary of MDB's greatest sin is STEREOTYPING. Morgan Freeman's character escapes this and gives the movie the bulk of what substance it has (much of rest comes from a ""born-to-lose"" minor character boxer who manages to overcome the extraneousness of his part), but Eastwood and Swank's strong performances can not redeem the stereotypical characters they are condemned to play.<br/><br/>But the very worst (again, because so exaggerated) and perhaps most important stereotyping was of the heroine's family. Actually, they were insufficiently drawn as a family to be a stereotype, but each of its members was a stereotype in the extreme: the pretty but spineless and dissolute (and obviously unwed) young mother, her hostile boyfriend who would have been considered a security risk by the Hell's Angels, and the fat-and-ugly welfare queen mother herself. The unifying factors of these three characters were (1) their lack of affection or sympathy for anyone in general and for Swank's character in particular, (2) their dedication to exploiting the welfare system for all they can get (which is implied to be supporting them forever despite the Clinton-era's ""welfare reform"" limits), and (3) their lust for Swank's money. Stereotypes all, but not just any stereotypes -- these are the wet-dream stereotypes of a right-wing ideologue whose goal in reforming the safety net is to destroy it.<br/><br/>I am content with the Best Supporting Actor award, and I'm not going to argue with MDB's Best Actor or Best Director awards despite my suspicions. But why the Best Picture award? It is all too easy to suspect that it may reflect the Academy's wish to prove their political correctness and placate their right-wing critics, despite irritating the religious right with its more-or-less positive presentation of ""right to die"". In any event, it seems a travesty to present MDB as the Best Picture of the year."

","Million Dollar Baby is a sports drama film directed, co-produced, and scored by Clint Eastwood.It features Eastwood together with Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman. It is the story of an under-appreciated boxing trainer, his elusive past, and his quest for atonement by helping an underdog amateur female boxer achieve her dream of becoming a professional.The screenplay was written by Paul Haggis, based on short stories by F.X. Toole.<br/><br/>Frankie Dunnis a veteran boxing trainer who has devoted his life to the ring and has precious little to show for it; his daughter never answers his letters, and a fighter he's groomed into contender status has paid him back by signing with another manager, leaving Frankie high and dry. His best friend and faithful employee Eddie Dupris is a former fighter who Frankie trained. In his last fight, Eddie suffered a severe injury, a fact that brings Frankie great guilt. One day, Maggie Fitzgerald enters Frankie's life, as well as his gym, and announces she needs a trainer. Frankie regards her as a dubious prospect, and isn't afraid to tell her why: he doesn't think much of women boxing, she's too old at 31, she lacks experience, and has no technique. However, Maggie sees boxing as the one part of her life that gives her meaning and won't give up easily. Finally won over by her determination, Frankie takes on Maggie, and as she slowly grows into a viable fighter, an emotional bond develops between them. When a tragedy befalls one of the three characters, each comes to a decision that shows how the relationships in the film have changed them. <br/><br/>The film has won four Academy Awards that includes Best Picture,Best Actress for Hillary Swank,Best Supporting Actor for Morgan Freeman and Best Director for Clint Eastwood.Obviously,Million Dollar Baby is a masterpiece.It was one of the best movies that Eastwood has made since Unforgiven.The story of a tragedy about an innately paternal man's desperate need to overcome his own emotional traps and the loyal girl who facilitates his growth by her steely will and stubborn drive will definitely catch the viewers emotion just like the character development of the three main characters involved.No question that the direction and acting particularly from Swank and Freeman were excellent,brilliant and outstanding.But overall,it is one motion picture that should never be missed nor put aside when selecting movies to be seen on a weekend."

","Clint Eastwood is really making his mark as a director. In fact, I'd say that he's an even better director than he is (and was) an actor. He took a seemingly slow, passive, uneventful tale of a woman boxer and made it into something deeply moving and mesmerizing. I was easily wrapped into the main characters as they were intriguing and the actors did such a great job. There are rarely fairytale endings in real life, and the writers should be credited for being courageous enough to explore and present a dark ending. We were swept from the joyous emergence of a promising young female boxer who was beating every opponent, to her sudden and tragic fall into the fight of her life on her death bed and the battle with the decision of euthanasia. This movie was so excellent because it could have just as easily been poorly done. With the wrong actors, or wrong director, or wrong writers, this could have been a long sappy drawn out tragedy. I extend my compliments to a movie that made a person that dreads dramas and romance actually stay locked in."
"ClaytonDavis","10","4","5","20 April 2005"," Million Dollar Baby (Top notch)
","First let's start with the undeniable respect for Mr. Clint Eastwood. Producing, directing, and starring in a film is a lot on anyone's plate but Eastwood shows effortless masterwork. Clint Eastwood gives the performance of his career even better than his other Oscar nominated performance in ""Unforgiven."" His voice hasn't been raspier and we've never seen him so bare in character. His scene that proves the worthiness of the performance is his scene when he's in the church crying. There's no performance in 2004 that shows more nakedness and more emotion than that of Eastwood's. Hilary Swank also gives a performance worth remembering. Her character of Maggie is entirely lovable and believable at all times throughout the film. You love her from the very second you get your eyes on her. The real triumph of her performance is the entire last 1/3 of the film. From the moment of her being paralyzed you feel every bit of pain she feels and every tear she sheds you shed with her. She completely embodied herself into the character. Despite the breathtaking performance I still wouldn't give her the Oscar for the 2nd time. The nomination nonetheless was very well deserved. Morgan Freeman was one of the most overdue actors working today prior to ""Million Dollar Baby."" The performance was very good but not one of his best. His win was a celebration of all his fantastic films that went unnoticed by the Academy. (The Shawshank Redemption, Driving Miss Daisy, Street Smart) He is a very talented man showing many ranges in his impressive career from drama to comedy and back to drama again. You can't help but love ""Scrap."" Every line Freeman delivers in the film either gets a laugh or just utterly scene stealing from his co-stars Eastwood and Swank. If it wasn't for his overdue status going into the Oscars I wouldn't of gave him the Oscar. If were going on solely performance Clive Owen from ""Closer"" definitely out-did him. Nonetheless Freeman's impressive career made him the prime candidate of winning his long overdue Oscar. Clint Eastwood directs this film to utter perfection. Its dark lighting gave the exact mood of each scene and beautiful musical score is remarkable. He is truly one of the most gifted people in Hollywood. One underrated performance of the film goes to Jay Baruchel who plays Danger Barch, the wannabe boxer. His character is like the others likable and I feel he was the true breakthrough of the film just like Thomas Guiry was last year in Eastwood's nominated ""Mystic River."" ""Million Dollar Baby was a pleasant experience and if it doesn't beat on your heart's door than there's no heart in there at all.

","I really consider Clint Eastwood as one of the most charismatic persons of the film industry. While starting up with macho roles in movies like ""Dirty Hurry"" and ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"", he completely changed course later on and started doing very sophisticated, and even art, films, such as ""Mystic River"" and ""Bird"".<br/><br/>""Million Dollar Baby"" is a prime example of Clistwood's genius. The story is about Maggie (Swank), a female boxer, who has nothing else in her life than her boxing talent. Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) is a tired, old coach, whom she approaches and he grudgingly decides to take her after Eddie ""Scrup-Iron"" (Freeman), his assistant and pal, persuades him to. The girl proves to be a very promising athlete, and she climbs the ladder of success very swiftly. Frankie starts to feel very close with her, as she reminds him of his long-gone daughter. Things however get very nasty when Maggie suffers from a serious accident, and everything now gets turned upside down...<br/><br/>All the Oscars in this film (nominations and winnings), are well deserved: Eastwood provides us with an A-class direction, as he portrays us a dark world of losers where boxing is their only way for them to feel they have a purpose in life. The leading trio (Eastwood, Swank, Freeman) are so superb in their roles, that it is almost impossible for me to distinguish among them. All in all, the film describes a sad story, very well told, which cannot leave you untouched. 9/10."

I find more and more on the IMDb people make their posts as if their view the absolute truth. many arm chair film critics and wannabe film bluffs add their two cents with righteousness than is offensive. Reading the various posts about this movie only makes my point. One person ""FreddyShoop"" says, ""It is not the best film of the year, but probably in the top ten."" He then proceeds to vote it as a one. Now he is certainly entitled to his opinion, but their are so many contradictions in the voting that I no longer have any faith in the voting totals. Personally I cannot see how anyone could vote this movie a one. The acting is good. The look of the film in brilliant. Not your cup of tea? Okay... but a one. No better than Police Academy 5 or Battlefield Earth? I'm not talking total votes... I'm just pointing out that people gave those films a one... In fact if you go to the highest rated film on the entire IMDb, ""The Godafather"" you will see that 119,493 people voted for it (as of this writing) and that out of those 7,229 people gave it a one! Incredible! Now I am not saying the people who gave it a one are not entitled to their opinion (even though I cannot understand how anyone could ever reach that conclusion) what I am saying is that I find the voting system to be misused. People seem to either vote in 10's and 1's. More thought should be given to make the votes more reliable."

","Clint Eastwood always explores the darker side of human nature and the duality of man. His dark hero of Unforgiven, William Munny, tries to repent only to be thrust back into that violent world he knows so well. His regretful Frank Horrigan of In The Line Of Fire and his womanizing Steve Everett of True Crime also want redemption.<br/><br/>Eastwood's Frankie Dunn of Million Dollar Baby is the most conflicted, weathered, and vulnerable he's ever played. When he weeps in a darkened church it's like watching a house of cards begin to fall. This is a man whose had a regretful past and can't run away from the curve balls life has thrown at him. Frankie Dunn is like most of us where we eventually get punished for our good deeds.<br/><br/>The funny thing is that Million Dollar Baby is not a boxing movie despite the way it's being advertised like a female version of Rocky. Yes, Hilary Swank's Maggie trains to be a boxer under the guidance of Clint Eastwood's Frankie Dunn. Yes, Morgan Freeman is Scrap, Frankie's tough friend and ex boxer. Yes, the bulk of it takes place in a boxing gym. Yes, there are numerous boxing matches. Despite all this it's still not a boxing movie.<br/><br/>When you see it you'll be surprised by the utter humanity in the piece. This film runs very deep and you will care for the three main characters. Eastwood gives us something we rarely get in films today. He gives us real people.<br/><br/>The film is about the triumph of the human spirit, the emotional world we try to hide from that eventually sucks us all in, our compassionate hearts, and the difficult decisions we face when it comes to those we care about. It's about friendship, trust, and the bonds of the heart that are unavoidable. It is a true masterpiece.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank is all fire and guts as Maggie. Her intensity and commitment has guided her to another Academy Award. She knows she's poor, she accepts it, and she pushes forward despite her limitations. This is not to say she can't be hurt. We watch her eyes well up a few times and truly feel her pain despite the fact that she is as tough as they come. Morgan Freeman, who finally won a long overdue and well deserved Oscar, plays Scrap with the perfect combination of toughness and compassion. He knows the situation from every angle and his narration of the film rings true.<br/><br/>See this film. It deserves it's accolades because it's about real characters and it's directed with honesty, warmth, and true pain. Clint Eastwood gets better with age and his films reflect the days of real movie making. The sets are simple, the characters are complex, and the story moves in a pace closer to real life than any other director could reach. Eastwood has been called the Hemingway of Film making. You don't get more real than that. It was great seeing this natural storyteller take home his second Oscar for Best Director and Picture."
"saarvardi","9","5","7","3 July 2007"," A film that doesn't give in to the rules of the genre, and stays loyal to the story and the characters instead
","Unfortunately, it seems as if two-time Academy Award winner Hilary Swank is one of the least famous actresses who managed to win the prestigious Oscar trophy twice during the course of the years. I say so in great sorrow, as I believe Swank is part of an elite list of modern-day actresses who truly lives up to the definition of acting. And boy can she act! Swank has that special ability to absorb herself into the role she's playing. If she's the androgynous victim in Boys Don't Cry, the nerdy cashier in the overlooked 11:14 or the powerful underdog boxer in this case  she'll always become the character and deliver a powerhouse, emotional draining, performance.<br/><br/>Anyway Million Dollar Baby, Clint Eastwood's little boxer film that could, became a surprise Academy Award best picture winner back in 2005, beating Scorsese's wonderful The Aviator. The plot itself, much like the film and its lead actress, tells the story of Maggie Fitzgerald, a female boxer (Swank) who rises from her trailer-park life and become a professional fighter against the odds, with the help of her devoted manager, Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) a washed-up trainer who has seen much better days. However, this isn't your average boxing film. Unlike Rocky, Cinderella Man and others of the genre, its final twist is truly unpredictable, and will most likely leave you pondering for days after watching the film. Either way, I found it different in the right kind of fashion. It's a film that doesn't give in to the rules of the genre, and stays loyal to the story and the characters instead. Since it did that and still managed to gross over 100 million dollars in the North American box office alone, I would call it a remarkable achievement for the human spirit."

I think the chemistry between the two actors is on the money.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman acting goes without saying since he can take on any role and give it life and character. I love his narrative skills from the days of ""Shawshank Redemption"".<br/><br/>This movie is great but you must be prepared for an emotional roller-coaster ride. It will tug at your heartstrings.

My only complaint about the film is Clint brought back to life the gravely voice from Heartbreak Ridge that at times can be a little unclear. Morgan Freeman has a center roll in the movie as a narrator (much like Shawshank Redemption) and as Clints friend and fellow boxer/trainer. The two together with a fine performance from Hilary Swank make this film a must see. Take your Kleenex and be prepared. The music is clearly Clint and at times may remind you of pieces from Unforgiven.<br/><br/>The film is simply awesome, moving and unpredictable.

","Clint Eastwood has done it again. He has reversed the thinking from old school Hollywood that violence is glorious. 'Unforgiven' was the anti-western masterpiece showing that old west America wasn't just about the guys in the black and white hats and it was the film that defined Eastwood as a director. 'Million Dollar Baby' shows that Clint is making the best movies of his career over the last 15 years. Unlike 'Rocky' where the fight is uproarious as you cheer and the hero gets the girl in the end, 'Million Dollar baby' shows how ugly boxing violence is and why the sport has degenerated into a low brow competition in recent years.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman deserve Oscars for this film as their performances are raw, heartfelt and just plain worthy. Eastwood also deserves his second Oscar as best director and this film is superior, yes, superior I say to Martin Scorsese's over rated 'Raging Bull' from 1980. Made on a relatively low budget with no special effects, just the good old fashioned elbow grease that Hollywood use to consume itself in, 'Million Dollar Baby' might be the best picture of 2004 for its message as well as for its creative talents."

","He couldn't forgive himself as an ex-boxer for knocking someone out and either maiming or killing them. In the film when the priest says that for anyone to go to Mass every day for that many years he must be unable to forgive himself for something in his past. This also may explain why he holds his boxers back, i.e.,from a title match...not because he doesn't believe they can win, but more because he wants to be sure they are ready and won't get seriously hurt...he has seen a lot in his day and in his career and it has left him jaded and wounded emotionally. On the whole, I thought it was a wonderful movie; dark, like Mystic River, but very powerful. Hilary Swank's performance was great...I don't know how anyone can beat her for the Oscar. And the same goes for Clint Eastwood--I know Martin Scorcese is due for an Oscar and should get it for ""Aviator"", but my vote would go to Clint."

","It took me awhile to get into ""Million Dollar Baby."" Like all of Eastwood's latter day helmed films, it's snail-paced, darkly lit to the point of annoyance, and at times deafeningly quiet. I thought I had paid to see an underdog triumphs story, a rote boxing pic about an old dog of a trainer (Eastwood) reluctantly teaching a down-and-out youngster (Hillary Swank-amazing here and finally delivering on the promise of her breakthrough performance in ""Boys Don't Cry""). The intimate details of boxing and using the sport as life metaphor are done well here, but nothing special.<br/><br/>Then, about three quarters of the way through the film, it takes a turn I was not aware it would take, and I was blindsided, and then treated to a bearing of Eastwood's soul as an actor and a director, as a man and an artist...an honest and unflinching tribute to the life and philosophies of the noble outsider, the person living by their own set of morals and values, the person who does what is right even when it flies in the face of standard practices and laws. In the shadows of the tragedy that the last quarter of the film depicts, we get treated to Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Swank bearing all, and giving heartbreaking and devastating performances that haunted me long afterwords. Say what you will about Eastwood as a director (he's usually overrated) and as an actor (he usually plays himself), but he gives us a blazing look here into his perspective of the world, and it is both tragic and beautiful to watch in ""Million Dollar Baby."""

The acting is superb with Clint Eastwood playing a bitter boxing trainer with a history involving something he regrets. Morgan Freeman narrates superbly just as he did in Shawshank Redemption, and as Eastwood's handyman does not take over the screen.

Maggie Fitzerald (Hilary Swank) is a 31 year-old woman who works as a waitress in a restaurant. Perfectly aware that her life isn't much worth, she only sees boxing to find a way in life. With the help of an old coach Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) and after weeks of intense training, she knows a meteoric rise with fame and glory under her belt. But Clint Eastwood is a too demanding author to content himself to shot this kind of story and is ready to go beyond it to get more interested in the relationship between Maggie and his character Frankie. As a matter of fact, ""Million Dollar Baby"" diverts codes of the boxing world and success story to develop a touching friendship story between two opposite characters that will peak in the last wrenching third of the film. One the one hand, Maggie Fitzerald, ready to do anything to become the best woman boxing. She sees in Frankie Dunn, the perfect coach and eventually a father figure to enable her to reinforce her trust in herself. On the other hand, Frankie Dunn, an irascible old man whose life has especially been a series of disappointments and who tries to find a hope in redemption (I think the somewhat dreary scenery of the gymnasium reflects well his temper). But in reality, he hides a golden heart and perceives Maggie as the daughter he hasn't had but would have liked to. To tell this absorbing story of an unlikely friendship, Eastwood uses pure film-making basics: a straight-forward narrative line, lovable characters and a calm directing without exaggerations. The whole is tinged with a huge tenderness and a humor of quality to which it is impossible to resist. And just like in ""Unforgiven"" (1992), to hear a few guitar notes is better than a whole classical music orchestra.<br/><br/>A new variation of the American dream, a praise to courage and perseverance, a just description of the boxing world, a poignant father-daughter relationship. ""Million Dollar Baby"" combines all these things. With this monument of emotion, Clint Eastwood is really at the peak of his art. It probably won't be his last movie but one thing is sure: by getting old, he improves and currently shots better than ever. It's simple, genuine and moving cinema at its best and no wonder it seduced the jury at the Oscars ceremony earlier this year by awarding it 4 Oscars including best actress (Hilary Swank) and best director (Clint Eastwood)."
"druss44121-1","9","8","13","12 February 2005"," Better than a million bucks
","Honestly, there was little doubt that this film would be good. With the actors, the director the talent, it was a sure hit. And yet, it still somehow exceeds expectations. First and foremost, Million Dollar Baby is not a boxing film. Yes, boxing is in it. There are boxing matches. Many of the characters are connected because of boxing. But through this the film reaches for so much more than simply telling the story of a boxer and her trainer. Instead, the film ultimately tackles issues of faith, love, life, fate, will, strength and ultimately asks one of the greatest questions of all: what does it mean to live? That's not to say there aren't any cliché's in the film. As hopeful Maggie Fitzgerald goes against all odds to reach her dream of fighting for the world championship there is a hint of familiarity in her efforts that comes in the form of Rocky or real life boxer Jake La Motta (spotlighted in Raging Bull.) Yet, for every cliché there is an original element wholly unique to this story.<br/><br/>Moreover, the characters become real. Eastwood's Frankie Dunn begins as a grumpy, old man who wishes not to train Maggie because she is both a girl and too old. Hmm where has this been seen before? But then, it does not end there, and the journey Frankie as well as the rest of the characters face does not lead to familiar territory but rather to a myriad of difficult questions, leaving the viewer with no easy answers. This film does not end with everything tied up in a neat little bow.<br/><br/>What Million Dollar Baby does do, though, is leave an impact. Seldom becoming manipulative and always holding a quiet grace, much like in both of Eastwood's previous films Unforgiven and Mystic River, it takes ideas used before and breathes new life into them. The style Eastwood directs with is unmistakable and the emotion he creates unforgettable.<br/><br/>Then there is the ending. Recently much controversy has come from some of the choices made by characters at the end of the film, with political commentators condemning the film (Rush Limbaugh is a big example) and some major published reviews even spoiling the end of the film because of its supposed ""political ambitions."" It's unfortunate, and the hubbub is completely silly. Eastwood has said himself that he meant the film as a story, not a quick answer to a political problem of today. Sometimes the characters an actor will play or the story a director will tell aren't necessarily their point of view. That's why acting is called acting; a character is created. A story is told to transport as well as reflect.<br/><br/>Furthermore, much of these complaints likely come from people who haven't even seen the film (it's sadly reminiscent of the butchering Martin Scorsese received for his work The Last Temptation of Christ.) Even more ironic is the fact that the very viewpoints of the attackers of this film are brought up and questioned within the narrative itself. Overall, it's best to see Million Dollar Baby without any knowledge of the ending or even the major plot points, and to instead let the film tell its story. This is art, subtle but never compromising, an example of Eastwood at his best and of cinema at it's finest."
"Elswet","9","6","9","20 May 2007"," Unforgettable
","This is easily one of the most unforgettable, heart-wrenching, bittersweet films I've ever seen. Eastwood not only directs a masterpiece, but directs himself - a feat which I'm told is rather difficult. Morgan Freeman's narration is hauntingly loving, even though the story he has to tell is quite dark, but the darkness is in the reality of the story, and not in the hearts of those involved. There are few obvious effects, car chases, bullets fired, or bodies burned, but this is quite beautiful in its story, grace, and execution.<br/><br/>This is one movie which earned the kudos (and multiple awards) it earned. There are many award-winners which made me stop and say, ""Huh?"" But this is definitely NOT one of them.<br/><br/>Further, this is a movie for everyone. This is not a chick flick, but neither is it a guy flick. Literally all walks can love this work. It is simply amazing, and was a total surprise for this reviewer.<br/><br/>It rates a 9.3/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

","""It is what it is"", watch it for yourself before you judge it based on what someone else says about it. Most all of Clint Eastwoods movies live up to the hype and this one is no different. Well written, well acted. Most everybody will have something to pick out as to what they are disappointed by. But not all of us are bent on dissecting everything we see and analyzing its meaning. I took my two sons, One who is 17, the other who is 14. Both did not really want to see it based on what they saw in a commercial.I really had to talk the oldest into going and forced the youngest. After the movie I could tell it really had an effect on them. They both will tell you it wasn't what they thought it was.

"gosia_rybak","9","6","9","15 March 2005"," Congartulations for not being 100% Hollywood infected
","The film is only in 50% Hollywood like: the exchanges about ""mummy"" and ""daddy"", so straightforward and psychologically simplified, are disadvantage. As if Eastwood didn't have enough trust to the audience - he had to make all the father-figure metaphors, hints and parallels so evident... ""American Dream"", fabulous for a European like me, in this film becomes a probable option - maybe because the possible interpretations of the ""success"" that the film gives are not all too one-sided (see ""Scrap's"" or Danger's"" story, for example, although Eastwood is not resolute to explore the theme of a seeming failure as some sort of personal success to the end. At times he even lets us believe that what really matters is the ""title"" or having one's moment of glory. ) What I loved about the film was its anti-Hollywood features: minimalistic scenery, meaningful play of shadow and light - at times poetic and speaking volumes, when the faces emerge from the darkness, plus quintessential language (except for the ""psychoanalytic"" utterances, fortunately, not abundant in the film). Very interesting and deep study of the relationship between the master and the apprentice - subtle, complex, moving and, thank God, not melodramatic as the Hollywood filmmakers would typically have it. A good movie, amazing even for a European taste brought up on Kieslowski's or Stuhr's films..."

","A powerful boxing film, it is such a good watch because it goes much deeper than just being about boxing. It is very deeply involving and gripping, and it is likely to even encapsulate viewers not interested in the sport. Swank is excellent but it is the acting from Eastwood that stands out the most, full of realistic emotion in this gritty, authentic tale he has filmed. The film nevertheless is imperfect, outstaying its welcome, having a few medical flaws and some real weaknesses in the plot. It is perfect viewing otherwise however and such a potent experience too insomuch that the flaws of the film do not detract very much. It is just a shame that this film cannot be discussed much further without telling how it ends. It deserves to be talked about."

","Greetings again from the darkness. What a pleasant surprise this gem of a film is! I had to force myself to go after the nominations because the trailer was SO BAD. Hilary Swank is totally believable as the trailer park trash dreamer who wants so much to be a professional boxer. The great Morgan Freeman brings elegance to his role as a former boxer / now wise janitor and Clint's gym. Freeman again proves he is the best movie voice over working today (see ""Shawshank Redemption""). <br/><br/>As wonderful as Hilary and Morgan are, there is no doubt that this is Clint's (multi) million dollar baby. He directs and stars and writes the music. At almost 75 years old, he can still carry a picture, while not stealing scenes. Yes, the twist in this one smells a bit like a Hollywood chick-flick, but the talented director (Eastwood) never lets it sink to that level. This is a terrific film by a top-notch filmmaker. The story is interesting, funny, dramatic and heart-warming and the acting is truly first rate. Don't let the trailer or the thought of a boxing movie keep you away."

"pcrump71","8","2","2","29 November 2006"," A knockout film!
","Million Dollar Baby deserves all the acclaim it received and some. Ebert even calls this film a masterpiece and says it is Clint Eastwood's best film. Eastwood comes to us as director, producer, and lead actor in this knockout film. In more than one way Eastwood showed us that he is like wine  he gets better with age! In Million Dollar Baby, Hillary Swank plays Maggie Fitzgerald, a 30- year waitress who sees her only way out of the trailer park is boxing. Maggie feels that her only chance of winning is having Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) train her. Swank did such an excellent job acting, that when I see Swank to this day my heart still goes out to here. I have yet to be able to separate her from her character in this excellent film.<br/><br/>Frankie is a 70 year old trainer who is opposed to training a ""girly."" Frankie is dealing with guilt from two issues from his past. He hasn't spoken to his daughter in years and she won't even read his letters. Also, Frankie feels responsible for throwing in the towel too late in a fight with his boxer Eddie ""Scrap-Iron Dupri (Morgan Freeman) years earlier. Frankie lets Scrap live at the gym and keep it up.<br/><br/>All three main characters have yet to make it big. Frankie, who is a trainer and ""the best cut man,"" has never been able to get his fighters a title fight. Scrap is a retired fighter who lost eyesight in one eye after fighting one too many fights, yet sticks around to help Frankie run the gym. Maggie is ""trailer trash"" who's only way out of waiting tables for the rest of her life is to box. Destiny awaits this trio as Scrap convinces Frankie to train Maggie. But, don't underestimate this film, this is no shallow Rocky film.<br/><br/>Frankie initially refuses to train Maggie, but gives in after he sees her determination. He takes on a fatherly role and a deep bond between the two emerges. Frankie is all Maggie has, and without him, she can't make it. Frankie and Maggie's father-daughter relationship add depth to the emotional element as he substitutes her for his own estranged daughter.<br/><br/>Eastwood did an excellent job of expressing the theme of how life deals some hard and unfair blows. Similar to Ray, the message is clear, one is never to give up in the fight of life. You can't change the cards that have been dealt, you just have to play your hand the best you can. And Eastwood, masterfully exhibits this as Frankie tells Maggie the number one rule in boxing is ""to protect yourself at all times"" Freeman narrates this film as he did in Shaw Shank Redemption. At one point in this film Scrap, in his very serious and solemn voice, talks about how boxing is an unnatural act and ""everything in boxing is backwards."" Life seems to be backwards at times especially when bad things happen to good people. This film begins as a traditional fight film, but the backwardness creeps in and brings with it a more profound and realistic meaning.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby takes a surprising plunge to the dark side of life that we see often. It explores how we respond to fate, especially when it seems we deserve something more. But, Eastwood does a superb job of exploring the complexities of the blows that life deals and the subsequent decisions that we have to make.<br/><br/>The lighting, or lack thereof, throughout the film contributed to this theme by adding a dark and gloomy element to the harsh reality of what happens to Maggie. Maggie's life was rough from start to finish. There never appeared to be any lasting sunshine. Therefore, cinematographer Tom Stern kept the majority of this picture in poorly lighted dressing rooms, dark restaurants, and of course the typical stark gym where pain and punishment were endured daily.<br/><br/>Paul Haggis does the screenplay in this film and adapted it from several stories out of Rope burns: Stories From the Corner, a 2000 book by Jerry Boyd, who was a veteran fight manager and ""cut man"" writing under the pseudonym F.X. Toole.<br/><br/>Overall, the theme was expressed very well and it had a profound emotional effect as it caused sorrow and pity for all the characters as we watched them each deal with the blows that life had dealt them. We expected sensationalism and the traditional underdog theme, but Eastwood brought us life with all its blows! This is a must see!!!"

","When you make a film with characters, true characters, you have won half the battle. The characters in this film are on a crash course with emptiness, until they find each other. The tired, stagnant life of the Clint Eastwood fight manager, Morgan Freeman, who has sold his needs to watch his friend, and, of course, Hillary Swank, who is trying to find someplace to keep her from ending up like her trailer trash family. If one were to simply look at the plot, it would seem pretty trite. Girl wants to be a fighter (a contemporary possibility; her gender really isn't important), manager hasn't had a fighter in years (he is a curmudgeon who sees the negative in things), and the talent will out. But then the element of tragedy rears its ugly head, and the plot becomes more complex. But it is the characterization that wins the day. We get to know and love these three people (actually a fourth; a young boxer who continues to get the crap beat out of him but who provides another example of what we should be. It is, of course, ultimately about love: love for self, love for others, and love for why we are put on this earth. I was really moved by this film. It is a masterpieces of redemption and will. It is about victory through pain."

","and i am firmly on the latter. i walked out of this movie thinking it was average, but in the three days since, I've realized i was way too easy on this steaming sentimental, emotionally manipulative pile of clichés. Clint has retained the same mood and overall atmosphere of mystic river (which is a lot better than MDB), obviously hoping to gain the same success with a few more Oscars, which he will probably win (much to my chagrin): the sadness and tragic ending felt so so similar to MR.<br/><br/>Clint cant act. there i said it. seriously, i think his directorial skills (which are far from amazing) more than outdoes his acting skills. i mean he delivers his lines the same as when he was playing the man with no name. but hey, if it keeps getting him lots of money and awards, well more power to ya old timer. this is one of my major problems with MDB: not one of the three leads (freeman, Eastwood, and swank) are pushing themselves or their acting skills to a level deserving of the accolades and overwhelming praise being heaped upon them. swank has played this role before, freeman has played this role before, Clint has done this role before.<br/><br/>the 'humor' in this movie was lame as hell. really lame. super-duper lame. so forced and artificial it felt like a bad sitcom. Clint and Morgan arguing over brands of bleach. Clint and Morgan talking about holes in his socks. half a chuckle was all this movie could elicit from me. and the biggest lamest attempt at humor in the movie was the character ""Danger"", a scrawny young redneck with dreams of being a great fighter when its obvious he would get whipped by my grandma. the joke about how he is bewildered about how ice could get in a bottle was not funny at all. I'm sorry Clint but not even southern rednecks are that stupid to not know that water freezes into ice, or maybe you mean to tell us they don't have fridges in that part of the country yet??? incidentally, the whole subplot about danger was totally irrelevant and out of place with the rest of the plot, it felt like filler big time. the characterizations and broad stereotypes Clint labels the 'trailer trash' family and danger the 'stupid redneck' with were pretty offensive.<br/><br/>the first two acts play out like a cross between Rocky and Girlfight. Clint doesn't want to train Maggie because she's a girl. eventually he agrees and trains her up until she gets a title shot against a dirty German fighter during which the movie enters the third act with a major twist in the plot. sounds a bit uneventful huh? well it is. apart from the training some other minor events happen (like Maggie buying her mom a house) but nothing happens really; just training and fighting until the third act. during the title fight i was absolutely incredulous that the fight wasn't called on a disqualification. the German girl pulls some dirty moves that, despite me not being a boxing aficionado, I'm pretty sure would get her disqualified immediately. i mean come on, if pulling moves like these didn't get you disqualified every pro fighter would be doing them. also, the fight scenes were fake as hell, no thought or effort was put into the fight choreography. its very obvious that swank spent all her time working out to get a buff body rather than actually look like she could throw a decent punch, she didn't look like she was a competent boxer let alone the unbeatable champion she is portrayed as. not one of her fights are won on points, every one is a knockout usually in the first round. how freaking realistic.<br/><br/>in conclusion, I'm amazed at the positive response this movie has gotten. i guess people really do equate a sad and tragic ending with greatness. Mystic River moved me, i cried several times during the film. this movie left me unmoved, its emotional manipulativeness and hollow sentimentality was something even Spielberg would gag on. i really hate to simplify movies but in this case i think it stands true: MDB is just a Rocky ripoff with a tragic sad twist at the end."

","Having seen the movie just today, I would comment that the final scene showing the greasy spoon diner in Missouri was a strong indication that Frankie went on with some type of life after giving up the gym and easing Hillary Swank out of her misery. What ever ghost haunted him, he'd found a small measure of redemption when he disappeared. His previous comments about ""Wonder if a place like this could be for sale"" and ""Do you want to build a cabin in the mountains"" would indicate a fresh start, perhaps away from the very ghosts that haunt him throughout the film. Morgan Freeman's character sums it up while writing a letter to Eastwood's daughter to tell her ""just what kind of man your father really is."" That's not a loser who gives up but one that sees the battle through to the very end."

","Million dollar baby is three parts: a boxing movie, a father-daughter story and a movie about euthanasia.<br/><br/>As a boxing movie it's interesting for camera-work and editing of the boxing scenes, but after all those years it can't still come close to Raging Bull. The father-daughter relation is endearing and in drama terms the best part of the movie. The more complex issue of euthanasia is handled in too simple terms here.<br/><br/>Eastwood's movies are almost never dull, but they are so full of simple clichés that there is a moment when the screen magic becomes an over-sentimental and unbelievable journey. The gym that can't hardly exist, the cleaning man that can't buy socks, the fighter winning everything in the first round, the family that is too crude for words. the Danger guy for the funny note, etc. Morgan Freeman's uninteresting repetition of his voice-over in The Shawshank Redemption tops this off."

","If you are like me who wants a good ending, then don't watch it. You will be forever disappointed. I mean you will be waking up nightmares after watching it. If you want a bad ending then the movie is for you. There are two camps and it is the movie of the great divide. Most boxing ends with a fairly satisfying ending regardless of the story, whether we speak about Cinderella Man, Raging Bull, Rocky, etc. They are all good. This movie is an exception. I am one of those people with a conscience and this movie totally goes against my conscience. I will not spoil the movie for you and it is a fictional film about an aspiring woman boxer who knocks out opponents in the first round. And if you are like me. I would rather turn off the video, or at least stopped after the second half of the movie and burn the movie. I made a mistake, and this is a warning. This movie should not deserve even to a favorite, if only you know medicine, suffering, and torturing. There is a better ending, and it is definitely not this movie. I made the right decision by not watching in the theaters here. In fact in my locale everyone her hated it and was in a theater for about a week. I wonder why Hollywood love this movie so much. Perhaps they are part of the New World Order, in that case it is perfectly socially acceptable. Sorry for being blunt."

","When I first heard of this movie, I thought it would be another Rocky, which would have been just fine with me. But instead, I was treated with a film that was nothing but cliché after cliché. When Clint Eastwood says, ""Girlie,tough ain't enough"", I just groaned to myself. He then says, "" I don't train girls"", you then just know he was going to train her. Also, any time that Clint's at church, you know why he's there. He pretends to be a pain in the ass, but really wants salvation from his isolation from his daughter. All of these build up to the title fight, where Hilary Swank is tragically injured. Also, not to be too big a nitpicker, but her opponent would have disqualified for punching her while she was down, no ref would allow that. Once the fight is over, the film absolutely goes into the ground for me. Hilary Swank is injured, her spine broken, along with her spirit. She goes through the motions, leaning to use a wheelchair, getting out of bed, etc. She then has a ""visit"" from her family, who just wants her money(cliché alert!). The movie then just barely whirs along, until finally, just as Clint's character offers to get Hilary Swank a wheelchair, so she can continue on in life, maybe even go to college. Instead of accepting this kind offer, the writers of this film, decide it would be better for her to die just because she is disabled. The reasoning being, that of course, she can't do what she wants to do, so she should just give up. This attitude towards people with disabilities is a shallow one, that displays a lack of knowledge about people with disabilities. Even if she can't box, that does not give her the right to die. I have a disability that, in a way, i acquired during my life. This prevented me from baseball, my first love. But I took my new life, embraced it, and I now play wheelchair basketball for a nationally ranked team. This movie shows that people with disabilities are helpless, with nothing to add to society.

","If Morgan Freeman, ( Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris) did not appear in this film it would have failed on its face, because he gave the best supporting performance I have ever seen him create. Hilary Swank, (Maggie Fitgerald) put her heart and soul into this role as a prize fighter who climbs to unbelievable heights in the world of women boxing with the great help of both Eddie Dupris and Clint Eastwood,(Frankie Dunn). Frankie Dunn constantly has gone to his church and asked the priest many questions concerning the Catholic Faith and even runs into trouble with the Priest trying to understand his frame of thinking. Frnkie Dunn asks the priest a question that will change the entire mood of the film and put it into a very controversial film concerning Life or Death. Nice film."

When ""Million Dollar Baby"" came around, I knew it was a film I wouldn't want to miss.<br/><br/>I used to/occasionally box and this film doesn't really capture the training struggle that ""Rocky"" did.

But Clint did it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for me, I knew the plot and ending of this film before walking into the theater. Because of the staggered release of MDB, it was almost impossible not to. I would have liked to assess the impact not knowing the twists and turns of the plot.<br/><br/>That being said, I found this a beautifully-realized story about dreams, courage, and the true meaning of family.<br/><br/>The three principals did a tremendous job. Hillary Swank is so much more than an actress. She is able to break a role down down to its simplest elements and becomes the character. There is never anything overdone in her work. She is one of the finest actresses we have. Morgan Freeman is one of the finest actors we have. And Clint Eastwood? Well, he's just one of the finest directors we have. Congratulations, Rowdy."
"jdesando","Null","6","10","16 January 2005"," A film about boxing is not really about it at all.
","A film about boxing is not really about it at all. Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby is more about a father Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) dealing with an estranged daughter and about the same crusty trainer facing an aggressive young female boxer, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank). The intersection of Frankie's personal and professional lives is deftly drawn in the parallel plots.<br/><br/>Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman) narrates, as Freeman does so well in Shawshank Redemption, about Frankie's boxing gym, where Freeman, a former boxer and best friend of Frankie, works and lives. Freeman has the right melancholic but authoritarian voice, the kind Michael Caine uses so well in Cider House Rules that relays acceptance of fate with a generous supply of humanity. Frank quietly endures boxers leaving him for a better chance, old age, and the importuning of young boxers who wants a chance at success. Along with Maggie comes a trailer-park family that tests Frankie's essentially peaceful nature, one nurtured by reading Gaelic.<br/><br/>Director Eastwood's style is minimalist, essentially a three-person drama set in spare locales like the clean and uncluttered gymnasium. Although not black and white, the color film plays down color to give it a '40's film noir feeling. Cinematographer Tom Stern (chief lighting technician for Road to Perdition) uses dark and light shadows like a 16th century portrait painter. At times I thought I was watching Hopper's diner come alive with these marginal but never dull characters.<br/><br/>While the dialogue is rarely poetic, it is muscular in its spareness, just enough to get the point across. With weathered faces like Eastwood's and taut beauty like Swank's, not much more is needed but a close-up camera and editing to reduce the fat to that muscle. When Maggie from southwest Missouri describes the life she left, the language is tough poetry: ""I might as well go back home and buy a used trailer and get a deep fryer and some Oreos."" I was drawn into the drama far more than any other film of 2004, because the story was common but powerful and the Oscar-worthy performers reached the right notes, and not a note more. The best picture of '04 by a knockout."
"thecubanratio","1","11","22","21 May 2006"," horrible
","I thought this movie was absolutely horrible. There was no point of the retarded kid at the gym who kept on saying that he was the heavy weight champion of the world. That ruined most of the movie. It also didn't follow any real boxing rules. If that girl that she was fighting at the end would've really done that to her, there wouldn't have been just a little warning. She wouldn't have been allowed to hit that other girl in the sciatic nerve too. It would've also been the under card of a major mens' boxing match like a De La Hoya fight. Also, when her parents went to visit her in the hospital and one of her relatives said,""She has to sign it with her mouth"", it was just so stupid. The is movie was completely unrealistic and more like an assisted suicide movie then a great drama. I definitely think this movie shouldn't have won the best picture of year either."
"dmacewen","10","5","8","7 June 2008"," Eastwood's greatest film.
","Let me quote one viewer's criticism of this wonderful film: <br/><br/>""Am I the only one who found the ending to be completely contrived, if not nonsensical? This has nothing to do with the fact that she died, and that it was sad. I have no problem with sad endings, when they MAKE SENSE. The thing I don't understand is WHY she had to die? In what way did it help the narrative, the plot, the story, or the lesson to be drawn from it? Here we have a story about a girl, her dream, and her struggle to live out that dream, despite her horrible family, and all the odds being against her, and as she is about to realize even the tiniest portion of that dream: BLAM, you're paralyzed... Why that? To me it seemed like it came TOTALLY out of left-field. It was like Eastwood had this great movie going, had everything worked out perfectly and suddenly realized that it was getting too long and he needed to end it and that's the first thing he could come up with. <br/><br/>""It just didn't make sense in relation to the rest of the story. Now some people will say 'well that's life, sometimes *beep* happens.' And yeah, that is life, but MDB isn't life, it's a movie. Her injury seemed totally useless and left me wondering where in the hell Eastwood pulled that idea from. <br/><br/>""Mystic River = Eastwood movie with a SAD, SAD, SAD ending, but one that MADE SENSE.""<br/><br/>First off, the so-called ending is actually the final third of the film. So stop calling it ""the ending""! Second, note the emphasis on WHY and MAKING SENSE. This is one viewer who is stuck on plot and thinks that if an incident does not advance the plot in some overtly obvious manner then it is somehow faulty. The final portion of the film wasn't there to ""help the narrative."" The movie is ABOUT this part of the story, right from the very beginning. And yes, sometimes ""*beep* happens,"" and that's life, and some movies are about life, as opposed to those that are about car crashes or explosions or Adam Sandler making his girlfriends laugh or Robin Williams impersonating a woman. If the controversial plot turn were arbitrary, then it would have sunk the film; life can be random, good art cannot be random. If it seeks to create a story that reflects life's randomness, there must be an underlying logic at work, and in Million Dollar Baby there certainly is. Here we have a strong, determined woman who dragged herself out of a dead-end life to achieve heights of athletic fame and accomplishments as a prizefighter. As is so often the case in life much of our fates are left to chance, and in a single, random, fateful moment in the ring (not her bathtub or street corner or local candy shop, so there is an element of plot causality after all), all that she had built for herself was taken away. Now she's left in a position where her pride and integrity are compromised, because she was once a great fighter and she is now a vegetable who feels she no longer has a reason to live -- and so she turns for help to the manager with whom she had her most intimate relationship. The man who helped her become what she was now has to ponder whether his responsibility to her is to help her live or help her die. (Unlike some of those who both love and hate this film, I don't think it makes a definite ""pro-euthanasia"" stance.) In other words, people who are in the position of begging for a mercy killing have lives that preceded their predicament, and Million Dollar Baby lets us experience that. Of course, grasping this requires some mental dexterity not possessed by those whose perspectives are purely linear. And those who think that movies are not life, ""just movies"" (whatever that means) will be completely lost. Sure, art can't do it the same way life can, but I think I covered that already earlier in this paragraph.<br/><br/>In other words, the story of Million Dollar Baby is more about two characters and a relationship than the construct we call ""plot."" Some movies are very plot-driven, and there is nothing innately inferior in that. Some of them are great films. They can, in their own way, reveal just as much about our external or interior lives. I even like outright action movies when I feel there's creativity and wit on display. I think Robert E. Howard (creator of Conan) is a great American writer. I don't think any work of ""literary fiction"" has captured so incisively the workings of our sexual sub-conscious as Dracula. I have a soft spot for John Carpenter's Big Trouble in Little China, for crying out loud. I mention these seemingly irrelevant and diffuse trivia lest I be accused of ""highbrow"" elitism.<br/><br/>Many works of art are great because they help us understand human nature better (although I don't agree with another viewer who feels that great films try ""to improve the world at least a little bit""; some works of art may try to do this, but I feel this is incidental to what makes them great). Million Dollar Baby falls into this latter category of art that sheds light on what one nineteenth century writer (I forget who) called ""the human heart in conflict with itself."""

Hilary Swank as Maggie Fitzgerald shows up one day, Frankie doesn't take kindly to a ""girl"" in his gym, but is hesitant to refund the 6 months fee she already paid.

Maggie works harder than everyone else, follows instructions, and when she finally gets fights has a knack for knocking out her opponent in the first round. Frankie eventually has to give other managers under-the-table money to get opponents for Maggie. She makes a tour of Europe and wins everything. Back home she gets a fight against the champion in Las Vegas, for a $Million split with the opponent (thus title ""Million Dollar Baby""), a dirty fighter and former prostitute in East Germany. But Maggie gets the upper hand, knocks the champion down, the bell rings, Maggie is headed back to her corner when an illegal punch knocks her down, onto the stool Frankie had just put in her corner, snapping her neck.

The acting was excellent & the characters fully believable while the story showed the results of determination & dedication. It is easy to see why Hilary won the Oscar for her outstanding performance. Seeing the background from where our heroine evolved adds to the degree of admiration at her determination & will power to succeed in a sport that is very competitive & one that by all reason she has passed the expiry date as she is competing with much younger fighters. The message here is strong also the message of faith in others as she fully believes that only one trainer is going to get her where she knows she is capable of being. People taking chances on others is always open to good interpretation & is very well done in this movie. Although a long movie it is very sad when the story actually ends.

","On the outside 'Million Dollar Baby' seems like a boxing picture, but it's really a character study of the three characters involved (played expertly by Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman). Before I saw the film, I thought it was going to be a tacky and sappy girl boxing movie, but it wasn't. I find even after I've seen it, it's hard to convince people the film is not like that, and it's not a conventional formulaic boxing film like Rocky, but that it is something a hell of a lot deeper. After seeing the film for a second time, I found that it really has no weak points other then being a little slow towards the beginning (which was essential in order to tell the story correctly.) Clint Eastwood not only does an outstanding job directing this soon-to-be-classic, but he also produces the film, composes a spellbinding musical score, and gives his very best screen performance as Frankie Dunn, a down-on-his-luck boxing manager who decides to take on a wannabe female boxer. Morgan Freeman provides us with a quiet yet extremely effective performance as Frankie's long-time friend and partner. Not only does Freeman play this part, but his character narrates the story, so the whole movie is told from this character's perspective. The on-screen chemistry between Eastwood and Freeman is too incredible for words, a chemistry that was only once before seen in 1992's Best Picture winner 'Unforgiven', that was also made by Eastwood. The best performance of the film obviously comes from Hilary Swank as the average trailer-trash restaurant waitress who's one true passion is for boxing. Swank delivers a tour-de-force performance, and along with Eastwood it's also her best on-screen acting performance. Ms. Swank knows her character very well, and it shows that she didn't just memorize the lines of the character, but she embodied the character. Overall, when you see the film you don't see the three actors, but the characters they portray. 'Million Dollar Baby' is my choice for Best Picture, along with the Oscars for Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, Best Film Editing and Best Original Score. However I think Hilary Swank shouldn't be awarded Best Actress, that title belongs to Imelda Staunton who gave definitely one of the best female performances I have ever or probably will ever see in my life in Mike Leigh's 'Vera Drake'.

While the movie has many parts that are light hearted and pleasant, the confluence of its undercurrents and themes towards the end seems almost too much to grasp. It left me deep in thought, struggling to deciminate this striking portrayal of human relationships. Acting was superb. The plot moved. I cared about the characters. Violence was sometimes difficult to watch but meaningful. Only criticism I had was some of the scenes could have used a little more lighting (too film noirish) and at times I had problems following the dialogue. One of my co-workers said this movie was not about boxing. I tend to disagree. It was about boxing, but was also about life, love, caring, redemption and dedication. Tough at times to watch, it was tough to forget. If you want ""Singing in the Rain"" or other family fare, this isn't the picture.

Eastwood, Freeman and the beautifully tough and vulnerable Swank create a memorable triumvirate holding the centre of the ring throughout. I don't mind having my emotions manipulated - when I'm also given the opportunity to ponder and reflect as well. Hitchock mastered that perfectly and Eastwood does the same.

She looks like the role of Maggie Fitzgerald was made for her, a little like she doesn't even need to act. Clint Esatwood plays very well the tough (well, more then tough since ""tough ain't enough) trainer in all situations, although there was something that bothered me about him but I wouldn't be able to name it. Morgan Freeman is actually playing quite a small role even 'though he is in many scenes. I can't say much about his performance because it looks like quite an easy role but I can say at least that he looked absolutely natural.<br/><br/>The fighting scenes were all from weak to great but you don't remember the weak ones anyway because they last for few seconds only. They are there only to be passed so who really cares that boxing doesn't really looks this way. I don't think this movie is even about boxing after all, it's absolutely nothing like the famous boxing movies. It's a totally different story and I'm not willing to share any of it with those who didn't see it because one of the things I enjoyed the most was not knowing even a small bit of the story while watching. This way I enjoyed it completely. It's like this movie got pure joy and pure sadness in it (damn, I hope it's not a spoiler).

The ending could have been better, but it didn't prevent me from enjoying the movie very much.<br/><br/>The development of MS Swank's character was excellent.

The addition of the supporting cast used for her family did very well in making her personal values even more amazing.

","Congrats to all responsible for the film. I'm writing this a couple hours after Oscars finished- yup, that's right, it's now 2008. Nah seriously, this is an excellent film. One wouldn't know what the film was about from the previews. Not that one should. Nevertheless, typically accomplished work from Clint. And this time, he wrote the music too. If he could film the movie and be in it at the same time, he could cut down on salaries to people by minimizing the number of people in the production. All that said, Morgan Freeman is excellent, though really the Oscar is a bit of a typically Hollywood, guilt-ridden, let's-right-wrongs Oscar. That being said, he's one of the best, and he's as good as ever. One's tempted to take him for granted, he's that good. I think I'm going to have to go back and see ""Unforgiven"" again to see him collaborating with Clint again. Hilary Swank is excellent. She didn't deserve the Oscar, I'm sorry. Obviously, much of the Academy hadn't seen ""Vera Drake"" or she wouldn't have gotten it. I haven't seen ""Maria Full of Grace"" so don't know how that lady's performance measured up. All that being said, Swank really is a very talented actress. The film itself, well, some nice elements to it. Swank conveys winsomeness and determination as well as any actress this side of Jodie Foster. The characters tend toward stock, but really, they are nicely colored to the point that the story is not disabled by their blandness. Clint takes what might be a straight-forward sports biopic and makes it something so much more. This is a very enjoyable movie."

Clint Eastwood was very good, and I am not a big fan of his. Morgan Freeman was kind of wasted, but was still terrific, they just didn't give him much to do. Hilary Swank's performance was beyond words. Never have I been so moved to laugh and to cry as I was by this film. It made me want to stand up and cheer, made me want to cry my eyes out, made me laugh my ****s off, and really, REALLY made me wish this movie would not end. If you can only see one movie this year, or next year, you will be doing yourself a service by seeing this movie!<br/><br/>If Swank doesn't win Best Actress, the Oscars will forever be tainted in my eyes......."

","After Mystic river I thought Clint Eastwood could never do better than that. Well, with his latest effort, Million dollar baby, he came very close..<br/><br/>Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is an old boxing trainer and promoter who is spending most of his days training young fighters, learning Gaelic, and chatting with his janitor and best friend, an ex-boxer Scrap (Morgan Freeman). One day, a young women Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank), a wannabe and not very talented fighter comes into Frankie's gym and wants him to train her. At first, he refuses because he doesn't train girls and she's too old. However, Maggie doesn't give up and finally, Frankie agrees.. What follows is the most beautiful platonic relationship on film ever Words cannot even begin to describe the emotions ant the thrill I felt while watching this film. It's very moving, simple, at times very funny, and in the end tragic. Eastwood does what he knows best: He directs and acts. With his calm hand, he creates a fine balance between a boxing movie and an emotional human drama. The three main performances are amazing. Eastwood, Swank and Freeman create mutual relationships that are far more convincing and powerful than any romantic comedy. Swank is especially convincing in the scenes with her and her family who are without a doubt the most disgusting group of characters in recent years. The ending of this film won't be appealing to a lot of people, but it's very powerful and disturbing stuff, and it contains a a great message about life, freedom and most of all freedom of choice. If you keep an open mind, you should enjoy this wonderful film, which will sty on your mind a while after seeing it.<br/><br/>After having directed two master pieces in a row, the question is, can Eastwood go wrong. I hope not. Go Clint, go!"
"csmart1","10","5","8","13 February 2005"," Most powerful movie ever
","""Million Dollar Baby,"" should have a category warning: this movie contains subject matter that may be too powerful for your average, literate viewer to watch, no matter what their age. When I saw ""Mystic River,"" I was amazed, and touched by it; however, I had read the book, so there were no surprises. After seeing ""Million Dollar Baby,"" today, I am compelled to admit that I have never left a movie in a state of shock. The irony of this film was so overwhelming and the message that it sent was so intense that I was almost unable to leave my seat when it was over. Never before have I seen the use of foreshadowing that was so refined that even when I thought I could predict the outcome of the story, I was wrong. If everyone connected to this film doesn't win an Oscar then the system no longer works. Hilary Swank could give Meryl Streep a run for the money. Clint Eastwood has surpassed Hitchcock when it comes to the element of surprise and story telling. Eastwood and Freeman were so finely tuned the score was hardly recognizable. And the title not only summed up the movie brilliantly but at the same time, bordered on being a misnomer. All I need now is to take a long recovery nap and then attempt to appreciate every day to the fullest. When this movie is released on DVD it should come with a set of emotional steak knives."
"DICK STEEL","Null","5","8","13 February 2005"," A Nutshell Review: Million Dollar Baby
","This is not just a boxing movie. It's a boxing movie with a lot of heart. This is a story about hope, and giving hope when all seems lost, about dogged determination, and never giving up, about relationships and second chances.<br/><br/>The multiple themes in the movie are carefully brought out through the excellent interaction between the various major and minor characters, and whilst the focus of the story might seem to be on the boxing, it never is, and you're kept glued on the screen, exploring the narrative and backgrounds of every character introduced. This is not to say that the action sequences are mediocre - they are shot so subtly, that it feels as if you're in or around the ring and swinging with the blows.<br/><br/>Narrative in a nutshell - Eastwood is a boxing trainer whose star protégé left him. In comes newbie white trash Swank who begs him to train her, as she believes that he could bring her to the top of the game. And so begins the father-daughter relationship that they establish, as they haul themselves from fight to fight, win to win, until the title shot where they must pay the ultimate price in this brutal sport.<br/><br/>It's good to see Eastwood and Freeman team up on screen again - character acting never had it so good, and it feels like old friends on screen with the advice they dispense to each other. Hillary Swank did wonders with the physical demands of this film, and her taut body put shame in mine.<br/><br/>A Definite Oscar worthy contender."
"Carl_Simkevich","Null","5","8","9 February 2005"," It Will Break Your Heart, It Has Broken Mine.
","This is a powerful film, you feel that you are involved in the characters lives. Hilary Swank is stunning as Maggie Fitzgerald. She thinks that she is white trash, but she is far from it, she just has not realized how nice she is, coming from a dysfunctional family. Even though she has known extreme poverty, she gives to her family before she takes care of herself, but it is not appreciated. She is concerned about a fighter that she knocked out.You come to care for her. You would step out in front of a speeding train, take a bullet, sacrifice your life to protect her.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood are excellent in their roles. The boxing scenes are well done, but it is the human stories that make this film.<br/><br/>The ending is painful and I don't agree with it. It doesn't fit Maggie's determination. I expected her to say ""I WANT TO LIVE!!!"". She could do it. She would need love and support, but I know she could."

","Hot new prospect Million Dollar Baby electrified the crowds and sent out an ominous warning to other contenders with a sensational knockout in the later rounds here last night. Having set the pace from the first round, the up and coming champion remained aggressive until the final four rounds where she dazzled her fans with one of the greatest displays of skill not seen since the days of Raging Bull. With consummate skill Million Dollar Baby changed tactics in the later rounds, a strategy devised by her trainer Clint Eastwood. It was a move nobody at ringside saw coming, and as one critic stated, it was in the final third act that Million Dollar Baby stepped into masterpiece territory. The performance, considered by many as the best of the year, was more than enough to guarantee a shot at the World Title on February 27th. Hailing from Malpaso Boxing Gym, where under the tutelage of veteran trainer Clint Eastwood, Million Dollar Baby has become one of the hottest contenders around. In fact, many critics and pundits believe that Eastwood, one of the most respected men in the business, will have himself another world champion come fight night at the Oscars, his first being Unforgiven who was title holder in 1993."

","Hey everybody, this past Saturday, I saw ""Million Dollar Baby"", a film starring Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman. I wanted to just let you all know how much I enjoyed the film, and let you know I highly recommend it, and the reasons why....I am not some big time film critic, but I do feel as though I have a good sense of what a genuienly good film is....Million Dollar Baby exceeded my expectations in so many ways, there is no doubt in my mind it is the best movie of 2004.<br/><br/>I'm going to start of by saying ""Million Dollar Baby"" is one of the best movies you could ever see. From start to finish, it has all the key elements that every great film should have.<br/><br/>A+ actors, who deliver top notch acting, a gripping, compelling story(which is based on true events, by the way), interesting characters, and a story filled with amazing dramatics, full of emotions, and heart.<br/><br/>I believe one critic said it best: "" The kind of movie where you sit very quietly in the theater and are drawn deeply into lives that you care very much about. "" There is much more to this movie then ""it's just a boxing movie."" Million Dollar Baby at it's core, is a movie dealing with guilt, responsibility for risk, and determination to do what you believe is right.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank is incredible. She firmly establishes herself as a top leading actress in the business for years to come in this.<br/><br/>Don't listen to what anyone else has to say about Million Dollar Baby. Do not let anyone tell you anything that happens, or spoil the ending for you, go see it for yourself.<br/><br/>It's one of the very few movies I've seen in recent memory that I would confidently recommend everyone to go see.<br/><br/>I give it a 10 out of 10."
"BenjaminRaymond","8","5","8","5 February 2005"," 'Million Dollar Baby'... Priceless
","Take a film, strip it of special effects, a drop-dead-gorgeous female lead, and a box office-friendly, money-making plot line. Replace with a soul-shaking story, timeless performances, and a bone-shattering punch that comes not in the form of explosions, sex, or gratuitous violence, but in the genius of its direction, writing, and soulful thematic delivery; you get Million Dollar Baby. The film with 'million dollar' integrity and bargain $30 million price tag lands a killer, cinematic punch square in the dignity of films with the $150 million price tag and Dollar Store insignificance.<br/><br/>Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), determined, full of heart and empty of pocket enters the boxing gym of the hard-shelled and well-respected trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood). Between her low-paying and hopelessly mundane waitressing job at a local diner, Maggie lands punches at Frankie's gym. Taking little notice to and simply no concern for the ""girl"" who has been so doggedly training in his gym; Frankie is approached by his old friend Eddie 'Scrap-Iron' Dupris (Morgan Freeman), who has seen something in Maggie, not in the force of her blows, but the strength of her heart. Several times Maggie pleads with Frankie to train her and several times he turns her down. That is until, one night, when another shoebox full of un-opened letters returned from his daughter is filled and Frankie must decide to regain the daughter he lost. Finally accepting her offers, Frankie begins to train the scrappy and determined 31 year-old amateur. Having not in her unfortunate life seen a fraction of the love and care given to her by her new trainer, Maggie is bestowed a father figure in the most unlikely of places. Having not had anything to love and care for the longest of times, Frankie is given the daughter he lost so long ago. Fighting and sweating and bleeding, Maggie works her way to the Las Vegas title fight Frankie never participated in. All the way she is loved and grows closer with her trainer and all the way Frankie regains the fire to care for the person behind the gloves, and not just the gloves themselves.<br/><br/>Known for his classical and quiet approach to direction, allowing the actors and storyline to carry his films into the annuls of film hierarchy, Clint Eastwood reaches far beyond the industry's wildest expectations and lands a cinematic punch of unparalleled magnitude in this riveting modern classic. Pacing is done to perfection with well-built character development across the ensemble and general calculated patience in the maturity of the story. The viewer is allowed to ease into their seats early in the film so that they may be as comfortable as is possible before the film's enthralling climax. Simple camera movements and framing (a moniker of Eastwood) are utilized without the pretentious and dizzying camera spasms of Stone, Rodriguez and other ostentatious directors. The unadulterated ability, grit, and strength of character Eastwood exudes through the film give it its poignant, numbing effects. Simple, yet ruggedly-elegant cinematography bodes well for the overall might of the picture. Praised by his casts for allowing their ability as actors to speak through their performances and not through their costumes, make-up, or ""punch-lines"" and for his meticulous attention to emotions and not explosions, Eastwood's pioneering directorial integrity are ingrained in every frame of Million Dollar Baby.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman delivers another Oscar-caliber performance as the warm-hearted, one-eyed ex-boxer, Eddie. Emotional presence is exuded into every line in a performance mimicking the timelessness of the role of Red in The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Eastwood's unmistakable grit and emotional veracity in his Oscar-nominated performance is simply unforgettable and brings the driest of eyes to tears. But, out-doing even the thematic valor of Freeman and Eastwood is the simply breathtaking, inspiring, and mind-numbing performance of one, Hilary Swank. In the title role of Maggie Fitzgerald, Swank is immaculate. In a portrayal that can only be characterized as miraculous, Swank brings the audience's eyes to the screen as they watch her struggle to survive, taking half-eaten food from the plates of the customers she waits-on. She brings us to the edge of its seats when she enters the ring. She brings us to cheers and revelry with each bloody, pulse-pounding, jaw-shattering first-round knockout. She brings us all to our knees in her despair after being denied the slightest scrap of gratitude after buying her odious, gold-digging, ingrate of a mother a home with what little money she has earned in her early bouts. She moves our souls, touches our hearts, and reaches to wipe-off our tears in scenes of such moving poignancy, they are simply impossible to describe in words. A flawless, awe-inspiring performance at the apex of thematic capacity.<br/><br/>Without giving away Million Dollar Baby's gut-wrenching climax, I must touch-on its jarring inspiration.<br/><br/>How valuable is something that is two-of-a-kind? How priceless is something that has happened only once before in over 550 different experiences? It is timeless. It is priceless. Until Million Dollar Baby, I had wept only once before during a film. That prestigious honor went to one of the greatest achievements in the history of the arts, Schindler's List (1993). Accompanying me to the film were two of my closest friends, one of which would cry in Finding Nemo, the other has teared-up in only a small handful of films. One, as to be expected ran out of tissues and had tears cascading down her face long after the film's credits rolled across the screen. The other, doing his very best to fight off the torrent of water building deep in his eyes, could not help but choke on his emotions. I, myself truly wept. With each tear the film was elevated to a higher level. With each falling drop, Million Dollar Baby instilled more in me, the movie-goer and me, the human being. Astounding direction, astonishing integrity, miraculous performances why we go to the movies. An inspiration.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Take a sports drama and litter it with every cliché in the book then let the great Clint Eastwood surprise the audience as he manages to deliver a highly satisfying, original, thought provoking film. Despite containing some of the most realistic fight sequences I've seen, this is not a film about boxing, it's about loneliness, redemption and achievement, something that brings together three characters played by Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman.<br/><br/>Eastwood displays his emotional side something he touched upon in UNFORGIVEN, IN THE LINE OF FIRE & BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, but here he excels in one of the most moving performance's of his career, he directs with pace and flair but never over indulges with style. He also composed the beautiful score, a talent many movie fans don't know about(he also wrote the theme alongside regular collaborator Lennie Niehaus for UNFORGIVEN).<br/><br/>Freeman is excellent (as usual) in a role not too dissimilar to that in SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and let's not forget the lovely MILLION DOLLAR BABY herself Hilary Swank, she gained an Oscar five years ago for BOYS DON'T CRY but never achieved star status...hopefully this movie will change that.<br/><br/>This is as good as mainstream Hollywood can get and Legend Eastwood doesn't need big budgets to please a Cinema audience and with his 75th birthday in May approaching he shows no signs of stopping."

In the middle of the twentieth century three outstanding boxing movies were released, Champion, The Set-Up and Body and Soul, three movies, three heavyweights, Kirk Douglas, Robert Ryan, John Garfield, but Million Dollar Baby is better than all three put together - and, please, don't write in and say what about Raging Bull; I could put on 30 lbs but does that make me an actor? A REAL actor can ACT heavy, so enough with overrated deNiro already. If anybody told me I'd be moved to tears by a Clint Eastwood movie I would have thought they were barking but here I am with a soaking handkerchief and a slightly punch-drunk expression. As I write this the news is just in that Swank and Eastwood have just picked up Best Actress and Best Director Golden Globes and that's what I call justice. If Imelda Staunton's over-hyped Vera Drake had eased out Swank it would have been the greatest travesty since Mick Jagger got a gong from the Queen.

","I hated Mystic River, I really did, I spoke against it like it was the worst movie of the YEAR, the decade, the century. I was just not a fan of the screenplay, although the performances were flawless. What can I say? Clint Eastwood is a guy that does not compromise. He will make movies that you either love or you hate, yet they will have their impact. As much as I hated Mystic River, I LOVED MILLION DOLLAR BABY. Million Dollar Baby is by far the most brutally honest film I have seen since Monster's Ball or even Requiem for a Dream. It does not apologize, it does not seek to swerve the viewer, it is just an honest depiction of life and the choices you are forced to make in the process.<br/><br/>It was not a manipulative movie at all, in a year of manipulative movies like Passion of the Christ, I found Million Dollar Baby to hold a higher bar for itself than what the rest of Hollywood is putting out there.<br/><br/>But the reason I loved this movie is because it forced me to come to terms with myself. There is a twist, a twist much discussed by the media, and ruined by Michael Medved (or as I call him Middle Ages Medved, really does this guy live on a completely different time line than the rest of us.) When I left the film, I did not like or respect myself as a person, because I found myself siding with Hillary Swank's character, Like her, I am a strong individual when I want something, but when dealt a bad hand I am positively sure that I would make the same choices she did. That realization has been gnawing at me for three weeks since I saw this film. This film stays with you, it keeps you up at night, it makes you think, it makes you re-evaluate your choices.<br/><br/>The film is a hot potato with the disabled right now, but they fail to see that the film is about one person's choices, in a culture where we love our movies to reflect the masses rather than the individual, people cannot see the forest for the trees. This film is a wake up call for film makers. It is a wake up call for all story tellers. And I'm so glad that a man that would normally be at the end of his career is the one to point the way.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is a classic. It is a classic Now, and it will be a classic 100 years from now. How many films made in the last ten years can you say that about? Not many."
"matthewlynch","8","3","4","27 March 2012"," Aamzing story........
","Million Dollar Baby is a movie about boxing like Braveheart is a movie about men in kilts riding horses. What it is is a movie to experience if you find yourself ever entertaining thoughts about loyalty, determination, talent, no talent, age, youth, courage, fear, fate, and the pain and joy of both living and dying.<br/><br/>I read reviews of Million Dollar Baby and expected to like it. Roger Ebert can be soft on movies because he is plainly a big fan, but even he does not lightly toss around the M-word, masterpiece. Yet he drops it on MDB, and justly so. The story is simple and searing. A gal (Hilary Swank) with much heart and no experience aspires to be the champion of the world. She is Rocky in a sports bra. A grizzled fight trainer-manager/gym owner (Clint Eastwood) reluctantly takes her on. His best pal and wise-man assistant (Morgan Freemna) stands alongside them, as the plot unwinds steadily, seamlessly, picking up speed, scene by scene, act after act. Eastwood and Freeman are artists at the top of their profession and they, along with the brilliant Swank, present you the very worthy lives of three people you will care about and remember. The arena is boxing, but it might as well have been boating or baking. It is a story about values and truths that far exceed sports and movies. I walked into the Lowes Lincoln Square theater last night knowing Million Dollar Baby was taking me on a ride and willing to hop aboard. What a beautiful, memorable ride it was."

"Chrysanthepop","Null","3","4","3 October 2009"," Prototype Of Subtlety
","Beautifully written, superbly directed and excellently acted in, Eastwood's 'Million Dollar Baby' both captivates and involves the viewer in a staggering film experience. This is not the typical underdog's rags to riches story. The story here is driven by the characters Frankie and Maggie and narrated by Frankie's friend Scrap.<br/><br/>All three characters are ordinary people living, or rather, surviving in the real world. Of the older characters, Dunn is living a life of regret as he visits church almost every day writing letters to his daughter only to have them returned without being sent while Scrap, a retired boxer, is supervising a gym yet wishes if only he had completed 110 matches. Suddenly a young and stubborn but very passionate young woman, whose dream is to become a boxer, enters their lives and changes it forever. 'Million Dollar Baby' is about passion. What we get from this amazing movie is that all three characters lived for their passion and even though it did came with a price, it is better to have lived your life with passion, to make your dream come true even if it is only for a short while than to go through life wondering why and regretting having never done anything about it.<br/><br/>The film has been made, directed, written, filmed and performed in with heart. Eastwood has pretty much given his best and extracted the best from his cast and crew. He has done an incredible job with Haggis's solid screenplay. He just reminds us why he's one of the best in the business and what a remarkable career he's had. As Frankie Dunn he is simply awesome. Morgan Freeman is exceptional as Scrap-Iron Dupris. As for the admirable Hilary Swank, what can I say? This is easily one of the finest performances by an actress in a lead role and perhaps Swank's best to date. She has given Maggie Fitzgerald and Mo Cuishle her all and not only does the performance appear natural on screen but the her Maggie really creates a place in the viewer's heart as they cheer and empathize for her.<br/><br/>What also struck me about 'Million Dollar Baby' is the subtlety. Pretty much everything is underused and downplayed, whether it's ligthing, camera-work, art direction, humour, drama, presentation of themes and even music. The gentle soundtrack (also by Eastwood) contributes beautifully to the film. This is perhaps a prototype of subtle film-making. Lastly, 'Million Dollar Baby' is an all-round winner. It deserves to be watched and even after repeated viewing, its effect hasn't deteriorated."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","3","4","23 July 2009"," Veterans bring seasoned fists but fresh perspective to boxing drama
","Boxing, despite the sport's decline in popularity since the '80s, has managed to make for some of the best films. Starting with ""Rocky"" and then films such as ""Raging Bull,"" boxing has is one of those things that seems to best represent life's journey and its struggles. There might not be a stronger visual metaphor than the glory and physical danger of someone with a goal laying it all on the line in the ring. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is the latest film to exploit this genre, and armed with great talents it manages to do so with a fresh point of view.<br/><br/>Talent number one is Morgan Freeman. He could narrate what I did yesterday and it would be considered Oscar-worthy. There is no one better to impart wisdom to an audience and half of why ""Million Dollar Baby"" communicates its ideas and themes so clearly is because of him.<br/><br/>Talent number two is Paul Haggis, producer and screenwriter. Haggis takes stories by F.X Toole and crafts something that boxing-movie lovers haven't seen before. It doesn't lean entirely on the exhausted underdog cliché (""Rocky"") or the 'rise and fall of a star' one either (""Raging Bull""). <br/><br/>This underdog, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), is more complex and more troubled. Knowing full well she's Southern white trash, she still spends whatever money she has to join the club owned by old-time boxing trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood, who also directs) and tells the stubborn old grouch that she won't leave until he trains her. After taking a few tips from the club's assistant manager, a retired and half-blind former boxer named Scrap (Morgan Freeman), she captures his attention and he agrees to help her toward her dream of being a boxer.<br/><br/>""Million Dollar Baby"" is about ambition, about establishing yourself as something and achieving in even the smallest way. Of all the boxing movies, its themes are the most universal. We all want to leave this life knowing we didn't waste it and ""Million Dollar Baby"" wrestles with this on levels both obvious and subtle through its central characters.<br/><br/>The final talent is Mr. Oscar -- Eastwood. His film is very quiet, shadow-enveloped and contemplative. He lets the characters tell this story and our interest in them keeps our attention. The actors also fit their roles perfectly. Swank has proved she can do Southern American gender ambiguous in ""Boys Don't Cry,"" Freeman has shown wise supporting role prowess in ""Shawshank Redemption,"" and Clint Eastwood redefined tough for the silver screen in his career, making him perfect for the troubled role of Frankie.<br/><br/>Everything comes together in this film effortlessly. That's what veteran filmmakers do. Though Haggis at this point was relatively unestablished, his storytelling is elegant and the veterans behind him make the script succeed in its every purpose. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a sports drama, but not like you might think. Boxing is the vehicle for delivering a knock out punch of a greater sort, one that brings us unique characters and a terrific story.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

But its so much more than that. The film is a powerful and moving experience to sit through.<br/><br/>Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), is an experienced and successful Boxing trainer who runs a training gym with long time friend 'Scrap' (Morgan Freeman). Although Frankie appears to be a tough strict, man, he is secretly hiding a heartbreak involving his daughter, who he has made a lot of failed attempts to get in contact with her over the years.

His work and lack of faith are the two main elements of his life, until Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) walks into his gym.<br/><br/>Admiring Maggies work rate and attitude, Frankie eventually takes Maggie under his wing, beginning a relationship that see's Frankie develop her into a terrific boxer. The pairs relationship grows and it becomes clear that Frankie may have found the long lost daughter he's been looking for. The two are all each other have, and one horrific incident results in them facing a battle tougher than what they could ever face in a boxing ring.<br/><br/>I couldn't take my eyes off this movie and I was very moved by the performances.

Clint Eastwood's direction is excellent. There are some fine performances from Eastwood (also starring), Hilary Swank and the underrated Morgan Freeman, and its quite well written too. But after seeing the film I was left wondering why so much fuss was heaped upon it. People called it the best film of 2004, and labelled it a modern classic. These opinions tend to make the film a little overrated. I just liked it for what it was. A well told story about lost hopes and dashed dreams. Nothing more.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood is a fine filmmaker. He has a slick, economical directing style that make any film he directs intensely watchable. And he brings the same approach to Million Dollar Baby. But I can't help but wonder if the film would have gathered the same critical applause had it been made before Unforgiven, the film that had Clint Eastwood rediscovered all over again as a groundbreaking director. Clint had been making films 20 years before that, but people only started taking him seriously as a filmmaker until after Unforgiven. Had Million Dollar Baby been made all those years before, one suspects it would have received half of the attention.<br/><br/>It has a plot that's out of a hundred sports movies. An underdog boxer who wants to fight her way to the big time. So you could be forgiven for feeling beforehand that Million Dollar Baby is very predictable. I suppose it has a familiar story arc, but fine acting and Eastwood's direction allows it to transcend its stereotypical origins and become a superior film of the genre. If not quite in the classic bracket.<br/><br/>When Clint is not in the directors chair he plays Frankie Dunn, a down on his luck manager who trains possible heavyweight champions who end up signing with new managers. When his latest protégé leaves him in the lurch, he only has one option left. To train Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank), a female boxer. As a rule, Frankie doesn't train women, and Maggie at 31 is too old and too inexperienced. But he doesn't have much choice. She's his last student. Either he trains her, or the gym will go under.<br/><br/>Maggie barely makes ends meet as a waitress. Boxing is the one thing she's passionate about. And after relentlessly badgering Frankie for lessons, he gives in. With a little bit of nudging from Scraps (Freeman), a retired boxer who co-owns the gym with Frankie.<br/><br/>Maggie forms quite a rapport with Frankie and Scraps. And in between the lessons and training, she's allowed to share their private confidences. Frankie has a daughter he hasn't seen in years. No matter how many letters he writes, she sends them back, unopened and unwanted. Maggie becomes the daughter Frankie so desperately misses. Scraps (short for Scrap Iron) used to be a boxer under Frankie's training. But he lost an eye in the ring, and all because Frankie didn't know when to call it quits. Now Scraps spends his time at the gym training hopefuls, and only dreaming of what might have been.<br/><br/>Its individual vignettes like these where Million Dollar Baby really scores. Its a much better film than Rocky, because the excellent cast hits all the right notes. There's nothing wrong with any of these performances. Clint Eastwood delivers an honest, well honed turn as Frankie. This is a man who lets the world pass him by. And even when he tries to change that, he doesn't get much reward for his troubles.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank gives a brave and equally assured performance. She's not just up to the physical sessions, she also displays a quiet but astute assessment of the role. Something that serves her well in the third and final act.<br/><br/>And Morgan Freeman turns in another excellent performance as the world-weary Scraps, the role that finally netted him an Oscar. Certainly Morgan Freeman is an actor well overdue Oscar recognition. He should have won one back in 1994 for The Shawshank Redemption. Instead it went to Tom Hanks for the overrated Forrest Gump. And Freeman plays a part not that far removed from the one in TSR. He not only provides firm, moral support for Frankie and Maggie in times of crisis, but as the narrator of Million Dollar Baby, he's the film's moral centre.<br/><br/>With his customary resigned inflections, he delivers lines of dialogue about the harsh realities of life. And he convinces us without ever raising his voice. He never steps out of character. Which is what makes him such a fine actor.<br/><br/>For about three quarters of the way through, the film follows firmly established routes, but suddenly takes a step in another direction in the final act. Maggie ends up paralysed from the neck down. Its a shocking and emotionally crushing moment that leaves one quite numb.<br/><br/>Its this part of the film where Eastwood's direction really pays off. He shoots scenes in near darkness, interplayed light and shadow. And it gradually shows Maggie's deterioration. Not physically. But emotionally. And Eastwood deserves credit for avoiding conventional, melodramatic clichés. No sappy music or maudlin dialogue. Just cold hard facts underscored with true poignance. Hilary Swank is wonderful in these scenes. The silent expressions on her face speak volumes about her inner turmoil.<br/><br/>When she asks Frankie to help her die, its an approach that actually feels emotionally charged and honest. Not fake and obvious. Maggie's death scene is quite moving. And all because its told perfectly straight.<br/><br/>In the end, I do believe Million Dollar Baby falls just that little bit short of classic status. But it is an affecting story all the same. Its a successful package. And it succeeds on levels of acting, directing and writing. You really couldn't ask for anything more."
"lawrence_elliott","9","3","4","14 June 2007"," Riveting! Eastwood Just Gets Better With Age!
","What can I say that almost a thousand other comments haven't said? Clint Eastwood loves his craft. That's why his films are so good. He simply loves what he does........and it shows. He is a simple task-master but it works. What he lacks in talent he makes up for in grit, hard work, love of craft and determination for depiction of the truth in a natural way. He has a knack for simplicity and story-telling that is gripping and satisfying. He picks screenplays that are controversial and revolutionary and that require you as an audience to think and use your brain. He is not just there to entertain, though he always does that in large measure, but also to inform and to provoke one to thought - but rarely does he preach. He chooses themes that are often out of the mainstream, but can engage an audience so thoroughly with the universal emotions that we all share in our daily lives that he galvanizes large audiences into reactions that are at once massive but at the same time diverse in opinion. And that is precisely what Clint does here with great success. He does not give you a ""right or wrong"" to it. He just puts it on a platter for you to try it out and see for yourself what you think. I love Clint as an artist and so do many other people. This is a great film. Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman fit into their roles beautifully and Clint looks good too. Hilary and Clint do magic together on screen.<br/><br/>Get this film and own it today. Watch it often and Enjoy! One of the Best Films ever made and perhaps Clint's finest!"
"lmayer2","10","3","4","27 February 2007"," 2004's best...Eastwood's usual...A lessonful masterpiece
","There weren't many contenders for 2004's #1 film spot. People say Sideways was a close first, come on, is that really the movie you want to be watching? I mean, it spelled snobbish all the way through. But Million Dollar Baby is a heartfelt, different side of things and that's what Eastwood likes. An example is his latest, Letters from Iwo Jima. It shows the Japanese point of view in WW2. I really do think that's key. If you run out of ideas for one subject, you take another side and milk it as much as possible. Million Dollar Baby is its own special category. This movie teaches us that ultimately, winners are simply willing to do what losers aren't and that's what screams out a lot in the movie. This film has a lot of heart and pride, and it sure wasn't taken away by the acting or directing of this film. Million Dollar Baby shows the rough side of things to really get the mood going and the mood was set off perfectly. There was remorse, guilt and willingness to do anything all through this film. This film cries out to be understood. Sometimes your family will let you down and sometimes you'll let yourself down but you just roll with the punches life has to offer. There are many punches to this film and this film punched its own ticket to success."

"bm-25","10","3","4","20 January 2007"," Brilliant film, tough themes leading to painful outcomes
","I watched this film with my wife and by the end of it we were both in tears. I've been a long time fan of Clint Eastwood and this is probably another high point in a remarkable career.<br/><br/>The interplay between Frankie Dunn (Eastwood), the ageing owner of an impoverished boxing gym and Eddie (Freeman) his sidekick and former boxer/client is the skeleton of the film supporting the body of the plot. It's an understated tour-de-force by these fine actors.<br/><br/>We see Frankie lose the management of gym member and possible title contender Willy, which casts doubt on his ability as a manager, articulated by Eddie, who acts as a moderator of Frankie's stubbornness and truculence.<br/><br/>We have recurrent themes, for example Frankie daily visiting his local church to the frustration of the young priest, and where we learn of his long time estrangement from his daughter. We also see Frankie take some pleasure from trying to engage the priest in redundant explications of Christian theology. But he is a man struggling with guilt and looking for redemption.<br/><br/>The obvious answer is that Swank's character, a determined but naïve aspiring boxer, might provide such redemption. But part of the power of this film is that it is not your usual trite Hollywood fare. Eastwood has earned the privilege of making films his own way, not to some formulaic requirement for feel-good endings.<br/><br/>Yes, Frankie finally succumbs to Maggie's determination to have him as her manager, and he works his magic, but not conventionally. Maggie doggedly refuses to take notice of much of Frankie's advice, and hurtles through a series of 1st round knockouts, therefore failing to get the experience he feels she needs.<br/><br/>The growing development of their relationship, and accepting of their own and each others strengths and foibles, builds a plausible and deepening bond. Eastwood and Swank are utterly convincing.<br/><br/>The end of the film is tragic, but admirably deals with fate's potential for throwing disaster in the face of potential triumph and the dilemmas faced by those involved with edge-of-survival injuries. Anyone that has visited on a Spinal Injuries unit will understand the reality of such situations.<br/><br/>So a brave and typically involved Eastwood affair, dealing with topics close to his heart in a tough and uncompromising, yet humanitarian way. Deserving of all its awards!"
"Robert_duder","9","3","4","19 December 2005"," Eastwood's Powerful Epic brings out the best in everything
","Million Dollar Baby, if nothing else, brings forth the best performances you are likely to ever see out of both Eastwood as director and actor and Hilary Swank who really does perform above and beyond. Eastwood has been one of my favorite actors for a long time, more so his new work in the last 20 years...ie: Mystic River, True Crime, A Perfect World, Absolute Power and so on. I think he has come into his best work in his later years. When accepting his lifetime achievement award several years ago he stated that his best work was still ahead of him and that was the truth!! Million Dollar Baby is the rarely told story of a female Boxer who has the passion and heart but lacks the training. Eastwood plays a rough and tough former trainer turned cut man who is so passionate about boxing and protecting his boxers and when one of his prime boxers leaves him for another manager his sense of responsibility is quite shaken. Enter Swank as the tough as nails Maggie who won't give up on trying to get Eastwood to train her despite his insistence that he ""doesn't train girls."" Her insistence and his lack of faith in his boxers causes them to team up and their bond becomes unbreakable as her intense spirit and his rough exterior but faithful interior comes together. Enter the incomparable Morgan Freeman as Mr. Scrap, the former boxer who Eastwood trained back in their hey day. Scrap has leaved in Eastwood's gym and cleans the floors and is just kind of there to offer wisdom, even when it's not needed. Like it or not, they are all each other has.<br/><br/>The story is powerful and the action is intense. The fight scenes hold nothing back and they are brutal and gory but you barely notice with all the amazing heart in this film. The story really has little to nothing to do with boxing but rather about these people...not just Maggie and Frankie and Mr. Scrap but even the other people around them from Maggie's family, to Danger the mentally handicapped boy who wants to box more than anything.<br/><br/>Eastwood, Freeman and Swank perform their characters so beautifully. Granted Frankie played by Eastwood is the typical gruff and rough kinda character you'd expect from Eastwood but he plays it like no other could and he puts real soul into the character. Swank deserves all the praise as Maggie Fitzgerald. Her character is unique and interesting, and tough, and emotional, all at once and we really get to see where she came from, where she was going...we see her at her highs and lows and you can't stop watching her. Swank is brilliant!! Freeman's character adds real class and his narration of the story adds a grim bleakness to the story. It's a very sad and touching story from beginning to end and it's an instant classic that any lover of film must see. I don't know why I'm not smacking a 10 out of 10 on this...something holds me back from that but no one will be disappointed with this. Eastwood's direction is dead on, and the entire story is so gritty and dark but with this slight ray of light and hope and love and passion and dedication. It's one of the most unique films ever made. I admit I'm a huge boxing film fan...there doesn't seem to be many films that can go wrong when it places itself in the midst of boxing (I also more recently ADORED Cinderella Man), there is just something very passionate about boxing. This is well worth the watch for something very powerful and real. Definitely watch it!! 9/10"
"Sylviastel","9","3","4","22 August 2005"," Reminds us of what is missing in films today!
","One of the reasons that I don't like going to the movies now is the violence and profanity that fills films rather than great meaningful dialogue. I knew the ending which is why I didn't want to see it. I didn't agree with it which is the only reason that I am giving it a 9. I found the relationship between Clint Eastwood and Hilary Swank to be both beautiful, meaningful, and surprisingly platonic which is rare in movies today. There is too much focus on sexuality and this film lacks it completely. The relationship is more father and daughter than anything else. Clint's character Frankie Dunn finds a willing substitute in Hilary Swank's character, Maggie Fitzgerald. Her character recalls her father fondly in spoken memories only. She does not share the same fondness for her mother and other living relatives. Maggie follows her dream to box professionally which her mother disapproves. Maggie works hard, long hours of waitressing. She saves her pennies and even brings home scraps of leftover food. Hunger and poverty is never really talked about in films anyway. Maggie is a strong character who never gives up her dreams and she is loyal to her trainer, Frankie Dunn who learns to train her. The film's ending still leaves me asking more questions. I am not a person who cries easily and I had tears in my eyes. Morgan Freeman is also wonderful and deserved his Academy Award. In any other year, Clint would have won for Best Actor too and Hilary's performance is both heartbreaking and Oscar winning. She is the best actress of her generation with her own heartbreaking story. She always gives it her all in film and this is no exception."
"pinochle67","9","3","4","7 August 2005"," Always appreciate the blessing in life
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Great acting, with a few of mini plots surrounding the main plot. The tail of a boxing trainer who through experiences in life does not like to take chances decides to take one more. The trainer has not had contact with his daughter in many years and his continued pursuit of contacting her is constantly rejected. The movie just gives us a small piece of why the trainer's does not have a relationship with his daughter, but this let's the viewer ponder one of the many reasons it happened. He takes his big chance on a girl...who he would not train because of her sex for months. I get the portrayal as this is the relationship with his daughter he never had. The girl's family is lazy, greedy, self-centered people whose only concern with the girl fighter is how much money can she give them. So two peas in a pod are matched with each being quite stubborn. Somehow the relationship blooms. The cautious trainer and fighter take a great ride to the title fight. The end is one of those life searching decisions most of hope never to have to make. Yet a decision the trainer has to make...life or death. I strongly caution parents this film is not for children 17 and under. It is loaded with profane language. I would have rated the film R instead of PG-13 and if not for my TVG devise I would not have let my 13 year old watch."
"hokiemo","8","3","4","1 August 2005"," Excellent Performances
","""Million Dollar Baby"" is perfectly cast --- the actors take on their parts and make them their own. The story is about a white trash girl, Maggie, who wants to make something of herself and believes that boxing is her calling. She seeks out Frankie to train her at the gym, but he refuses to take her on at first. At first you think Frankie's sexist, but his character is not that simple. The story builds steadily and you later realize Frankie has many good reasons not to train Maggie, but her spirit and dedication win him over eventually. Frankie ties himself emotionally to each person he trains and tries his best to make them champions. Morgan Freeman is excellent as Scrap the gym's custodian and his intelligence and ability to decipher Frankie even surprises Frankie. Scrap reminds me of a man I met one time at my company who earned a purple heart in the Vietnam War, but spent his days sorting mail in the mail room. Surely, this veteran had more to offer the world or maybe I just didn't understand that he had experienced and accomplished more than most people do in a lifetime. I think the situation is the same with Scrap -- being at the gym doing whatever is still immensely satisfying to him. How many people can say they'd want to live at their place of work like Scrap?! Hillary Swank is wonderful as Maggie and Clint Eastwood... well what's not to like? The man is brilliant in every way -- acting, directing, writing, and so soft spoken in real life that you love and respect him even more.<br/><br/>I also was immensely impressed by the minor players in the film, especially the actor who plays Maggie's mother, Margo Martindale. She is just excellent in her supporting role. Lucia Rijker is also fantastic as ""Billie the Blue Bear"". She is one tough lady! It wasn't until I watched the behind the scenes footage that I saw how pretty she is off screen.<br/><br/>One minor problem I can see with the film is the diction and audibility -- I couldn't understand everything Scrap said and had to use the subtitles feature on the DVD player. I understood all of his narration, but not some of his lines when he appeared on film. My complaint sounds like nitpicking and that's not my intention.<br/><br/>Finally, it is great to finally see a major film about women's boxing. I didn't know the women's version is just as violent as the men's. I am quite surprised boxing headgear is not worn in women's or men's boxing. Boxing with your bare head makes no sense when you see how many injuries are sustained such as concussions, broken eardrums, detached retinas, and such. The sport makes complaining about a broken nose sound like you're complaining about a broken finger nail. I've heard some of Muhammad Ali's present health condition is attributed to numerous blows to his head during his boxing years.<br/><br/>Overall this is an excellent film and well worth the time viewing."

","Million Dollar Baby, can't get it out of my head.... absolutely brilliant, a deeper movie than at first may seem.<br/><br/>Basically surrounds the on going of a boxing coach/manager (Eastwood) who gets coaxed into helping out a determined 31/32 year old girl (Swank) who wants to be a boxer with the mgr's friend overseeing events and hangs on for the ride (Morgan Freeman). Swank comes from a lower class struggling background from the family from hell.<br/><br/>In some ways it is part Rocky, but it goes it own way, and the emotional roller-coaster of the movie hinges on that the girl becomes like a surrogate daughter for Eastwood as he is cut off from his own estranged daughter.<br/><br/>Very humorous at times, but you can't help be chocked at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Class movie.<br/><br/>8/10 definites....."
"elitt","Null","3","4","21 February 2005"," ""Baby"" carries a powerful punch and knock-out performances
","""Million Dollar Baby"" is really two films in one. A classic underdog story about a white trash waitress who wants to be a boxer. She comes from a small poor trailer town and saves whatever money she earns to give to her thankless mother back home. Hilary Swank plays Maggie Fitzgerald and she is good natured and only wants to fulfill her dream. She knows that Frankie Dunn, an aging struggling gym owner and former trainer is the man to get her there.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood plays Frankie and he's fighting his own demons. He attends church every day for no apparent reason. He isn't sure why he goes everyday, but he just feels he needs to make up for his lost daughter and his empty career. When Maggie appears in his gym for guidance, he sends her on his way, but she keeps coming back because of her determination and he eventually gives in. The two of them form an unusual bond. They ultimately need each other. She needs him to help her dream come true and as a father figure. Frankie sees Maggie as the daughter who'll return his letters and be in his life.<br/><br/>The boxing sequences aren't focal or anything special, but they're well directed and simple. Eastwood accomplishes what he needs to with these. The story is about the characters. It's not a boxing film. Naturally, Maggie gets better and better and a title match ensues.<br/><br/>While the first portion of the film is a true underdog story, the rest of it is a tearjerker as something unexpected occurs. Both portions blend well together and you'll be weeping like a baby. The film is a story about commitment, dedication, family, and redemption.<br/><br/>All the roles are carefully laid out and as Eastwood has gotten older and older, he has gotten better and better as a director. Like, last years ""Mystic River"", he directs his scenes with simplicity and he does it carefully without being too flashy. He lets his actors carry his films. Speaking of which, Hilary Swank is nothing short of amazing. She hits every right note as the naive woman who wants nothing more than to follow her dream and have a better life than she knows she has. Eastwood is terrific too. His best roles and acting jobs are when he is playing characters his own age. He hits the right notes more times than not. Morgan Freeman narrates the film and sort of plays the conscience of the film, like he did in Shawshank Redemption.<br/><br/>I don't know if ""Million Dollar Baby"" will come home with Oscar gold. It's not as flashy as ""The Aviator"", but it's a better film and it will have you talking when you leave the film. (****)"

For most of the movie, I found the plot well developed, the characters interesting and the grimy background believable. And what do you know, that girl can punch - one wallop and down they go until one day, down she went. And so did the movie. If the movie would have ended before the lengthy hospital scenes, I would have walked out and thought, well she did what she wanted to with the help of a moody, guilt ridden manager. He really overdid ""moody"" but hey, this is a movie. Now to get to the sad part and it was sad, sad. He was sad, she was sick and sad. Her folks were especially sad since no more money was forthcoming. Anyway, as the sun sets in the west, the movie sank lower and lower into despair until the end.

And when the priest said he would be agonized for the rest of his life if he did the mercy killing he had in actuality already been agonizing.

","Clint Eastwood (Dirty Harry) stars as Frankie, an emotional boxing trainer who takes a determined Maggie under his wing and trains her to compete at competitive levels.<br/><br/>Being a fan of Scorsese's Raging Bull and Michael Mann's Ali, I was eager to see this Oscar winning drama and was able to sit and be engaged into a slow and touching plot about the human spirit.<br/><br/>Eastwood leads the way as Frankie, a man with a whole lot of personal history that keeps him from making quick decisions, and gives a deserved Oscar nominated performance in his picture, which he also directs beautifully. Through the character's history, does Eastwood capitalize on bringing out the character's weaker side and he does it to perfection, though it's not Eastwood who steals the limelight.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank (Boys don't cry) gives an Oscar winning performance as Maggie, another character with the past casting shadows over her judgement and with the characters both having similar characteristics and interests, does a great on screen partnership start to blossom into an emotional tale.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman (Shawshank Redemption) likewise receives an Oscar for his performance as Scraps. Not in the film nearly enough for viewers to get to know him, Freeman does great with what he has. Jay Baruchel plays Danger, a weak person in the mind of so many others and is emotional to watch the character on screen.<br/><br/>After a pretty dull opening does the film pick up as we get to know the characters more and the plot comes intriguing with personal issues the focus in this drama.<br/><br/>The plot is consistent once it gets going and with a strong line of personalities the viewers are thrust into their lives as they deal with personal and professional lives.<br/><br/>The fights are tense and interesting to watch, none more so than the final one of the film, leaving to a sad and dramatic climax.<br/><br/>Stronger than Ali and equally as dramatic as Raging Bull, Million Dollar Baby is one of the great boxing dramas ever made with excellent performances which show in a beautifully directed drama."

"rmax304823","7","4","6","12 January 2006"," Ponderous, not at all bad.
","Clint Eastwood has earned the satisfaction he seems to get out of making leisurely, moody pieces like this, instead of the drive-in kinds of mindless commercial properties he once had to produce to satisfy his bankers. He has enough ambition and talent to do without the orang-utans.<br/><br/>You can tell this is one of his more arty enterprises by the darkness, the shadows, the chiaroscuro. People work out in his gym with all the lights but one turned off so they cast dramatic shadows on the peeling cinder-block walls. We can tell that it's Morgan Freeman lurking in the gloom because a single strip of light falls across his eyes. Even hospital rooms are lighted as if they were the interiors of cathedrals.<br/><br/>The score, by Eastwood, is a simple one. A melancholy falling arpeggio on a guitar or piano, perfectly predictable except for the final note, which hovers in the air for a long moment before resolving the progression. <br/><br/>The theme is not triumph over aimlessness, as in ""Rocky,"" but guilt. Eastwood is Frankie, a fight manager who feels responsible for his pal Morgan Freeman's losing his eye in a bout. The movie begins with Frankie twitting a priest after mass, provoking him into saying the f word. Frankie's been attending mass every Sunday for more than 20 years but the priest can't figure out why because Frankie lies and blasphemes all the time. It isn't until the end of the movie that we realize exactly how guilt-prone Franky is. He's afraid to push his fighters ahead too fast for fear they'll be hurt, the way Freeman was hurt, and so when his best fighters are fully trained they leave him for more aggressive managers. Frankie's final act of mercy involves such a monumental breach of ordinary ethics that the weight of his responsibility now makes it impossible for him to carry on with his previous life. He disappears overnight, without a trace, with leaving a puff of smoke. A minute-long coda tacked on leaves an unnecessary, unrealistic taste of optimism in the mouth, along with some homemade lemon-meringue that's gone slightly off.<br/><br/>It's curious, but as Eastwood has aged he's come to resemble the aging Henry Fonda more than ever -- tall, gangling stiff, slightly kyphotic, his voice changed into a hoary whisper.<br/><br/>His performance is okay, and so is Hilary Swank's. Morgan Freeman narrates and plays an avuncular observer, doing the interpreting for us, filling in the gaps in the narrative, a fine actor. The prize ought to go to Margo Martindale (?) as Swank's redneck selfish unfeeling Mom. What a picture of pure e-vil.<br/><br/>If there's a weakness in the film, that Fitzgerald family is probably the most prominent. The other characters are mostly multidimensional, but not Swank's family members. They're mainly there to illustrate the point that if Swank doesn't box, she has absolutely nothing to live for. It would be a better movie if Swank's family had been more nearly human -- maybe polite and grateful, but not unhappy at her estrangement. As it is, the family is drive-in baggage, though well acted.<br/><br/>The boxing part is a little different from that of ""Rocky."" Rocky already knows how to box. He just doesn't care. Swank cares a great deal but knows nothing, so the few lessons we see her getting are instructive. (In ""Champion"", Kirk Douglas didn't know how to box and he didn't care either.) Watching those brutal boxing scenes would have prompted me to wonder what it was like to be beaten to a pulp by a woman, if I didn't already know. They don't show much in the way of either realism or artistry. No blank spots in the bouts. It's either, Pow, right in the snot-locker, or, Whiz, a great big miss. And every fight ends in a knockout. Ah, well. It's not really a movie about boxing anyway.<br/><br/>Another thing might be mentioned. Eastwood has always tried to build a part for an African-American or other minority in his films, starting early with Albert Popwell. But these characters are never condescended to. They're not sentimentalized, ennobled, or otherwise politically corrected. They're treated like anybody else. And Eastwood hasn't been afraid to challenge himself on screen with fine performers either. Here (and elsewhere) he's used Morgan Freeman, than whom there is no finer actor on the screen today. Watch Freeman play the hilarious scene about his day socks and his night socks, while staring distractedly out the window. Eastwood gets extra points for taking risks like that.<br/><br/>This is a tragedy, but a pretty good one."

","I have never been so thrilled when watching a movie, besides David O. Selznick's 'Gone With the Wind'. The three main actors/actresses, Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman, and Clint Eastwood are at their best and make you forget you are watching a movie. I'm a fan of boxing movies, like the classic 'Rocky', and I thought it was interesting to see a boxing movie about a woman boxer. Hilary Swank clearly worked hard to portray this character and it paid off, she blew me away, I knew she was a great actress, but she just solidified herself as an actress that will stand the test of time. She has unbelievable chemistry with both Eastwood and Freeman. She and Eastwood really made me believe that they had grown to love each other, and your heart really goes out to Eastwood at the end of the film when he grants Maggie her wish to die in peace. I truly was amazed and I am very excited to watch it again on OnDemand!"

After her plea for his help he gives in along with the co-owner Morgan Freeman. Who makes a good sidekick and helps make the movie more enjoyable. Even though the screenplay written by Paul Haggis (who will later go on to make Crash) was fantastic and one of the best boxing screenplays since Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin did Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull screenplay.

"Keirdance","10","4","6","18 May 2005"," A Wonderful, and Important Film
","As I sat through ""Million Dollar Baby"", I was very pleased about the quality of the film as a whole. Then, the film took a dark turn, and it became a multi-dimensional film, one that I will never forget. The acting, writing, directing, music, and even the lighting of the film was perfect for what it was. I happen to agree with the choices of the characters of the film. Does that make me biased?, I don't think so, because if you really think about it, nobody wins. It's about bonds that we make with people. An unspoken love that we have for the people that we connect with in life. Clint Eastwood is a master. He has proved that throughout his career. With ""Baby"", he not only shows us his mastery as a director, but a spot-on acting job as the grumpy gym owner. This IS his masterpiece. Morgan Freeman is wonderful, as always as Scraps. I can't imagine the film without his narration. The film, though, belongs to Hilary Swank. She is both mentally and physically perfect for Maggie. Swank makes you fall in love with Maggie, makes you cheer her on in the fight scenes. Swank brings that character to life. She is honest in every way in her acting. I was sooooo happy when ""Million Dollar Baby"" won the Oscar for Best Picture. Thank You Academy!!! This is a beautiful, haunting film. If you haven't seen it yet, go now!"

This one hits you so deep in the gut(pardon the boxing pun) that once is definitely plenty. You will most likely never forget it. There have been only a few movies so sad and so heartfelt that the emotional chord it strikes leaves you in such a state you don't want to go there again. Kind of like a funeral for someone you loved. I sincerely admire Hillary Swank as an actress. Her 2 most amazing roles that both won her Oscars, have her dying in the end. She does it better than anyone. She has a humanity to her roles that reminds me of Audrey Hepburn at her best. The only other actress I know today that has this same quality is Natalie Portman. Watch her amazing performance at the age of 13 in The Professional. It is like she and Hillary are cast from the same amazing mold. MDB is a great movie. It may have an ending some may not agree is right, but it fits. It almost seemed like 2 different movies. A Rocky type of story at first, then a story about the issue of life. I highly suggest watching it once. That is all you will need."

","Starring: Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman Boxing is a sport that I personally do not appreciate. Two guys go into the squared circle, put on some gloves, and beat the living crap out of each other. To me, that isn't entertainment. That's just stupidity.<br/><br/>If nothing else though, I admire the people who go through that rigorous training and have the physical skill and strength to be such incredible fighters.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is a movie all about boxing. Frankie (Eastwood) is an over the hill boxing trainer and manager who owns a gym. His prize fighter is on the verge of being ready for a title match, but Frankie holds him back for a few more fights so that he's ready. His fighter doesn't want to wait and finds a new manager.<br/><br/>From the beginning of the movie, there is a woman frequently showing up at the gym to train. Her name is Maggie (Swank), a southerner from a poor background with dreams and a truckload of ambition. She wants Frankie to be here manager, but Frankie doesn't train girls. No matter how hard Maggie tries to convince him, Frankie doesn't budge.<br/><br/>Eventually, after his fighter leaves him, Frankie has a change of heart and decided to take Maggie on. They form a friendship that almost seems like a father/daughter relationship. Frankie looks out for Maggie all the time, doing his best to protect her, guide her, train her, and send her forward into the boxing world. Maggie advances and eventually gets a title bout. But tragedy strikes. Specifically, I will not say what, but Maggie's boxing career comes to an abrupt and tragic end.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is very difficult to watch because you feel genuinely sorry for Maggie when you see her lying in that hospital bed. At points in the movie I felt my eyes getting a little moist.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is a very well done movie. The acting is superb, the plot is great, the movie is mostly clean. But the ending is far too tragic for my taste. I watch movies to be entertained. Not depressed.<br/><br/>This movie is very good in a The Green Mile or Forrest Gump kind of way.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (definitely worth a look)"

"benihana83","9","4","6","19 April 2005"," Deserved Oscar Winner..
","The winner for the best picture of 2004 at the Academy Awards, Million Dollar Baby featured magnificent acting and directing. This boxing character study, the latest effort from Clint Eastwood, is certainly deserving of whatever honors it received. In addition to the award for best picture, it also won Oscars for best directing (Eastwood), best actress (Hilary Swank) and best supporting actor (Morgan Freeman).<br/><br/>At the heart of the film is Swank, who plays Maggie Fitzgerald, an aging boxer with a hard past. When she meets Frankie, played by Eastwood, she sees a man who could take her to the top of the boxing world. Despite his efforts to get her to leave him alone, Frankie finally agrees to train her. Together, they form a bond that helps Maggie earn fame in the ring and also fills a void in each of their lives.<br/><br/>While Swank is remarkable as Maggie, the real treat in Million Dollar Baby is the interplay between Eastwood's Frankie and Freeman as his long time friend ""Scrap."" The two have the most believable on-screen friendship in recent memory. With every line and quip, the viewer has no doubt that the two have been best friends for decades.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Million Dollar Baby and many of its critics have come under fire for the movie's final moments. While I won't ruin the ending by divulging it here, I can say that there is a significant and controversial twist in the last third of the film. Many critics revealed that twist in their criticism of the film's morals and motivation. In response to these critics, I can do no better than to quote renowned movie critic Roger Ebert, who wrote on the subject in a January 29 essay entitled ""Critics Have No Right to Play Spoiler."" ""Million Dollar Baby raises fundamental moral issues,"" wrote Ebert. ""At a moment of crisis, the characters arrive at a decision. I do not agree with their decision. But here is the crucial point: I do believe that these characters would do what they do in this film. It is entirely consistent with whom they are and everything we have come to know about them. That is one reason the film is so good: it follows the characters all the way to the limit, and plays true to them."" Ebert mentions that the film follows its characters to the limit, characters which were first formed by F.X. Toole in his book Rope Burns. Eastwood has adapted the F.X. Toole stories perfectly and provided us with an intriguing character study that will make you question your beliefs and the actions of the characters. Great movies make you think, and Million Dollar Baby does just that."

Though there was a lot of boxing involved it's not a boxing movie. It a movie about life decisions, love, regret, and ultimately death. I cried for the last 30 to 45 minutes of the movie and even my boyfriend cried a little. Although it was incredibly depressing it was one of THE BEST movies I have ever seen.

Personally Frankie has suffered estrangement from his daughter, and feigns atheism but has been attending mass for the past 23 years.<br/><br/>Then Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank), a struggler requests Frankie to train her.

But Maggie's determination makes Frankie agree, although grudgingly.The two come to discover a common bond that they share and loss of their families long ago. <br/><br/>Comment: The screenplay based upon stories from ""Rope Burns"" by FX Toole. The story packs two years of their lives into two hours showing the surrogate father-daughter relationship and personal/professional challenges they undergo.Direction and Acting are simply amazing (4 Oscars prove it). The characterization, plot and handling of touchy issues like euthanasia are neat.

","This is the greatest movie I saw this year. So many levels, so many layers, so many metaphors. It's a religious film, it's a story about secret of success: strong body, strong spirit and unlimited faith. This film is all about faith.<br/><br/>Each character acts in two levels: human and divine:<br/><br/>Scrap::: Represents the God who loves, suffers, but who cannot get involved. For second time in his life (as far as I know), Freeman played God. And he was awarded for this exceptional act.<br/><br/>Dunn::: Represents Holly Spirit, divine component of Maggie-Dunn symbiosis. Dunn is Scrap's boss, ""Free Will"" allows him to be God's boss. God ""cannot mess with Free Will"" (Bruce Allmighty). All he could do was to make Maggie and Dunn met and join to the fight of their life.<br/><br/>Maggie::: At beginning she was human. Then, she surrenders herself to Dunn, to Holly Spirit in a challenge of faith. Now she become symbol of Christ, the symbol of supreme self-sacrifice, the symbol of our maximum capacity.<br/><br/>Priest::: Teaches a cold faith, a faith without understanding of human spirit, a faith built by general rules, not by love.<br/><br/>Danger::: That's the ones who only dreams and who punch air because they're afraid to fight. They are the ones who will ""never have the chance"".<br/><br/>Manager::: The temptation. God allows Evil to tempt Christ, it allows him to prove his faith. <br/><br/>Family::: They are the lost ones. The ones who don't have a holly spirit, and Maggie has to fight herself with them, she cannot allow her spirit to be affected by such low feelings and emotions (Dunn waits on hospital hall).<br/><br/>Boxing::: Is the faith. The fight itself, it the positive fight in life: holly spirit get involved. Unlike fight with family where the spirit will loose his grandeur if he'll be part of that.<br/><br/>Dunn's daughter::: Represents atheist, they don't want to know and don't want to hear. They refuses his love, they refuses his messages. At the end, God itself(Morgan) does the last try to claim her into ""his kingdom"".<br/><br/>The Accident::: Unfair Events which happens to perfect people. Crucifixion. At beginning, Dunn accuses Morgan. The Spirit accuses God and tries to get a logical explanation. That's last but one Christ's fight. The fight with the Creator.<br/><br/>The Suicide::: Dunn, tried to find the answer in Church, but the impersonal advices cannot offer him any. The solution comes when he met Scrap: when Spirit made peace with God. Maggie's flight was stopped by that accident, but her spirit was still powerful. Keeping in mind that boxing was her faith, an absolute faith, nothing else could replace that (ie. school). The only obstacle to the absolute faith was her imperfect body, and they had to get rid of that component. God approved that as a way of evolution, not as an end. The spirit released the body and they both found peace.<br/><br/>Why people die happy at 80 years ? Because they have children, grandchildren and they are happy about what they did in life. Most people believes in something: in God, in family, in box. Maggie believed in box, she touched the perfection and she had the right to die happy. I don't think is about Euthanasia, and it's not about Spinal Cord Injury. It's about a spirit who made peace with himself, with his body and with his Creator. <br/><br/>People have the right to die with dignity, but, first, they have to grow as much as possible and beyond that. They shouldn't abandon the fight, their spirit shouldn't loose. They should reach the absolute level, they should have the conversation with God and, if they all agree, they are ready to leave this world.<br/><br/>P.S. Sorry for poor English, it's not my mother tongue"

","The funny thing is that a few months before this film came out, I was extremely disappointed with cinema in general and asked, ""Why can't anyone just make a simple story and tell it?"" Sure, there's a handful of films out there like that, but why are they so few and far between? Why must there be gimmicks? Why so many distractions (that don't distract) for the audience? And along comes Clint Eastwood . . . thank you, Mr. Eastwood for having integrity and making the movies you want to make.<br/><br/>I love this movie. I'd go as far as to say it's one of the best films I've seen in the past ten years. What is Million Dollar Baby? Just a good old fashion movie, shot in a solid old fashion style, whose focus is squarely placed on its characters where it belongs. That's it ladies and gentlemen. This is story telling at its best.<br/><br/>And honestly, the story really isn't even remotely unique  a character has a dream and shoots for it despite the opposition. This same story has been told thousands of times under thousands of titles and thousands of variations on the circumstance--in one movie it happens to be a warrior fighting for a cause, in another movie it's about an Olympic team, here it's simply about a woman who wants to take up boxing. But you know what? If it's done well, it doesn't matter how many times we've heard variations on the tale.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is done well.<br/><br/>I could go through and talk about the characters, the wonderfully realistic, sincere, and heartfelt performances from Eastwood, the ever-awesome Morgan Freeman, and Swank, but this film's strength lay in ""how"" and not ""what."" As stated earlier, it's a simple story that's been told numerous time--person has a dream and chases it--what separates Million Dollar Baby from the rest of the pack is how the story/characters are presented, and that needs to be experienced first hand.<br/><br/>Even if people are usually turned off by ""sports"" films (believe me, I'm one of them), I still highly recommend Million Dollar Baby because, quite frankly, this is not a sports movie. In Million Dollar Baby you meet Eddie, Franky, and Maggie, you spend time with these three, learn about them, and they become real so you no longer watch their lives, you experience it too.<br/><br/>It's somewhat strange that the best films I've seen I have so little to really say about them. The greatest compliment I can give to any film is simply stating that an accurate description is beyond words. It has to be seen, heard, and felt. The film has to be experienced.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is one of those movies."

And the million dollar would come from the money that she had made out of her unfortunately shortened career. I don't know. These are just my reflections. Or did i miss something?

To become a professional female boxer and to give all she got into this last shot. Coming from poor and truly ungrateful family to a place where hope finally starts to grow.

","Clint Eastwood is a unique icon of American cinema whom I have admired even before he reached the big screen when I enjoyed his performances as Rowdie Yates in television's ""Wagon Train"". The longevity of his career (the first of his films as an actor was years 50 ago), the commercial success of his 58 films as an actor (whether as cowboy, cop or comedian) but, above all, the critical success of the 27 movies he has directed (especially the later work such as ""Unforgiven"" and ""Mystic River"") make him a singular figure in the cinematic firmament. In many cases, he has both starred and directed and so it is with ""Million Dollar Baby"" which - at the incredible age of 74 - is set to consolidate his already formidable reputation.<br/><br/>I went into the cinema expecting to see ""Rockette"" - a female version of Stallone's triumphalism in the boxing ring - but came out feeling I'd seen ""Who's Fight Is It Anyway?"" - a searing examination of the meaning of life and relationships. Eastwood, as the laconic and irascible boxing trainer Frankie Dunn, and Hilary Swank, as a 32 year old trailer trash waitress who wants to find herself in the ring (she put on 19 lb for the role), are individually commanding but, in their subtle interaction, they are most impressive, as she finds the father who died too early and he connects with the daughter who will not receive his letters.<br/><br/>The third character is a friend to each and the one who understands both from the beginning. Morgan Freeman plays Frankie's assistant Scrap in a dual role in which he is also - as he was in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" - the mellow-voiced and knowing narrator. Unusually for this type of movie, a considerable amount of time is focused on the training gym and the actual fight scenes are very different from ""Rocky"": fast, furious, and short. Indeed the fighting is essentially a metaphor for feelings and the whole work is simply a knock out."

","I agree with the summary for the most part, but I am of the opinion that the fighter who left to work with another manager left not because the other manager paid more money, but was willing to let him take the chance to fight bigger. Remember when he said ""You keep saying I'll 'be ready in three or four more fights!'""? I think all the characters found their ""Million Dollar Baby"" when they responded authentically to the obstacles presented them. Each major character was presented with an obstacle. Once the monster was confronted, each character had his (or her) moment of clarity. We're not told why Clint Eastwood's character was estranged from his daughter, and I don't think it's important. I do think it is important that once he did what he had to do, in spite of his conflict with the information from the priest and his inner agony, he was freed..."

She is able to carry the weight of her back story in her shoulders and is able to communicate triumph with her face alone. Clint Eastwood does give the performance of his career as the aged trainer of Swank's character.

Then of course, after watching the trailer, I became intrigued and then of course, after all the critical praise, became intent on seeing it soon. Trouble was, it was only playing at one theater in my area and a good thirty miles from home. Tonight, I decided to make the trip and boy my efforts paid off. This film starts out to be a great story and sweet, funny and visually stunning and then once it starts to reach it's climax, changes gears and goes another direction.

At least Johnny Got His Gun makes a much better attempt.<br/><br/>I feel for those that suffer disabilities of this magnitude, I really do. It's not a situation to simply dismiss. What disgusts me in this movie is the lack of fight in it. Is this girl really a boxer? Does she really understand a boxers mentality and what it means to really go a round in not only in the ring but in life? No, the punch line is 'I can't answer the bell, I'm staying on the mat, count me out'. I'm a quitter and there is no hope.<br/><br/>No only does she give up but of all people ... her trainer???? Clint Eastwood is portrayed as her corner man and coach, but can not so much as offer anything of substance to encourage her to fight. He even is the one to give her the final shot... Hey how so true blood, sweat, and tears in the ring and outside of the ring with her? Does he have nothing to offer her outside of a gym or a ring? No he doesn't he simply concedes and says goodbye.<br/><br/>I guess when people truly believe an agenda, it doesn't matter how weak the characters are, or how weak the characters CHARACTER is, it's all good and it's all truth, so much as it supports one agenda.<br/><br/>Life is far more precious that this movies makes it out to be. It is worth the fight to get in the trenches with the downcast and depressed to instill in them hope. That is why the Shawshank Redemption is a classic and this is not. This movie only breeds nihilism and death, the LAST thing that those in a wheelchair or on their deathbed need.

","I've been watching films deeply enough to develop a strategy of trust. There are certain persons that if they are involved in a film, I'll go into it with an open soul. Often they'll fail but thats a small cost in an otherwise rewarding life of trust. There are only a few actors on this list, some writers of course and directors.<br/><br/>And there's another list of people to avoid, people who have damaged my soul and compromised my world, folks who require you to repair your encounter with them. I avoided this project until now because it has both types. Swank is an earnest actor not on either list.<br/><br/>Eastwood is someone who has earned my trust because of one amazing project, ""Mystic River."" Quite apart from the story, it is about direction, a melding of forces. All the major actors in the thing are actors who also direct. All of them understand to a significant degree what most actors don't, that a performance has both inside and outside compositional values. What Eastwood wrangled in that little film was an encounter not only among characters as scripted, and among acting philosophies as often happens, but also among actors situation in what they see as the directorial situation the local composition. And we also have the interaction of all layers with the others. Marvelous, and worthy of trust.<br/><br/>Plus the man is so economical. Economy by itself isn't worth much; Bresson chafes me. But Eastwood can focus and pare so that even the most ordinary effect can seem purposeful. And that's what happens here. This is such an ordinary, derivative, spitefully mundane and worthless script, it says something that he has given it dignity. But that's all it is, tripe with a clean wrapper.<br/><br/>The two men on my list that do not deserve a place in my pantheon of film friends: Freeman and Haggis.<br/><br/>Haggis is a hack, a machine, a cut and paste expert in appealing to the lowest and most uncomplicated sentimentalites. That's allowable in my book so long as there's some novelty, some new handle on life some new angle, something that pulls us up with tools for seeing. Never.<br/><br/>Freeman is simply an annoyance. He's an arrogant actor exploiting black avuncular type. He decided long ago and has often said that he will just be himself, regardless of what the role requires. But that never comes up because he only chooses roles that match what he has chosen to invent himself as a person. Its a fake racist nobility, made ever so more offensive with the fake wisdom that accompanies it.<br/><br/>I'll take a hundred Eddie Murphys exploring the limits of race over one who safely cashes in on it. Listen to his narrative phrasing in the voiceovers. Eastwood should have known better.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

","I wanted to like this movie, especially since I am a fan of Clint Eastwood as a director and Hilary Swank as an actress. The previews didn't interest me at all - but the almost universal praise heaped on this film did make me want to see it.<br/><br/>I agree with the reviewer who said the film felt ""scripted"" - not only that, but watching scenes (near the beginning) with Clint and Morgan were like watching people ""act"" and ""play the scene"". Hilary Swank saves the day with her performance, believable and truthful. Clint's work later in the film is exemplary. Morgan Freeman is, well, Morgan Freeman, and here he plays simply a variation on his ""Driving Miss Daisy"" character, mumbling through some scenes making his words incomprehensible.<br/><br/>I didn't feel an emotional connection to this film at all - I don't see it as ""Clint's masterpiece"" at all - ""Mystic River"" is a far superior film, which had me extremely emotionally involved. The Morgan Freeman voice-over really got on my nerves very early on. I am not a fan of voice-over - I believe it's an easy way out of explaining things rather than SHOWING them.<br/><br/>I can't understand all the hype about MDB - I really can't.

","That Clint Eastwood continues to prosper in Hollywood, despite having been a star for four decades, reflects well upon his talent and his ability to make relevant films. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is Clint's 25th directorial outing, and the 57th film he's acted in. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is advertised as a female ""Rocky"", with more focus on the boxing trainer. For the first two acts, perhaps, it is. The film follows Frankie Dunn (Clint), who is pursued by aspiring boxer Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank, in an Oscar-worthy portrayal). Frankie doesn't want to train girls, but Maggie is persistent, and Frankie eventually agrees. Frankie and his gym manager, Eddie ""Scrap Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman), train Maggie, who quickly rises through the boxing ranks. Maggie becomes a surrogate daughter to Frankie, who has a painful past with his own daughter. It's at the start of the third act that Clint sucker punches the audience, taking the film in a totally unexpected direction. After an accident in the ring, ""Million Dollar Baby"" switches from a female ""Rocky"" to a female ""The Sea Inside"". Let's hope for Oscars for Swank and Freeman, and, while I love ""The Aviator"", Picture, Director, and even Actor are hardly undeserved. 10/10."

","I'll cut to the chase -- this movie is flawless.<br/><br/>The direction, cinematography, and writing are all significantly better than ""Mystic River,"" with all three leads (Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman) turning in Oscar-worthy performances. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is an intimate triumph, and could legitimately be called an ""instant classic."" The specifics of the story are available everywhere, so I'll spare those details. Less often discussed is the skill with which Eastwood treads the razor-thin border between ""been there, done that"" and perfection.<br/><br/>A look at this film's basic premise might make it appear rife with potential cliché, and the finished product may have lived down to that expectation in the hands of a less insightful director. Watching Eastwood evade the unintentional humor of Hollywood's traditional ""underdog-made-good"" stories (and soaking up the leads' brilliant performances) comprises much of the appeal of the film's first two acts.<br/><br/>The third act is simply arresting. The acting is one hundred percent flawless throughout the film's last thirty minutes. The pacing remains perfect. To a man, the sold-out audience of which I was a member was utterly, silently transfixed after the beginning of the film's third stanza.<br/><br/>As soon as you possibly can, see this movie.

"oneblip","1","8","16","22 January 2006"," Doesn't make a good movie
","I'm going to try to make this as short as possible, because you people deserve it after sitting through Million Dollar Baby (or not). If you liked Rocky, don't see MDB. If you liked Gladiator (the boxing one, not Russel Crowe), don't see MDB. If you liked any boxing movie, DON'T SEE MDB.<br/><br/>Plain and simple, this is not a boxing movie. This is not a movie about hope, or dreams. This movie is about giving up. This movie is against every thing a movie should be about, entertainment and thought provoking material (if that's your bag). MDB works in two halves, the good half, and the bad half.<br/><br/>The good half consists of the main character (Maggie) struggling to realize her dream of becoming a boxer. Eventually she does, after bugging Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) into submission. We see her in her prime, you get this feeling that she realized her dream because she never gave up. The second half happens after Maggie takes a fall after a dirty hit causes her to sustain a spinal injury.<br/><br/>The last 30 minutes of the movie are spent watching Maggie die in a hospital. She does nothing, she barely says any thing. She simply lays there and Frankie stands by her bed as she does. Eventually Maggie says ""Put me out of my misery"" and without much question, sure enough Frankie injects her with an unknown substance, after which Maggie shortly dies. So what are we left with? An ending that tells us it makes no sense to go on once we can't move our limbs.<br/><br/>That it's better to give up than to die trying. I'd have been happy with this being another Rocky, at least that was entertaining. And admittedly so was this until the last 30 minutes. The only thing I can give this ending is that it's probably the most realistic, given the circumstances of her injury.<br/><br/>That still doesn't make up for the fact that when I watch a movie, I want to be moved. I want to be entertained. I do not want to feel depressed and like I should just give up all hope of ever achieving any thing. I am not a picky man when it comes to movies (see my comment history) so you know it's something else when a movie gets a very low rating from me.<br/><br/>If you want to see a movie that will do what a movie is supposed to do rent Rocky's 1,2, and 4."

You know, I'm quite convinced that if it hadn't been for Eastwood sitting on the director's chair, all the critics would have been very negative and no-one would have appreciated this film.

"Galina_movie_fan","6","8","16","15 February 2005"," My handkerchief stayed dry.
","""Million Dollar Baby"" is a plain and predictable movie which was confidently directed, and has three very good performances. I just cannot believe how many clichés it's got - the estranged daughter of Frankie (Eastwood) to whom he writes every week and receives every letter back not opened. This device was used for Freeman's character's narration - in the last scene of the film we realize that he was telling the story to Frankie's daughter to convince her that her father was a good man. The main character, Maggie the waitress (Hillary Swank) eating table scraps and counting pennies, makes a long trip to LA to be trained by Frankie to became a boxing champion - why is she so determined to have him as her trainer we'll never know. Her conversation with Frankie when she remembers her father and her dog, Axel that was put asleep when became sick - kind of lets you know what to expect in the end. The ominous descriptions of a German champion Billy the Blue Bear, ""the dirtiest killing machine"" - you know what will happen way before the movie takes it turn. It should've ended just after the turn with Maggie's death - the final round of the movie is despicable in its manipulation. It is hard for me to believe that Maggie practically fall apart from the lack of the proper care - it was shown that way to squeeze as many tears from the audience as possible. What it squeezed from me was anger and burning desire to hiss ""Die already!!!"" It is also quite predictable that all members of Maggie's family are the crude caricatures. By the way, her sister does not look like a redneck girl who keeps having babies and cheats on Welfare but this is a small detail. Final heartbreaking scene between Maggie and Frankie - in her last moment he told her what Gaelic phrase 'Mo cosúlacht' means and of course, it should make the audiences cry even harder. But if you think of it, Maggie had the robe with the sign for months, her many Irish fans kept greeting her with this phrase all the time - and she never was curious enough to find out (through the dictionary or just by asking any of her fans) what it meant. Again, it is a small detail but I hate to be manipulated by the cheap tricks and the movie has lots of them. Oh, I almost forgot the mentally retarded boy in the Frankie's Gym whose only purpose to be in the gym and in the movie was to provide a triumphant moment for Freeman's Scrap and the comical relief exactly in the right time. <br/><br/>You know, when I think of it, I hate the whole idea of women boxing - I find it unnatural, cruel, and absolutely unsympathetic. If Maggie was able to safe a few pennies to get to that Gym, if she was so subtle, strong willed and determined to change her life, to pull herself out of the trailer park, to become somebody, to not be called ""white trash"", why did not she go to school - to better herself, to receive education. She was smart enough to know where she came from and to want to get out of there, so, why choose the way she chose? But I guess, the movie was not supposed to answer this question.<br/><br/>I believe that Eastwood is an incredible artist at almost 75 - with sure hand, great style, and sharp mind. I loved the music he wrote for the movie, I liked his acting (as well as Swank's and Freeman's), and I wish him well at the Oscars but for me, ""Million Dollar Baby"" was not the Best film of the year, not even close. 6.5/10"
"screenlabs","Null","8","16","26 January 2005"," Conservative mythologies
","MILLION DOLLAR BABY is Clint Eastwood's bode and homage to the world of traditional conservative values of the poor pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, the tough-love authoritarian father figure, and the stereotype hatred of poor white trash welfare chiselers. In many of Eastwood's films, the former mayor of Carmel puts forward a world of simplistic virtue and moralistic black and white that you often see old men in diners declaim as lost to sophistry and complexity. <br/><br/>In MDB Eastwood's characters all verge on flat one-dimensional stereotypes, Morgan Freeman (puts in a good performance that defies its shallowness on paper) plays the washed-up boxer who lives in the storage closet of the gym. Hillary Swank is a desperate waitress who tries to escape grinding poverty and trailer trash ignorance by looking for a strong father-like authoritarian who, at first, attempts to disabuse her of foolish ambitions. The worse one-dimensional stereotypes come from Eastwoods depiction of Maggies family of crooks and overweight baby-producing welfare cheats. <br/><br/>The cartoon-like script treatment of the characters throws you out of the film's narrative and do not serve the excellent acting by Swank and Freeman. This is carefully contrived political ideology that ends with the well-worn emotional manipulation verging on melodrama. Eastwood would do better if he stuck to good storytelling and avoid broad swipes at political characterization."

I can't say how much I HATE those petty Oscar movies. a retardate boxer, a female trailer-trash super boxer who basically never loses, a black fighter who could have taken the belt and had lost his eye due to his pride, a gloomy coach and once again - the German boxer. When I saw that so many people gave it a 8 or 9 or even 10 in the rating chart I almost cried. how stupid can one get to be fooled by this so called movie. just because you see an eye sobbing movie you shouldn't rate it 10! Even if you do like this kind of pictures it still shouldn't get more than 4 or 5. I can feel it in my bones how the writer is thinking to himself how to make this movie more and more heartbreaking.

","After months of hearing about Million Dollar Baby and the hype surrounding it, I finally got to see it. I actually went in with low expectations but was very pleased to find out that it lives up to the hype! It really is that good.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is basically about a tough woman named Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) who lives for boxing and wants to go as far as she can with it. Therefore, she finds the right person she wants to train and manage her and refuses to quit until he accepts her. As you can imagine, the boxing plays a huge role in this story but around half way to three quarters of the way through, the movie takes an unexpected dark turn. I don't go into many details because I don't want to spoil it. I saw this movie without hearing a thing about it and I believe it was much better not knowing what to expect or even what kind of movie it starts off as and metamorphoses into.<br/><br/>I know from what I have written, the movie seems a bit cliché'd, and certain parts may be, but the movie itself is nothing but a cliché. It is a great story that is more about the boxer than boxing. While I was expecting somewhat of a female Rocky, it became something quite different. If you are expecting another Girl Fight, Honeybee, etc., look someplace else because you will get well more than expected here.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank plays the boxer very convincingly. She obviously went through an immense amount of training to ready herself for this role and I have to say, she nailed it. Not only does she show us what she has in the ring, she shows us she can act with the best of them.<br/><br/>I like to compare Clint Eastwood to John Wayne. Not just here but in almost every movie. They are similar because they always play the same roles. Some people may hate me for saying this, but this is the first Eastwood film that I really liked. Blood Work was all right, but this movie is much better. I give him kudos for his director and producing talents here. Anyone can act the same part for 50 years and get it right. I don't mean this as an insult, but just so you know not to expect anything new from him.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman plays Eddie Dupris, a former boxer who is narrating the story. He also seems to be a mediator between Frankie (Eastwood) and Maggie, at least until Frankie accepts her.<br/><br/>Add Danger (Jay Baruchel) for comic relief as the semi-retarded wannabe boxer and you have a nice little movie.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is an outstanding movie which I can compare to American Beauty in 1999. I went into both without expectations and left knowing that I had seen something great and simply put, brilliant. 10/10"

","I see more than 100 movies a year in the theaters, and with all the over-hype of this, I expected something truly great. Well, if you read through all these reviews, it'll explain the plot, so I won't waste time and re-do it, but I will say this...this film is a major disappointment. Considering Eastwood's last, great film, Mystic River, I expected something in that caliber. There is nothing in this film that holds up to Mystic. No, this film is not a complete loss, it does have good moments, but no great, or significant moments. It's all huff and bluff, but nothing more. The performances are fine, but not spectacular. And the script has to be one of the poorest scripts of a major film this year. It is juvenile and amateurish and far from the caliber Eastwood should be working with. It takes from classic great films like ""Raging Bull"" and ""Shawshank' to name a few, but adds nothing to them and can't even match the brilliance of either of those truly classic films. Eastwood should have known better, but this is obviously a director out of his league and not fully comprehending what he wanted to do or say. When the narration fails under the weight of the great Morgan Freeman, you know you are in trouble. Swank does well, but her role is not terribly complex. I think back to the great Imelda Staunton, in 2004's Best Film ""Vera Drake"" .Now that was great acting!! And a truly great film. This film will receive a lot of Oscar noms and probably win some, but it's a sad commentary when a film like this is so over-rated and people seem to buy into it. Roger Ebert called this, the best film of the year, but he, like so many others, seem to be star struck and not really paying close attention to details, script, plotting or what is on the screen. I liked this film, well enough, don't mis-understand me. I'd give it a ""B"" on a scale from A-F. But ""B"" is hardly what I expect from Eastwood, and far from what I expected reading all these over-praising reviews. I have the real sense that many viewers, who listen to the hype, will leave the theater sad, disappointed, and wondering what all the chatter was all about. So do I."

Just some deep feelings these fine actors, with this little story, brought out of some deep place inside me.<br/><br/>I stayed away from reviews and talk of this film so I did not know what was going to happen. Boy was I surprised by the ending segment; taken back at first and then wasn't quite sure where we were going in the last scenes. Surely she was going to fight her way back? When I saw what was going to happen, I initially rejected that outcome. Then, after awhile, I understood that this was the place this movie was going to all along, and it became something so much more than what it started out to be.<br/><br/>There are some movies that really touch the heart.

While not in any way a ""female Rocky"" (who'd wanna see that anyway?, and not a feel good popcorn flick, it's beautifully written, cleverly but simply directed and acted with true passion. To be a good boxing movie is tough, no sport has had more movies made about it, yet Million Dollar Baby succeeds with aplomb. Hilary Swanks portrayal of Maggie is full of joy and love for life, despite hardship, and this contrasts nicely with Eastwoods Frankie, yet ultimately he seems to find some joy in his relationship with Maggie. While not likely to make you smile all the way through, if you don't find yourself smiling a few hours after you leave, you may not have really understood the film, which is ultimately about what all good movies are about, the indomitability of the human spirit, despite the ending. A film about people far, far more than about boxing, this is what makes it so worthy of acknowledgement by the Academy, and by yourselves. Enjoy!"

","Even though there are pages upon pages of comments, I just had to leave one myself because I didn't care much for this movie.

Instead, it just drones on (monotone voice-over included!) and there are too many elements of the real, i.e. non-victorious ending, that it just got incredibly BORING for me.

"dhaufrect-1","10","5","9","1 February 2005"," ""Million Dollar Baby"" is A Compelling Daram
","""Million Dollar Baby"" is a very compelling drama. Clint Eastwood has directed a very controversial masterpiece. He portrays the retired boxer and now trainer, Frankie Dunn. He has not seen his estranged daughter, Katie, in years. He persists in writing to her weekly, but he never receives a response. He is associated with Morgan Freeman's character, Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris, also retired and suffering from the loss of his right eye from an earlier fight. The real star of this picture is Hilary Swank who gives a very believable performance of a moderately young female boxer to be. She aches to be trained by Eastwood's character, and finally earns the right to do so. The emotional and complex ending is too overwhelming to describe in this brief epistle, and one should not spoil it for the viewing public. Suffice it to say that you should bring your box of tissue, and chew on the meat of this drama for a long time after it is ended on the screen. It deserves as many thumbs up as it can get."

","I saw this film last night on Sunday January 30th 2005 and I still am depressed and devastated. I was filled with rage and sadness when the end credits started appearing. I think that alone speaks for the excellence and brilliance of the makers of this film including the writers, and the director, and the actors, so I will not spend any more time offering cliché praising comments. But I will ask one question; why? Why would Clint Eastwood make a film like this that in my opinion can beat any other tragedy ever made in history in making my heart ache? Maybe my reaction is a little too much because I am a huge fan of Hilary Swank, well all right I might even be in love with her... But, I felt the same way when I saw Mystic River and there certainly was no one in that film with whom I would say I might be in love. When I remembered Mystic River, things started making sense a little... In films like The Unforgiven, Mystic River, and Million Dollar Baby Clint Eastwood is making films that are the antithesis of standard Hollywood movie making. I certainly understand and immensely respect that! I want so much for such films to be made, because I am tired of Hollywood making the same teen movies over and over and over and it's getting ever harder to even find films to watch in a theater... But I still ask, was it still necessary to make Million Dollar Baby so intensely heartbreaking?"

","No doubt in my mind... I am an actor and have seen pretty much all of the greats. I looked down the list of IMDb's greatest 250 movies and I've seen about 80 percent of them. There is not doubt anywhere in my body that this is the greatest movie of all time. Clint Eastwood's direction, paired with his excellent acting, not to mention the amazing performances by Hillary Swank and Morgan Freeman make it a clear choice. Eastwood's use of light in this film creates a unique environment that allows us to see the characters how he wanted us to see them. Freeman's narration is very similar to that of his role in ""Shawshank"" and I think he was a perfect casting choice. People who disliked this movie don't understand what makes a movie great and should just stop going to the movies. Your opinion isn't worth while if you can't see the genius of this film."
"cocoshell","9","5","9","9 January 2005"," One of the year's best
","Clint Eastwood just won't give up. Like good wine, the older - the better, Clint just keeps delivering unforgettable moments to movie lovers willing to grasp his world of human heart. ""Million dollar baby"" is not a movie for everyone. Many people will see it just because the trailer looks like one of the sequels in ""Rocky"" franchise, the only difference for boxer being a girl. How wrong. The first half of this masterpiece gives us a graceful insight into the lives of our heroes, all carrying some sort of emotional/physical wounds. Just when you think the movie is slipping into cliché' territory of Mr. Eastwood makes a U-Turn and the next moment you're embarrassed for even coming up with the thought. Pure and simple this is a film about friendship, redemption, value of life, perseverance and above all love. Love in this film is stronger than religion, stronger than life itself, stronger than all the secular things. Eastwood shows us that love is God, however cruel his works may seem. Performances are pure brilliance : Hilary Swank shows once more that she is probably the greatest actress of younger generation. If there is justice, she will bag another Oscar. Eastwood adds such a depth to the thick-skinned but fragile Frankie Dunn that I cant't see anyone else doing it better. Morgan Freeman is exquisite as well. His soothing voice as a narrator and a mere glance at his face blows you away. For anyone who's looking for moving emotion in a movie and not just 2 hours of popcorn fun, this is a gem not to be missed. Back to back with ""Mar adentro"", ""Million dollar baby"" is the best movie of 2004!!!"
"DeLaSoul","10","5","9","9 January 2005"," Amazing piece of cinema
","Million Dollar Baby is a magnificent piece of cinema. It's as simple as that, really. It came very close to eclipsing Sideways as my choice for #1 film of the year, but I thought it had a few very slight flaws that prevented that from happening. Baby is one of those movies that (literally, in this particular case) seems to punch you in the gut. Clint Eastwood's last picture, the also magnificent Mystic River, left me with the same powerful, haunted feeling that this film does. I'm still reflecting and contemplating ideals of the movie despite it ending an hour ago. A lion's share of Million Dollar Baby's success must go to lead actress Hilary Swank, who completely immerses herself in the role and gives the best acting by a lead actress this year. Clint Eastwood himself is also very strong, and Morgan Freeman gives the movie his usual dose of quiet dignity. The one thing in Million Dollar Baby that I could've perhaps done without is the portrayal of a mentally retarded wannabe boxer played by Jay Baruchel, who comes off as perhaps too cartoonish. However, it's only a small section of the film. Baby takes an unexpected twist in its final 1/4, and it's easily one of the most emotional and truly sincere sections of a film in a very long time. Very highly recommended."

","Usually there is so much hoopla surrounding films that come at the end of the year, and 80% of them are disappointing when they finally screen. Some of them flying by in colorful shells with technical wizardry but little emotion. Others manage to touch the soul and teach us how to confront the wonderful mystery of life. Eastwood has put together a sensitive study of damaged souls and hope. He gives an opportunity to appreciate life and not to give up in the pursuit of our of dreams.<br/><br/>Eastwood, Swank, and the always wonderful Freeman move effortlessly and interact with each other with fantastic precision and grace. It is hard not to think of them as fantastic performers and give them their much deserved dues. In an era when people are so fascinated with quick flashes and light analysis of important material, comes a small film that envelops and doesn't let you go. In my second viewing I felt I discovered more of its richness and grew to appreciate it even more. I truly hope that when Academy Awards (which supposedly honor the most accomplished work of the year), the acting, direction, and every other aspect of this film is recognized accordingly. There has been other phenomenal work out this year, most in small films. Don't let this be a make up year or a year that will eventually be recognized by ""should have been"" remarks.

More so when Eastwood, Swank and Freeman deliver some of the best performances of their career. <br/><br/>Clint Eastwood will be remembered for two things: As an actor, the ultimate tough guy.

"xy78ooolbop","1","14","35","20 January 2005"," Clint still hates the disabled
","This film leaves out many important facts about disability: 1. It is a the law that a person on a ventilator can ask the staff to give them sedatives and pull the vent. The courts have upheld this. There was no reason Clint had to sneak in himself and give her a stimulant.<br/><br/>2. She should have not received such poor care. Her deterioration is not standard and only due to incredibly bad service of the fictional facility in this film.<br/><br/>3. Clint Eastwood went in front of congress trying to weaken the Americans with Disabilities Act in 2000. He did so in revenge for being sued under CA law (not ADA law) for failures of accessibility of one of his resorts. Regardless of his being in the right or wrong in that case he decided to take his suffering to congress. Congress told him to go home and this film only proves his continued hatred of the disabled.<br/><br/>4. I am disabled myself: I understand suicidal thoughts and pain but I stay alive because people love me and want me to do so. Everyday it gets easier to live. But everyday 90% of the places I go are not handicap accessible. Maybe if Clint Eastwood had a handicap himself or knew physical pain for real he would have rethought this movie."
"VernonDozier","1","6","12","24 September 2005"," Vastly overrated celebration of dysfunction and despair
","I just saw this movie and am utterly flabbergasted at the number and intensity of positive reviews for this nihilistic garbage. From a technical standpoint, the movie is rarely better than mediocre. Yes, Hilary Swank's acting is fine as far as it goes, but very little is demanded of the role. Her character is basically a cliché. Clint Eastwood is, as usual, Clint Eastwood (imagine a geriatric sad-sack version of Dirty Harry or nearly any other Eastwood character, and there you have him in this film), and Morgan Freeman adds little other than an unnecessary voice-over. The first act is both unrelentingly dull and unimaginative. It strives to come off as some sort of gritty, realistic slice of life, but with nothing but stock characters and dialog, it is doomed from the start. Underlying the film from virtually the first frame is a pervasive mood of despair, emphasizing Clint's estrangement from his daughter and concomitant pangs of guilt, as well as his repeated missed opportunities at making it big.<br/><br/>The second act, where Swank's character rises in the ranks as a boxer, is mostly entertaining, but is marred by the introduction to the audience of her family -- the most cartoonish gaggle of white trash put to celluloid in recent memory. Mind you, stereotypes don't necessarily offend me because they are unfair, but because they show absolutely zero imagination. And when their sole purpose is, as here, to manipulate, I resent the filmmakers' assumption that the audience is too stupid to get their point without being smacked over the head with such a blunt dramatic instrument.<br/><br/>The third act is a ramping-up of, and a capitulation to, the despair that already underlay the film from the first. In case you haven't seen it or heard about it, I won't give away the details (although I don't know why I shouldn't, since I don't recommend the movie anyway), but it is an incredible downer. The film first teases the audience that there may be some redemption in the offing: Clint basically finds a new daughter in Hilary to replace the real daughter he has irretrievably lost, and Hilary finds a new father in Clint to replace her deceased father -- the only member of her family who was worth a da*n, apparently. But the hint of a happy ending to come is just another manipulation, and comes off like Lucy pulling a football away from Charlie Brown -- a cheap trick. I have no problem with a tragic story as such, but there should be either some element of heroism or a moral lesson to wash it down. This has neither. All it offers is a surrender to helplessness and a descent into wretchedness. To the extent that the filmmakers were aiming at bittersweet, all they hit was the bitter. They might want to take a gander at the immeasurably superior Finding Neverland to see how to do it right."
"Rogue-32","10","6","12","29 January 2005"," Winners are simply willing to do what losers won't
","The above maxim is from a poster in the film's boxing gym, and its presence very cleverly and subtly pertains deeply to what transpires in this movie.<br/><br/>Eastwood gets everything right in this one, beginning with Morgan Freeman's eloquent (but yet never overwrought) voice being utilized as the narrative - this in itself is transcendent, immediately elevating the film to mythic heights. And Hilary Swank's Maggie - there are no words to describe what she manages to achieve in this performance, no words could ever begin to do justice to the depths of what she makes us feel. And Eastwood's turn as Frankie is equally brilliant, coming from a place of true, pure and deep understanding of the human condition and all the dark ramifications that implies.<br/><br/>The best thing about the film - and another one of the things that elevates it to mythic status - is how there is not one minute detail that doesn't belong; there is nothing on screen that doesn't contribute completely and utterly to the film's power - the amusing banter, for example, is not there to simply kill time or to create comic relief but rather it is intrinsic to the characters, to show their almost-unrelenting heart in the face of monumental adversity. Eastwood has matured magnificently as a director, he has made me a believer after all these years; I could not get home faster to get to IMDb and give this staggeringly heartfelt masterpiece a TEN."
"jayasian","9","4","7","8 October 2007"," Superb Film and Raw Acting
","One of the best films I have seen. It is not just a story depicting boxing as a sport but the story behind people's anguish in life behind the sport.<br/><br/>I have always watched the movies of Hilary Swank and unsurprisingly, she always gives an excellent raw acting that no Hollywood actress can emulate. She really deserved to be the runaway winner of different award giving bodies.<br/><br/>For Clint Eastwood, he is really good in directing movies with a surprise ending. He is really a good director and approach his films as raw(real) as possible. As far as I can recall, when he directs films, the actors that are involved has been given citations for their acting. Morgan Freeman has been consistently excellent in his movies and particularly to this film.<br/><br/>Very touching movie and a bit intellectual. I think most of the insensitive people would get bored to this movie."

","I absolutely hate boxing - I find it to be a truly inhumane sport (it's not even a sport; it's people inflicting maximum pain and damage on each other), and I always saw Hilary Swank as just a pair of silicone implants and a horsey smile. But I AM a sucker for films in which the characters (reluctantly) team up to accomplish a goal, whether it is a heist or winning a boxing title.<br/><br/>Combine this with the heartwarming, mandatory Morgan Freeman narrative of the film and I have endless affection for it. Well, not endless perhaps - but it is a well-crafted quality drama with superb acting performances and exciting boxing games. Clint Eastwood as grumpy veteran boxing trainer who reluctantly takes on Maggie (Hilary Swank) has got to be one of the most likable characters in film. There is also quite a bit of humour in the first half of the film when he begins coaching her. I love it how he is never disturbed by Maggie's stubbornness, just sort of exasperated. <br/><br/>The film delicately sees these two personalities juxtaposed with each other to overcome initial difficulties and in the end, develop a strong father-and-daughter like bond. It sounds corny, but it translates very well on screen and I do not remember the last time I was as engrossed in a character's struggle as I was with Maggie's, which tells me Million Dollar Baby is doing something right. Very right.<br/><br/>When Paul Haggis' (of the horrorshow Crash) name popped up in the end credits as screenwriter, I was quite stunned but it made sense later on - because the writing of Million Dollar Baby is very explicit and spelled-out for audiences. That said, it is not as bad as Crash. Had I known Haggis had written it, I probably would have avoided it for a while longer in fear of being met by a blinking sign over a character's head that says ""THIS PERSON IS SAD"" .<br/><br/>As far as sport-themed films go, Million Dollar Baby is a grand accomplishment that projects so much heart that I must have cried nearly all the way through the second half. <br/><br/>8/10"

","Forget your personal taste for a particular type of film. Forget about all the films you thought was great in the past few years. Clint Eastwood, at his age as a master director now, shows what the simplicity of storytelling can be without all the bells-and-whistles of today's films, filled with all sorts of boring twists and uninteresting characters.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is the newest blueprint to simple, cinematic storytelling done at it's best.<br/><br/>Paul Haggis' script should be the newest example of ""How to write great stories for the big screen?"" It should be issued in film schools across the world, showing these wannabes how it is done. It should be used as a source of inspiration for studio execs looking for that next project that would help them keep their jobs. He told enough on the character's journeys without giving us too much information. He never tried to spoon feed us with the answers to all of our questions by explaining. I'm glad we never knew what exactly was the problem between Frankie (Clint Eastwood) and his daughter. Haggis forces the viewers to take as much as we needed to join in on this extraordinary journey. He had shown us how to use narration without using narration.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood's directing was superb. He was able to capture crucial and emotional moments that didn't lessen the quality of the writing. He was able to help his cast deliver excellent performances depicting simple characters that seem to be ""the unwanted."" He also didn't take away from the cinematic experience with fancy camera angles and MTV style editing. He would have a master shot that can hold on a moment as long as possible, and with the help of the great performances, the beautifully choreographed masters work without boring us. He didn't drown out the moments with predictable, cliché music scoring as well, contributing to the beautiful music that expressed the power of this simple story without feeling out of place.<br/><br/>Hillary Swank's best performance ever. I enjoyed her more in this movie than the last film she had done that won her her first Oscar. She was empathetic without being sympathetic. She was real. Her ability to be tough and sometimes ruthless, merciless, was seen in her boxing matches with opponents. Maggie's love never felt false.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman's well deserved Oscar performance. It's about time. He was subtle and realistic. He didn't try to provoke anything from anyone, especially the audience. Scrap was one of those characters that believed in the best in all of us and was humbled enough by his own life experiences to help us find that potential in ourselves, encouraging us to use it as a survival tool. He only added to this ensemble cast.<br/><br/>And, in my humble opinion, this is Clint Eastwood's best performance ever, which is hard to say looking back on his long career.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away too much of the film. I advise all filmmakers and audiences alike to go and experience the best film of 2004, Million Dollar Baby. This is what film story telling is all about. 10/10 - A+"

When he breaks out of this mould, you get Firefox, The Rookie and Space Cowboys.<br/><br/>M$B teams spunky hick chick wannabe-boxer Maggie with grouchy mentor Frank, puts them on the road to success and then runs them off it in an extremely tragic manner. Imagine Rocky with breasts but no sequels.<br/><br/>Clint combines power with light-footedness in the gym and in the ring, but some of the dramatic scenes suffer from screenwriter Paul Haggis's leaden, hackneyed dialogue which clumsily telegraphs each of the tragic events to come. But the actors, and Swank in particular, deliver it faultlessly.<br/><br/>This is a movie about taking your chance when it comes, living for the moment and having faith in people, not religion (tellingly, the only 'f' word in the film is uttered by a priest). It is a thought-provoking and captivating film of unquestionable quality, but the idea of the working class girl with a boxing dream was realised recently, and perfectly adequately, in Girlfight.

"bassoonchef","10","4","7","20 February 2005"," There are no words....
","There are no words to describe my feelings about this film. From acting, storyline, dialogue, and character development, Million Dollar Baby is, simply put, unmatchable.<br/><br/>To begin with, the acting. Hilary Swank gives the single best performance of her career, even surpassing her last great turn in Boys Don't Cry. Taking a controversial character doing highly controversial things and making the viewer believe truly and wholly in what that character is doing is a task not easily accomplished. This performance is marked by simplicity and courage far out of the range out almost any other actor or actress working in Hollywood today. Clint Eastwood pulls a double-whammy here with not only the best film he has ever directed but also the best performance of his career. The rest have nothing on this film. His portrayal of a boxing coach with dark secrets has the viewer crying without even knowing why they are crying. Yearning so badly to know what his relationship with his daughter is but knowing that his character wouldn't even want the viewer to know is what makes his turn as the boxing coach so real and touching. Morgan Freeman also gives his best performance in a long time, possibly since The Shawshank Redemption. His character is more simple as far as the story goes, but is also the driving factor in the film. His performance, also, is one marked by subtlety. All three of these actors should see Oscar gold but one, Hilary Swank, will win without a doubt.<br/><br/>The visual aspect of the film is dark and gray, almost black and white at times, setting the mood expertly in what does not seem to be, but ultimately is a very dark movie.<br/><br/>Finally, the twist. Movies have certain rights. They can twist reality, accent reality, and portray reality. If a movie offends, that is OK because that is what it is allowed to do. Million Dollar Baby may offend some but for others it is not about whether you agree or disagree, it is about that character at that time. Maggie, having lost her ability to move from the waist down and a leg, makes the decision that she wants to end her life. If she were capable enough, she would do it herself but because she is not she recruits the help of Clint Eastwood's character. Some may agree with this decision, as I do, and others may be vehemently opposed. That is the right of the filmmaker.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood and the fantastic script make for what is, ultimately, one of the best movies ever to make it out of a studio. 10/10"
"jakaswan","9","4","7","20 February 2005"," not so dark
","Million Dollar Baby is a wonderfully complex morality tale. The crux of the movie is Scrap-Iron's reminder to a despondent Frankie that, unlike most folks, Maggie had her shot, thanks to Frankie, and took it. She's a noble figure, as are Frankie Dunn and Scrap-Iron Dupris, and Million Dollar Baby is a great movie. Frankie Dunn reminds me of Dr. Larch in Cider House Rules, a moral man in an immoral world. Though I do not believe in assisted suicide or abortion, I cannot fault either Frankie Dunn or Dr. Larch; because I do not know what I would do in their circumstances. Isn't that the point of drama -- to create a reality that questions our comfortable assumptions about life? A friend of mine screened this movie and decided it would not be appropriate for kids because it was too ""disturbing.""

","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs <br/><br/>Hard-faced,hard-bitten boxing trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is a man battling his own inner-demons and is not at a time in his life where he wants to go against the routine that he has settled into.So when trailer-trash waitress Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) wonders into his gym one day,eager to become a female boxer (which Frank has never trained before!) he is understandably disconcerted.However,with some gentle persuasion from his only true friend and former boxing champion Eddie 'Scrap-Iron' Dupris (Morgan Freeman) and Maggie's consistent determination,he gradually becomes less stuck-in-his-ways and heralds Maggie to championship level,and to the triumpths and tragedies that follow...<br/><br/>As is noted in the trivia section,this is no less than Clint's 25th film as director,his 57th film as an actor and his 21st film as a producer.There can be no question that this is a man truly deserving of his lifetime achievement award.It is truly remarkable that,even at the age of 74,Clint's name can still garner a cinema release (even a limited one,as in the case of films like Blood Work and True Crime) as opposed to having slipped into a life of DTV mediocrity.Yet it is also his style that keeps his films distinguished and apart from any other films of this day.In other words,you know an Eastwood film when you see one.This,like a fair few of his previous efforts,is a mature,slow,considerate film that the 2-Fast-2-Furious generation are unlikely to have the patience and attention span to sit through.As a previous reviewer noted,Clint refuses to 'dumb-his-films-down' and cut corners in any way...<br/><br/>While you have to admire his longitivity,the fact remains that Eastwood has never been a great emotional actor.There's a scene near the end where he appears to be trying to cry that comes off as terribly unconvincing.Yet he's as great as the grizzled,hard-faced tough guy act as he's ever been,and,even at 74,there were certain scenes where his physical appearance really scared me and made me think I still wouldn't want to mess with him in real life.I suppose the same could be said of his co-star Freeman,but,like Eastwood,he does his thing and provides an engaging narrative voice-over throughout the film.Yet the real star of the show and the deserved Oscar winner is Swank,very good as the feisty,determined,give-it-all-she's-got-girl knowing she can't fail or else succumb to a life of further mediocrity.<br/><br/>What will further distance the film from a large proportion of the modern day audience is it's heavy,hard-hitting (forgive the pun!) scenes.It's got a 12A certificate,yet it's doubtful a lot of people that age will have the maturity,or,ridiculous as it seems,even mental responsibility to handle it.It's a gentle,easy-flowing film that shows Eastwood's maturity as a film-maker and star and,in this day and age,is distinctly,discernably Eastwood.*****"

","If there was a Clint Eastwood film that proves how great of a director and actor he is at the same time, this movie is it. This movie really extends his acting chops. It's one of his best performances in the likes of ""Unforgiven "" and the under looked ""Honky Tonk Man"". Hilary Swank was impressive as the leading lady. As always, Morgan Freeman was excellent. There was fine support, especially from Jay Baruchel, who has really grown since ""Undeclared"". What also makes this movie is the great story line. As the movie develops, you realize that Eastwood and Swank develop a non sexual relationship, in a way as father and daughter do. The movie ends in tragedy, but that just makes the movie better for me. This is the best picture of 2004, and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time."

Not for cheap thrills and popcorn, but for a story to be told and folks you care about.<br/><br/>""Million Dollar Baby"" seemed to come from no where - maybe because it didn't have a lot of slick marketing dollars during Decemeber, or hordes of teenagers to sit in the seats to make it #1 several weeks in a row...or ""ooh"" and ""ahhh"" over special effects.

Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Hillary Swank all deserve every accolade they have been named to or receive.<br/><br/>The great thing about this film is that not many came out like this - which is what makes it so outstanding.

"joemystery2004","Null","4","7","14 February 2005"," The best film in a year of wonderful films.
","Million Dollar Baby is the best picture of the year through and through. After taking the history of motion pictures last semester, I somehow decided that I was going to reject the mannered style of classical Hollywood cinema such as Howard Hawkes and Frank Capra, where style and montage are subordinate to narrative. Despite this, I couldn't stop myself from falling in love with this film from the first frame until the last. Clint Eastwood has an eye for film-making and directing that is worthy of all accolades, including the Oscars. If there is any justice, Clint will walk away with his second best director trophy, well deserved over Martin Scorsese (who also directed a good film. Just not as good, and noticeably not as good.) Million Dollar Baby follows the rise of underdog boxer Maggie Fitzgerald, in a flawless performance by Hilary Swank who has proved that her turn in 1999's Boys Don't Cry wasn't a fluke. She too will take home her second Oscar, also well deserved over her ""overdue"" competition who will remain nameless. Maggie is too old to start training, too inexperienced to fight and too dumb to realize it. The film centers around her relationship with hardened fighter-turned-trainer, Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) who approaches her with steadfast reluctance that believably morphs into a paternal love that words can hardly describe. Eastwood too gives a wonderful performance as Maggie's trainer/surrogate father whose troubled relationship with his own daughter leaves a void that Maggie fills with her unwavering loyalty.<br/><br/>Possibly even more wonderful than Eastwood and Swank is the film's narrator, Scrap played by the ever-lauded, yet still Oscar-less Morgan Freeman. His performance is on-point, consistent and almost effortless, as he narrates this tale with haunting grace. If this performance doesn't garner Freeman an Oscar, then there truly is no justice in the academy.<br/><br/>To say that this film switches gears some two-thirds of the way through is redundant and pointless at this point, considering the press the film has received. I won't specifically divulge what that twist is because it isn't my place. Yes, this movie is at its heart, about far more than just boxing. The fact that this movie is getting some bad press from right-wing media, wasn't the most Oscar nominated film (Scorsese's the Aviator got the most noms) and lost the Producer's Guild award will logically keep Million Dollar Baby from stealing the best picture trophy from the Aviator. However, like Hilary Swank's Maggie, I believe that Million Dollar Baby, with the odds stacked against it, will rise above all obstacles and take home Oscars for best picture, director, actress and supporting actor. Clint has truly pushed himself to earn his best director and best picture trophies this time around. While it would be great to see Scorsese finally take home an Oscar (it's a travesty that he doesn't have one by now), the general consensus is that it's Clint who deserves it and I'd be loath to disagree."
"FilmSnobby","9","4","7","14 February 2005"," He doesn't train girls.
","Let's dispense with the plot synopsis -- IMDb thoughtfully provides one for you. Instead, let's immediately assert that Clint Eastwood is a film master, and his latest, *Million Dollar Baby* (shot in 36 days!), is a masterpiece. I would not have thought it possible for him to follow up *Mystic River* -- perhaps the greatest American movie in a decade -- with another astonishing film, but he has done it. How? one wonders. The man's ongoing mastery is almost dismaying, in the same way that Michelangelo's incessant masterpieces must've disheartened artists who were 60 years younger than himself.<br/><br/>Eastwood is indeed the Michelangelo of today's art, cinema. Young filmmakers 50 or so years younger than Eastwood may want to take note of how the director shapes the script he's given, how he incrementally builds a narrative, how he excises wasted scenes while at the same time keeping things moving along at a leisurely pace, how he introduces developments within his characters whenever the plot demands a new angle on their behavior, how he maintains a consistent visual tone that matches the story's theme, how he includes revealing details that pay off later, how he mingles his tragedy with a sprinkle of wit here and there, and how he can produce a hard-earned emotional impact out of the most standardized narrative material. Watch and learn, kids. Then watch again.<br/><br/>(Vague spoiler follows) If you're feel secure in your dogmas -- religious, philosophical, or otherwise -- then *Million Dollar Baby* is bound to be an upsetting experience for you. The most devastating, artistically sublime scene in the film occurs when Clint's Frankie confronts his priest (who has had to put up with Frankie's annoying theological quizzes each week at Mass) about the circumstances of his beloved boxing protégé, Maggie. Frankie is, for once, seeking real answers: should he fulfill her request or not? What are the moral implications? The priest, horrified at Frankie's raw pain, can only mouth Church dogma before scuttling out of the camera's frame, far away from the unanswerable darkness sitting beside him. The movie has ensured that the priest's answers -- that is to say, moral generalities -- are meaningless within an individual context. THIS is the heart of what the film is about, and it is apparently not sitting well with some of our ideologues. Rush Limbaugh and Michael Medved are rightfully terrified of this movie's message, which is that life's dilemmas usually cannot be easily answered by either Fox News or your local Sunday service. Know-it-alls and other ""morality"" types are advised to stay far away from this movie. Because, you see, Frankie doesn't train girls . . . and Eastwood doesn't make movies for girls, either. He makes movies for women. And men. In other words, he makes movies for adults.<br/><br/>9 stars out of 10."
"Keith-35","10","4","7","13 February 2005"," Well worth watching
","Million Dollar Baby is of the classical zero to hero format, but with a difference. Clint Eastwood's character is the typical ageing hero that we came to know in Unforgiven. Morgan Freeman's is also similar, the voice of reason and the only one old enough and experienced enough to make an impact.<br/><br/>All credit to Clint Eastwood and his evident clout in the business to be allowed to pull of a movie that did not have your typical happy Hollywood ending that has ruined so many otherwise excellent movies.<br/><br/>As a result, watching this movie is time well spent. The movie lingers on in my thoughts and it's not easy to forget the dilemma posed.<br/><br/>More impressive however, is the real life achievements of Lucia Rijker. It's a pity that with all that behind her, she had to settle for playing the bad guy."
"gtzam","Null","4","7","10 February 2005"," Unmissable
","There is more than meets the eye, however ample this initially may be, in Clint Eastwood's astounding film. It is more than a gripping and brilliantly performed drama of the rise and tragic fall of a female boxer who is taking her last chance for success in life.<br/><br/>The film is a perceptive portrait of social outcasts who, having failed for a variety of reasons to integrate into the society , try to survive in their own enclaved world. Frankie Dunn's (Clint Eastwood) gym is the focal point of this world, a place so untouched by time that seems outlandish. A place that harbours past dreamers who landed abruptly (Morgan Freeman) as well as those who like Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) want to put all their efforts for one last chance of success. For Maggie, unlike her predecessor who dumped once and for all the place and his mentor when he got his chance for the title, success does not necessary translate onto money, but it is more a form of recognition, acceptance and self-esteem or even survival, at least in her own mind. She is sneered and scorned by her family despite her generous efforts of proving her worth and showing her affection. Her actual family lies in the gym and her relationship with Dunn, who is estranged from his family and cannot find solace in the established institutions (Church), becomes blood relationship as time goes by.<br/><br/>Boxing is treated in the movie in a matter of fact way - a last refuge for the underdogs and a savage route for survival in a savage world. Boxing itself is indeed peripheral to the movie's central core which is mainly concerned with how relationships evolve (or not) in that isolated world rather than victories.<br/><br/>The story is told, unsurprisingly being a Clint Eastwood film, in a deceptively simple but extremely subtle and effective way. There are no high-pitched hammered out scenes to extract emotions from the viewer despite the fact that there were plenty of opportunities in the storyline. Clint Eastwood's directing style can be compared to going from one point to another from the shortest possible way, a method that allows him to go straight in the heart of the matter by separating the wheat from the chaff in order to achieve a genuine degree of representation. A ""Million Dollar Baby"" represents movie classicism at its perfection."

","After seeing M$B I can say this is more than just a boxing movie. Hilary Swank, who won a Best Actress Oscar five years ago in ""Boys Don't Cry"" plays a woman named Maggie who at age 30 wants to be more than just a waitress and takes up boxing. Thats where she meets Frank played by Clint Eastwood who owns a boxing gym. She also meets Frank's longtime friend/partner ""Scrap"" played by respected actor Morgan Freeman who works at the gym. In one of the more touching moments in the film, Maggie offers to walk Scrap home at closing time, Scrap stops and turns his head to tell Maggie he is home as he lives at the gym in a room not much bigger than a closet. Watch Hilary Swank's marvelous performance as she is odds on favorite to capture her second Oscar for Best Actress! I recommend this movie."

","I have never loved Clint Eastwood more than I do after seeing this film. Frankie Dunn is a beautiful character, played with grace and insight by Eastwood. I positively fell in love with his character through the movie. Hillary Swank glides in and out of the film. Her acting sneaks up on you, and before you know it, you are in awe of her. Morgan Freeman is stunning. I felt that this was his best part since The Shawshank Redemption. The entire cast is phenomenal.<br/><br/>The fact that Eastwood not only starred in the film, but produced it, directed it, and composed the music for it blows my mind. There were so many subtle moments where I savored every second as it was unfolding. This film was truly a work of art. Pay attention to the lighting. Every flicker of pain and intensity in Eastwood's clear blue eyes is accented by the lighting. Every grimace, every line on his face speaks to his character. The story simply cannot be done justice with words. My vote for Best Picture of 2004 goes to Million Dollar Baby."

","By all counts, this was an EXCELLENT movie. Talent, realism, the flow of the plot. Just when it looked like Maggie was going to ""have it all"", the lights suddenly go out (literally) when the opponent takes an illegal swing. Poor Maggie goes from independent/ambitious to dependent/helpless. Although, the tongue-biting routine reinforces that Maggie actually has NOT lost her will to accomplish what SHE wants. The character of Frankie is already at odds with his(?)God, so now the dilemma of whether or not to grant Maggie's final request. It was real; it was difficult; it was controversial. In the end, Frankie acted in the best interest of Maggie. Isn't that what assisted suicide is all about? Given the same set of circumstances, I would do the same as Frankie. Dr. Kevorkian is a HERO. Someday I hope he is recognized as a pioneer of ""what's right""."

"Pavel-8","9","4","7","2 February 2005"," Oh Baby what a film!
","""Million Dollar Baby"" is a film about fighting, both physical and otherwise, that traces the story of three diverse yet connected characters. Eastwood, who also directs, stars as Frankie, an aged boxing trainer and gym owner. Morgan Freeman, who narrates the film, plays his right hand man and friend, Scrap. And Hilary Swank joins in as Maggie, a young lady eager to learn the sport. Expectedly the story follows Maggie's boxing journey, and perhaps more importantly, Frankie's relationships with Scrap, Maggie, and an unseen daughter, as they each deal with the powerful themes of loyalty, forgiveness, and love.<br/><br/>Watching ""Million Dollar Baby"" is ridiculously enjoyable for a drama, the cinematic equivalent of cruising the spectacular Pacific Coast Highway with the wind whipping through your hair. The pace is steady and deliberate, like much of Eastwood's directorial work, but far from slow. And the scenery...oh, the scenery. Eastwood and Freeman, in roles similar to the screen image that each has cultivated over the years, are simply magnificent. How many actors can enrapture an audience with a discussion of socks? Or bleach? With their commanding presences, easy dialogue, and evident listening capacities, the pair presents a clinic in portraying old friends. Impressively, Swank fits right in with the two veterans. Sporting an impish smile and dogged determination, she expresses a proud humility that remains strong while reflecting her character's rough background. The ability to see great actors working brilliantly with great material is why many people go to the movies, and all three stars are worth the price of admission to observe, fully worthy of their Oscar nominations, as their interactions result in a picture that remains fully engaging without zooming from scene to scene.<br/><br/>The beautiful simplicity of everything is captivating as well. Much like last year's ""Mystic River"", Eastwood's ever steady hand guides the entire picture. The cinematography of Tom Stern (""River"") is striking but not overwhelming, framing images perfectly and using slow movements to enhance the drama. His muted color scheme of blues, grays, and greens creates and matches the mood, and makes the occasional flashes of color all the more vibrant.<br/><br/>Also like ""River"", ""Baby"" is accompanied by Eastwood's own simple yet elegant theme, on both classical guitar and piano, which accentuates the powerful emotion of the film. Baby lacks the palpable emotion of River, replacing it instead with drama that bubbles beneath the veneer of the boxing theme, and springs to life during the quiet in-between scenes that make the film great. On the sports movie spectrum, ""Baby"" sits somewhere between the pure sporting nature of ""Rocky"" and the sports-tinged drama of ""Raging Bull"". The boxing storyline is not unfamiliar, but the high technical value makes it seem fresh and original.<br/><br/>Just when the course of the story seems apparent, in the final half hour the road of ""Baby"" takes a dramatic hairpin turn, as the tone is drastically altered, nearly sending the audience into the ditch. The change throws the car out of alignment and disrupts the ride, but once things settle down, one can look back and see how brave a cinematic decision was made in choosing such a path. The end result is a a different course that culminates in a major moral dilemma, one that the film answers without preaching or diving into the issues of such a decision. In fact, ""Baby"" doesn't even pretend to solve the problem, merely presenting the chosen option. Aside from that potential moral controversy, the only problem with the film is the precarious portrayal of the church, which is questionable at best and sacrilegious at worst, although the referenced flaws certainly do exist in the real world.<br/><br/>Freeman's narration alone merits a recommendation for ""Million Dollar Baby"". But add the astonishing performances both in front of and behind the camera, and the aggregate is one of the best dramas in recent years, strong enough to present an extraneous story arc as touching instead of superfluous.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: This is quite possibly the best film of 2004. 9 of 10."
"curtman2","10","4","7","1 February 2005"," Eastwood TKO
","Grizzly, testosterone-driven Clint Eastwood hits the emotional juggler in a film that succeeds as a simplistic, yet profoundly meaningful and poignant masterpiece of the human soul and spirit: of coming out from the hollow shadows of apathy and defeat to realizing our ambitions and giving our best to fulfill all that we've been given in life. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a mirthful and uplifting journey as well as a brutal and harrowing wake-up call: it bleeds with compassion for its characters, each representing a slice of the ""hard-knocked life"", and delivers many eclectic punches yet never holds back on its powerful theme. The acting here is impeccable: Eastwood delves inside the troubled and ostensibly conflicted Frankie Dunn with naked solemnity; Freeman is portentous as always in his scruffy narration, astute observance, facetious relief and unwavering empathy; Swank, of course, the highlight of this remarkable film, is nothing short of marvelous and outstanding, channeling the deep-seated wounds, abjections, and ambitions of Maggie Fitzgerald as if this challenged life paralleled her own. The plot revolves around boxing, yet its underlying theme that rings deep and true for Maggie is survival through overcoming adversity and despair: we feel engaged in the understanding that whatever punches she releases, she is relinquishing her justified bouts against life with as much passion and vigor as she can stomach, which indeed is ameliorated by her ""boss"", trainer, and inspiration, Frankie. There is nothing more emotionally absorbing than rooting for a genuine innocent like Maggie who has somehow overcome neglect, discouragement, and poverty, in exalting herself as a champion in her ultimate, and single, passion in life. Not to be mistaken, the film also very much encompasses Frankie Dunn (Eastwood), who seems to bear enormous guilt and emotional distress that could perhaps be remedied in giving this ""girlie"" a shot in life, as if embracing Maggie as the daughter he never knew and always desired. The emotional intensity of ""Million Dollar Baby"" is virtually seamless and unequaled to anything I've experienced in quite many years; such as the aspiration that Maggie eventually realizes from her ravaged-turned rewarding existence, the emotional impact by the end is something one couldn't possibly anticipate, but almost definitely experiences. The veritable narration also resonates with many of the film's events, as if resounding themes, most especially: ""You can only protect yourself"" and ""Hold back too long, and you'll lose the fight"": it becomes heart-pounding and true beyond anything you can imagine... ""Millon Dollar Baby"" is one of the most engaging, invigorating, hearty, and harrowing films you will ever get the ""shot"" at enduring. Its climates of moral adversity, affliction, survival, and redemption culminate as one powerful, emotionally brutal ""knockout"" of a message and a masterpiece that is deeply felt and appreciated on nearly every level. Another note: the use of shadow and darkness throughout the character structure of the film is impressive and telling, serving to deepen the emotional subtlety of its core. Simple, yet hardly guileless, and resoundingly potent and true: this is one of the most fulfilling and affecting experiences delivered in cinema with one indelible mantelpiece of a message: ""Only you can protect yourself"": fight for what is within you, regardless if nobody's watching and only you can see it, and do what you must to fulfill your fervent, aching soul: whatever is infeasible to your surroundings can be achieved from one's impetuous direction, as Maggie Fitzgerald teaches us. Excoriation is not an option: it's either the shot that beats you or the shot that engenders you. **** out of ****"
"padiyark","10","4","7","31 January 2005"," The most human film in years
","After reading all the reviews, I still did not know what to expect out of ""Million Dollar Baby"" (""MDB""). Was it a female ""Rocky""? Or was it about relationships? Well, after watching this film last night, I have to say that this is one of those films that is more about people and human nature than anything else.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood as a film maker has done what few actor/directors have done: make a succession of films that have gotten more mature and better with age. He started tackling complicated issues such as murder, mythology, and feminism with ""Unforgiven"" (which almost single-handedly deconstructed the Western genre), and then went after other great dramas with ""Mystic River"", ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"", and ""The Bridges of Madison County"". However, Mr. Eastwood has proved to be a master of exploring humans with ""Million Dollar Baby"" If I was to summarize this film, I'd give a lot of the movie away and ruin the experience. So let me clarify a few things to get you prepared. It is not a female ""Rocky""--""Rocky"" was about a chance of a lifetime; ""MDB"" is more complicated, exploring themes of determination, taking chances, and courage. Secondly, it is only partially about boxing. While we do learn about the intricacies of boxing, it does a better job about exploring the minds of the people involved. Finally, these characters are people who you know in your life, and they are not treated with kid gloves; everything is presented straightforward, with nothing to hide.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a plot, I can say that there is a very skimpy one. However, like a good story, it bonds you to all the characters, and in the end, you will be jolted. Along with ""Unforgiven"", this is his masterpiece. Hillary Swank is making her way to be the next great actress since Meryl Streep. Clint Eastwood courageously shows more emotion and range than he ever has on film. And Morgan Freeman, who is usually portrayed as a low talking father figure, adds a good foundation to the film as a whole. Direction is tight, and the score, while simple, is very moving. Forget the big budget blockbusters and give this small film a watch; by far one of the best American films to come out in a while.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), the Million Dollar Baby of the film's title, becomes bigger and more heroic as the camera gets more cruel. Capturing her pure energy before Maggie loses her million dollar bout to her opponent's dirty tactics, director Clint Eastwood captures Maggie's Christ-like, more than Christ-like dimension, as she lies in a Rehab bed, her spinal cord damaged, her dancing boxer's legs destroyed by bedsores. <br/><br/>As Maggie's trainer Frankie Dunn (Eastwood in a revelatory performance) gradually comes to understand, she has the shine  the glint and glimmers of passion and physicality, of sexuality and a girl's raging hormones. And she turns all that into the sport of boxing. Maggie remains relentlessly ""pure"" and warm throughout the film, even as she is clearly dying.<br/><br/>Frankie's love around Maggie's dislocated body is dramatically reinforced by the repulsive greed of her mom (Margo Martindale) trying to dupe her daughter. In a horrific scene, Earline sticks a pen into Maggie's mouth as if it's a lollipop. Earline doesn't give a damn about her girl, her passion for boxing, or her compassionate need to pull her family out of poverty. She just wants Maggie to sign over the money she earned in the ring. <br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby opens with Maggie seeking out Frankie, her sublimated Daddy. Although at first, he won't have anything to do with ""a girl boxer,"" he finally lets himself be seduced and becomes the conduit to her passion. He brings out her boxer's strength. Then comes the blindness of love, of admiration. <br/><br/>Frankie overshoots the mark by taking her to a category she might not be ready for, and from trailer park America to the World. But he gives her a stage for her grace and glory. She moves into the arena of her final match like a bride in a silken emerald hooded robe. She is offered to the crowd. The opponent arrives, all concealed in blue and black, wily and intent on killing. This is a million dollar match. The game is dirty and brutal. <br/><br/>At the end, Frankie's guilt is unbearable. He tries to give her what he can. But the truth is that she is maimed, and she's dying. A priest (Brian O'Byrne) advises Frankie to walk away from her desire to die, using reason and precepts. He is in the ivory tower of the Church. He does not see actual suffering, a proof of which is painfully clear when Maggie bites her own tongue to make herself bleed to death. <br/><br/>In concert with his other films about suffering and ambiguous redemption (Bird, Mystic River), Clint Eastwood touches us with an unexpected force in this tragedy of destiny."
"noralee","Null","4","7","29 January 2005"," A Spare and Gripping Character Study
","""Million Dollar Baby"" is a spare, minimalist and gripping character study. Even the elements that now and then seem a bit extraneous, particularly about religious faith, turn out in the last few minutes to be vital. <br/><br/>Director/star/scorer Clint Eastwood confidently pares the film and his performance down to its simplest elements. Tom Stern's cinematography is even more breathtaking than their collaboration on ""Mystic River,"" especially in its use of darkness, and should have been recognized for an Oscar nomination. Paul Haggis's script recalls his ahead-of-its-time TV series ""E.Z. Streets,"" where the dialog is more for character development and revelations than for plot. <br/><br/>Particularly wonderful are the interchanges between Eastwood and Morgan Freeman that are lovely evocations of long-time male camaraderie. A key element of the film is its exploration of paternal aspects of masculinity we rarely see on film without a sexual context - friendship, mentoring and responsibility. <br/><br/>The film, however, is almost too bare in its treatment of Hilary Swank's character, with none of the personal context that ""Girl Fight"" stressed, particularly in the lack of any romantic hints at all -- is it to avoid any issues about the tomboy's sexuality? But this keeps the spotlight on the central, quasi father-daughter relationship with its emotionally draining conclusion that packs a tremendous wallop. <br/><br/>One of the few jarring notes is the stereotyped portrayal of her grasping hillbilly relatives, including an inconsistency or two about them. <br/><br/>Freeman's continuing narration simply got on my nerves, even if it is rationalized in the last frame, especially when it re-emphasized something we were seeing visually. I felt it was recalling his essential commentary in ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" which is explicitly referenced in an amusing epithet. <br/><br/>The glaring product placement for Everlast and the gratuitous reference to a Warner Brothers product were unnecessary and cheapened a moving story."

","I give this 9 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>I usually do not give most movies anything above 7 because they just do not deserve it. Movies that are 8, 9, 10 have two things in common: great story and great performance. Every year, only a handful of movies, if at that, I believe deserve a score of 8 or above. The reason why I am discussing this is because I have friends who will be receiving their Academy ballots for the upcoming Oscar Awards and I hope some of them will give their vote to this movie.<br/><br/>This movie is simply superb! Well written and very good performance. I cannot single out one person as standing out over others in this movie. Perhaps it is because you have three really good actors and actress who perform their craft so well that it seems effortless when you see them on the screen.<br/><br/>The story! I mean, when I first heard the premise of this movie, I was simply turned off by it and did not watch it when it first came out in theaters. Big mistake. The saying, you cannot judge a book by its cover, is so true here.<br/><br/>The movie is about a young woman (Hilary Swank) from a poverty background whose dream is to become a female boxer. She wants to train under a veteran trainer (Clint Eastwood) but he does not want to train her at first. The boxing gym's janitor (Morgan Freeman) gives her boxing advice so that she can train properly. Eventually, her perseverance wins out and the veteran trainer takes her under his tutelage. Things go well until tragedy strikes which causes the characters to evaluate what is truly important in their life.<br/><br/>If this was simply a boxing story, I would give it no more than 6 stars. Thankfully it is not. Kudos to Rope Burns, F.X. Toole, and Paul Haggis, in bringing this story into creation. Further Kudos for director Clint Eastwood...the man is simply a juggernaut of talent.<br/><br/>Seeing movies like this really makes all those other bad movies that I had watched throughout the year, bearable."

","2005 has started off with a big big bang for my wife and I. Million Dollar baby is a sure fire Acadamey Award nominee in several categories and how can you possibly choose who and what should win. Everything about this movie from the writing, directing, acting and even the music by Clint Eastwood is brilliant. Hillary Swank is once again one of our best actresses.. Don't know why she doesn't make more movies and do some as a ""real lady"" which she certainly is. Her portrayal as a white trash girl from the sticks who wants to be a boxing champion is very believable and she is perfect in the role. The chemistry between her and the fabulous Clint Eastwood who I believe is past 70 years old is wonderful. Clint is simply great in anything that he does, from those old spaghetti westerns, to Dirty Harry to the comedies, acting, directing, singing, you name it and he can do it as good as anyone else. He is a fall back to the greats of Hollywood goneby. What can you say about Morgan Freeman. I can listen to his voice for hours and be satisfied. He is mesmerizing with his tones. As an actor, he too is so versatile and fantastic that he has not gotten the appreciation that he should be getting. He is one of the finest actors in Hollywood who just goes along making movie after movie and each one is of the top caliber. He is great as the go between with Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank in this movie and he does it with such ease. I would love to see him finally get the recognition he deserves by not only getting nominated but actually winning the academy award which he so richly deserves."

I almost walked out, but the story got interesting once ""Clint"" took ""Hilary"" under his boxing glove. The second act (one hour) then became pretty riveting: exciting boxing scenes, good drama between the two leads, back story development, yes! But then - like a loud, farting uncle who has worn out his welcome - came the melodrama in big heaping, dripping spoonfuls. I rolled my eyes more than once during this TV-movie-of-the-week portion of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie also boasts one of the most annoying secondary characters since Jar Jar Binks stunk up the screen.

","Mr. Eastwood has taken American cinema, both behind and in front of the camera, to places it could not have achieved on its own. From 'Play Misty for Me', to last year's triumph 'Mystic River', his contribution to quality simple tradecraft storytelling is of invaluable measure.<br/><br/>As Frankie, a could have been/should have been trainer, Mr. Eastwood reminds you with startling moments that he began an actor. At a moment when you know anyone, someone, would cry, that the character Frankie would cry, you start to ask yourself 'Is Clint really going to take us there?' He does. And back again.<br/><br/>Now to have his skillful storytelling and performance partnered with Morgan Freeman and Hillary Swank, is a treat for all. If you began to think that Ms. Swank had lost her verve, or that painful ability to swagger in an out of strength and pathos, then it will certainly be revived by this performance.<br/><br/>The story takes a direction you do not expect. Many a director, particularly American directors, would take thirteen minutes to peak and close out this twist of tale so as to end the film within a perfect three-act structure. But not Mr. Eastwood.<br/><br/>I was reminded of 'The Iceman Cometh' or 'Nights of Cabiria' in that the film plays itself in three equally paced, toned, acts. But never when watching are you aware of this. The transition between banter and voice over and underdog and glory and pain and mystery are kept in check by a lucid austerity of a director who knows what he is looking at. A director who knows how to tell a story.<br/><br/>This is a painfully dull year in film. Ray is a showboat actor's piece. Sideways drags over familiarly executed material a la Alexander Payne. The Aviator; Scorcese is a talented man. Why does he keep after the semi-epic historically significant holiday release material? And where are the female performances for the year? But this is another discussion.<br/><br/>Film? Picture? Director? The best of all categories for this year can be found inside 'Million Dollar Baby'. Morgan Freeman may be due, but will likely not take anything home. Swank, who can say. But I do know, statuette or not, this film is the best place I've gone in cinema this year."

"tolbs1010","2","5","10","27 February 2005"," Astonishingly bad, insult to viewers' intelligence
","Critics and audiences alike should be ashamed for heaping praise on the makers of this movie. Not only is it overrated, it is flat-out bad. Clint and his screenwriter, Paul Haggis, botch both halves of this manipulative story. The first half shows no respect or even knowledge of the sport of boxing. The gym scenes and training scenes are cursory at best and make Rocky look like the pinnacle of realism. Also, no amount of natural boxing talent allows a 130 pound fighter to pull of early round knockouts every time out. IT DOES NOT HAPPEN in men or women's boxing. But let's just say we can write off the boxing elements as Hollywood shorthand, the characterizations and dramatic thrust of the film are equally stilted and unbalanced. This film should be more complex emotionally than it is. The main characters are made to look way too righteous and everyone else is unfeeling scum, even the priest. How ridiculous is the white trash family caricature? Why does Swank have to fall at the hands of a sucker-punch by a monstrous cheater of an opponent? Do we really need to see Morgan Freeman knock out Danger's taunter? Of course we do because that's the kind of filmmaker Clint Eastwood is. He believes in stacked decks and simplistic portrayals of good vs. evil. Go out and rent The Gauntlet, Pale Rider, Blood Work, Sudden Impact, and other Eastwood films for more examples of his boneheaded approach to humanity. (Mystic River manages to escape ridiculous simplicity thanks in large part to the very talented screenwriter Brian Helgeland.) That kind of attitude can be fun, like in the Dirty Harry films, but in MDB it adds up to cheap, unearned pathos that is practically begging to be recognized by the academy as something important. It's not important or even moving-it's laughable. It's like a hard sell for tears-anyone with any sense ain't buying it."

Also, as we are all aware from hearing Christopher Reeve's being interviewed when a person is trach'ed their voice is choppy and airy. And it would have been a walk in the park for law enforcement to track down the person who turned the ventilator off and administered the lethal injection of adrenaline.

","Million Dollar Baby just came to our fair city this weekend, so I had to go see it. I'm leery of seeing a film when my expectations are so high, it's usually a letdown. Not in this case. I left the theater over an hour ago, and my eyes are still puffy and my nose is still stuffed and running. This is Clint Eastwood's best performance since playing Bill Munny in Unforgiven. In this movie he plays Frankie Dunn, a grizzled old fighter who now owns a boxing gym and trains young fighters. Morgan Freeman is perfect in the role of his sidekick, another old ex-fighter, taking care of the gym for Frankie, while Frankie takes care of him, for reasons that become known during the film. Same type of role he had in Unforgiven as Ned Logan. But the person who really shines in my opinion is Hilary Swank. This film is going to get her noticed. She was good in ""Boys Don't Cry"" and OK in ""Insomnia"", but in this she is simply terrific. She talks Frankie Dunn into managing and training her, against his better judgment, a decision that will have lasting consequences on his life.<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, one of the things that made this film so gut-wrenching for me was that it wasn't sentimental, and didn't fall into the trap of having to have a happy ending, rather the ending is about making choices and dealing with tragedy. We may all fantasize the happy ending,we fantasize because it so rarely happens; but if we live long enough, we all have to deal with choices and decisions in tragic situations. <br/><br/>Well, my nose is running again as I urge you to please go see this film, I think it will be worth your while."

I would have added more people in her life like maybe a boy friend maybe we should have met her family earlier in the story. I mean to relate to her more when needed to know more about her. To me most effective part of the movie was when you meet her cold hearted family. Though it doesn't take much to spoil this movie there is a twist but it took to long to get there in my opinion. I also felt like I was paying to watch a manipulative film. Something that should be left for network TV."
"XweAponX","5","3","5","29 April 2015"," I had an epiphany about this movie today
","And its Tea-Party roots.<br/><br/>Basically, this movie was a tool used to inject poison. I'll get to that in a bit.<br/><br/>This film was released at virtually the Nadir of some of the worst years, not of just my life, but of this nation.<br/><br/>If we look at the events surrounding the year of it's release: US is embroiled in basically a war which our then-president caused over OIL. The Housing bubble had burst, and one year later, Bush's first attempts to privatize our social security system was put into effect, namely ""Medicare Part D"" which privatized a function of Social Security, took it AWAY from the State, and handed it directly to private entrepreneurs and Insurance Sharks. Many of our elderly went without medication for up to three years. If Part D were put on the table today exactly as it was in 2004, it would be rejected, because it is supposed to be ""Federal"". The reason why this I bring this up is because it was an issue during the time this movie was being made, it's director and writer believes in it, and mainly this movie attacks the idea of Social Security.<br/><br/>So I watch this movie, and it actually did have some good things in it, ergo my 5 rating. For the first half at least, some of it was very good, because Chair-Talking' Clint actually is a talented director. But I thought I was watching a movie about a girl who liked Boxing and became a woman boxer. And it was interesting as that movie... Until Clint decides to speak to that empty chair for the first time.<br/><br/>Suddenly, the film is no longer about a budding girl boxer, suddenly she is disabled, and her ""evil"" mother is fighting with Clint over her money (The mother who just so happens to be worried about losing her Social Security benefits because she is given a HOUSE).<br/><br/>If a Disabled person, meaning a person dependent on Social Security to do things like get Medical Care, EAT, find transportation, etc (In other words, those things that people who are not disabled take for granted) - If suddenly were given a HOUSE like that, well for a fact there would be serious and instant consequences- They COULD lose their Social Security. Now, the mother is no angel, and has problems: But to be worried about losing Social Security is a dread fear for all people who get it. However, the woman did receive and act on bad advice from other family members. But Clint uses this one dysfunctional family to make all of Social Security look bad, attacking the recipients of it, in order to state his political views on not liking the system. Well, to hell with you, Clint! Basically, this film is a war about a girl's inheritance money - Should it be given to her Family, who does not seem to give a rip about the girl, or should her ""beloved"" trainer get it? The Problem is, regardless of how bad the mother appears, she was justified in being worried over losing her benefits. Simply put, Clint is not a valid person or director to put these elements into a movie, he's never had to LIVE on Social Security. Maybe at times he's had to get California Disability, but that's not the same thing- a person who is on Social Security can own a house, but to just be GIVEN a house is a serious problem.<br/><br/>Perhaps if Clint had not made such a big deal in the movie about the mother's fear of Losing Benefits, but it just seemed to me, he went out of his way to make it into some kind of ""statement"". I mean, if the mother is a B****, then just have her be a B****. The whole thing about fear of losing Benefits had no place in this film.<br/><br/>Now regarding the relationship Clint has with his Boxer played by Hilary Swank, I could believe that a bit. But that was at the very end of the movie, where his true feelings came out (He tells her what the Irish Slogan he had sewn on her robe meant). It would have been a better ending for a better movie had not Clint used the Anti-Medicare Detour to get there. Now, I've never read the stories that this is based upon, I don't know if the reactionary ideas were in the stories, or if Clint simply put them in. All I know is that this film uses those unfortunate events to make a system we depend on look bad.<br/><br/>But this is just Par for Eastwood Movies these days, he is no longer interested in making any good Drama, he actually used to make films that supported the underdog, lately he makes films to support radical right wing reactionary ideas. But mostly he creates these huge canvases where he basically justifies telling a lie as the truth, like his latest sniper movie which gives his stamp of approval to the War in Iraq. I'd rather see him stick to Fiction."

She won't give up, and with the help an old retired fighter Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman), she convinces Frankie to give her a chance.<br/><br/>This is a great standard underdog sports story for 3/4 of the movie. It works great. Clint and Morgan are old hands at this. They cancel each other a bit with their grumbling voices and their gruff demeanor. Hilary Swank is perfect for the role. She's no princess. She can definitely play the hungry white trash role.<br/><br/>Then the last 30 minutes turn dark. It's a change in tone. It has difficult things to say.

It's so great in fact that I think you really need to take a closer look at him as being one of the greatest filmmakers of recent decades. I certainly don't think this is one of the greatest films ever made but it's certainly a revalation in today's terms since Eastwood has the balls to do something the audience doesn't expect. I knew something happened at the end but I was able to not have it spoiled by reading nothing about the film. I went back and read some of the controversy that came up and found it all quite silly. I guess when people have nothing better to do they start stuff up. In the discussion thread here I saw a lot of people bashing the white trash family in the film and I found it rather funny that their locations had them in states not really known for ""white trash"". Being from KY and having to hear these jokes, I must say this is one of the most realistic examples of this type of family. In fact, I'd say it was the most realistic and there certainly wasn't any cartoonish moments or over the top moments. The performances by Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman are right on the mark. As with Mystic River, it's good to throw the CGI in the toilet and see a movie being carried by great acting.<br/><br/>As for the ending, again bless Eastwood."

","The flawless performances by the cast, the perfect settings and the pure emotional journey you will be taken on make ""Million Dollar Baby"" a must-see movie and another feather in Eastwood's brilliant career.<br/><br/>""Million Dollar Baby"" isn't really a boxing movie, but a movie about the developing relationship between a boxing coach, a female boxer and the man who is the caretaker at the gym where they all initially meet. Clint Eastwood as Frankie Dunn, is simply brilliant in a role that seems so made for him, it would be unfeasible to believe anyone else could have possibly cast in it. He is the aged, wise trainer who has lived boxing his whole life and at his age could do without any angst from any source. His only other occupation seems to be attending church every day.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the actor that stands out the most in this amazing cast isn't Hilary Swank or Clint Eastwood. It's Morgan Freeman. Eddie ""Scrap Iron"" Dupris is so eloquently played by veteran Morgan Freeman. He completes the three-way relationship with Frankie and Maggie, which is central to the narrative, narrating part of the story in voice-over as a letter to Frank's estranged daughter. Wise beyond his aging years, Eddie gives good advice, which, although cryptic at times, is taken on board by others. It is the relationships between the three leads in this movie that will be tougher than any bout in the ring.

","One of the most frustratingly disappointing movies I've seen in recent years, especially given the critical reviews, its academy award for best picture, and the quality cast.<br/><br/>On the plus side: it is a technically well-made film with good acting, as one would expect from the people involved. It also does a nice job (mostly in the first half of the film) of presenting the boxing gym as a microcosm in which a diverse group of people at very different points in their lives struggle with the demands of boxing for individual reasons. It's too bad this wasn't the main focus of the film.<br/><br/>On the negative side: (WARNING: spoilers ahead!) This is what is sometimes referred to as a ""kill the kitten movie."" It presents an innocent and almost too good to be true character that the audience will care about and root for (the kitten), and then has something terrible happen to that character (the kitten gets hit by a car). The audience is of course deeply moved by the tragedy, which creates the illusion of powerful drama when it is really just cheap, generic manipulation. In this case, the Hillary Swank character is a beautiful, plucky, brave, generous, determined young woman from an impoverished background who has not a single fault (even her teeth are movie star perfect despite her family genetics, poor upbringing and boxing career). So, the screen play has something really bad and really unfair happen to her to evoke ""kill the kitten"" emotions. Unfortunately, not only is the tragic turn in the movie manipulative, it's also highly illogical. While the incident occurs in a public sporting event significant enough to have a large audience and to be televised, and involves a felonious act by an at least marginally famous athlete, there is no media follow up to the event, and no holding the perpetrator legally or financially responsible for the consequences. Then, the seriously injured victim is sent to 2 different medical facilities in which she never receives any counseling for the psychological trauma she's going through, and is placed in a medically inappropriate bed (I know whereof I speak) that results in terrible and unnecessary pressure ulcers that add to her woes. Finally, to evoke even more visceral responses, the movie resorts to playing on what it apparently considers to be ""acceptable"" prejudices. The protagonist's family members are presented as disgusting and stereotypical examples of ""white trash:"" ignorant, lazy, selfish, irresponsible, dishonest, parasitical people with West Virginan accents. Personally, I found this depiction offensive and reprehensible. There's also the depiction of a completely ineffectual priest who shows us that religion is useless and irrelevant in times of tragedy and ethical dilemmas. This appears to be an implicit justification for the ""shocking"" ending which I found too contrived to be controversial.<br/><br/>Apparently, mine is a minority opinion, but I've met a number of other people who share it. Here's hoping for better movies."

","Eastwood's scenes with Morgan Freeman are funny and touching, and Hilary Swank does a fine job of acting. But there are several major flaws. First, Clint Eastwood simply is not an accomplished visual artist, as he would have to be to hold our interest through an entire film the color of celery. Second, there are several problems with pacing. In the first half, the training process is slow, which is fine, then the one-round fights are abrupt, which is disconcerting. The second half is also quite slow for the first several sequences, which is also fine, but the transition to the climax (never fear, no spoiler) comes abruptly, which nearly ruins the picture. Third, Director Eastwood gives a preposterously large number of closeups to Actor Eastwood. Still, much of the movie is good, even if it was clearly the wrong choice for Best Picture."

""MDB"" is a small scale, low key, intimate film that packs honesty and raw, heart wrenching emotion. <br/><br/>Hillary Swank gives a powerful performance as a poor, single waitress from a rural background, who decides, against the odds, to become a boxer. Clint Eastwood portrays a former boxer, now trainer in his own gym. He reluctantly accepts Swank as her first trainer. Morgan Freeman portrays a retired boxer who almost won a title under Eastwood's training. He is now an assistant to Eastwood at the gym and is the one who notices Swank's determination and gives her a chance getting started with training at the gym. Both Eastwood and Freeman give strong performances to back up Swank's memorable acting performance. <br/><br/>Swank's character and transformation are convincing and believable, as she begins to find herself in life. Her toughness, stubbornness and determination help make her a winning boxer. From a troubled, broken family and a life of struggle, her new boxing career becomes a life renewed. During the several years of successful partnership as boxer and trainer, Eastwood gradually becomes a father figure to Swank.<br/><br/>Nothing, however, really prepares one for the sudden and unexpected change of events that occur about midway into the story and dramatically changes the mood of the film. By this time, we have strongly bonded emotionally with Swank's character, feeling empathy for her life situation and struggles. So this sudden shift in the story is all the more powerful and sets the stage for deeply intimate and heart wrenching emotions in the second half of the film, which ends in a surprising and poignant manner.<br/><br/>Unlike typical Hollywood films, ""MDB"" has honesty, sensitivity, believable, ordinary people and raw emotional power. ""MDB"" will leave you with lingering, heartfelt sorrow. An extraordinary film."
"lotus_chief","9","3","5","4 March 2005"," Just when I thought Mystic River couldn't be topped
","I just saw Million Dollar Baby about 2 hours ago, and I'll admit that I was a bit non-decided on how much I liked the film; there's no doubt that I liked it. I've always admired Clint Eastwood's style and choice of films to make, his films are so human at the core and that's something that's sorely missed. Every time I see that Eastwood has directed a film, I am eager to watch it. The stories he chooses and the characters he shows are the essence of human everyday life; and as a result I can FEEL his films that much more. This time around, however, the simplicity and realness of the story was SO MUCH that I was almost numb after wards. Unlike Mystic River, which was more in-your-face, raw emotion that could be immediately recognized; Million Dollar Baby is so much more reserved, almost passive in telling its tale that all of its influence can't be initially taken in. Million Dollar Baby is so ""bare-boned"" it's almost scary to look at. It's so subtle that I didn't recognize the true beauty of it until further contemplation as I was leaving the theater.<br/><br/>Because of this, I can honestly say that Clint has truly mastered film-making (in his own way of course). This, to me, represents Eastwood's pinnacle; THE blueprint for an Eastwood film in the truest sense. The beauty and genius of MDB is that everything is not spoon-fed to the audience. For example, we never find out why Clint's (Frankie) daughter doesn't want anything to do with him. Then again, it doesn't really matter. I think of it as a ""longer-lasting McGuffin"". We just know that Frankie's life has forever changed because of his estranged relationship, and everything he does is a result of it. Nothing is really forced on us; which is perfectly represented by Freeman's narration, which is simply a guide with no influencing tone throughout. It's a classic story told in the simplest of fashions; we have just been fortunate enough to 'drop in', if you will, on the lives of these three people. This has become a signature of Eastwood's films.sure it could be said to be present in other films, but no one captures that effect the way Clint does.<br/><br/>I don't really have to say it now, but the acting is truly first class. Eastwood is as good as he's ever been as Frankie, you can't help but genuinely FEEL his character. The same could be said for Morgan Freeman, who is one of the greatest actors ever. For a man with such a commanding presence on the screen, Freeman underplays his character perfectly. Swank as Maggie is just wonderful. I could see the dedication that she put into the character; it was a sight to see. As said before, the story (a surprisingly dark one) is classic; but it's told in a way that doesn't come off as preachy or overly sappy. Frankie has lost much in his life; he's a grieving old man who is trying to hold onto whatever he can but it always finds a way to wiggle out of his grasp. He had just about given up when Maggie came along and he reluctantly gets attached again. He goes through it all with Maggie and learns to love again; when again it was being taken away from him. Only this time, he wasn't going to stand around and let it wiggle out of his hand.this time he set it down and let it go.on HIS terms. He may not have wanted to let go and be hurt once again, but the strength he showed displayed the love he had; love that would never die. He had learned that he could indeed love again, and it was there until the very end. Scrap had it all at one point, but after losing his eye in a title fight his dream was deferred. He'd gotten the title fight he'd always wanted and let it all out. but at a price. He has since been reduced to a help man at the local boxing gym, a life that he seems to accept because that's about as useful as he's going to be. He is best friends with Frankie, about the only one that Frankie truly has; but even their relationship has an uneasiness to it.they exist now almost as a father/son tandem, most likely to make up for what Frankie views as his mistake for not protecting Scrap's well-being many years ago. Maggie was a nobody who just wanted a chance at life and eventually got it. The simplicity of her story is the beauty of it; and it is also the reason you can come to terms with her decision that much easier at the end of the film, no matter how coarse and sorrowful it seems. She got her chance, lived the life she wanted to live; she had her family (now Frankie); and that's all she ever wanted.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is such a beautiful, simple story with so many layers; that's why it works so well. It may take more than one viewing to realize completely the essence of the film. If any lesson is learned here it's ""simple is better"". Eastwood takes that to heart with all of his films, and that philosophy has been fully mastered and realized by him; putting him in the upper echelon of the greatest filmmakers in movie history. Just when we thought Mystic River couldn't be topped, we are blessed with 'an old master's new masterpiece'.I couldn't put it better. I can only imagine what Eastwood will come with next, but this gem is one for the ages.<br/><br/>**** out of **** stars."
"Son_of_Mansfield","9","3","5","3 March 2005"," Clint Eastwood scores another point.
","If an artist's job is to get you thinking, then Clint Eastwood is just hitting his prime. Following up on the fantastic Mystic River, comes another complicated and emotional story about redemption that also is kin to Unforgiven. Million Dollar Baby, like Mystic River, strips away almost all gloss and flash to tell the story of an old aged boxer teaching a middle aged woman to box. Both looking to make up for past mistakes, they embark on an ultimately tragic journey. In the end they gain and then lose what they sought. I love Clint's elegant, slow storytelling. The movie moves along without the use of quick cuts or a pulsing soundtrack which would be expected from a sports movie. The ""lesson"" that it is better to have failed then to never tried played out by seemingly perpetual losers should affect anyone. The possible controversy over the ending is simple minded and probably forwarded by those who have not seen the film. I agree with Bill Maher. When someone has had such a life as to be admired and now is rotting away, it is more wrong to keep them alive against their wishes with machines. Not everyone can or wants to become a Christopher Reeve when placed in the situation that he so bravely challenged. This is just my opinion. The performances are commendable as well. Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood have great chemistry playing some still very intimidating men, while Hilary Swank again brings a quiet dignity to a possibly flashy role. It is Oscars all around and while I think that Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind should have won best picture, I think this is a worthy movie that justly wins hearts and minds."
"kingbad","9","3","5","2 March 2005"," Small, beautifully-told, ultimately tragic
","Easily the (latest) masterpiece of Clint Eastwood's directorial career, although, on the heels of Unforgiven and Mystic River, perhaps his best is still ahead. Powerful story of a determined young woman and her over-protective trainer/manager. Eastwood is amazing as the tough but fatherly Frankie Dunn, seeking redemption for some great, but untold, sin against his own daughter. Hilary Swank shines in yet another ""role of a lifetime"" as the doomed Fightin' Maggie Fitzgerald, who rises from an awful family life in the Ozarks to become the No. 1 title contender. Morgan Freeman turns in yet another wise sidekick/narrator performance; his role as ""Scrap Iron"" Dupri is strong, although not as memorable as ""Red"" Reddick in The Shawshank Redemption (of course, any time he's not stuck in another Ashley Judd movie is a good thing). SPOILER ALERT!! A lot has been made of the film's treatment of Maggie's paralysis after being injured in the ring, and her decision to enlist devout Catholic Frankie's help in ending her life. Politics aside, however, her choice was completely in keeping with her character, and shouldn't be taken by advocates for the disabled as some sort of approval of assisted suicide. In fact, Frankie's initial refusal, and agonizing decision to help, emphasized the difficult moral choices involved."
"mrrbdavis","Null","3","5","28 February 2005"," Best Picture: A Masterpiece
","""Million Dollar Baby"", winner of 4 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, and Best Supporting Actor is in a word...extraordinary. It is a motion picture as beautiful and rare as a precious gem. <br/><br/>Clint Eastwood crafted a masterpiece with deep characters and a brilliant, moving story. The film centers a around a grizzled old fight trainer and gym owner, Frankie Dunn (Eastwood), his sidekick, Eddie ""Scrap Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman), and an aspiring female boxer, Maggie (Hilary Swank). The characters teach us that even though life can be hard dreams are worth pursuing because if we're lucky we all get one chance at achieving our dreams. We learn that no matter what happens to us, we're better off if we can say we had our shot. <br/><br/>Hilary Swank gave a stunning performance as Maggie and dazzles on the screen. Her work in this film is a lesson in acting and earned her, at the young age of 30, a second Academy Award win for Best Actress. She improves upon her Academy Award winning performance in ""Boys Don't Cry"" (1999). <br/><br/>Morgan Freeman earned his first Academy Award, as Best Supporting Actor for his turn as a hardened, hard luck, wise old former boxer who manages Frankie's gym and looks after some of the boxing hopefuls who train there. <br/><br/>Early in the fall of 2004 when critics began to zero in on which films and performances were Oscar contenders, ""Million Dollar Baby"" was barely on their radar screen. That's because the film had been planned for a 2005 release and was not available early in the fall. Eastwood only began shooting the film in June of 2004, which would ordinarily be too late in the year for a film to be available for release that same year. But Eastwood filmed the movie in only 37 days. The beautiful screenplay by Paul Haggis needed no rewriting, and most scenes were filmed in one take. When studio execs at Warner Bros., which released the film, saw an early rough copy in the early fall, they were so impressed that they rushed the film so that it could be released in time to qualify for the 2004 Academy Awards. <br/><br/>Once it appeared, the critical acclaim for ""Million Dollar Baby"" was enormous. A.O. Scott of the New York Times marveled at the subtle beauty of the film and lauded its director, Clint Eastwood. He called it a masterpiece and proclaimed it the best film released by a Hollywood studio in 2004. Scott compared it to the classic films of Hollywood's heyday when pictures were in black and white. The popular critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times stated in his review, ""Million Dollar Baby is a masterpiece, pure and simple, deep and true."" The film was instantly thrust into the running for the Best Picture Oscar and the buzz surrounding it began to grow. <br/><br/>After a brilliantly timed, modest Oscar campaign which included a limited December release and a nationwide release the weekend after the Academy Award nominations were announced, the film gained momentum so that by the time the Academy Awards show aired only a month later, ""Million Dollar Baby"" had become the new front runner for Best Picture. Early on, the front runner had been ""The Aviator"" (2004), the Howard Hughes biopic, directed by Martin Scorcese, which had captured the Golden Globe for best Drama Picture. ""The Aviator"" also garnered 11 Academy Award nominations compared to 7 for ""Million Dollar Baby."" <br/><br/>Among the film's 7 Academy Award nominations was a surprising acting nomination for Clint Eastwood. He received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for what many critics hailed as the best acting performance of his fifty year career. <br/><br/>""Million Dollar Baby"" also brought Eastwood a second Academy Award win for Best Director, for a film many critics believed to be his best work. He had won the Academy Award for Best Director previously for ""The Unforgiven"" (1992), which also took home an Oscar for Best Picture. <br/><br/>""Million Dollar Baby"" is the best film to win the Oscar for Best Picture in the '00s."

","When I first saw the Flyers for this film wasn't keen to see it. Female Boxing is not my kind of sport, figured it was ""Rocky"" with tits, and wondered why Eastwood had bothered. Fortunately I did make the effort and how rewarding is this picture. It absolutely deserves the Oscars it won, and again establishes Clint Eastwood as a legend in his own time. The fight part of the story, although superbly realized, is secondary to the relationship between the case hard boxing trainer (Eastwood) and a fiery ambitious young boxer (Swank) who wants to succeed at all costs. Initially Eastwood wants no part of training a girl, but with the help of Morgan Freeman (as a old fighter who works in the Gym) Swank at last convinces Eastwood to train her. With results that neither party could imagine, it will effect their lives, and brings them together against tragedy. A human and moving drama set against the gritty background of boxing rings and training gyms. Up there with ""Requiem for a Heavyweight"" and ""Raging Bull"" (directed by Martin Scorsese who was pitted against Eastwood in the Academy Awards with ""The Aviator"") Eastwood made the film on a modest budget in less than 40 days shooting, which is a truly remarkable effort for a man in his 70's. Both directing and acting a lead role. One of the best ""boxing"" films ever produced, but more importantly one of the most human stories of love and ambition. The three leads all work beautifully as an ensemble in this finely crafted film, don't even think of missing it."
"Scaramouche2004","Null","3","5","28 February 2005"," Eastwood's supreme effort.
","Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby is an outstanding piece of film making. In a career spanning fifty years he has had many defining moments, including The Fistful Trilogy, Dirty Harry and Unforgiven, but this movie tops them all.<br/><br/>I went to see this movie today, following last nights Oscar scoop, not only as an avid Eastwood fan, but to see what all the fuss was about.<br/><br/>Now having seen it, I can say without fear of contradiction, that if anything not enough fuss is being made about this film, a film I believe will one day rank as one of the best ever made.<br/><br/>It does not have the epic feel of say Gone With The Wind, The Ten Commandments or Lawrence of Arabia, but it's impact on the viewer is just as powerful if not more so, as Eastwood takes on many religious and moral arguments.<br/><br/>This film will also be hard to pigeon-hole as it can easily fit into so many different genres. Whats starts out primarily as a cut-throat boxing picture turns into a moving story of compassion and tragedy made all the more moving due to the outstanding performances by its three leads.<br/><br/>Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, a craggy old boxing trainer and gym owner not too far removed from Burgess Merideth's Mickey of Rocky fame. He is a lonely man with a black and white outlook on life, a daughter who has disowned him and religious convictions that even his local priest seems to try and discourage.<br/><br/>He is helped in the gym by old friend and one-time title contender Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris played by Morgan Freeman. Known not to affectionately in the gym as 'Old School', Dunn feels responsible for Eddie and blames himself for the bloody bout that cost Dupris his career. He therefore takes care of him financially and emotionally.<br/><br/>Enter Hilary Swank as novice-with-potential, Maggie Fitzgerald. She feels certain that inside she has the makings of being a champion and asks Frankie to be her trainer. At first Frankie refuses on the grounds that she's, ""too old"" and that he ""doesn't train girls"" but in the end he reluctantly agrees to take the young boxer under his wing.<br/><br/>We are then presented with a series of montage shots where we see the awkward kitten's progress from a hopeless case into a potential queen of the ring, and its not long before Fitzgerald is laying her opponents out to dry in the first round.<br/><br/>This part of the movie, very much in the vein of Champion or Rocky, is both brutal and violent. Its almost as if we can feel the blows and smell the canvas. Exiting though it is, it does lead us to question the morality behind such a sport, and in this I suppose lies one of Eastwood's questioning messages.<br/><br/>It is touching to see the scenes between Frankie and Maggie during this early period, as we realise that the more he teaches her, the more respect and affection they seem to share. This is yet another factor of the movie. It is a genuine love story but not by your conventional Hollywood standards. This is not love story based on passion or lust and it is in no way sensual, it runs deeper than that. The relationship between them blossoms to an almost Father/daughter level.<br/><br/>I do not plan to give away any more of this film than I have already, as I wish the reader to see it and appreciate it in the same way I did, without any previous assumptions or opinions, although it deems worth mentioning that the rest of the film holds heartbreak and tragedy from here on in, and focuses on a fight of a very different nature.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood has really developed as an actor over the years. If you were to compare his ""Why, Shucks Ma'am"" demeanour in the early Rawhide years to his moving performance in Million Dollar Baby, you would hardly believe it was the same talent on screen. How he missed out on the best actor Oscar again is beyond me. The guy had me in tears more than once.<br/><br/>However he is probably the best Director in Hollywood today and at least that was taken into account on Oscar night, an award I'm sure Eastwood would have personally preferred..<br/><br/>The film walked away with four Oscars altogether, not only Eastwood's Best Film and Best Director awards but Best Actress for Hilary Swank and a long over due Best Supporting Actor for Morgan Freeman.<br/><br/>This film is priceless. A gritty sports drama, a love story, a buddy movie and a tragic weepy to boot.<br/><br/>But beware you may cry at the end....I did."

Anyone else would have converted Million Dollar Baby into such a TV Movie or something, kind of a ""Karate Kid"" mixed up with a moral conflict. Nevertheless Eastwood has a steady hand, he's tough when he thinks he has to, and he's spectacular when he thinks the story can afford it. Once again he plays the lead role: the cynical-skeptical-heartless old man unable to feel anything for anyone  till he finally does. Someone will say Clint Eastwood can only play one character; OK, maybe that's true: but he is the best playing it.

He doesn't have to ""eat the scenery"" and carry on like some other so-called great actors. Morgan Freeman as always gives a fabulous performance. But it is Hillary Swank who owns this movie. She is clearly the best actress of our day, and if she doesn't win as Best Actress for her performance then I have to wonder about the Academy members who voted. There are not enough adjectives to describe how truly magnificent she is.<br/><br/>I did not sleep too well for three nights after seeing MDB. The movie stayed with me and I almost believed these people and situation to be real.<br/><br/>A MASTERPIECE!"

","Well it is nearly always one or the other isn't it. Mostly I don't care for Clint Eastwood, though he can be terrific - ""Play Misty for Me"" being one example that comes to mind, but here he gives a performance that is completely believable, low-key and complex.<br/><br/>Here he plays Frankie Dunn, an older boxing coach and manager of a tacky male-only boxing gym. He goes to daily Mass and argues with the parish priest about matters of faith, he learns Gaelic and he keeps an old boxer, his helper (who is the narrator of the movie)living in a small room off the gym floor. Frankie is buttoned down, does not show his emotion but we are given hints that life has been hard on him, relationships have been destroyed and broken.<br/><br/>Maggie Fitzgerald (played by Hilary Swank)comes on the scene. She's a thirty-something hillbilly woman from southwest Missouri with a big dream which is nearly impossible to attain, she is too old, too broke and a woman to boot. But she inveigles her way into the gym and practically lives there, training incessantly.<br/><br/>I will not spoil the outcome, it works its way into your heart without being melodramatic or over the top Hollywood.<br/><br/>Hilary's performance is just as good as it was in ""boys Don't Cry"", she seems to immerse herself in these one of a kind roles and you are literally stunned at what she can do with them. I cannot imagine anyone else playing Maggie.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman does a wonderful turn as Dunn's right-hand man, but it is Clint't direction and performance that puts the stamp of overall excellence on this movie. 8 out of 10."

","I went to see Million Dollar Baby tonight, and it was incredible. Clint Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, a Boxing Trainer and Manager who is nearing the end of his career. Frank is plagued with an inability to take risks, which is the Motus Operandi of boxing itself, leaving him with no real accomplishments to take credit for. He is given one last chance at doing something great with his life when he is faced with Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), an aging female wanna be boxer with little trade skill, but a whole lot of heart and natural talent.<br/><br/>I am not a huge fan of Clint Eastwood's earlier films (as a director), I think they are a little too clichéd and Dirty Harry-Esq. But somewhere along the line he managed to take a deep breathe and develop his own style of direction that is absolute art. I used to be only a fan of a movie that had some sort of cleverness about it, now every movie you see tries to be clever in someway. But maybe the cleverness of Million Dollar Baby, is that it doesn't try to be clever.<br/><br/>The artistic direction in Million Dollar Baby is amazing. Clint has grown an ability to transmute the world as we know it into a modern Norman Rockwell painting. Everything piece of set dec in the movie, no matter how torn up or battered it may be... seems to be beautiful. It is like this gossamer shroud of old fashion imagery, draped over the entire set. Clint has Morgan Freeman narrating the movie, and he does just as amazing as in The Shawshank Redemption. Every protaganistic characters seem to have so much honor, and command respect from the viewer, especially when they are held in contrast to the bad guys in the film. It really REALLY makes you root for the main character, and has that much more impact when disaster strikes. Trust me ... you start cheering for Maggie as she beats the crap out of people :D The character development is absolutely amazing in this movie, and possibly it's strongest feature. Clint develops the characters and their relationships so well, that you can feed solely off their body language. There are moments of silence in the movie, and although nothing is being said, you feel as if the characters are still speaking.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved this movie, all performances and characters are awesome. It was very well written and extremely well directed. Go see it. You have 2 days.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby - 8.5/10"

"flashbeagle","Null","3","5","7 February 2005"," One of the best films of 2004. A heavy weight Oscar contender
","Heres a review for one of the best films of 2004, Million Dollar Baby. Gathering up seven nominations in this years Academy Awards, its one of the best-reviewed movie, and this one will really be no different.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is the story of Maggie Fitzgerald, played by Hilary Swank, a wanna-be boxer who has made it to her level by sheer determination and raw talent. Maggie seeks out the help of aging boxing trainer, Frankie Dunn, portrayed by director Clint Eastwood, who co-owns a boxing gym with retired boxer Eddie Dupris. Frankie, who has been burdened by his relationship with his estranged daughter, finds something remarkable in Maggie's determination, and is able to open up to a relationship with her. The film carries these characters through the pains and struggles of, not only boxing, but life as well to an astonishing and beautiful ending.<br/><br/>I have to admit that all the other reviewers have been right. This movie is one of the best of 2004. The performances are remarkable along with the direction. Hilary Swank is astonishing and not only deserved the nomination for best actress, but also deserves the trophy. Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood both do a great job playing off of one each other as old boxing friends. The chemistry throughout the movie is spectacular. The script works on so many levels. The movie looks like a heavy drama, and is, but does not nerve away from adding some other great, heart-warming characters and some great lines.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood, as one would expect, truly grasps this story and makes it come alive with his directing. He is definitely a big contender in the best directing category for the Oscars, and may even walk away with the statue. Eastwood is able to make this movie about the boxer, and the trainer instead of about boxing, as some other directors would have. It's a movie about the life behind boxing, and that's what makes the film great.<br/><br/>When reviewing a movie, a critic always looks for not only what was great about it, but also what hinders it. And I can honestly say that I cannot think of a single item. The only, for lack of a better word, problem I had with the film, is how much it looked like it reeked of ""gimme Oscars!"" However, it's less obvious in the actual film itself than in the trailer. And this ""fault"" is, by no means, a bad thing.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is a fantastic use of celluloid, and after my many reservations about the movie, I must concede to the professional reviewers and give this movie five stars. Because it is that good. While Sideways is my top pick for best film, Million dollar baby is definitely, soul crushing pun alert, a vicious right hook knock out."
"DD-931","8","3","5","6 February 2005"," Mark of a Great Storyteller
","I was in no hurry to see MILLION DOLLAR BABY. I am not a fan of boxing films, and I still think the title is less than stellar. And after seeing it, I haven't changed my opinion that ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND is the best film I've seen so far in the 21st century.<br/><br/>But number two of the century for me is now MILLION DOLLAR BABY.<br/><br/>It's not the story itself that makes this such a great film. The story with it's surface emphasis on underdogs and redemption is actually fairly routine. It is the way Clint Eastwood tells this story, the way he gets such understated yet magnificent performances from his cast, the brilliant use of lighting, of story pacing through editing, his unobtrusive but highly effective music...This film is a textbook example of the best of film storytelling that should be studied by film students in this generation and the next. And the next, and the next...<br/><br/>This is not a film about boxing. This is a film about human beings, their hopes, fears, flaws, and potential for transcendent greatness, sometimes through staggering self-sacrifice. It is told with such love and compassion for the human condition that it gives me a little much-needed faith that maybe the human race is still capable of more than the mundane goals it seems to be setting for itself lately.<br/><br/>The supporting performances are uniformly excellent. But the three leads reach levels of acting on a par with any great performance you'd care to name in film history. I have not been a Hilary Swank fan. But her work here forces me to acknowledge that she is one of the best in her profession. And just when I thought Morgan Freeman couldn't get any better, here he is with the best performance I have ever seen from him. And considering his past work, that is really saying something.<br/><br/>And speaking of best performances, here the legendary Clint Eastwood crowns his career with a titanic performance that redefines him as an actor for the ages. And trust me, the fact that he did it while simultaneously having to spend so much time and loving care on this film as a director makes his work as an actor all the more amazing. Consider this, too: if MDB had been someone else's film, would that director or producer even have thought to cast him in this role? <br/><br/>I didn't really expect to be saying these things about this film. But I mean every word of it."
"rosscinema","8","3","5","5 February 2005"," A film so haunting that ultimately it becomes impossible to forget
","Few films stay with me after time has passed but this is one of those that not only stays embedded in my psyche but shows everyone what making films is really about. Story is about Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) who is a boxing trainer and cut man who runs a gym in Los Angeles but he also attends mass and writes letters to his estranged daughter. Living in a room in the back of the gym is Eddie ""Scrap Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman) who was a fighter for 23 years and lost an eye in a bout that Frankie worked on. After a fight card Frankie is approached by Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) who tells him that she wants to be a fighter and also wants him to train her but his response is ""I don't train girls"".<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT***** Maggie is from a white trash family in the Ozarks and has been working as a waitress since she was 13 but she's determined to be a fighter and shows up at the gym religiously and works very hard. Scrap talks to Frankie and convinces him to train her which he does reluctantly and after time passes she starts her professional career by knocking out her opponent. Maggie becomes quite the sensation as she knocks out her opponents and eventually talks start for her to fight the female champion in her division (Lucia Rijker) and a fifty-fifty split for a million dollars. The fight is made but during the bout Maggie is seriously injured and ends up in the hospital paralyzed from the neck down. As she lies in a hospital bed Maggie also loses a leg and tells Frankie that she wants to die and now he must dig deep into himself and his beliefs for what he is about to do.<br/><br/>This is Clint Eastwood's 25th effort in directing and it's arguably his best ever which is incredible because last years ""Mystic River"" was getting the same accolades. Eastwood's directing is such a joy to view simply because every scene in his films has some sort of meaning to them and nothing that we see is for nothing. The banter that takes place between Frankie and Scrap might appear to be idle chit chat but what it's really doing is establishing the comfortable relationship that they obviously have. For me, this film is about pain and the three characters that carry pain around with them but do their best to keep going in life. The performances that take place on screen are three of the best not only this year but in the careers of these actors and Freeman as Scrap shows a man who's been through extremely tough times but came out of it with dignity intact. Eastwood has always been an underrated performer and while some critics think he relies too much on his incredible presence I still remember him giving solid efforts in several films. Here he plays a character so haunted by his past that he would rather keep most people at a distance but his character gradually learns to love and care once again to the point that he must make the ultimate decision. Eastwood is mesmerizing and he's never been better. I have alway's said that Swank gave one of the great performances in cinema history in ""Boys Don't Cry"" and here she gives another great performance that proves to everyone that she's no fluke. With her tenacity and earthiness Swank gives viewers an utterly believable character from her athletic prowess to the gut wrenching scenes in the hospital bed. It's a performance that will haunt viewers for years to come which is ironic because she did the same thing in 1999 with her Oscar winning role. I'm also a big boxing fan and I can find faults in some of the scenes such as the female champion hitting someone when they are down which in reality would result in an instant disqualification. These little flaws just mean that this film isn't entirely accurate but they don't detract from the emotional power that builds during it's duration. This is a tremendous effort from Eastwood who again shows that his direction can bring out the best in actors but what may surprise everyone (including himself) is that he brought out his own brilliant performance."

This film should go down as one of the greats in the annals of movie lore. It is emotionally moving and stunning.

","I went in to the theater today to see Million Dollar Baby with high expectations. After all the reviews have been great and the awards are starting to rack up for both the actors and the other people involved with this movie.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed. This is a great film, possibly Clint Eastwood's best work as an actor and director. Clint plays grizzled fight trainer Frankie Dunn, a ham and eggs kind of guy with a very gruff exterior. When we first meet Frankie he is carefully managing the career of a rising star boxer from the trainer's hardscrabble gym. Frankie seems to be bringing this fighter along too carefully, as there is a championship bout awaiting. Later in the film we learn the reasons Frankie is careful with his boxers.<br/><br/>Right at the beginning of the film we meet Maggie Fitzgerald, played brilliantly by Hilary Swank. Maggie is a very tough young woman in her early 30's. Some people might call her character ""white trash"" and they wouldn't be too far off of the mark. But that would only describe the superficial aspects of Maggie's character. You quickly come to appreciate Maggie's determination and grit as she hounds Frankie Dunn daily with the request to train and manage her. Frankie wants nothing to do with her initially but slowly is won over by Maggie's personality.<br/><br/>As all of this is going on we meet ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, a washed up old boxer and possibly Frankie's only friend. Scrap-Iron helps Frankie run his gym and is won over by Maggie a lot quicker than Frankie is. Scrap-Iron is played by the always great Morgan Freeman. Freeman deserved his Best Supporting Actor award.<br/><br/>Frankie agrees to train and manage Maggie and this is when the film really takes off. Frankie is, for reasons never really explained in the movie, estranged from his own daughter. Maggie becomes Frank's surrogate daughter.<br/><br/>Maggie starts to rise in the ranks as a boxer. It turns out that she's exceptionally gifted as a boxer. Her relationship with Frankie grows with each fight. There are virtually father and daughter and are fulfilling that emotional role for each other.<br/><br/>The movie takes a dramatic turn which I won't reveal in this review. The events only deepen your appreciation for the emotional integrity of all of the main characters.<br/><br/>What can I say about the 3 main actors in this film that hasn't already been said? Being a huge Clint Eastwood fan I am immensely satisfied to see him finally getting the respect for both his acting and directing skills from his peers, the critics and the general public. I hope that Clint continues to make films. It's great to go to a movie that is about something, has characters you care about and a real story. Hilary Swank is Maggie Fitzgerald. You never even get the impression that this great actress is acting. She was the Best Actress last year and also deserved her Oscar. I've already made my comments about Morgan Freeman.<br/><br/>Hey, everyone in Hollywood...You want to know how to make a great film? Put your mocha lattes down and get a primer lesson on film-making. Go see Million Dollar Baby."

Hilary Swank is a great in her character as a boxer and she is very lady like also. I was surprised that Eastwood can still perform like his younger days. The locations were very well chosen and the cast was well chosen. It is very sad, but it is an excellent script and great direction by Clint.

","Millions of critics have been enraptured by the sheer emotional impact of Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"". With ""Mystic River"" and now ""Baby"", critics that were once ""unforgiven"" to Clint because of such clunkers as ""Blood Work"" & ""Bronco Billy"" are now in awe to the Clintster. Not that Clint cares about that sort of thing so much because in his eyes those pundits should really be called ""The Witches of Eastwood"". ""Million Dollar Baby"" stars Hilary Swank as Maggie, an impecunious waitress who dreams of becoming a professional boxer. Maggie is on a relentless pursuit to have a surly old trainer named Frankie train her. Maggie works out in Frankie's boxing gym everyday in hoping to persuade Frankie to be her hit-man. Frankie is played by none other than Eastwood himself. To be ""frank"" with you, I admired Eastwood's straightforward acting work here, but do not think it deserved a Best Actor Oscar nomination. However, his direction of ""Million Dollar Baby"" was worth its price. His attention to detail and framework was of the technical knockout variety. Moreover, the movie's startling emotional turn midway in the narrative is one of the most profound plot-twisters that I have seen in film in a very long time. Morgan Freeman plays the assistant gym sidekick to Frankie who he himself plays an imperative role as the overseer & narrator of the story's dramatic chops. Freeman is an acting legendary God in the business; he did play ""God"" in ""Bruce Almighty"". However, his work here was poignant but not of the Best Supporting Actor nomination weight-class. The heavyweight of ""Million Dollar Baby"" is Hilary Swank. She delivers passionately blow-by-blow. Her lauded performance has been recognized by numerous critics and my scorecard also shares that exact sentiment. She is the frontrunner for the Best Actress Academy Award. If Swank wins her second golden boy, Hilary will be living large in the ""Hollywood Hills"". Paul Haggis' screenplay does possess a heartfelt punch to it, but it felt lightweight at times in the church scenes. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is somber and it's unlike your typical boxing movie, but those are no reasons why you should throw in the towel for ""Million Dollar Baby"". Spend a few dollars and check out the ""Million Dollar Baby""! **** Good"

","This bare, emotional movie is the best that Eastwood has ever done in my opinion. For me, it's not because it has a ruthless, touching ending. So many people have written about it better than I can. I loved this movie because of the atmosphere that Eastwood created.<br/><br/>The movie had a lot of stretches. For me, the story line is too fantastical. It's hard to imagine that a prized fighter would train in such a run-down decrepit old gym. Isn't it a coincidence that two exceptional fighters would both come out of the same gym seemingly in the middle of nowhere, white trash America? But this movie was so realistic in its dialog that I forgot about all that. You could smell the sweat in that gym and it had such a homey feel to it, it made you believe that people would spend all day there.

","This film is beautifully strong but immensely cruel. The strength of the film holds in one single fact: anyone can always win one battle provided they are trained properly and they are managed properly. That does not mean they will win the world title but they can always try and win one victory. How far will they go, no one knows, no one can tell. Luckily, otherwise there would be no meaning in trying. But the cruelty is all contained too in one fact: the end of such a fight for the top title is lost sooner or later if the contender does not learn how to cheat with life and the rules or to be aware the other one may cheat with life and the rules and this contender must be ready to resist these attempts. And that's just what the ""boss"" forgot to teach his fighter. And she was the victim of the viciousness of the champion who did something wrong for the third time causing severe damage and eventually death. If you just concentrate on these two elements this film is a masterpiece that deserves all the prizes it got. If you want to go slightly farther and sort out other elements like the heavy reference to God and religion, you will fall into something very trite, like the priest advising the ""boss"" not to meddle with the fallen fighter's desire to die because then he, the boss, would not be able to come to terms with himself. This answer is so narrow-minded, so egotistic in the name of God. I respect the divine command not because I respect or fear God, but because my disobeying this command may make me unhappy. On these sides issues and questions Clint Eastwood is definitely less clear. But the cruelty of this boxing against all people involved in the business is mastered in an admirable way.

She scraps steak from her job, she admits her heritage of growing up ""white trash"" - she speaks of the defeat that overcame her family - but her heart swells, and in every step, or elusive blow to the hanging bag - her heart beats victory.<br/><br/>Eastwood becomes her reluctant trainer and delegable father - his own daughter not being on speaking terms - why, the audience is never informed - but Eastwood clings that each letter he sends won't be returned from his daughter like the hundred others that he keeps as punishment.<br/><br/>One would guess that Eastwood sins were great - that he betrayed his daughter - that he left his wife, that he is looking through redemption through the victory of his protégés.<br/><br/>In a word, this film chronicles Swank's rise from ""trailor trash"" to the fierce warrior who destroys her competition to the cheers, and inspired crowds chanting her Gaelic name, given to her by the poetry reading Eastwood.<br/><br/>Swank has her chance, and victory is certain. Eastwood has borough a fighter to the height of heart and skill. But this is not a glorified female version of Rocky, or more recently Cinderalla man. It is a story of friendship, loyalty, and again, like Mystic River, like Unforgiven, the tragic hand of G*d intervening to force the characters to face themselves at the level of heart, of Philos, of the knowledge of one's limits of love and devotion.<br/><br/>These themes prevail Eastwood's recent films, and his touch is delicate, and subcutaneous. To insert a personal anecdote - I sat in the theater long after the final frames had run, and the theater became lit, and emptied. Stunned that wisdom could be brought to the screen like the best of literature, floating like the best of Chopin's Nocturne's. This is a film for the ages. And will be talked about, and written about and discussed, for years to come.<br/><br/>The best film of the year, from one of Hollywood's most understated, and underrated directors - the masterfully wise Mr. Eastwood."

","Picked this one up off Sky box office and have to admit that I had never heard of it. Not quite keeping up with the latest movies as much as I'd like recently.

Clint Eastwood plays his usual, difficult and unforgiving role with a touch of brilliance.<br/><br/>Casting for this movie was really thought out by someone. Morgan Freeman, do I need to say any more.. The guy is an acting god and provides a kind of a Shawshank similar narrator role, along with an outright perfect performance on set.<br/><br/>As for Maggie, prepare yourselves to metaphorically adopt the girl during the movie and feel the ups and downs of the boxing world.<br/><br/>The film is based around boxing but I would say it draws more from human values.

","I really consider Clint Eastwood as one of the most charismatic persons of the film industry. While starting up with macho roles in movies like ""Dirty Hurry"" and ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"", he completely changed course later on and started doing very sophisticated, and even art, films, such as ""Mystic River"" and ""Bird"".<br/><br/>""Million Dollar Baby"" is a prime example of Clint Eastwood's genius. The story is about Maggie (Swank), a female boxer, who has nothing else in her life than her boxing talent. Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) is a tired, old coach, whom she approaches and he grudgingly decides to take her after Eddie ""Scrup-Iron"" (Freeman), his assistant and pal, persuades him to. The girl proves to be a very promising athlete, and she climbs the ladder of success very swiftly. Frankie starts to feel very close with her, as she reminds him of his long-gone daughter. Things however get very nasty when Maggie suffers from a serious accident, and everything now gets turned upside down...<br/><br/>All the Oscars in this film (nominations and winnings), are well deserved: Eastwood provides us with an A-class direction, as he portrays us a dark world of losers where boxing is their only way for them to feel they have a purpose in life. The leading trio (Eastwood, Swank, Freeman) are so superb in their roles, that it is almost impossible for me to distinguish among them. All in all, the film describes a sad story, very well told, which cannot leave you untouched."

","While this comment goes against the tide of popular opinion, I believe that ""Million Dollar Baby"" is tediously self-indulgent and formulaic. From the opening moments of this overly-long, predictable movie, the audience is presented with one clichéd situation after another - in fact towards the end of the film, one can practically see the kitchen sink descending! Many of the characters are nothing more than stereotypes - particularly the boxer's trashy and unscrupulous family.<br/><br/>Swank's acting skills cannot be faulted, but one becomes very tired of Eastwood's deeply soulful gazes, as he metamorphoses from an impatient curmudgeon, reluctant to undertake the training of a ""girlie"" boxer to a deeply caring father-figure. <br/><br/>None of the characters is explored in depth. Instead we have hackneyed situations, inducing a strong sense of deja vu. Haven't we encountered these themes and these character types in one form or another before? Morgan Freeman is an extremely capable actor, but hasn't he assumed a similar persona in many other films? ""Shawshank Redemption"" comes to mind, for a start.<br/><br/>I realize that ""Million Dollar Baby"" will have much popular appeal, since the film demands no challenging cerebral activity from its viewers, but instead shamelessly manipulates their emotions. For my part, I found the movie to be a nauseating concoction of schmaltz, political correctness and predictability."

All in all it is about a boxing trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) who starts to train a girl, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank). In the beginning, their relations are distant but as it goes on, they evolve the relationship of a father and a daughter.<br/><br/>The movie itself was brilliant. I don't enjoy box myself and for the first part of the movie, I was starting to think that the movie was a mistake and didn't deserve the Oscar. But towards the end and especially after the match with Bluebear, I loved it. The most emotional part was when Frankie helped Maggie die in the hospital. I cried there and even in the end as it was a very emotional letting go. Perfectly played out :) <br/><br/>The actors were the best. Hilary Swank was just amazing. I can't describe it in any other way. Her second Oscar is worth just as much as the first one was. Clint Eastwood - what a magnificent man! He really deserves the Oscar for the film.

MDB blew away the competition for best picture with its tremendous performances, great plot, and powerful surprise ending.

","The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences made the right decision when deciding the Best Picture of the Year. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a film unlike any other. Most films these days are full of cheap, unrealistic visual effects, bloodshed, and gore, but ""Million Dollar Baby"" avoids these characteristics with such ease.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood brilliantly directs this movie and brings out the best performances by Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman, and himself. Eastwood captures the hardships of everyday people with a dream, as in Maggie Fitzgerald's case (brilliantly portrayed by now two Academy Award winner Hilary Swank, one of them being from ""Million Dollar Baby."") Eastwood turns to his ""Unforgiven"" costar, Morgan Freeman as Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, the long-time janitor of Frankie's (Eastwood) gym to inspire and train Maggie before Frankie Dunn does so.<br/><br/>What surprises the audience is the beautiful transformation of Maggie from a long-time waitress and boxing-champion hopeful to champion Maggie aspired to be. Hilary Swank gives Maggie a determined spirit to fight for what she wants to be happy. However with Maggies transformation comes unforeseen tragedy while achieving her dream.<br/><br/>The euthanasia of Maggie provides the viewer with a feeling they may have never felt before or have felt rarely. With Maggie's surprise paralysis from a boxing match comes without a doubt, comes one of the most memorable portions of the film. How this part swung by without controversy is no mystery. Clint Eastwood deals with the tense subject matter beautifully and creates no cause for controversy or alarm, but creates a feeling of mesmerizing awe for the brilliant movie.<br/><br/>This movie deservedly earned its Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress, and Best Supporting Actor."

","There's a line in Million Dollar Baby where Scrap (Morgan Freeman) tells Frankie (Clint Eastwood) that if Maggie (Hilary Swank) were to die today, she would die a happy person, because she made it. But he didn't have to say that. It was obvious. The pace of the story and the performances from all three actors tells this so well.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank is amazing as a young woman who has nothing in this world but her own ambition and belief in her dream of becoming a boxer. ""She grew up knowing one thing. She was trash."" was what Scrap had said. Yes, it sounds recycled, like it's been tried before, but from the moment Swank walks on the screen, you believe it. She plays the part so honestly and without over indulgence in sensitivity and emotion. This may be because Eastwood's direction was to tell the story with simplicity and depth.<br/><br/>Once again Eastwood delivers a great story on screen, and his performance as a gritty, old boxing trainer with scars of his own was outstanding. As well was Morgan Freeman's character who's loss was the Championship, and his eye under the direction of Frankie years earlier. <br/><br/>To say that Million Dollar Baby is a heavy hearted film is putting it lightly. But it will stay with you for a few days. And at the end of it you realize just how much of a hero Maggie Fitzgerald is."

","I know perfection is a hard thing to achieve... some may argue that it's impossible... maybe, but this movie is one of the closest things you can get. Eastwood is like a good port wine, or a good scotch whiskey, it get's better as it ages. Far from the cold hard look of it's Dirty Harry or Sergio Leone's westerns, Clint has become a man with a very personal and always emotional view on human relations. From the wonderful Oscar-winning Unforgiven, to the beautiful Bridges of Madison County or the powerful Mystic River, Clint Eastwood always shows us a human story with some unresolved, deep, old wounds from the past that haunt the characters throughout the entire movie. And he is always able to touch the most inner feelings of ourselves. Million Dollar Baby is probably it's most accomplished movie. Great actors, great script and a master's touch make a must see for everyone.

","""Million Dollar Baby"" takes the well worn boxing genre and turns it into so much mawkish manipulation. Though Hillary Swank gives a great performance, the story is painfully transparent. The use of the omniscient voice-over distracts from what is happening on the screen. Clint Eastwood airs out his limited selection of old catchers mitt expressions and Morgan Freeman is his typecast old self as the wizened presence with a hatful of aphorisms. This film covers no new ground and you might be left with a desire to approach the theater manager about a refund. When a film has the Oscar prognosticators panting only ten minutes after the film has opened, you may have seen a great film, or you may have been sold a bill of goods. If you can remove every boxing film cliché' from your brain before sitting down to watch, ""Million Dollar Baby"" might be the former.

"mick-137","Null","4","8","11 February 2005"," Flawed and therefore overrated
","Eastwood's film about a veteran boxing trainer who reluctantly takes on a female fighter starts slowly, builds in excitement, then abruptly runs out of ideas. I won't give away the ending (I've heard that if you do Eastwood comes round and personally beats the crap out of you), but I will say I found it clumsy, contrived and (worst crime) far too drawn out.<br/><br/>The film works fine in the claustrophobic atmosphere of Eastwood's gym, but when Eastwood and Swank move out into the wider world it gets lost. Eastwood is preparing Swank for a world title fight, but where are the promoters, the agents, the TV crews(the fights appear to televise themselves, the lawyers, for goodness sake? Why doesn't anyone offer Swank sponsorship (for example Everlast, who get their logo into every other frame in this movie)? There's a bit where Swank mentions ""magazine articles"" but we never even see her talking to a fan, let alone a journalist. Her entire career seems to take place in a vacuum, when common sense tells you anyone who looked and performed like her would be an instant media sensation.<br/><br/>The problem seems to be lie with the time-frame of the film. It's nominally set in the near-present (Eastwood waves a VHS cassette at one point) but its heart is in the '40s or '50s, or rather a sort of non-specific past mythical past you get in ""The Shawshank Redemption"".<br/><br/>There's much to enjoy here in the way of dialogue and cinematography, balanced by some major longeurs and lapses of taste (such as going totally OTT in its determination to stick it to welfare claimants). It's not so very bad, but I can't see where the Oscar nominations are coming from."

"highclark","8","4","8","27 January 2005"," Somebody Up There (at the Academy) Likes Me---8/10.
","Somebody Up There (at the Academy) Likes Me----8/10.<br/><br/>Although the Hollywood hype machine is working overtime for this movie, I cannot anoint 'Million Dollar Baby' as the greatest movie of all time, let alone the best movie of this year, absolutely not. It's not even the greatest boxing movie of all time. If I were to judge 'MDB' against the body of work that Clint Eastwood has done up to this point, this movie would fall down to fifth or sixth on his directorial depth chart. Yes, it is better than 'Firefox', but there's no way this movie could be rated higher than 'Mystic River' or 'Play Misty For Me'. However, I will concede that Clint has surpassed his bloated and overly decorated western 'The Unforgiven'; a movie that I, admittedly, didn't get at all, and to this day, still can't believe how it ever received the award for best picture over 'Reservoir Dogs' (which wasn't even nominated, what a crime) or 'Howard's End' or even 'A Few Good Men'.<br/><br/>History may be repeating itself to a certain extent this year at the Academy Awards. Clint could very well be walking away with not only the Best Picture Award, but also the Best Director Award. If you believe the media hype of 'MDB' (and 80% of the comments on 'IMDB'), he's already won the awards. However, the Academy may snub Clint and his bid for the Best Director and Best Picture Award by wanting to acknowledge instead the man responsible for making the best boxing movie of all time; Martin Scorsese. Martin could win it for 'The Aviator'. Talk about 'Fly There and Drive Back'.<br/><br/>From what I could see, the underlying problem with 'MDB' is the plausibility of human drama. There are too many situations where I thought to myself, 'Surely that could never have happened the way they did it'. Whereas most people want a strong plausibility for the human drama, most people don't have a problem with the implausibility of comedy. For instance if Harpo Marx pulls a birdcage out from underneath his trench coat, then proceeds to pull out a fish, a cup of coffee and the silver ware for a party of 20, nobody balks at all, it's a perfectly acceptable scenario. But if Clint Eastwood calmly walks into the ICU in the middle of the night with a bag of needles jacked up with adrenalin on his way to euthanize Hillary Swank while at the same exact moment a hospital staff member needs to get a cup of coffee leaving Clint free to do his mercy killing, that starts to feel very implausible. It is possible, I guess, it's just too neat and tidy for the movie, especially a movie that has quickly become an instant classic. There are enough scenes like this one that undermine what is mostly a very enjoyable movie. But can a scene like this really be in a serious drama for best picture? I hope not. <br/><br/>There are many fine performances in the film. Clint is good as the trainer/surrogate father figure and boss. Morgan Freeman is excellent as the same guy who narrated 'The Shawshank Redemption' or at least that's what it feels like to me. But it is Hillary Swank who is the true standout performer in the film. Swank plays Maggie Fitzgerald, the undefeated not so young new comer. There are many times in the film where her energy just wills the scene to be good. Her bonding scenes with Clint come across as convincing and turn out to be very moving. If 'MDB' steals any Oscar's, hers would be acceptable.<br/><br/>I would be remiss if I didn't also submit my disapproval of the character 'Danger Barch'. Judging by the groans I heard in the movie theater upon his reappearance at the end of the film, I was not alone in my disapproval. I was hoping that when Morgan Freeman put on that boxing glove, that he was doing so to finish him off. <br/><br/>If only the implausibility of many scenes could have been tightened up and straightened out before production. If only the producers could have seen a way to erase the part of 'Danger Barch'. If only it could a been a contenderactually, it is a contender and perhaps even a winnerbut if it is a winner, it will be clear to me that Maggie wasn't the only one to take a fall. It's good, it's just not that good.<br/><br/>8/10. Clark Richards"

","First of all, every review on this page should check the ""contains spoiler"" box. It is impossible to discuss this film without giving away its essence. I thought this film was well acted and the cinematography was great. I even bought Hillary Swank as a knockout artist. I've never boxed myself but her form and her movements struck me as natural and realistic. But I didn't care for the last 1/3 of the film, really. Politically, I believe in assisted suicide but that doesn't make it interesting cinema. I never really bought that Maggie would quit on herself without a fight. Where was the determination she showed in training? This is not to say that suicide under those circumstances is weak or cowardly. Not at all. But I think you would have to go through all the steps of grieving to get there. And if you had the personality of a fighter, it would take that much longer. And I'm also annoyed that as far as we can tell, those fat lazy hillbillies were going to end up with her money anyway, which nullifies the only stand she took after that last fight. And oh yeah, she didn't lose that last fight either. That absolutely would have been a disqualification for the German girl. Maggie would have won the fight via DQ."

Don't get me wrong, it's a decent story and it does turn pretty quickly, but there are problems. The first problem is that it starts off way way too slow. We literally see Maggie come back and forth to the gym with no progression of the plot. The boxing scenes are okay, but I expected more of them.<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILER The turn was probably the most shocking thing about the movie and kept me from falling asleep. Yes, it was a little touching, but too sentimental at the very least.

"tfrizzell","Null","5","11","5 April 2005"," Boxing Ring of Life.
","Truly excellent film from director Clint Eastwood about a 30-something woman (a striking turn by Hilary Swank) from Missouri who dreams of becoming a boxer. She finally makes it out to California, meets trainer Eastwood (who wants nothing to do with her), and tries to convince him to help her with her sports career. Swank hangs around the gym, to Eastwood's dismay, and gets help from an old former fighter (Morgan Freeman in his finest performance) who now stays around and acts as a janitor at Eastwood's sweat-box. Reluctantly, Eastwood starts to help Swank and slowly they develop a father-daughter bond as Swank indeed starts a meteoric rise in the female boxing ranks. However, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is not really about women boxers. It is a tale about three characters that are all broken up inside emotionally and all are trying to cling to something that can repair their damaged psyches. Swank, admitted white trash, feels like someone when she is fighting. The 15 minutes of fame she gets from it is something that makes her feel adequate and complete as a person. Eastwood is a devout Catholic that just does not understand God's ultimate plan. He tries hard to see that everything that happens does happen for a reason, but the fact that Freeman lost an eye while he was fighting under Eastwood's care still haunts him. This point makes Eastwood leery about putting his male boxers in the ring for championship bouts. And then there is Freeman (who also narrates here ala ""The Shawshank Redemption""), an individual that just seems tired and beaten by life in general. He has come to the realization (long before we ever see his character on film) that life is going to continue to punch him in the face and he has admitted defeat and put up a figurative white flag. His deep emotions are hidden by a worn-out body and a somewhat indifferent disposition. Landmark direction by Eastwood as he goes way beyond his best works behind the camera (""Unforgiven and ""Mystic River"") and arguably has his best performance in front of it. Freeman and Swank have jaw-dropping roles that make the whole thing work. This movie is not just about sports. It is a powerful motion picture about life, love, friendship, family, spirituality, mercy and the choices that define us as human beings. ""Million Dollar Baby"" raises huge questions about living that are not easily answered and many times not easily understood. An emotional knock-out that ranks real high on the list of greatest movies ever made. 5 stars out of 5."

Just like a typical sports drama, a rookie wishes to become a champion (in this case a female) and so they train, win fights and compete in the title match. Yes, we've seen it all before. It's a formula that just works perfectly for the sports genre, so there is no need to alter it. Yet, Clint Eastwood decided to go that extra step further and throw in a plot twist that was ruined by the film's marketing. That issue aside, it was excellently executed and really does create an impact. This isn't just a story about winning boxing and becoming a champion. It's about pursuing your dreams and battling your own personal demons. Trying to make something out of your life. Two juxtaposing personalities makes this abundantly clear. Frankie Dunn gives people opportunities and strives for perfection whereas Eddie Dupris lives his life in regret for not being able to achieve his life's ambition. Maggie comes along with the pain and loss of her past life and is able to connect with these two experienced yet jaded individuals that transcends their sorrow. Through sheer determination of the sport, they battle on together. Like a family they unfortunately never had. Using the sport of boxing, Eastwood turns a simple plot into a subtextual construct about inspiration. Very touching. All performances were outstanding. Swank, Freeman and Eastwood were phenomenal, could watch them all day. Eastwood's direction was incredible, particularly how he filmed the boxing matches. The shots are far away so that you can see the actors fight, as if it was a real boxing match. Paul Haggis' screenplay was sharp and rather cut throat. Eastwood's lines were quite savage which enhanced how fatigued he was. The third act's tonal shift may steer some away but this is a well crafted and well acted sports drama."
"KineticSeoul","9","2","3","21 September 2010"," Sports fan or not, check this film out
","This is one of the best boxing movies every made, heck it's one of the best sports movie I ever seen. The acting, the plot, the cinematography, almost everything was done really great and it got my attention from beginning to end. I especially loved watching the humanism in this movie and all the emotions, because the acting is just top notch. This is a story about a poor southern girl who wants to enter the boxing world and with hard work gets her coach played by Clint Eastwood who becomes her mentor and becomes a father figure, kinda like the only family she ever had. And as time goes by her game and skill improves. It's inspiring and yet depressing film that is most definitely a classic. Didn't even know of Hilary Swank but she puts on a amazing performance and she is going to go far in the movie industry, this movie is so good it basically made her. It really is a memorable film that is most definitely worth checking out, sports fan or not.<br/><br/>9.5/10"

","I'd been watching a lot of shallow movies of late, the depths being American Pie present: The Book of Love, which put me off Hollywood movies for a bit.<br/><br/>However, I remembered this movie garnering a lot of critical acclaim and winning an Oscar, so I watched it and, I have to say, it was the best movie I'd seen in quite some time.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, the movie's about how a rural girl comes and experiences basically everything a person could possibly experience in their life.<br/><br/>That line, however, does not do justice to what a good movie it is. <br/><br/>Morgan Freeman's narration is really good, but Hillary Swank's acting is absolutely what you'd expect of an innocent girl who hasn't been through the evils of life. Clint Eastwood does enough to convince me to somehow get all his other movies and watch them.<br/><br/>However, the ending could've been a bit better, which is the reason for the missing star. To give you a modern-day example, you could compare the ending to Law-Abiding Citizen.<br/><br/>However, don't let this put you off the movie as the preceding 1 hours and 40 minutes are absolutely top class, covering up, to a large extent, for the ending."

","I stumbled across this movie on cable TV in its last third and I think it made me cry. Did she have to die. From that time I vowed not to see the entire movie because of the emotion involved. I can still bet you it a good movie.<br/><br/>I have had to read the rest of the story from the synopsis and would recommend it it for the world. It reminded me of movies like the color purple, only this one has a loss at the end rather than a reunion. I think Hilary Swank is brilliant. As I write this review I'm now considering to watch the movie in its entirety and I will be ensuring that I watch it alone because Im gonna drop a few tears."
"EUyeshima","9","2","3","31 March 2008"," Three-Disc DVD Set Highlights An Eastwood Masterwork With a Powerful Turn by Swank
","It has been quite a few years since Clint Eastwood was reamed by critics for starring and sometimes directing ultra-violent vigilante action thrillers. What they neglected to acknowledge is that Eastwood has always had a strong sense of story, and age has really sharpened his film-making techniques to a deeply resonant emotional level without the need for gimmickry or special effects. Nowhere is his immense talent more evident than in this acclaimed 2004 film, a low-key, patiently paced, three-person drama that takes a surprising turn that lifts the movie into something quite extraordinary. The only significant thing miscalculated is the movie's title, which seems almost too comically ironic for such an enriching film.<br/><br/>Written by Paul Haggis (""Crash""), the basic story is simple, almost deceptively corny sounding a bit like the distaff version of ""Rocky"". A spunky female fighter from the wrong side of the tracks, Maggie Fitzgerald, wants a grizzled old trainer, Frankie Dunn, to guide her to become a professional boxer. Of course, the trainer owns a third-rate gym with an array of male fighters encompassing all the stereotypes. He also has an aged assistant, Scrap, who is of course, willing to champion Maggie's potential more than Frankie, at least at the beginning. Eastwood, however, belies the predictability and takes his story to a far deeper and more nuanced level than one would presume from this set-up. It turns out that Maggie is pushing 32 and considered over-the-hill for getting into the game. Frankie is estranged from his daughter, reads Yeats, studies Gaelic and goes to Mass every day mostly to annoy the young priest. Scrap was a contender trained by Frankie but lost an eye and his boxing future when a match went awry.<br/><br/>How these three characters interact with each other supplies the film's main pleasure, not really the obligatory boxing scenes that will assuredly make one wince by their realism. In fact, one of the more painful scenes in the movie is not in the boxing ring but in a new house that Maggie buys for her ungrateful mother, when Maggie comes to the revelation that she has no one but Frankie to provide emotional support in her life. This is not to say the film lacks humor, as Eastwood infuses a clever sensibility that subtly draws you into these characters' lives without hesitation. The story follows Maggie's ascension in the boxing world, and what happens beyond that development is devastating. While it is enough to say there is tragedy involved, leave it to Eastwood, in his straightforward, confident directorial approach, to make the last part of the story surprisingly life-affirming and not at all exploitative. Only a film-making master could pull off such a feat in such an honest and emotionally affecting manner.<br/><br/>As an actor, Eastwood continues to impress primarily by his innate connection to Frankie. Probably not since his surprisingly open-hearted turn in ""The Bridges of Madison County"" has he made himself so vulnerable on screen, granted this time under the veneer of his hard-earned, leather-faced machismo. His sense of authority is never in question here, and he shows it off with great relish, especially as his character realizes how much more complicated life becomes as he grows older. Morgan Freeman plays Scrap with his customary humanistic skill. In fact, he provides the narration as a voice-over letter to Frankie's daughter in a manner that will remind you of his similar turn in ""The Shawshank Redemption"". That's not to say his performance is unsurprising, as he and Eastwood have an easy rapport that plays to both actors' strengths. But the standout is Hilary Swank portraying Maggie with an emotional directness and piercing vulnerability that cuts right to the heart. Not only is she physically impressive in the gym and in the ring, but she elevates what could have been a one-note character into someone far more complex, intelligent and affecting. The film is wonderfully profound with superlative acting.<br/><br/>The three-disc 2005 DVD set is solid but rather light on extras. Disc One contains a pristine print transfer of the film but no commentaries from Eastwood or the cast. There are three extras on Disc Two. The first is an 18-minute featurette, ""Born to Fight"", which features interviews with the three stars and three other cast members, in particular, boxer/actor Lucia Rijker (who plays Maggie's fatalistic opponent) who discusses the ways in which the film parallels her career in boxing. The second is ""The Producers' Round 15"", a 13-minute short on the film's production process featuring Haggis, as well as producers Albert Ruddy and Tom Rosenberg. The last extra is a roundtable discussion, ""James Lipton Takes on Three"" with the three stars being interviewed in typical sequestered fashion by the erudite host of ""Inside the Actors' Studio"". Disc Three is the soundtrack CD of Eastwood's atmospheric musical score orchestrated by Lennie Niehaus conducting the Hollywood Studio Symphony."
"MovieDude95","8","2","3","21 March 2008"," Great Movie!!
","WOW!! I absolutely LOVED this movie!! It deserved to win the Oscar all the way, and it did. Hillary Swank And Clint Eastwood were UNBELIEVABLE! I usually don't like movies like this, but I just couldn't believe my eyes. It is hands down one of the best movies ever made. It deserves a perfect 10 out of 10. The ending is so emotional. She had that girl cold!! If it wasn't for that punch. Every movie lover on earth has to see this movie, because you'll LOVE it!!! It's just amazing. See it, you wont regret it!!! Another thing that is great about is that is has just the perfect amount of boxing scenes. It didn't go overboard on the boxing scenes and it didn't go over board on the boring scenes. In fact, in my opinion there were no ""boring"" scenes. If it's a night were your craving to see a movie, rent this ""Best Picture"" movie. It is certainly a ""Million Dollar Movie""!"
"billion_mucks","7","2","3","1 November 2007"," A sour lesson
","Million Dollar Baby"" is Clint's 27th film at progress in directing. His turnover from that legendary course of bravery in ""Unforgiven"", is now set up in the flat; not charming arena of boxing. But did Clint Eastwood make a movie about boxing? Yes, no. Boxing is the element of desire; uniquely secondary for the movie but primordial to the character of Maggie, to improve on conditions. The lesson moves in a dimmed world, where characters are incomplete and they found in another the way to complete themselves. Eastwood shows his capacity to create credible characters; no dimensional yet dorky and cartoonish heroes. The heroes in ""Million Dollar Baby"" are those we seem to know; but not entirely. The lesson is ""Nothing is beyond you"", yet I find amazing how a very fine script can adjust a story of Frankie's redemption and anger by a lack of communication with his daughter. The film is a calm spectacle of everyday heroes, of great performances (Morgan Freeman with age absorbs perfection) yet a very sour taste. The ending is emotional, but can unbalance the fictional precision that was carried away. Indeed for that, another Academy Award and public award winner."

","And yes i was a little surprised by this. And i felt a little guilty that i had not seen this film earlier as it was very very good and it deserves all the good things that people say about it.<br/><br/>I was expecting a female Rocky film, and most of the film was and you wanted her to go further and with, you wanted him to be the manager, and when the title fight came up you knew it would be a hard fight but she would come out on top. And this is where the surprise kicked in - almost shock really - quite sad too.<br/><br/>One thing that i did find very hard was Morgan freeman talking all the way through the film, i love Morgan to bits and think he is a god, but his talking was like mumbling and i feel i missed important bits about the history of the story. But on the bright side i'll just have to watch it again to see what i missed.<br/><br/>Good film well worth a watch, Clint has done good."

From its first minutes to the very last scene I was stunned.<br/><br/>The narrator is, and may I say 'of course', Mr. Morgan Freeman - one of my favorite actors. He has an excellent voice does a very good job as the narrator as well as the former boxer Eddie. 'Million Dollar Baby' is directed by Mr. Clint Eastwood I haven't seen any of his movies before so to me, this was a nice experience.<br/><br/>'Million Dollar Baby' is a touching story and very well-done which makes it to one of the best movies of this decade.

","This is without a doubt Eastwood's best ever movie. From start to finish we see how one man can and will be able to make a difference in someone's life when they need them the most. As a martial artist I've always believed that the teacher appears when the student is ready, and never is this more apparent than with Swank's character.<br/><br/>I related to her in this, as I saw her family issues arise from her career success and the jealousy which can go with it. I also have to say it gives me tears every time I've watched it, and I simply refuse to see the end of it anymore. Its that good, its that powerful.<br/><br/>So if you're looking for a good movie, no, make that an awesome one, this is one to get. I rank it up there with The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile. Love it, simply love it.<br/><br/>9 out of 10."
"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","9","2","3","12 March 2006"," Heartwrenchingly powerful...it's a movie that nearly anyone can relate to and enjoy
","'Million Dollar Baby' was the first Oscar winning screenplay written by Paul Haggis (Crash). Directed by film legend Clint Eastwood, MDB is nearly perfect in every aspect of film making. When you see this, the acting of Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and especially Hilary Swank will leave you moved. Deserving of all the accolades it received, MDB is not only the best picture of 2004, but one of the best in history.<br/><br/>Frankie (Eastwood) is a very hardworking and talented boxing trainer, getting the most out of his fighters, even if their talent isn't Ali or Louis caliber. His most talented fighter has just left him (you see this in the movie) for more money, but is very sad he has to do so, and thanks Frankie by saying that he taught him all he would ever need to know. Then, one day, Frankie and his custodian (Freeman, who lives in the boxing gym) notice a young woman (Swank), Maggie Fitzgerald, punching a bag like clockwork every day. Frankie is at first annoyed by the upstart lady, rapidly declining her request that he train her. Over time, when Maggie tells her story of poverty, financial struggle, and desire to become a champion to Frankie, he reluctantly agrees to train her until she finds a manager. After Frankie decides to fully train and manage her, we see Maggie's success skyrocket. What ensues are some pretty intense boxing scenes. Also what begins is a fantastically acted father-daughter relationship between Frankie and Maggie.<br/><br/>We begin to see Maggie's success and popularity soar, and we get more insight into her life, especially her troubled past, consisting of a neglecting mother who we will grow to hate. Swank's performance as Maggie is so good that you will love Maggie so much for her determination to becoming a champion and her kick-ass approach in the ring. All the while, we get a preview of Maggie's ultimate opponent, a ruthless and dirty fighter, a fight which will scare the squeamish. It is hard to go on further without spoiling the plot, which I will not do.<br/><br/>The best acting of the movie comes after Maggie's big fight, and it is the reason the movie won so many awards. Eastwood's portrayal of Frankie's inner-struggle in life because of boxing over the years is just great. If not for Jamie Foxx's brilliant portrayal of Ray Charles, Eastwood would've won the Best Actor Oscar last year. Hilary Swank delivers one of the best performances in history as the chipper and lovable Maggie, and Morgan Freeman, while I have not mentioned him too much in this review, is once again great as usual. He is Frankie's right hand man, adviser, and best friend. What you'll notice is that each character will have a scene that defines their performance. Eastwood's is the last scene of the movie, Freeman's is in the middle-end of the movie when he is cleaning something, and Swank's is virtually every scene she is in. That's how good she is.<br/><br/>As I said before, it's really hard to review this movie without giving away plot details, and while I'm doing a horrible job of hiding that fact, Eastwood's direction and Haggis's writing do an excellent job of making the movie's most important events come out of nowhere to get to you. In most movies, you feel like you're just watching a fictitious adventure that's pretty cool. This is not the case. You'll feel as if you are getting a look into Frankie and Maggie's lives, and that is the mark of a job well done. You'll get the same feeling when watching 'Crash', which I've also reviewed. I'll admit, I watched this movie at my school's auditorium a few weeks ago because they showed it to kids who were excused from testing, but I decided to watch carefully and I'm glad I did. There's one other fact that made this movie so good: Never before had I seen something or someone that could silence 300 teenagers, but this movie did.<br/><br/>9/10 --spy"
"RNHunter","9","2","3","12 January 2006"," Not Just Boxing
","For those people who do not like boxing (such as me) take heart. It might not matter. In my opinion this movie transcends boxing, just as the movie Sea Biscuit was not just a horse race movie.<br/><br/>I have heard it said that when Clint Eastwood directs a film and is also a star in it, it will be a notch above most in seriousness and overall quality. Having added this one more Clint Eastwood picture to my viewing experience I have to agree. Clint Eastwood is definitely an interesting person. With no one to direct him but himself, he turns in a fabulous performance as an actor in this movie. Perhaps due to casting, perhaps due to Eastwood's direction and perhaps due to both, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman also deliver acting performances that were among the best I have seen anywhere. With this realistic acting, serious direction, and an interesting story line, Million Dollar Baby is easily one of the most powerful movies I can recall seeing in recent years. Powerful is the correct word. With both exceptional and yet believable roles played by Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman, and Clint Eastwood himself, one can easily get lost into the movie themselves seeing it through one of their eyes, and thus almost become a part of the film itself.<br/><br/>I know that some will try to typecast this movie and pigeonhole it as a certain type. Some will call it a boxing movie. Some will say it is a pro euthanasia movie. Now, I also believe that I am a moral person. However, to typecast this movie as simply as either of those I believe is to be unfair to Eastwood. Eastwood does not take the subject of boxing too seriously, and yet he more than does enough to render the subject of life and death itself a most serious matter in this movie also. In fact, after watching this movie, one wonders if Clint Eastwood is capable of being ""casual"" about anything. Clint Eastwood is a serious director, a serious actor, and a serious man.<br/><br/>I highly recommend watching this movie. However I would also caution what I say is its most important point - that of being a powerful movie. By powerful movie you may, as I was, become drawn deep into the movie and the story. When that happens you might want to cheer at the times when it has good news, and be very sad during the movie sad parts. That is what I believe powerful means.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie and am personally looking forward to the next Clint Eastwood production."

"mlscordia","9","2","3","22 December 2005"," this movie has deeply knocked out me!
","""Million Dollar Baby"" is far more than a movie to me: it's just a real piece of life. If you don't feel anything after watching it, you're either dead or lifeless. It's quite difficult to hold your tears back throughout its running time. It's full of sympathetic characters and it is, morally speaking, infinitely more complex than the greater part of current movies. This movie is not primarily about boxing. It's not an essay, it's art, a movie about human beings as close as I expected. It looks like a classic one, full-blooded movies which the characters, the director and the screenplay (regularly written by real writers) were a lot more important than special effects or box office. An interesting movie in itself, because of there are a lot of heartbreaking feelings inside. I have seen this movie several times. The first time I left the movie theater so impressed that I couldn't get out of my head for a while. That's why I bought its stunningly Original Motion Picture Soundtrack three months later. I recovered it on DVD as soon as it released to realize how endearing the relationship between the leading threesome was. Besides, they are losers but they fight to change their spells of bad luck with dignity. For example, Clint Eastwood's character doesn't stop sending letters to his only daughter in spite of the fact they are always send back to him over and over again. They don't lose hope because they insist on getting a second chance for themselves. Sometimes I believe that Clint Eastwood is not who he really is. Maybe he is John Ford reborn. He has taken from the everlasting master the style, the feelings and their reasons for I think old-time movies will never be forgotten. The future looks bright for Clint Eastwood. Even though he's a 75 year-old-film star he's at the top level of his profession thanks to his two latest masterpieces which have been a roaring success all over the world and has no plans to retire, anyway!"
"playitinG","9","2","3","6 December 2005"," Review of Million Dollar Baby
","We ordered this movie last night on PPV, and I didn't know anything about it except that it involved boxing and starred Clint Eastwood. While watching the last Oscar Awards, I saw Hillary Swank's acceptance speech and thought it was a bit over the top with emotion. Now I understand why, and I also understand why it's so important to see the nominated films before the awards! I have never seen Ms. Swank in any other movie, but as of today I am a die-hard fan. What a gut-wrenching, heartfelt, sincere performance she gave us! Not to mention her efforts put forth to recreate the physical and conditioning demands of such a role. <br/><br/>As for Clint Eastwood, his character holds immense content to create such a beautiful film. He is an inspiration to those of us who may be feeling less 'able' as we age. Although the narrative role of Morgan Freeman's character made me hearken back to 'The Shawshank Redemption', I did not mind the similarity. Like Shawshank, I found great comfort in hearing his voice. It provided some sort of calming reassurance through all the swirling emotions I felt as I watched this film. <br/><br/>I urge everyone who loves films to see this one and to tell everyone you know to see it as well."
"moniker_jones","9","2","3","6 November 2005"," A Knockout for Clint
","Forty years ago, Clint Eastwood was immersed in a trio of spaghetti westerns. Fifteen years later he was playing second banana to an orangutan named Clyde. Somewhere between the 1970s and turning 70, Mr. Eastwood became one hell of a director. Unforgiven landed him multiple Oscars, while Mystic River brought him some of the best reviews of his film-making career. The recent release of Million Dollar Baby has given even his most ardent doubters pause, displaying his continuously expanding talents before and behind the camera.<br/><br/>Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) is an aging boxing trainer whose modest gym acts as a second home to a ragtag crew of wannabes and runaways. His one genuinely gifted fighter leaves him shortly before hitting it big, citing Dunn's over-protective nature as the reason for his departure. Dunn's fears reach an all-time high when he finally agrees to train newcomer Maggie (Hilary Swank), despite an aversion to coaching women. Her persistence and stubbornness eventually wear him down. As expected, she proves herself a natural, overcoming every opponent in her path.<br/><br/>Swank's performance as the loyal, scrappy underdog cements her status as one of the great actresses of her generation. Eastwood's surprisingly emotional performance is a far cry from the one-dimensional, deadpan delivery he made chic decades ago. The story itself unfolds in unexpected ways, but its simple honesty is what truly sets it apart from many of today's flashier, self-important films. A few missteps aside, this is easily one of 2004's best efforts. Don't miss it.<br/><br/>Rating: A-"
"AppleBlossom","9","2","3","23 October 2005"," Clint Eastwood has done it again
","Clint Eastwood has done it again, directing and acting in another memorable film. 'Million Dollar Baby' will surely tug at your heartstrings by the end and give you some deserving reflection on parts of your own life too. The story encompasses a lot of human endurance's and dwells on the path one takes in life; whether it is the right onewe will never know for sure. It centers on the hopes and dreams of 3 main characters; - Frankie Dunn, Maggie Fitzgerald and Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris. Each has their own story to tell and this is done bit by bit throughout the film. Hilary Swank was a wise choice to play the part of Maggie Fitzgerald she is so convincing as the aspiring boxer with stars in her eyes. She wants to better herself and accomplish something in her life before it's too lateher dream to be the best boxer she can be. Not easy with an unwilling trainer and no previous formal training, which makes it that much harder. Yes, I suppose you've guessed by now this film is about female boxing and yes again, it's that good!!! Before I watched it I had no idea what it was about, not an inkling of what to expect at all.<br/><br/>The 4 Oscar Awards absolutely deserved.everything concerning the production is excellent. Not to mention the acting.as always Morgan Freeman steals the limelight with his role of Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris - the gym caretaker who adds warmth and humor to an otherwise lonely place. Quite different from Frankie where he shows sarcasm and less confidence, Eddie (Morgan) plays off this with such a natural acting ability. The two congeal their parts so perfectly and the dialogue exchange between the two is sharp and witty, you'll be snickering to yourself when you hear it.<br/><br/>'Million Dollar Baby' I think is a tremendous testimony of talent to one of today's most respected director/actor. Clint Eastwood has had a successful career behind the camera, he is (what I call) a thinking director  knows exactly how he wants his films done and simply does it. See it if you enjoyed watching the likes of 'Rocky' and 'Raging Bull'.not exactly on the same level of masculinity, though with a lot more heart!!! 9/10"
"Elendil87","9","2","3","10 October 2005"," a fine new addition to an American tradition in film-making
","Since the days of silent film and pioneer filmmakers such as DW Griffith, and the days of the Western and its main contenders like John Ford, and through the time of the gangster films of Raoul Walsh and the like, and until today, there has been a tradition in American film, a tradition of film-making and storytelling that chronicles the great struggle for self-fulfillment and achievement. In ""Million Dollar Baby"", we have a grand return to this form by Clint Eastwood, one of the quintessentially American filmmakers still working today. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is by no means a virtuoso film, or innovative in its use of the camera or cutting. Here is a film that sticks to tried and true methods such as continuity cutting, smooth tracking shots, and atmospherically centered and balanced mise-en-scene. The film establishes a true sense of place in the boxing ring, the gym, and the hospital. The camera takes us through the world revealing to us the truth of things rather than telling us the truth of things. The characters play out their interactions thus without stylistic interference. Indeed, Eastwood has mastered the Hollywood style. He has stripped it of all its commercial coverings, and shown us what American film-making is really all about: honesty. A character study of enormous depth that plays out in a tried and true narrative, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is not a hard nut to crack. It is a film about finding peace with oneself, about the generosity and determination of the human spirit. It is a film about the battles each of us fights but that no one likes to talk about. A great movie, it is about hope and redemption in the end. I was profoundly moved."
"winner55","8","2","3","23 September 2005"," Best cliché you'll see for sometime
","This film has received criticism for its use of clichés; and the clichés are here, and they are plentiful. But the production, direction, and acting breathe life into them to the extent that most of them are unnoticeable, and a few are even welcome. Morgan Freeman's character is pure formula, but to the extent that he is an excellent actor, who cares? and to the extent that this IS a ""boxing"" movie, where would it be without such a retired ""old-school"" boxer (punched-out eye and all) to comment on the nature of the sport? The fact is, the construction is so well-done that it is hard not to watch the film all the way through. And the main characters are, on the whole, very likable; we care about them.<br/><br/>A well-made, memorable presentation, even if we have seen these elements before."
"mwendel","7","2","3","5 September 2005"," This movie was not a sports movie.
","I can't honestly say if there are true spoilers in here, but I thought it would make sense to flag it since I relate some of my comments to the plot which could give it away.<br/><br/>This movie is not a sports movie. This movie is not the greatest boxing movie ever. This is a story about broken people reaching for the stars that just happens to involve boxing.<br/><br/>I recall when the movie came out all I heard about was the ""big twist"" and the way the movie changed halfway through to something bizarre and . I think that was because many people felt this was supposed to be a female version of Rocky, which it isn't. This isn't a feel good movie about a boxer who go lucky.<br/><br/>This is a story about a bunch of people, who did go after all of their dreams and put their entire lives on the line for it and, in my opinion, despite their best efforts seemed to fall short either due to no lack of trying, but just rotten luck.<br/><br/>Except for Maggie (Swank), In the beginning of this movie each character is flawed and broken, a mere shell of their former selves. This movie could have been done without the using of boxing at all, but I think it was an excellent choice of medium because boxing has been the source of many true bizarre tragic stories.<br/><br/>The portrayal of each of these characters is tremendous and for that alone the movie deserves many kudos. The story is fairly complete. I didn't think there were any real loose ends except for the ones that were deliberately created for cinematic and story telling purposes, not for sequel generation (doesn't everything seem like a trilogy these days?). I believe the filming of the movie was done with in an appealing, yet simplistic fashion, through the clever use of lighting and angles to bring solid atmospheres and emotions to different scenes - in some ways, I feel, similar to what Clint Eastwood did in Unforgiven.<br/><br/>While I feel this was an excellent movie, I don't think this is one I could watch over and over. I like movies like this except for that taste of dissatisfaction at the end, when you feel like nothing was every truly resolved despite the best efforts of the characters or the movie. Maybe I missed, something and there was more resolution that I though, but I don't feel like I did.<br/><br/>And for the parents who might read this, I think high school and up is the age range for this movie. I think younger kids might find some of the material very uncomfortable and disturbing."

","{rant}<br/><br/>I'm certain I'm not the only man who finds the main character of this film to be unbelievably winning, and the only movie character I've ever found myself actually falling for. God, that sounds lame. But apparently, it happens to guys as well, and it seems I'm not the only one. As me and my mates have discussed it, it boils down to this:<br/><br/>1) She doesn't try to be manipulative. She doesn't see herself as clever, as many women tend to. In stead, she does her best and gives her most, without regret. She doesn't try to sell herself with her ""interesting and quirky personality"", or push buttons. She wants to prove herself with achievement, actions. This is so incredibly rare, and stands out so much.<br/><br/>2) She is goodnatured. Not a mean streak in her.<br/><br/>3) Yeah, her being beautiful and feminine is a big part of it. But, though this is about the natural beauty of her face as well, it has much more to do with the way she acts and moves. A practical kind of femininity. Low on make-up, focusing very little on facial perfection, and in stead on fitness - which almost any of you can achieve - and feminine attitude - NOT to be confused with an attitude of weakness, as is too often the case. She's very respectful, but sure as hell not subservient.<br/><br/>* This is turning into a bit of a rant, heh. But, seriously - if I get to just one female out there, it's worth it. I know that you young and brainwashed minds are oozing about out there, so listen up: the main character of this movie summarizes what I so often hear men agree that they are missing and searching for. Take those other role models out there, the pretty and weak and clever and dependant ones, and ****'em. They get attention, but of the short-lived and mean kind. In stead, be just half of what this girl is... and the worthwhile ones will single you out.<br/><br/>Another amazing thing about this girl is that she would never excuse not bothering the effort by saying that it's ""too late"" to begin. <br/><br/>{/rant}"

Somehow, though, this stereotyping didn't bother me. The movie had a fairy-tale feel to it, which made it easy for me to ""suspend disbelief."" I found when it was all over that I wanted more. I'd spring for a whole movie just on Frankie Dunn (e.g. the story behind the feud between him and his daughter) or Eddie Dupris (such as his rise and fall in the boxing world, and why he too had so much passion for the sport, and how he maintained such a strong sense of morals and ethics through it all). I too thought there was no way that Maggie could've lost the fight after a sucker punch like that, so I refused to believe it, chalked it up to a lack of follow-up details, and moved on. I commend Hilary Swank for her outstanding performance; after all, to pull off Maggie Fitzgerald's passion for boxing, Swank had to be equally passionate about the role."

"movieguy1021","9","2","3","17 February 2005"," Million Dollar Baby: 9/10
","Million Dollar Baby is propaganda by the baby-killing liberals. As is every movie dealing with a controversial issue, especially ones made by those ultra-liberal people at Warner Bros. and that staunch Democrat Clint Eastwood. It seems like the only part of movies people talk about is the ending, even in crappy movies. Supposedly, prints of Hide and Seek were sent out without the final reel, so no one would know the ending until the time came (as if anyone cared). Remember the furor around The Sixth Sense's ending? Everyone knows it now, and if you're not careful, you'll uncover the ending to Million Dollar Baby-a true shocker, if there ever was one. It's unexpected, realistic, and powerful. Try getting that from Hide and Seek.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank (in what is sure to be her second Best Actress Oscar role) is Maggie Fitzgerald, a trailer-park wanna-be boxer who joins up in has-been Frankie Dunn's (Clint Eastwood) gym. Frankie has somewhat of a misogynist attitude, but agrees to train her, anyway. She rises through the circuits of boxing very quickly, and, although reluctantly, Frankie starts to admit that she's a good boxer.<br/><br/>Before I saw Baby, I thought for sure the Academy would finally give the best director award to Martin Scorsese for his mediocre work in The Aviator. But now, I think Eastwood's almost a shoo-in for Best Director. Eastwood frames each shot carefully, and creates the most drama possible from each one. Something that really stood out for me was his use of color. Oftentimes bleak, but always for a purpose, to elict some sort of feeling from the audience. Eastwood uses the minimum of, well, everything possible to make the mood as dreary and unwasteful as possible. And, much like Raging Bull (directed by Eastwood's current rival), the boxing scenes are completely realistic. Except you can tell Eastwood didn't cheat at all (like Scorsese probably did), as this movie is full color, and the boxing scenes build up so much tension it's almost impossible to believe. Million Dollar Baby has both that and the dramatic quality, which ranks it up with the top films of 2004.<br/><br/>The bigger question at hand is this: whodathunk that within five years, a relatively unknown actress will have had two roles of a lifetime and win best actress in five years. Swank was amazing (although not as amazing as Chloe Sevigny, who was robbed) as Brandon Teena/Teena Brandon in Boys Don't Cry, but better here in Million Dollar Baby. Her character is so determined, such a strong spirit basically rising from nothing, and Swank portrays Maggie extremely well. I guess she'll make Annette Bening lose again this year.<br/><br/>Is Million Dollar Baby the best picture of the year? No, mainly because in the last twenty or thirty minutes, it just drags on and on. The message and plot are clear, yet it continues to reiterate it over and over again. We know that the person wants to do something, and another person doesn't want that to happen, but seriously, do we need that extra fifteen minutes of no substance? That's the only complaint I have with this strong, strong movie. What's even better is that it's PG-13, meaning anyone can see it, which they should.<br/><br/>My rating: 9/10 Rated PG-13 for violence, some disturbing images, thematic material and language."
"ikanboy","8","2","3","12 February 2005"," Manipulative? Yes. Great? Yes.
","The critics who haven't liked this movie have called it manipulative. Well, they're right! But who cares! Eastwood sucked me in so beautifully that I'm willing to let it pass. As has been said before there is a major shift in this movie that really changes it's message and, excuse the pun, is it ever a sucker punch! Hillary is great, as are Clint and Morgan. Clint even shows some chops as an actor. Sure he's still doing himself, but he really takes on the character. The movie doesn't come close to the depth or sophistication of ""Mystic River"". The story, or rather the two stories, are predictable. Will our spunky heroine win over the old grouch? Will she make good? Will we root her on? You betcha! It's corny but there's good corn and bad corn, and Clint pulls his punches enough ( I'm sorry!) for it to work as solidly good entertainment.<br/><br/>******SPOILER****** <br/><br/>Now to those self righteous conservatives who derided Clint's ending. People this is a morality tale! That means the morals aren't cut and dried. Clint makes a decision that is not going to be accepted by those who want people in movies to act in accordance with the rule: only God can take life. Oops, I forgot, those kind of people are usually for capital punishment. Darn! Morality sure is complicated isn't it! O.K. only God can take life except for those people who deserve to die. Why do I keep thinking that Christianity is anti violence. It's just anti bad people."

","i went to see this film expecting it to be amazing like a lot of people say but, having seen it i would rate it as an average film.<br/><br/>The first problem is that the acting is so underplayed that, as an audience member, i found it hard to really feel any connection to the characters. If i had, perhaps i would have cried but i didn't, i just felt like a distanced spectator. Clint Eastwood, as a withdrawn boxing owner played his part well, the problem was just that, he was withdrawn. Realism in film is good to a point, here it was overdone.<br/><br/>However the film was well made and kept my attention throughout. Hilary Swanks portrayal of a gutsy boxer probably does deserve an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Overall a good film, but overrated, and there are films/actors out there far more deserving of academy awards - not that that makes a difference."
"Sargebri","Null","2","3","29 January 2005"," Probably the Greatest Film on Boxing, Period
","This has to be one of, if not, the finest films ever done on the sport of boxing. The fight scenes are great, but its the gentler moments between Hillary Swank and Clint Eastwood that help make this film what it is. However, the true glue of this film is Morgan Freeman. He definitely provides a true center as the narrator of the story. It is his gentle nature that helps make this film an all time classic. Also, this is a great story about relationships. You pretty much can see this as Frankie pretty much establishes with Maggie, the relationship that he wishes that he could have had with his own daughter. This relationship really comes to a head especially at the end.<br/><br/>The other thing that I really liked about the film is that unlike most boxing films, it doesn't end with the big bout that sees her win the title and become champion. Instead, it uses that scene to pretty much set up the real strong part of the film. This film is definitely a great film not only on boxing, but on relationships as well."
"denghowun","7","2","3","28 January 2005"," Technical issues are obstacle to greatness
","Beautifully acted, Million Dollar Baby nonetheless suffers from some technical deficiencies that render it among the ""might have been"" films of history. First, the champion 'Blue Bear' in the climax championship fight would have been disqualified, and very likely charged with criminal assault. Second, in the Nursing home, if a monitor is turned off, an alarm goes off at the Nurses' station--that in fact would be how they knew that Maggie Fitzerald had bitten her tongue. Third, this Nursing home was allegedly providing good care; yet the gangrene-caused amputation would not have been needed if the patient was provided with appropriate exercise (e.g. Christopher Reeve). Finally, Frankie Dunn's fingerprints would have been on the breathing tube; the surge in adrenalin would have been discovered at autopsy, and he would then be a fugitive in a murder case.<br/><br/>Hollywood finds liberal issues attractive, such as the euthanasia applied to Maggie, and this film will no doubt receive a number of academy awards--perhaps even best picture--but is over-rated. Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank turned in superb performances, and any awards they receive are deserving. The film itself disappoints, and it is a shame. None of the technical issues noted above needed to be there."

","I really don't think this critique is a spoiler, but rather a bitter disappointment. This movie had all the earmarks of being another Rocky or even BETTER. But, somewhere Clint lost his vision on this movie. This film started out as an insiders look into the goings on of professional boxing. It was really interesting to see the skill and technical aspects of boxing brought out by an interesting storyline of a young girl, who is literally fighting her way out of poverty and trying to make a place for herself. Hilary Swank was fantastic in this movie, though most of her lines were standard Hollywood fair...she did the best she could with the script presented her. Her physical prowess was and is unbelievable...she really is a knockout. Morgan Freeman turned in one of his finest performances to date. His repartees with Clint were special. His compassion for the plight of his fellow boxers was special. He is totally deserving of an Oscar nod for this performance. Clint Eastwood as actor/director turned in his now stock old tough guy performance...Gunny Hightower goes boxing...same gruff voice that is supposed to have one believe he is an old lion, still ready to bite. Though his ongoing debate with the local parish priest was humorous. I didn't see anything special from his performance and found the Hightower experience annoying. Clint as director...oh my god. Your filming a boxing movie, that is really interesting, informative and realistic. Your in the squared circle, describing to those who are unaware, the sweet science of boxing, the subtleties and the nuances of balance, grace, defense, footwork, training, the usage of speed bags, the heavy bag...etc..then you tell the story of a women in boxing, a true advent of the awakening of the woman as athlete, in sports that were deemed for men only, and you tell it well. But, the dreaded 'but' word, you take a carnival, cheesy Hollywood spin on the sport you are so compellingly telling. WHY? WHY? WHY? Instead of showing a championship fight where a fighter can and DO get hurt, unfortunately, you disgrace the sport with a comedic mockery that is something you might see from a Hollywood B minus movie. What a schlockfest. Then the hospital scenes should have been saved for 'Snow White Goes to the Snake Pit'. Have you know shame? The despicable scenes in the hospital are too felonious to mention. All I can say is for the traumatized paraplegics that fight for their breathes every single second of every day. Praying for a miracle and that modern science can one day help them. For them you should be ashamed of your ending. I was sickened by this cheap, lowbridge schlockfestival. If ever you could wish for a Hays Commission...or someone to put smelling salts under Eastwoods nose...this would have been it. I don't normally write bad reviews for a movie, but one piece of cow manure like this is hoisted up as some pretense to wave the Clint Eastwood flag...shame on you. For this film to be placed in contention for an Oscar is a disgrace to the Academy and the awards they represent."
"zkonedog","10","1","1","11 February 2020"," As Close To A Perfect Movie As One May Get
","I've probably seen ""Million Dollar Baby"" a solid 4-5 times now in my lifetime thus far. Despite that intimate knowledge of plot, characters, and even dialogue, the experience never fails to enthrall me on an emotional level. I truly consider this to be one of the best films ever created.<br/><br/>For a very basic overview, ""Million Dollar Baby"" tells the story of Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), an incredibly dedicated yet utterly raw boxer desperate for a trainer to give her an opportunity. She turns to Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), a grizzled old gym owner who is initially reluctant to ""train a girl"" until recognizing her work ethic and drive. While both fighter and trainer initially fill gaps in each other's lives, their partnership is eventually tested to the max in the face of incredible tragedy.
There are so many areas that combine together to make ""Million Dollar Baby"" a near-perfect film:<br/><br/>The plot is great not only for fans of pugilism, but also for anyone that loves a Rocky-like underdog story. The character of Maggie is so expertly constructed and easy to root for that it makes the ending of her arc that much more of a gut punch. The way she softens Frankie's outlook on life will also pull on your heartstrings.<br/><br/>The inclusion of Morgan Freeman as essentially the narrator of the movie is a brilliant move. Not only does his voice provide the perfect backdrop for all the emotional cues, but his character (""Scrap"") serves a key role in bridging the gap between Maggie and Frankie.<br/><br/>The music is almost an entity in and of itself in this film, providing a very distinct experience. From Eastwood's own simply piano melodies to the sweeping orchestra that takes over in the emotional throes, this is a soundtrack that will stick with you.<br/><br/>Of course, the gut-punch last 20-30 minutes absolutely comes out of nowhere and changes the entire tenor of the piece. What had been a fairly traditional (if still eminently enjoyable) underdog sports movie turns on a dime to examine issues like euthanasia and personal redemption. This is where the acting really shines. A particular scene where Eastwood's Frankie is asked-by Maggie-for an almost unthinkable request is one of the best reaction shots I've ever seen put to film. Really, the entire cast here give nuanced, spot-on performances.<br/><br/>I really struggle to find criticisms of ""Million Dollar Baby"" whatsoever. There is not a single wasted line of dialogue or scene to be found. Everything is ""paid off"" at some point, which is the sign of a fantastic screenplay.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a film that rests squarely within my ""top five movies of all-time"" list. I'll never forget how it seemingly came out of nowhere in late 2004 to ultimately take home 4 Oscars and be nominated for three more. The emotional rollercoaster this film takes you on is absolutely second to none."
"brchthethird","6","1","1","24 March 2015"," Three excellent central performances elevate a clichéd story
","Clint Eastwood must have gotten soft in his old age. While this isn't necessarily a criticism, MILLION DOLLAR BABY walks a fine line between emotionally powerful drama and sappy, overly sentimental melodrama. Fortunately despite the predictable plotting and cliché dialogue, it has a trio of excellent performances that keep it out of the kitchen sink. Front and center is Hilary Swank as Maggie, a down-on-her-luck waitress who aspires to be a boxer. Her performance is what really makes the film work due to her irrepressible spirit and down-home charm. Clint Eastwood also does an admirable job as Frankie Dunn, who reluctantly (""I don't train girls"") takes a role as Maggie's trainer, manager, and mentor. And then there's Morgan Freeman, one of Frankie's former fighters, and who also co-runs a gym with him. I will admit that his presence in the film adds some depth as he is a connection to Frankie's past, but I didn't feel like he was integral to the story. Still, he had one of the film's best scenes when he shows that despite losing an eye (and being old), that he still has ""it"" in the ring. Beyond these three central performances, the film seems content to stick to the tired sports movie formula of having a older mentor train a younger up-and-comer, at least for the first 3/4. Despite the film having been out now for over 10 years, I still won't give away the sharp turn the story takes. At that point the film becomes something else which is more obviously heavy-handed and didn't quite work for me. It also doesn't help that the film strongly hints at the outcome very early on, robbing it of a lot of the emotional impact. And that is actually my biggest problem with the film. Not content to let the performances and story stand on their own, Paul Haggis (a producer/co-writer) insists on holding the audience's hand throughout the entire film. It didn't work for me in CRASH, and didn't really work for me here either. Still, Clint Eastwood manages to elevate the material to the point where I didn't hate myself for watching it. Overall, the three central performances are enough to loosely recommend this film, but just be aware that it is somewhat heavy-handed and relies a little too much on genre clichés."
"MovieGuy109","8","1","1","22 October 2011"," Good study from Eastwood
","Million Dollar Baby is arguably the most well-acted film of 2004 and the most compelling. It holds our attention almost all the way through with its passionate storytelling. Swank and Freeman are both entrancing in Oscar-winning efforts and Eastwood is no less enthralling as Swank's grizzled trainer. Eastwood does not focus on as much the boxing itself, but the nature of the characters that participate in the sport. The only flaw is the murky, strange ending that does not sum up the film in the way our emotions want. However, 95% of this is excellent movie-making that challenges the viewer to think, not just watch and listen."

","To tell you the truth I'm not a big fan of boxing, in fact I think it is basically repugnant sport (if two people trying to brain each other can really be considered a sport). So for this film to win me over, it had to be really special. And it was. One of the reasons for this is that although the film does show the positive aspects of boxing, it doesn't glorify it. You see everything – the glory, the pain, the heartbreak, the feeling of belonging that is all some people have to hold on to. This film takes you on a real roller-coaster of emotion, taking you from the bottom to the top and back again.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is the story of a female boxer Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), her trainer Frankieie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), and his sidekick and business partner Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman). If anyone had doubts about the genius of Clint Eastwood, they should run, not walk to see ""Million Dollar Baby"", perhaps the best movie that came out of Hollywood about boxing after Raging Bulls. But mind you Million Dollar Baby is not a feminist version of Raging Bull, intent on bludgeoning the audience with gritty violence. Nor is it a maudlin rewrite of 'The Champ' or a woman's version of 'Rocky'. Million Dollar Baby is a rhapsody about life, using the harsh world of boxing as a metaphor.<br/><br/>In ""Million Dollar Baby,"" Frankie is a trainer and manager who never seems to know when to make a move or throw in the towel. He is also the owner of the Hit Pit, a boxing gym where would-be contenders look to flourish under Frankie. The gym manager is one of his former boxers, Eddie ""Scrap Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman). After Eddie's career ended, Frankie became less sure of himself as a manager. Eddie tells us, though, that Frankie is the best cut man he's ever seen. Frankie can prepare virtually anyone to get back into the ring between rounds.<br/><br/>Enter Maggie Fitzgerald, a woman who squeaks out a living by waiting tables at a local restaurant. She has some street smarts, and some talents using her fists. Her dream is to be a champion female boxer and she knows just the place to practice- the gymnasium operated by Frankie. Maggie wants Frankie to be her coach and her persistence pays off when he finally gives in and agrees to train her in the sport of boxing.<br/><br/>What makes this film so entertaining is its winning formula. On every level, this movie succeeds at captivating the audience and making them anticipate the next scene. Here story isn't as predictable as other sports films and many scenes will catch you off guard. A great movie does not need awesome special effects, loud musical scoring, fad or fashion. It just needs plain old-fashioned quality film making where talented people perform at the top of their craft.<br/><br/>'Millon Dollar Baby' strikes you when it's least expected. There are many points which leave you wonder: What do you live for? For basic survival or for reaching your goal, so you can be your true self? Are you willing to pay for it? No matter what? And what is life about? If you had seen the film, you would understand what I'm talking about."
"andreas_14_99","8","1","1","28 April 2006"," Clint Eastwood is The Man! :D
","Since I hadn't really heard anything about this film before watching it, I didn't really know what to expect. But somehow I knew that it wouldn't really be about boxing. That's quite easy to figure out. I knew that there's was gonna be a deeper meaning to the film, but I just wasn't sure what that was and how it would develop.<br/><br/>So finally taking myself some time to watch the movie I first felt a little bit uninterested, mostly watching to have seen it and being able to state my opinion afterward. However it didn't take long to get into the film, and when I did I found myself appreciating it a lot. Of course there are classic clichés and predictable elements in the plot at times. And already from the beginning you know something is eventually gonna go wrong. But that doesn't really matter. Even if you do know that, you don't know exactly what's gonna go wrong or how you're going to feel when it does. You don't know how strong feelings you've been led to build up for the main characters.<br/><br/>Nowadays, when making a movie, it isn't easy to avoid repeating some parts and turns in the plot that has already appeared in an earlier movie or several, since most movies already have dealt with most themes. And I know some people have criticized Eastwood for this film. Calling it overrated, saying it's cliché and so on. But It's how you do the film that matters. Of course originality is important in a film. But definitely also equally important is how the actors manage, what they deliver and how it all adds up in the end. What you feel during, and mostly important what you feel after the movie. ""Have you learned anything?"". ""How did you feel?"" etc.<br/><br/>What Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby regards I really got to say that I found the acting superb, mostly on Hillary Swanks part. But even Eastwood and Freeman were great as almost always. And the plot - although containing predictable elements at times - was also great and captivating. I was totally drawn into the drama of the film and felt for both Maggie as well as Frankie in the end. It was really chocking and horrifying what happened to her. Even before the fight you just know that something bad will happen. But even so, when it does, You can't help but to suffer for her sake. I would say what happens to her towards the end of this film is one of the cruelest destinies for any human to suffer in life. It lets you appreciate you're own life situation.<br/><br/>So what can be taught by this film? What do we learn? They way I see it, we learn that however cruel it seems to be what happened to Maggie we must dare to live our lives. Live out our dreams and not be afraid. Whatever happens to us it will be worth it if we've had a fulfilling life. Just think about it. Even if you protect yourself you're whole life what is it worth protecting for if you don't follow that dream? Although a classic theme - depicted in many films before and will be in several films to follow - it was nicely done in this one. Great Job Clint Eastwood! (Beside this is just my interpretation of the movie, you may have another one)...Anyhow, I seriously recommend you to see this film, you will be moved..."

","I can't add any more to the superlatives already voiced on this movie. Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, Hilary Swank. How much better does it get? What really caught me off guard was the expression placed on her robe . It has been many years since I have heard this but as a youngster I was quite familiar with it. After supper in our home we, the children, would have to do our homework right away. In the background my Mom would be on the piano and my Dad singing all sorts of tunes. It was their ""thing"" at the time since money was scarce and it was their relaxation and entertainment. One song was brought back the instant I heard this term mentioned in the movie and I almost ""shot right out of my seat with the wonderful flashback it gave me. My Dad always sang a tune called,""-- -------,Mo Chuisle, Mo Chree"".It speaks to me of family in a personal sense and movie-making a la Eastwood speaks of ""family"" in so many ways as well.What a bonus!

","Clint Eastwood directed this Oscar-winning film debating the above question. Should he or shouldn't he train a woman for fighting in the ring?

It's, unfortunately, too good to be true. There is another young woman hot on her heels and eventually, she throws a punch that knocks us all for a loop.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman, last year's best supporting actor, for his role as the trainer, moderates our story.<br/><br/>With Swank fatally hurt, we turn our attention to moral issues of letting patients die. We also see the immoral behavior of her family, they showed themselves to be there only for the buck.<br/><br/>If Russell Crowe is this year's ""Cinderella Man,"" Miss Swank is certainly our damsel in distress. <br/><br/>Eastwood's dilemma, after his ill-fated decision to train Swank, is whether or not to pull the plug. He consults a priest just before he does what he felt is morally right. I cannot fathom that the father would justify this. Am sure he consulted with him on this grave issue of the day, euthanasia."

","I admit, I have not seen any Clint Eastwood or Hilary Swank movies before. Before watching this movie, I never understood all the hype and awards surrounding this movie. However, after watching it, I have to give credit to Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood for putting up such great performances.<br/><br/>The story is a very compelling one, with characters who are both yearning for success. The enthusiasm and eagerness to learn of Maggie reflects the tough life she has led and the difficulties she has gone through. The way her family treats her is heartbreaking. It seems that she puts out all her frustrations in the ring.<br/><br/>The relationship Maggie and Frankie have can be likened to a father-daughter relationship. The lack of any contact Frankie has with his daughter Katie constantly nags at him every time, and he has grown to love Maggie not just as his apprentice, but also as his daughter and he is determined to hold on to her.<br/><br/>This movie not only has a compelling story and complex personalities, it also has a very thought-provoking ending. It makes you ponder about your relationship with your own father, especially if you are a female. Frankie finally finds the courage in himself but who knows what burdens he carries?"
"AshokePrabha","8","1","1","24 October 2005"," A very good work.
","In general, I like Clint Eastwood's films. Million dollar baby is a sincere and realistic work. There is a small, strange story with two strange people. A boxing coach with such dedication and a soft soul covered by ruggedness, and a girl with such determination to become a champion. The story becomes unique with the characterizations of Dunn and Maggie. There are bad people in the story but they are not purposefully exposed to be 'villainous'. Her mom and sister were not that much loving as a normal poor family with a bad/dead daddy and living in bad surroundings expect to be. <br/><br/>The main good thing is the story line and the script; both of them with sincerity and dedication. Next ones are the acting, music and photography and in fact direction of Clint. I wondered about Clint Eastwood's music. It was very simple. I don't know it involved any mind boggling composing of tunes. It was just plain but it was more than enough. In this modern world with readily perverted, what-the-heck kind of minds, this kind of plain good simple-natured story and characters might look odd. It did (that is why these Oscars I guess). I loved this film. It's like a perfect little short story (of two hours time though). Many criticizing comments read Morgan Freeman has nothing to play. But as I see it, Freeman adds more depth into the story. Watch it if you can go with slow-moving but strong stories."

","Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby is a good film that has a lot of good performances especially Morgan Freeman's performance. It seems like in every movie he is great in. He is a terrific actor and he made this movie a plus. To me, he was better than all the actors in the movie, even Hilary Swank. The script was pretty good also and Paul Haggis is going to have a great future in his writing. The boxing scenes are quite intense and it makes you just want to get in the boxing ring and fight someone. That's what I like in intense movies. *Major spoiler ahead*. There are a few clichés though and I thought that the white trash girl who meets the old trainer and becomes great instantly, then gets hit and is paralyzed, but old trainer happens to pop up and kill her because she asked him too got a little to over the top and it just didn't get to me that great. I don't know but on some parts, it didn't quite get to me that good, like the ending. Overall, Million Dollar Baby was a good movie that had a big heart. Paul Haggis's screenplay is good, the score is good, and Morgan Freeman's narration is great to listen to. He brings a lot of great and enthusiastic dialogue in his narration. I could see why Million Dollar Baby got best picture. I recommend it.<br/><br/>Hedeen's Outlook: 7.5/10 *** B-"

","This movie is really two movies in one. The first half is about an aspiring woman boxer and the problems she must overcome to get where she wants to go, and also about her trainer and how he gets involved with her. But the second half of this movie is the real drama, about how people affect each other's lives and how they find meaning by taking that one shot and how they face adversity. I would have given this movie a perfect ten but I was really in the mood for something a little more uplifting, instead of deep.

"esteban1747","8","1","1","8 May 2005"," Is professional boxing a real sport?
","Since long time I am convinced of the need to prohibit men professional boxing, so for women it is much more obvious, and this film probably reflects much of our concern about this ""sport"" managed and ruled often by gangs. I still remember the Tyson-Hollyfield match, where Tyson finished biting Hollyfield's ear, ridiculous and anti sport behavior, but Tyson after sometime started to box again. Professional boxing destroyed several valuable boxers, among them Joe Louis, Kid Gavilan and others. Often you have an invented champion like Benny Parets in the 50s, who at the end was killed in the ring in a match with Emile Griffith. Parets was never a real champion, he was just the bait for a big match with Griffith, who was much better than Parets. Here the film goes around a girl of a very humble origin, with a family nearly illiterate and a bit wild. She wanted to help their relatives working and boxing, but her family wanted all money earned by her without giving any service to her at all. She (Hilary Swank) was persistent in her intentions to become a boxer, and was good under the advice of his trainer (Clint Eastwood), and got nearly all victories in the ring except one. The film plot is interesting in general, but I am asking myself: what happened to that wild woman boxer who did not follow the rules of the fight? The film never said nothing about her final fate, probably she continued behaving herself as she was. In boxing the spectacle is much more important than the human's life, the rules are made to see bloodshed, people falling down after several punches and agonizing. There is no protection to the man, at the end if he/she dies, who cares? These constraints are well shown by the film, which could have gone deeper into this problem, but probably Eastwood preferred to show some insides of this ""game"". It is not the first film about the problem of professional boxing, but it's the first one including women. Good acting of Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, in fact both really were well awarded by their acting, Eastwood was also good but a little bit under the level of Swank and Freeman."

This is, to put it nicely, a terrible movie. Until the ending, the movie's message seems to be ""you can accomplish anything if you try hard"". And then comes the ending, which destroys any possibilities of a moral from this movie. Eastwood does nothing new, playing his standard, anti-hero, ""tough guy"" role. Morgan Freeman appears in this embarrassing movie, but miraculously, manages not to embarrass himself. This is a film overridden with clichés, absolutely boring and lifeless.

"moonspinner55","5","5","12","9 March 2005"," Ready-built for tragedy
","Clint Eastwood's directorial career has brought forth some very spotty pictures; when he loses his dryly-askew sense of humor, Eastwood becomes a muddled, one-dimensional filmmaker. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is much better than ""Mystic River"" in that it features sympathetic characters, multi-layered performances and an intriguing scenario that doesn't initially seem to follow a by-the-numbers formula. By the second-half however, both the script and Eastwood's agendas change drastically (not from a boxing movie into a character study, that would be too easy; it becomes something even more sentimental). It's certainly easy for the viewer to flow with the changes: Eastwood's professionalism provides a smooth contrast in moods and scenario. However, it's a disappointing right-turn that the story takes, and nothing is really done with the new venue anyway. It seems to say that life is rough--for the female boxer, for the manager, for the assistant, and for the (God help us) spindly-legged mental kid who hangs out at the gym (in a gratuitous subplot designed to give mentor Morgan Freeman a few extra scenes). An occasionally unpleasant and queasy picture with built-in pathos and over-the-top writing, the movie takes a good while to get cooking, but does provide some solid drama. Eastwood never lapses into soap opera; he's an intelligent and caring actor-director (while also providing somber, quietly effective mood music on the soundtrack). However, the assembly-line progression of situations are disappointingly trotted out and, even though the finale is moving, the set-up for it is almost mechanical. ** from ****"
"scoochie9","10","4","9","29 January 2008"," A Perfect Film
","After having watched this movie for probably the tenth time, I feel compelled to shout my love for it from a mountain top (or at least, from the IMDb commentary page)! ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a masterpiece in all possible respects. The brilliant screenplay could in no way be improved upon. The story is beautiful, gritty, sweet, tragic, warmly funny at times, and profound. The method of delivery as the story is written (which we find out at the end), is not merely icing on the cake, it's like lightning striking a crate of fireworks stored in the viewer's heart.<br/><br/>The acting is impeccably understated, as it should be. I watched it this last time trying to imagine how it would have played if the lines were said differently, by anyone else. (I'm a movie dork, I know.) It could have come off as really schmaltzy and melodramatic if the actors hadn't been so very sensitive, and the direction hadn't been right on key.<br/><br/>Speaking of direction, I suppose it's time we mentioned one Sir (he must be a ""Sir"" by now, mustn't he? Dude's an artistic genius after all...) Clint Eastwood. Not only did he bring the ideal combination of crotchetiness and underlying tenderness to the roll of ""Frankie"", aka ""Boss"", with his acting, not only did he direct (gently--I've heard he's the favorite director of all actors) the gifted Oscar-Winners Hilary Swank and (the incomparable) Morgan Freeman to do their finest, he actually composed the emotionally resonant soundtrack! <br/><br/>I find myself torn between wanting to prostrate (not prostate, that's something else altogether) myself before Mr. Eastwood, and wanting to slap him upside the head for being so darn talented... Bastard. (Just kidding!) My only disappointment was that he didn't win the Oscar for Best Actor.<br/><br/>This film is not for the faint of heart. I went in thinking it would be like ""Rocky"". It was, for the majority of it... then it took a most unexpected dramatic turn. I loved ""Rocky"", but ""Million Dollar Baby"" is an entirely different animal: an animal to be reckoned with, and an animal to be loved."

Clint Eastwood proved again with this film that he is one of the great American directors, in a class with his hero, John Ford. Under his direction both Hillary Swank and Morgan Freeman won well deserved Oscars and Eastwood himself won two more for Best Picture and Best Director. Finally, Paul Haggis was nominated for the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar.<br/><br/>No movie is perfect and ""Million Dollar Baby"" is no exception. Many of its characters are cartoonish characterizations, used as props for the more fully developed manager Frankie, played by Eastwood, His fighter, Maggie, played by Swank, and ""Scrap,"" Frankie's faithful friend and employee, played by Freeman. Maggie's hillbilly family, the brutish fighter, who Maggie fought for a championship, and a couple of the hangers on in Frankie's gym are examples of the less than believable characters in the film. <br/><br/>But don't be put off by these overdrawn characters, for they are merely props designed to illustrate the relationships among Frankie, Maggie, and Scrap, who are fully realized and entirely believable. Frankie and Maggie come to love one another as the father and daughter each has lost. Although Scrap and Frankie are each other's dearest friend, each recognizes the weaknesses of the other. These relationships are used to dramatize the anguish of a moral dilemma and the triumph of the human spirit in the face of great odds. Not to be missed."

It's even more gratifying to see Hollywood, the ultimate Land of Youth, honor a seventy-something year old director. And what a bargain. At the cost of a mere $18 million you know right up front that money wasn't thrown at it to make it more appealing to today's typically shallow movie going public. Usually the first 20 million or so goes directly into lining the pockets of some lousy, over-rated star who's supposed to supersede actual creativity in order to guarantee a decent box office crowd. I'd love to shake the hand of the gutsy Hollywood execs who green-lighted this one. Some of the best decision making Tinsletown has ever seen. No gun play, no fireballs, no CGI showboating and NO NUDITY. Not even nudity ""intregal to the plot line!"" and yet it actually succeeded in creatively topping every other film of 2004.

","I'm amazed at the strength of this movie, ""Million Dollar Baby."" I'm also amazed at how far its director and lead actor, Clint Eastwood, has progressed as a filmmaker. (It's easy to see that his ""Dirty Harry"" days are way behind him.) Since 1992's ""Unforgiven,"" we've seen an insightful, straightforward way of storytelling from the actor-turned-director, who has developed the most unique talent of any filmmaker alive today, which is to understand his characters and present them in a significant, but not overstated fashion that brings about their emotions, pains, and successes. His latest film, adapted by screenwriter Paul Haggis from stories printed in ""Rope Burns: Stories from the Corner"" by the late F.X. Toole, searches the souls of three people in the boxing ring of life. The first is old and tired gym owner Frankie Dunn (Eastwood), the type of world-weary character Eastwood specializes in, who knows the ring inside-out and reads poetry in his spare time. The second is hillbilly (white trailer trash?) Maggie Fitzgerald (a knockout powerhouse played by Oscar-winner Hilary Swank), who thinks boxing is the only way out of her job as a waitress, which she has been doing since the tender age of 13. Frankie reluctantly takes her under his wing and their path leads her on an escapable course with destiny. She trains hard, sweats hard, knocks out the competition in one round for several bouts (a feat that embarrasses the daylights out of certain managers), and a chance at a title shot if she can unseat the brutal Billie ""The Blue Bear"" (Lucia Rijker). She makes a complete turnaround in character, going from bright-eyed rookie to seasoned professional, and the way the film tracks her progress is relayed to us beautifully. Lastly, there is Scrap (Morgan Freeman), who is also the story's narrator. Scrap is sincere in his narration in yet another world-weary manner like Eastwood and doesn't twist or play with his words to make points. As a former fighter who Frankie once trained, he's blind in one eye, out of the ring, but possess the wisdom worthy of one to tell a story like Frankie and Maggie's. It's not hard to see why Roger Ebert showered it with praise; nothing in his review convinced me he was lying. The raw power of ""Million Dollar Baby"" lies in the performances and straightforward narrative of the story, all of which I described earlier. It won four Oscars and two Golden Globes, though sadly enough the emotional score that Eastwood himself composed didn't win anything. This is the best movie about boxing and boxers I've seen since ""Rocky"" (1976). But right there is the distinction. ""Million Dollar Baby"" isn't so much about boxing and winning the title as it is a close inspection of the relationship of three different people. ""Rocky"" is about that one shot, that one chance to make something of yourself; this film is about living those dreams. ""Million Dollar Baby"" - a knockout.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Mushaka2003","10","3","6","8 September 2005"," Million Dollar Baby
","Million Dollar Baby starring Hillary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I think that it deserves most of the awards that it won. This movie is about Maggie,a southern girl who works as a waitress and will take the leftover food from her customer and lie that it is for her dog because she can hardly afford anything for herself. Then she starts to want to box. In the opening scene you see her watching a boxing match. At the end of the fight she tries to talk to one of the managers of one of the boxers to see if he wanted to manage her. He denies her and then the next day she decides to go over to his gym. After she has been at the gym everyday and working very hard, Scraps, Morgan Freeman's character, comes and corrects her on some of her mistakes. Frankie, Clint Eastwood's character, finally manages her. You'll have to watch the rest to find out what happens next. This is a sad, happy, moving, amazing, and very unpredictable moving movie that shows how much effort and work you have to do to become a great boxer. I recommend it for everyone (even though it is rated PG-13 your kids and kids everywhere should see it), you will end up loving it and it will touch your heart."

Clint delivers more than the goods as the coach of the female Hillary Swank!! Hillary was actually really cute in this flick and kept calling Clint Eastwood BOSS. I was afraid that at one point, she was going to punch somebody out of the ring. If she had DONE THAT, then whoa!!! I loved that dude DALLAS who was retarded. He was innocent and although he called Morgan the N word, Morgan kept being nice to him. Oops, his name is Danger, not Dallas!!

","Maybe I've been a movie-goer for far too long, but I'd still like to think that every now and again it's possible to reach me. We've all been there as writers and directors try to reach out and tug on our collective heart strings. They give us tales of heart ache and woe, stories that are meant to capture out emotions and leave us feeling exactly as their protagonist does. Sometimes it works, most times it comes off as it was done, trite and meaningless.<br/><br/>I say all of this, because as a jaded movie-buff, Million Dollar Baby is easily one of the best films I've seen in a very long time. Forgetting about the politics of the film or the inherent criticisms that would follow, I felt that the story was so much more human than any I'd seen in a very long time. I want to say more, but really, how could I? The movie stands head and shoulders above all else by its own merits. Do yourself a favor and see it if you haven't already."

It's an unfortunate test really, because I love suspense in movies, but quiet true. It began when I first saw Apollo 13. I knew the history, yet i still sat on the edge of my seat, stupidly holding my breath, wondering if the crew would survive re-entry. Now a number of people told me how Million Dollar Baby ended, and dare I say it made the movie better in someways.<br/><br/>Eastwood creates some of the most human and endearing characters ever produced on film. I feel in love with every single one and simply found myself hoping everyone had lied to me. That somehow my copy of the film would be different... it was not. This is a touching and perfect film. Mr. Eastwood, the director, creates his most artful and technically skilled film yet, cementing himself among the great directors of all time. Swank has become the best/least known actresses in the history of film. An actress with the ability to become her role. All this is guided by the smooth voice of Freeman, making for 2 of the best hours film has produced in the past few years.<br/><br/>A beautiful film."

","Marvelous. Outstanding. The only thing I can find wrong is the film's title...MILLION DOLLAR BABY. This is a drama that packs a punch. Clint Eastwood directs and stars as Frankie Dunn, a cautious and wise gym owner and former boxing manager. His gym is managed by one of his former fighters Eddie 'Scrap Iron' Dupris(Morgan Freeman). Their lives take on a new perspective when a thirty-something waitress Maggie Fitzgerald(Hilary Swank)comes to the gym hoping to find a manager and trainer to help her escape poverty by becoming a boxer. Maggie and Eddie are convincing enough to change Frankie's mind about training a woman for the ring. Maggie proves to have the determination and the punch to become an acclaimed fighter. The fighting scenes are well choreographed and exciting. This emotional, powerful story has an unexpected and heart rendering finale. Eastwood, Swank and Freeman are excellent.

She's a white trash would be fighter, too old to train and it doesn't matter anyway 'cause Eastwood ""don't train girls.""

But, truth be told, from this point on acting really IS acting as well for Hilary Swank as well as for Clint Eastwood.<br/><br/>She, the boxer, who desperately wants but can't; he the trainer who can't admit and give in to his hurt and loneliness.<br/><br/>Did the movie deserve the Oscars? Depends, but Hilary Swank deserved this one more than the previous one (Boys don't cry). As for Morgan Freeman? Absolutely not, he has done better (The Shawshank Redemption), but it's good to see it as a token of appreciation from his peers Movie and directing? Yes, I suppose so, but then again... Clint Eastwood has done absolutely nothing wrong the past few years.<br/><br/>Euthanasia as a political correct item? Don't agree. But then again try to see it without the weight of the issue and see it as the right to live and die on one owns terms.<br/><br/>Controversial? Again, i don't agree. there have been better and more controversial movies about this issue; for example (Mar Adentro; which I experienced as more intense) What remains is the fact that this movie has been made with so much love and skill, and it shows!

","Clint Eastwood seems to be one of only a few film makers around with any confidence. The confidence comes from the story he is telling, which he fully believes in and the way he tells it. So many directors today seem to use flashy editing and visuals in order to keep the attention of an audience with a rapidly decreasing attention span and also to cover up the flaws in whatever story is being told.<br/><br/>Eastwood knows what a good story he is telling and therefore he allows the story to dictate the visual style and not vice - versa.<br/><br/>What we then get is a film which is beautiful in every conceivable way from the production design, to the cinematography, and the performances. Morgan Freeman is not only one of the greatest actors alive, but also one of the greatest narrators. His narration for the film is restrained yet very powerful. It adds another dimension to a film already on the right path.<br/><br/>From the beginning to the very end of the film I cared very much for the characters and the different spiritual journeys they take through the story. This is when I noticed what films are meant to be. 'Million Dollar Baby' reminds us how entertained and enthralled we can be from watching a good story with characters we care for and are interested in. Morgan Freeman, Clint Eastwood, and Hilary Swank give the most moving and authentic performances in many years. The flawless script by Paul Haggis and the always assured direction from Clint Eastwood elevate this film to a masterpiece. After seeing this film it lingered in my mind for days. This is what great films do and Million Dollar Baby is no exception."

I truly enjoyed Shawshank Redemption, and this film went further to show the power of his voice.<br/><br/>However, the true strength in the film is the run-of-the mill young boxer/ old weary trainer bit, but pushed to the next level. The film goes beyond boxing itself, to a much more human and realistic perspective.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't try to develop ALL characters, but concentrates well on just three.

","I regret booing Hilary Swank during her acceptance speech for Best Actress during this past year's Academy Awards. Now that I have seen Million Dollar Baby with my own two eyes, I cannot begrudge her the time she spent in front of that podium.<br/><br/>She deftly sold her character with expertise. Kind-hearted to a fault, seeing a world full of dreams to be reached even when her past and present strongly dictate otherwise, persistent, magical, shyly winsome and captivating. All the more to make it such a powerful film in the end. Eastwood and Freeman were paired in another one of my all time favorites, Unforgiven. I'm glad to see that Clint decided to give himself a role in his latest film. (As much as I enjoyed Mystic River... it didn't have Mr. Eastwood in front of the screen.) The constant ribbing and subtle, comedic bickering b/w the two regal actors gave the film a lush sense of weatheredness. In half an hour I readily believed that these two spent the good portion of a quarter of a century together in that gym... constantly playing and replaying the same scenes with the same spit and vigor they showed throughout the film... but always with a tenderness that was steadfastly under the surface of their grizzled and tough exteriors.<br/><br/>And to watch Maggie enter this boxing theatrical two man show was in itself a pleasure. First winning Eddie over and then finally Frankie himself. The hospital scenes are vivid reminders of the past few years. And the uneasy helplessness I felt in my own life percolated to the surface oh so easily. I could feel the vinyl easy chair under my weight... the sound of the machines that pumped and sputtered and beeped while dull red and green lights splayed coldly in the dark... and all one could do is be strong and smile and be there.<br/><br/>""always protect yourself."" ""always protect yourself."" That was the mantra that Frankie drilled into Maggie's head. In the end she displayed her mastery of this maxim even though some may say a bit late. Late? Maybe so... but when her family came to visit, she deftly parried the blows and delivered her own knockout punch. But even Clint Eastwood's character knew that to forever protect oneself was to back away too far. He had learned that lesson but was afraid to let Maggie learn it for herself. That sometimes to protect yourself, you have to get hit.<br/><br/>In the end, this was a story of humanity. Longing, suffering, perseverance, love, kindness, forgiveness, reaching beyond oneself... distilling all the components that make up a person to the few most important things. I am writing this to soak this all in... in the hope that by saturating the memories and feelings this film opened for me... I will forget them less easily. Yes, I can always buy the DVD and see it again... but like the quote from the Yann Martel book, ""Life of Pi"" at the top of this site says, ""First wonder goes deepest, wonder after that fits in the impression made by the first."" Once the power of this film softly fades, all I can do is hope that Mr. Eastwood will deliver again."

","In recent memory, no Best Picture has deserved its honor more than Million Dollar Baby. Not Gladiator, not Chicago, not A Beautiful Mind, not even The Return of the King. All of those films were notable for certain wonderful aspects, but in some way or another, they just don't reach the zenith of cinema that is Million Dollar Baby. I'll confess, I'm a huge fan of Clint Eastwood as a director. That alone, however, isn't enough for me when critiquing his films. I liked Mystic River, but its third act was (to put it very kindly) weak. Unforgiven is a masterpiece of a western, but no Clint Eastwood effort that I've yet seen tears open its heart so honestly and nakedly as this film. This film is all about the essence of life and living, and the debate raged by Michael Medved and other political hacks cannot detract from its impact on any viewer. Beating Saving Private Ryan, it's the closest a film has come to making me cry in a theater. I almost did, and it's my own fault for not letting in enough, but that's beside the point. The point here? Million Dollar Baby is an excellent film, rich with character, plot, and unspeakable heartache. You have to see it immediately, and try to hold back (like I did) when Eastwood visits his priest the last time. I won't give away any more than that."

His work in film always makes me embrace his character immediately. I am so glad he won the Oscar for this performance. He was worthy of the Oscar on other occasions.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood plays the same character he always plays. Good thing I enjoy that character. Not intended to criticize, John Wayne played the same character each time too."

","For those who don't quite ""get"" women's boxing, let me recommend two books that might help. The first is Rene Denfeld's 1997 title Kill the Body, the Head Will Fall, a post-feminist critique. The second is a new book by Leah Hager Cohen (2005), Without Apology. Both books maintain an analytical and critical stance, while at the same time allowing readers the opportunity to ""get into the skin"" of those who are drawn to the sport. Our society's fear of (and consequent denial of) female aggression is symptomatic of a much deeper problem. Almost all psychologists and sociologists would agree that integrating our aggressive feelings and impulses is an important part in the development of human wholeness. The degree to which we deny this development to women is commensurate with the degree to which we deny them their full complement of humanity. The movie Million Dollar Baby provides a corrective, indeed wholesome model of a woman seeking just such wholeness and integration. The second issue (likely to draw more in the way of negative criticism) dealing with Frankie's mental torment when confronted with a life/death decision may seem a bit sanitized, but the pain of decision is well-portrayed, and the issue is one we have tried to duck as a society, as well. For those not afraid to consider alternative viewpoints, I would recommend the title Death and Dying in the very helpful Opposing Viewpoints series published by Greenhaven Press (2003)."

","The most emotionally involving movie I have seen in many years. The only film that has made me cry in the theater since I saw ""E.T."" when I was 8. Great acting all around, with Morgan Freeman anchoring this great cast. Now I saw it without knowing the surprise ending, and it comes as a total shock. <br/><br/>Our hero Maggie had taken on the boxing world by storm and made a lot of money doing it. By her last fight she is taking on the female boxing champion. Her family doesn't want her and she has no boyfriend. All she has is her boxing family. That is what makes the end so heartbreaking. She would rather die than go on living without being able to fight anymore. <br/><br/>This is one of the best movies in a long time to come out of Hollywood. Clint Eastwood cements his legacy as one of the best directors of all time, and gives his best acting performance since ""Unforgiven"". Hillary Swank elevates herself to a league of her own. She is a beautiful woman who is talented enough when playing ""regular"" characters, such as the cop in ""Insomnia"". But as a female cross dresser in ""Boys Don't Cry"" and in this film as a musclebound boxer, she takes it to a level most female actors couldn't. You can tell how hard she worked to make this role believable because when she boxes you forget it is Hillary Swank in the ring."

","My husband and I see a lot of movies and usually spend the drive home talking about what we thought. That's about all the discussion or thought we give to most of the movies we see. Not the case with Million Dollar Baby. I've had a hard time getting this one off of my mind. I went to sleep thinking about it, woke up thinking about it, and have recalled its emotions many times today.<br/><br/>I knew the movie was about an upcoming woman boxer and in fact it started out like an underdog ""Rocky""-type flick. Character development was perfection - you learned enough of the background to understand why each character became the person they were, but much was left unrevealed- some of which I'm still wondering about today.<br/><br/>The deep emotions of joy, triumph, & overcoming your past were balanced with enough sadness to be moved to tears. And questions were raised that are truly NOT black and white, regardless of your religious or ethical beliefs.<br/><br/>This movie left me sadder than most movies I've ever seen. I was moved in a way few movies have impacted me.<br/><br/>It's not a ""feel good"" movie, but it is a movie that will make you feel. Go and experience Million Dollar Baby. Go on a day you can handle some pain and sadness. It is worth your time & tears and you will be rewarded with outstanding performances from an amazing cast."

","I had the interesting experience of seeing ""Million Dollar Baby"" late yesterday afternoon, an hour or so before the Oscars. Having previously seen most of the other nominees for best picture as well as the performances up for awards, I had no difficulty in figuring out how I would have voted if I'd been eligible. ""Million Dollar Baby"" was the easy winner, as were Morgan Freeman, Hillary Swank, and Clint Eastwood for best director. This is a small picture by recent Hollywood standards but it is worthy of every honor it received. The only wasted moment in the entire movie comes the near the end when the incompetent young boxing hopeful, earlier beaten to a pulp, returns to try again. I could have done without that. However, the basic story is told with rare economy. Contrast that with ""Ray"" which is distended and directed with monumental self-indulgence by Taylor Hackford, another nominee for best director. I don't know that I would have given the best acting award to Eastwood. Though he combines surface restraint and inner turmoil in a brilliant realization of the trainer/manager to Swank's Maggie, Jamie Foxx certainly had the showier role -- and he was quite good in it. For myself, however, I would have given the Oscar to Don Cheadle for his performance in ""Hotel Rwanda"" as the hotel manager who reluctantly at first but ultimately at great personal cost and risk saves hundreds from slaughter. Swank and Freeman won the prizes they earned, and Clint Eastwood won the two Oscars he most deserved. Scorcese will win some other day."

","Million Dollar Baby is one of the most amazing, terrific, heartrenching movies I have ever seen. The storyline is truly authentic, and amazing, left me in awe. The acting: superb. Brilliant. One of the most convincing performances I've seen from a whole cast in a movie. Hillary Swank, oh my god. She deserves the Oscar over and over and over again, She is amazing in this movie, and as her character progresses through the movie, you're rooting for her all along. Clint Eastwood plays a ""tough guy with a cream filled center"" very well, as at first, he refuses her, then embraces training her. Morgan Freeman, again, terrific. His character, a retired, regretful boxer who now cleans the gym Clint's character owns, adds a little laughter here and there in the film. This is one of the only movies that has ever struck an emotional cord with me. And I think it's funny that most people say that THIS is probably the Oscar movie they wouldn't see, yet, i think, EVERYONE should see this movie, it is honestly a piece of genius.

"lyn37167","10","3","6","26 February 2005"," Million Dollar Baby is a great film
","I went to see this last night and was enthralled. There will be the comparisons to Rocky, but as a fight film this is closer to Raging Bull. Unlike the villainous tragedy of Deniro's Jake LaMatta, though, Eastwood and Swank both portray tragic heroes who are beautiful in their dignified, but inevitably doomed struggle. This film takes the viewer to a deep, uncomfortable place where no one would go unless compelled. Compelling is only one word to describe this movie, though. Masterful and artistic, while at the same time touchingly human, and ultimately, tragically real.<br/><br/>Like many great sports movies, Million Dollar Baby transcends its subject, and sport itself. This film is about respect, and pride, and dignity.<br/><br/>Rocky leaves the audience in the ring, and one has to remind himself that Balboa lost the fight. Million Dollar Baby consumes the viewer with loss, making us watch painfully as the story winds up. If there was bittersweet triumph in Rocky, there is subtle, quiet, and touching triumph here, that is unquestionably more real. Sadly, some stories just do not have happy endings. I have heard this film called ""depressing"", though, and I cannot agree. Sad, yes. Humbling and perhaps disturbing, but there was victory here and Swank gives an inspiring performance.<br/><br/>I have not seen the other films nominated for Best picture, or for some of the other awards, but this should win something."

","Million Dollar baby is in my opinion the best picture of the year. I've seen all except Finding Neverland and I would have to say that this one is the best. (Sideways a close second). Clint Eastwood shows us again why he is one of the greatest actors and directors of all time. Hilary Swank clearly deserves to be the best actress, and hopefully Freeman will get his Oscar. I'm my opinion, Eastwood deserved best picture last year for Mystic River. This year, he will get the Oscar.I don't know if you will leave the theater angry, upset, sad, or moved, but you will leave the theater feeling a little bit different after you have seen million dollar baby.

"JaneSchmo","10","3","6","18 February 2005"," A Great Film
","""Million Dollar Baby"" is Clint Eastwood's best film as a director (at least so far , he's still young at 74).It tops even ""Mystic River"".<br/><br/>The story involves a young trailer park trash woman, wonderfully played by Hillary Swank, who thinks she can become a boxer.She has been waiting on tables for more than half her life, her life is at a total stand still and she has no way to go other than boxing.She comes to Clint Eastwood's gym and refuses to leave and he eventually agrees to train her.Morgan Freemen,excellent as always,plays Eastwood's best friend, former client and janitor and rounds out the cast in this small, three-person drama. <br/><br/>Names you always, always remember from the movies include Hal 9000, Fred C.Dobbs and Marge Gunderson.It's the damnedest thing.What's so unusual about the names ""Marge Gunderson"" and ""Fred Dobbs""? Perfectly ordinary, there are probably many people named that.And yet, I don't recall the names of the main characters from ""Casablanca"" but remember the ones from ""Fargo"" and ""The Treasure of the Sierra Mountains"".""MDB"" is newest addition to the list.Instead of in labels such as ""the boxer"" ""the trainer"" ""the best friend"",you speak of the characters by name as if they are real people.<br/><br/>For two thirds of its running time, ""MDB"" is a pretty standard rags-to-riches, underdog-triumphs boxing movie and one of the best since ""Rocky"".Then it completely takes another turn and truly finds greatness.It's a masterpiece, pure and simple.<br/><br/>Maggie is paralyzed from the neck down in a fight.She asks Frankie to put her out of her misery.At first, he flatly refuses.After she attempts suicide, he gives in and kills her.<br/><br/>Maggie's decision is wrong.In most cases, euthanasia is morally wrong. If I were in her place, I'd be devastated and maybe suicidally depressed but would learn to live with it.In fact,not being a good dancer or athlete,I might happier in a wheelchair and only occasionally miss jogging,swimming and not having to depend on others for literally everything from wiping my nose to going down the street.As long as I could still go to the movies, I'd be reasonably okay.Some of the most famous people in the world are paraplegics; look at the lives of Stephen Hawking, Christopher Reeve, Christy Brown, Larry Flynt or Muhammad Ali.<br/><br/>But Maggie is a boxer.Being a quadriplegic is a death sentence for her, like being a prisoner inside her own body.She only asks Frankie after she loses her leg.Losing her body is the worst possible thing that could ever happen to her and she doesn't have an educated mind to go on.<br/><br/>There is another reason she does what she does; except for Frankie and maybe Eddie, she's all alone in the world. We meet her unloving family twice, including her selfish, stupid mother. In one great scene, Frankie and Maggie go on a visit to her family."

","Much of how I rate a film is based on whether or not I, at any moment during the viewing, become conscious of the passage of actual time; that is, that I am actually conscious at any given moment of viewing a movie in a real time-space continuum. If a movie carries me along and causes me, in a fairly complete way, or as completely as possible, to be oblivious to my surroundings, then I believe the story is being told in a skillful and masterful way. You can split hairs over technique and other such minutia, but, the extent of how a movie accomplishes the above determines for me and, I believe, for others how good a film really is.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby accomplishes the above for me in a way that no other movie has done; at least in recent memory. There is no doubt in my mind that Million Dollar Baby is a masterpiece. Give Clint Eastwood the credit he is surely due. There are a lot of his directorial efforts (at least the ones I have seen which does not include Mystic River)that have been great. But, they have also been in what I like to call the ""almost nearly but not quite hardly"" category. <br/><br/>To coin some boxing terminology, Eastwood goes the distance on this one. I now consider MDB the best movie of all time."
"segratz","10","3","6","13 February 2005"," Directing Perfection for Eastwood
","Let me say first that I am no fan of Clint Eastwood's movies. I didn't like 'Unforgiven' or 'Mystic River,' both critics' darlings, so I was expecting something along the same vein for this film. In both those other films the focus is on men. In this case, it's Hillary Swank's character, Maggie, and it makes all the difference for me because I like a little estrogen in my films. The story is enthralling and character driven - with a focus on all three characters. Now some are very upset by the ending of the film but I felt complete empathy and so did Joe, who I had to basically bribe to see the movie. And he LOVED it. The direction of the film is perfection - Eastwood uses incredible shadow work and several styles that enhance the story so much, that I can't imagine any other director doing the film. While I saw some editing problems in Aviator, and some flaws in the directorial shots, I saw NONE of that here, and I've read Eastwood took only a little over a month to shoot it. Amazing! He wins best director in my mind.<br/><br/>The acting is fantastic - I can't even put into words how the actors melt into their characters. I didn't see Clint Eastwood - I saw cut man Frankie Dunn. I loved Jamie Foxx in Ray, but for me Eastwood won the Oscar for me. Of course Swank is awesome (I even loved her in Next Karate Kid) and should also win the Oscar. Morgan Freeman is always perfect and his chemistry with Eastwood is better than any other film I've seen yet this year.<br/><br/>Normally I wouldn't recommend seeing a movie like this on the big screen but the boxing scenes are so cool that I would say it is worth the price of admission. See it!"

","So I decided to go see Million Dollar baby on a whim after it was nominated for best picture and boy was I disappointed with myself. For not rushing out to see this astonishing motion picture. Clint Eastwood becomes a master of film with the story of a struggling woman coming out of her youthful prime whom is dying to be trained by him for women's boxing. He's a scruffy old fashioned guy who doesn't believe in training girls and cares to much about his fighters to watch them get hurt, sometimes blocking them from excelling. She is basically defined by herself to be white trash she works very hard as a waitress by day and eats peoples scraps off their plates to survive. She saves all her excess money to train at the gym and for equipment. In some of the film's saddest and most powerful scenes she confronts her trashy family and they have not a thread of redemability. Hilary Swank remains in her finest hour here even after her amazing performance in Boys Don't Cry if she doesn't get an Oscar for this it would be crime. Clint Eastwood is a masterful director and a star he directs the film with passion and acts with conviction. the film covers extremely dark territory and still manages to find some light in it. never before has a film based on any sport including Rocky hit such emotionally depressing depths. That are as memorable as they are powerful, littered with the years finest moments and talent Million Dollar Baby is phenomenal it leads the pack for the bets film of the year! 10/10"

","Clint Eastwood has done it again. Tough, violent and extremely moving. Million dollar baby is his best third work before the camera, (I think his first was Unforgiven, and his second Bird- unbelievably underrated-). Eastwood knows about boxing movies, and He knows that black and white is the best to shoot a boxing movie, but he also knows that nowadays everybody remember excellent Ranging Bull, so He tries a new way to shoot it: Lights and shadows. He creates the atmosphere with lights and shadows in the gym and in hospital scenes. It's an old game that Eastwood plays along the movie. But he has another trick... A great storyline. And Eastwood, a very good director, turns a typical boxing movie into a powerful losers drama which would make Eastwood himself cry. The best American movie of this 2005 Oscar, very far away from dull and dusty The Aviator."
"jon.h.ochiai","10","3","6","4 February 2005"," One in a Million
","Director Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"" is truly a moving and touching motion picture. Powerful. This power derives from amazing actors, an unflinching and uncompromising screenplay by Paul Haggis, and a master director at the zenith of his power. This is the best movie of the year, and Eastwood's finest work. His gift for simplicity and eloquence is absolutely stunning. In writing this comment and acknowledgment, there is apprehension that I may be missing the same respect and integrity that Eastwood has for his audience. The controversial attention given to the story line, which I will not dwell upon, is warranted-- I suppose. Ultimately, it is a matter of choice. And ultimately, regardless of the power of a movie, it is still a movie. That being said, Hilary Swank who inhabits the role of Maggie Fritzgerald, is my favorite all-time movie hero. Her Maggie has such an earnestness, a purity of heart, and spirit that are awe inspiring. Maggie goes after what she wants with everything she's got. Swank truly gives life and soul to Haggis's words and Eastwood's direction. Swank, aside from undergoing hard physical training to bring tough as nails Boxer Maggie to life, also tempers her with a genuine charm, especially when she breaks out a tiny smile that warms your heart. Swank deserves an Oscar for her performance.<br/><br/>Maggie is trailer trash, and she knows it. She has a fierce intelligence, and black and white sense. She sees being a professional boxer as her only way to make it. Thus, she saves all the money she makes as a waitress, so she can be trained by legendary cut man and trainer, Frankie Dunn (Eastwood). At first Frankie dismisses Maggie. Maggie is 31 years old, too old. It takes four years just to train a fighter, and she can't even hit a speed bag. Then Maggie tells him, if she can't make it as a boxer ""...I may as well get a trailer home. Buy a deep fryer, and bag of Oreoes."" That catches our attention much like Frankie's. He takes her on as his charge. Haggis's screenplay based on the stories by F.X. Poole has a stark and authentic quality and consistency that are admirable.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman as Scraps Dupris is the conscience of ""Million Dollar Baby"", and also it's narrator-- the reason later revealed. Scraps works for Frankie in his Gym. Scraps was a contender years ago. Frankie blames himself for a fight in which Scraps lost the use of his eye. Scraps is the one who first brings Maggie to Frankie's attention. Freeman is a great actor, one never catches him acting. His performance is commanding in it's understated nature. There is a breathtaking scene in the diner, where Scraps tells Maggie how he lost his eye in the fight. He (Freeman) is just talking, and Maggie (Swank) is just listening-- really listening. This is stripped down Eastwood at his best.<br/><br/>Actor Clint Eastwood as trainer Frankie Dunn gives a compelling performance displaying such an ease, strength, and vulnerability. Eastwood is still evolving as an actor. His Frankie has an incomplete relationship with an unseen and estranged daughter. Thus, his relationship with Maggie makes sense. They fill in a missing in each other's life. Eastwood possesses this powerful silent presence, that few actors have. In a scene where Maggie is devastated when her Mom ( an effective Margo Martindale) rejects the house that Maggie bought for her, because this would cut off her Mom's welfare check, Eastwood stands silently outside the doorway. Nothing need be said. On the drive back, Maggie says quietly, ""Frankie, you're all I've got."" He replies ""You've got me."" The chemistry between Eastwood and Swank is magical, and what makes ""Million Dollar Baby"" so special and compelling.<br/><br/>The movie ends quietly, and is absolutely moving. And the audience is also silent. Eastwood's vision always has an authenticity about it. He always respects the intelligence of his audience, and our ability to make our own choices and judgments. I truly applaud all the effort and talent involved in making ""Million Dollar Baby"". I think Eastwood's movie captures all that is courageous, compassionate, and noble."

And the three principles are awesome I'm their performances.<br/><br/>This is a love story; the love of two men for a sport; the love of a youngster for what that sport may make possible; the love of a father-figure for his young charge.

","The best way for one to enter the viewing experience of this movie is to read nothing about it first. But since that is impossible for most people- I know I can't pay $9 for a movie ticket without at least getting a feel for the critical waters, I will do as best I can to summarize what I feel is the movie deserving of all of the major Oscar categories, even if the criminal snubbing of Martin Scorcese has to continue for yet another year.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is a film that will put you through a wringer of emotions that will make you feel like you've been in the boxing ring yourself. Although Unforgiven is still, in my opinion, Eastwood's masterpiece in film-making, MDB is definitely going to be Clint's twilight opus. Although the man isn't exactly on death's door, there are only a limited number of films left in him. And if this is the last film he ever makes, then he has certainly gone out with a bang.<br/><br/>I guarantee you- if you see this film, you will be genuinely touched and moved. None of the actors- Morgan Freeman, Hilary Swank, and even Clint Eastwood himself, have been better. If anything, a film such as Million Dollar Baby has served to remind me what a dull and lonely world we will be in when great filmmakers and actors like Freeman and Eastwood are no longer among us, just as the world became less lively and funny when Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthou left us.<br/><br/>I apologize that this review is not more specific. It is because the most profound experiences I've had in movies came only when I knew very little about what I was about to see. All you need to know is this is a truly moving story about the human condition. That Clint Eastwood has made a film that will make you think about how you view certain issues, and should at the very least give you pause. That the characters in Million Dollar Baby are ones who will stay with you for a very long time, and that you will never forget them. And when the end credits start to roll, you will wonder how 137 minutes could go by so quickly."
"The_Void","8","3","6","31 January 2005"," Eastwood triumphs yet again
","Usually when the latest 'big thing' gets released, I go to cinema and end up disappointed. With Million Dollar Baby, however; that was not the case. Clint Eastwood's latest film is a powerful blend of believable characters and raw, gritty realism. The film benefits from Clint Eastwood's assured, no frills directing style immensely as it gives the film it's potent edge, and the lack of trickery ensures that our attention is never distracted from the characters and storyline. Clint spends the first twenty minutes of the movie setting the scene, which therefore allows the audience to get to know the score, before taking us on an emotional and physical roller-coaster ride through a myriad of emotions. This allows Eastwood to play with his viewer's emotions without the necessity to concentrate on the central theme of boxing - and Million Dollar Baby is all the better a film for it.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood made a name for himself by playing a character that you cant possibly disagree with. In movies like Sergio Leone's 'Dollar' trilogy, down to his own films, such as High Plains Drifter and Unforgiven; we are with Clint every step of the way, no matter what evil deeds he's doing. He perfected the anti-hero and proved that an audience can be fully behind any character. For this movie, Clint has given himself a support role, and all the faith that we would usually put him has been transferred to Hilary Swank. Hilary Swank is absolutely perfect in this movie, and anyone that says otherwise is sadly mistaken. She approaches her role with all the determination that epitomises her character on screen, and delivers a fine performance with it. Emotionally as well as physically, Swank never gives us a reason to doubt that she is Maggie Fitzgerald; the character she plays on screen. If Swank doesn't walk away with the Best Actress award for 2004, there is something seriously wrong. Despite taking a back step, Eastwood still manages to retain that which he made his name with. Once again, Eastwood is the downbeat loner - the man who comes along and changes thing; the catalyst of the story. This performance is much more mature than the work Eastwood did in his earlier movies, and may well go on to represent the twilight years of this classic actor.<br/><br/>The way that Eastwood gets the audience behind his central character is simply breathtaking. During the boxing scenes especially, Clint's subdued style lends them a potent realism and the audience feels every punch thrown and every wound endured. The boxing scenes are also testament to Eastwood's triumph with characterisation as well as technical potency, as we follow Maggie Fitzgerald every step of the way. When she takes a punch, we feel it too and when she delivers a blow - the audience is able to feel the adrenaline pumping, the same as the character does on screen. It's one of the hardest things to make an audience feel for a character, but Million Dollar Baby, not satisfied with just making us feel  allows us to become one with the emotions on screen. However, all is not rosy in the almost perfect garden that Eastwood has created. Basically, it's the musical score. Million Dollar Baby is a powerful film, and just the images and dialogue alone is enough to convey the story to the audience and make them feel for the characters - but for some reason, many scenes are saturated in a horrible rural style beat and it doesn't do the film any favours at all. Music almost always adds to the images on screen, but sometimes no music is better. I almost feel like I'm nitpicking as the film is so close to perfection, but it's a niggling little aspect of it that annoyed me.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is not one of those films that comes along and changes the cinematic landscape. However, it's a powerful drama with some excellent acting, great direction and a brilliant storyline. I'm not a boxing fan, but when it comes to films like this; it doesn't matter what you like. Usually when I go to the cinema, there's a mad rush to the doors at the end  no matter what the film  but this wasn't the case with Million Dollar Baby. Everyone in the cinema sat in their seats until the end credits rolled, and although I cant speak for everyone; I did so because the film is so utterly spellbinding and I needed the time for the credits to roll to catch my breath. I don't need to say this but I will: see this movie."

","Million Dollar Baby is the kind of film that evokes the deepest of your emotions. Clint (once again) plays a hard ass, who is showing his age and experiences in his face and voice. His sidekick, a semi-blind intellectual played by Morgan Freeman also shines.<br/><br/>The film is one where although based on stories (collection of boxing stories), it is better that it isn't a firm solid true story, because you would never wish the pain the actors show on any human being. It also enhances the way you believe, instead of accepting it b/c it is true, you believe b/c it captures you with its downtrodden, and dirt poor, almost loser (by societal views) characters. It takes you on the ride from the voice of Freeman's character (he narrates). It shows how Clint comes to care and love this woman who he at first neglected. You feel for what has happened and does happen to them all the way through the film. To be honest I almost cried and had to hold back the tears when Swank talked of her impending doom.<br/><br/>This, in nearly every way, outdoes Martin's THE AVIATOR and all other Best Picture nods.

The nominations it has received are well-deserved! From the opening scenes to the closing credits, I was enthralled. Hilary Swank (the new Julia Roberts?) makes Maggie come alive. From joy to sorrow to struggle, she IS Maggie. Her fighting spirit and determination to achieve a goal are inspiring. Clint Eastwood out did himself on the direction of this film and his portrayal of Frankie. A man who finally opens himself up to another, he will never be the same. Morgan Freeman's (okay, I'm a sucker, I like ANYTHING Morgan Freeman is in!!) role as Eddie (a former boxer) is the kind of guy you want in your corner. Have a great time.....you'll love every minute!"

My critic would not be based on the artistic value of the production or indeed the performance of the actors (although both in my opinion were excellent), I am not qualified to do so. My critic has more to do with the position that some folks have regarding the subject matter (and it is not Boxing) and their refusal to allow science to deal with alternatives to the end result of this painful movie.<br/><br/>I would really like to talk more about this but I think the movie stirs a debate and people need to see it.

","When Clint directed Mystic River, I was amazed. When Clint directs Mystic River, he leaves me stunned for life. The movie which everyone must of thought is another Rocky movie, is not much about boxing, but about Life and Relationships. Clint reaches for your hear this time around. His direction is just tremendous. I know his Oscar is awaiting. Acting-wise I think this was Clint's best performance. He rips the screen apart in every scene. He can be very humorous at times, and then he can be the total opposite, ""Stubborn-Old-Man"". His plays his role with ease. While best supporting actor award should be reserved for Morgan, cause damn he surely deserves it. He voice, his voice, his voice.There is absolutely no actor like him. He's just too natural. The show -stealer Hilary Swank gives a top notch performance. I know she worked day and night for this role to get in shape and learn boxing, but her role demanded way more than a few punches here n there, and she delivered. And boy did she deliver a ""knock-out"" performance. Screenplay by Paul Haggis is amazing. Editing is crisp. Its a pure classic. A Movie that will make you think for days and days."

","This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. For me it ranks up there with The Shawshank Redemption. If you loved Shawshank, I promise you, you will love this. Both movies handle a subject we have seen many times before and do it so well that you can not imagine how it could ever be done any better. In this case, the done-to-death story-line is about a fighter who wants to get her shot at the title and the hard-headed trainer who reluctantly takes her on. Don't be fooled by the story-line though. This is no Rocky. Million Dollar Baby is to Rocky as a diamond is to some cheap quartz imitation.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank creates such a believable character you'll have a hard time thinking she was acting. I hope to see her in the Oscars in some designer dress with a two-thousand dollar hair-do. I will be glad in more ways than one since it will destroy my image of her as an honest, hard-working, tough and yet vulnerable woman worth loving.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is absolutely and utterly wonderful, again, as usual.<br/><br/>As for Clint Eastwood. Well, some actors and directors get better with age. Clint Eastwood isn't just getting better. He is so far ahead of his contemporaries already he'll have to cut off an arm (well maybe both arms and possibly a leg) to let the others catch up with him.<br/><br/>After seeing this movie I thought about it a long time trying to understand why it had such an emotional effect on me. Deep down I guess its about choosing your road in life and going where it takes you. No complaints. No regrets. What really hits home is the love the characters have for one another. The sort of love you reserve for people who walked down that road with you. The people who you'd want to be with in your final moments.<br/><br/>I can not understand the mind-set of people who voted 1 for this movie. I can only guess they are other movie directors. Excellent 10/10."

","Great story, great acting, great characters; Million Dollar Baby has it all. One of the most solidly entertaining sports movies of any sport, this one is a true winner.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood shows why he is one of Hollywood's all-time great actors and directors. Million Dollar Baby is one of those movies that can be discussed for hours.<br/><br/>Maggie, played by a wonderful Hilary Swank, is determined to be trained by Frankie Dunn (Clint). Frankie doesn't train girls, and he sluffs her off. It isn't until Eddie (Morgan Freeman) who manages the boxing gym for Frankie gives Maggie some help and encouragement, that Frankie decides to take her on.<br/><br/>Frankie is taken by Maggie's enthusiasm, will, and determination. When he meets her family and realizes that the only person in the world that she can trust is him, he pledges to see her through and develops a strong admiration and love for her.<br/><br/>The movie tightens even more when tragedy strikes, and the closeness of the three characters is even more pronounced. All the characters stay true to form; Maggies family as opportunistic, greedy, trailer trash; Frankie as Maggie's best friend, and Frankie as the steadying influence throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Exceptionally strong acting by all the stars, which is to be expected. It is no coincidence that the narration of the movie by Morgan Freeman could remind one of another classic that he narrated, ""The Shswshank Redemption"". The supporting characters, especially Jay Baruchel playing a very entertaining ""Danger"", did a wonderful job as well.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is as inspirational as ""Rocky"", but with better acting and a more powerful ending. You don't have to be a boxing fan to by overwhelmed by Million Dollar Baby."

","Hopefully people will see that Clint Eastwood deserves an Oscar for his directing of Million Dollar Baby. And hopefully he wont get jipped like he did for Unforgiven and Mystic River. Even though people may think Martin deserves it because he hasn't won an Oscar yet but i still think that Clint Eastwood deserves it just as much. He has directed a lot of great movies that he never got the proper recognition for. Million Dollar baby was a great movie, very inspirational and many people deserve at least an Oscar nomination such as; Hillary Swank for her great acting definitely one of her best films and of course Mr. Morgan Freeman who shows why he is considered such a great actor who was also shafted for his acting in Shawshank Redemption(Tim Robbins also got shafted) Great Movie."
"zauis1234","10","3","6","10 January 2005"," Even Better After It Sits
","While watching this, I knew I was seeing a film that was completely engaging. It was paced really well and was top-heavy with wonderful performances. Eastwood is of the school of direction that favors substance over style, yet this film uses shadows and light as tools better than any film I can think of in the last 30 years (Since The Godfather). He also gives, here, his best performance ever. His is a risky performance, as an actor he pushes himself into emotional territory he had only touched on before. Hillary Swank is quite a bit of terrific, as well in a role that is solidly wonderful. She isn't stretching the same way Eastwood is, but is gritty and brave. Morgan Freeman is, like Swank, ""typically"" good, not reaching as far, but when you're Morgan Freeman, you really do not have to. The film is about choices and consequences, and, three days after seeing this, I cannot stop thinking about the implications of the last twenty-five minutes or so. The sign of a great film is what it does to you after it has a chance to settle in. On that basis alone, this ranks towards the top of a Master Director's list of Great Films. The movie hits you, yet the sting lingers long after. I mean that in the best possible manner."
"ruby_fff","8","3","6","1 January 2005"," A vintage of a film by Clint Eastwood -- for mature appreciation, no doubt
","A rare true depiction of life's fragility - its dilemma of hopes and dreams, risk taking and facing mishaps - can we ever avoid, do we always blame - does God care? ""Birth, Aging, Sickness, Death"" are inevitable stages to one's life cycle (a Chinese traditional saying).<br/><br/>I really like this Clint Eastwood film. Besides directing, producing, and performing in ""Million Dollar Baby,"" Eastwood also did the music which was simply well-integrated and perfectly composed to match and quietly enhance the plot progression, the mood, and the reaction of the characters. This is a gutsy film, gritty in emotions. It can be a tear-jerker yet not at all sentimental. It tells it like it is - the down to earth hard living of boxing (the theme being a 'crutch'), while the crux of the story concentrates on three main characters (each with haunting past): Eastwood as Frank the weathered boxing trainer, Hilary Swank as Maggie the enthusiastic spark in this whirl of boxing energy, and Morgan Freeman as ""Scrap"" - besides being the voice-over narrator, provided the bridging catalyst as the cool and caring mainstay to both Frank and Maggie. There are sprinkles of wit and humor here and there - that's how life is: making up of laughter and smiles occasionally in the midst of challenges and struggles, joys and disappointments, hesitation and reinforcement of faith, plucking up courage to take that risk, and mishaps nevertheless happen. There is ""whose life is it anyway"" dilemma - the confrontation of death, to be or not to be. Reminds me of the theme of Alejandro Amenábar's ""The Sea Inside"" (a film I've yet to catch - it was shown for only a few days just before Christmas week. A good film with tough subject is so hard to come by.)<br/><br/>Since ""True Crime"" 1999 (which I appreciate and posted comments), I prefer this Eastwood endeavor more than ""Mystic River"" 2003, ""Blood Work"" 2002, ""Space Cowboys"" 2001. Here we have basically a simple story in structure (screenplay by Paul Haggis), focusing on only three main characters (not ensemble casts we've been getting so often lately). This is not exactly a total upbeat film, but it is poignantly true in the expression of feelings, conversations, and the inevitably linked relationships between them - unspoken support to each other in being alive, appreciating living and respecting death.<br/><br/>Yes, the subject of death is not being shied away - it's approached head on with no circumventing the issue. With the ending of year 2004, the many events that involved increasing number of deaths, debate on wars, disasters, religious beliefs - the question of faith does come into play. There are no straightforward answers to questions of morality or the right thing to do - God's or man's decision (one believes that God works in mysterious ways for reasons one may not understand fully). And so the ending, be it a resigned assumption or not, it boils down to trusting one's heart with faith. And Freeman's calm voice closes well as it began - almost with a poetic touch to the tone.<br/><br/>The music lingered on (Lennie Niehaus orchestrated) beyond the credits roll. ""Million Dollar Baby"" - a loaded title (precious Maggie that appeared from nowhere; replacing an empty spot of an unreachable daughter; the professional status Maggie attained; takes a lot of heart to train her; takes a lot of courage to fulfill her request). The film did present and tackled a thoughtful subject after all. This may not be a Hollywood blockbuster, but the three stars' impeccably inhabited roles in this quintessential Eastwood film certainly warrant equal appreciation."

","MILLION DOLLAR BABY (2004) **** Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman, Brian F. O' Byrne, Jay Baruchel, Mike Colter, Lucia Rijker, Margo Martindale, Bruce MacVittie, Ned Eisenberg.<br/><br/>(Dir: Eastwood) Trifecta acting; one of Eastwood's best ; Swank's best since winning Oscar Clint Eastwood continues his winning streak as film's crusty elder statesman in this absorbing character study about the boxing world with surprises bold and uncompromising  just like his lean, no-frills journeyman film-making trademark has always been.<br/><br/>Eastwood stars as Frankie Dunn, the grizzled, graying manager of a run-down gym that you could practically smell the blood, sweat and p*ss it has accumulated through the years of would-bes, wannabes and all-too familiar never-was pugilists who've darkened his establishment and worse, led him down the world-weary belief at one last attempt for a sure thing champion fighter title match.<br/><br/>Along comes feisty yet green boxer wannabe Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank, the picture of determination and laser-eyed for the prize moxie), a thirty-something waitress struggling to shake her 'white trash' sack of ashes for a chance at becoming a world-class fighter. Dunn shakes her off from the get go until he wanders in one night to visit his best friend and the gym's caretaker Eddie 'Scraps' Dupris (Freeman, the film's somber voiced narrator as well)  a former boxer whose only memory of glory days gone by is a milky blue glass eye  who instills the plucky young woman with a fortitude to focus on what she is all set to obtain. All she needs is the properly motivated manager and Dunn reluctantly at first accepts this first as a chore to be done with but when he seconds guess his rookie protégée he is given a hard-knocks lesson when he actually sees her raw talent in the ring which needs only his sure hand and in a twist of fate Frankie Dunn's legacy is wrapped up in one solid bout leading to a fighter with some serious unproven talent.<br/><br/>What follows are some wonderfully leisurely paced sequences (liberally sprinkled with humor) as Maggie is shown the ropes in what easily could've been a hackneyed notch to a long-in-the-tooth genre that seems to have been thawed out from Warner Bros.<br/><br/>Golden Age of tough talking' bout flicks of the Thirties and Forties, yet Eastwood eschews the cinematic lineage instead for a very impressive tale of three interlaced story lines and the flesh-and-bones/meat-and-potatoes characters of Frankie, Maggie and Scraps that feels entirely fresh as the viewer gladly goes along the seemingly predictable path line/montage of one unheralded success to the next until the out-of-nowhere left hook/uppercut combo in the film's final act that all I will say is a real tearjerker deftly handled with exceptional restraint by Eastwood and simply allows his family of players to play their cards as they are dealt with : realistically.<br/><br/>Swank continues to impress but you' ll never expect the tough, gritty and wonderful work she does here as the sad but not pathetic Maggie who only wants one thing and that is to be a success at her one talent  boxing. I dare say she is the most honest cinematic fighter since the original ROCKY ; that good.<br/><br/>Freeman is formidably damn good as always as the voice of experience and at times reason but he avoids the tragic path his character easily could've been depicted; instead his usual understated gravitas shines.<br/><br/>Paul Haggis' no-nonsense yet likable screenplay adaptation is based on boxing stories by F.X. Toole. What needs to be recognized is the theme of love throughout and how it can be achieved in the not-so-traditional paterfamilias/lover classifications but an amalgam of just that.<br/><br/>Eastwood resurrects his growling cadence from HEARTBREAK RIDGE but his Frankie Dunn is not a stock character  a loser looking for redemption  but a man who has seen his limits (echoing a quote from his Dirty Harry in THE ENFORCER  'A man's gotta know his limitations.') yet recognizes that his life does have meaning (even if it is in Gaelic, the one running joke of the film has Dunn reading it over and over and gives the final scene it's closure in his affected nickname for Maggie's fighting moniker from the ancient language).<br/><br/>One of the true genuine surprises of the year and arguably one of Eastwood's finest films ever. A knockout."
"Anonymous_Maxine","10","5","13","27 February 2005"," One of the most moving films I've ever seen.
","I am writing this review on the afternoon of February 27th, a couple hours before the Academy Awards begin, and I really think that the Best Picture category is going to be mostly a contest between The Aviator and Million Dollar Baby, both of which are spectacular films, as are the rest of the nominees (Finding Neverland, Ray, and Sideways, in my order of preference). I caught this movie about a week ago at a theater a block from my house. The one thing that I really like about living in LA is that, especially at Oscar time, just about any movie nominated in any category is bound to still be playing somewhere, regardless of how long ago it was released.<br/><br/>Except Best Animated Short Film, of course. I still think those never play anywhere.<br/><br/>I have a feeling that Mystic River was passed over for the Best Picture award because of too much similarity to Clint Eastwood's outstanding 1999 film True Crime, and I had anticipated something in that general vein with Million Dollar Baby, if only because the appearance of the film is so similar. Eastwood has gone from making westerns to making one exceedingly dark film after another, and in this film he has succeeded like he never has in his storied career.<br/><br/>Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, the owner of a pretty run-down boxing gym where hopefuls come to work out and get some training from him. It's the kind of gym from which you don't really expect to see many people rise to boxing stardom, so Frankie concentrates hard on one man that he's training, who has a chance at a title bout. It is during this time that Maggie (Hillary Swank) walks into the gym and starts calling him Boss, which he does not appreciate because, as he flatly tells her, ""I don't train girls.""<br/><br/>Up to this point in the film the plot has not really revealed itself. We know we are watching a movie about boxing that's not really about boxing (a sports movie cliché that Million Dollar Baby brilliantly sidesteps) and that Maggie is more than likely going to turn into the brilliant boxer that Frankie has been looking for. But beyond that the movie could go in a hundred different directions, and it promptly goes exactly where you didn't think it was going to go.<br/><br/>This could very easily have become a quickly forgettable sports film that disappeared into video store obscurity like even the good sports films like Miracle and Mystery, Alaska seem to have done, but by the end of the movie it has gone in such an original direction and given the audience such an emotional workout that, on my way out of the theater I saw people leaning against the handrail. This movie is so powerful that you have to rest after you see it.<br/><br/>Frankly, given how violent some of these sports movies are, especially ones like this, it amazes me that no other ones have gone as far as Million Dollar Baby does. The boxing scenes are thrilling to watch, even providing good comic relief as Maggie consistently knocks girls out in the first round and then looks sheepishly over at Frankie in her corner, who has instructed her not to knock them out so fast because it's getting so no one wants to put their boxer in the ring with her. He ends up having to bribe managers.<br/><br/>The conflict comes from the fact that Maggie is desperate for a title fight. She has come from a trailer in middle America where she worked as a waitress for something like 17 years, and she knew that she would never do anything else until she got herself out of there on her own. Her family certainly was not going to help. My God man, I could not believe those people. She was uneducated and unskilled, she didn't even know how to box but she had the determination and the motivation to learn, and learn she certainly did.<br/><br/>The problem is that one of Frankie's past trainees who managed to get a title fight was Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris (played in the movie by Morgan Freeman), who not only lost the fight but also was knocked blind in one eye. By the end of the movie, by the way, I like to think that Eddie may have considered changing his nickname to Eddie ""110"" Dupris. Frankie blames himself and he doesn't want to have another fighter injured. An honorable feeling, but it clashes with Maggie's goals, for whom not getting a chance to a title fight means she'll have to go back to being a waitress, which to her is nothing more than waiting to die. The interaction between the three characters is some of the best I've seen in years. And I've seen a lot of movies in years.<br/><br/>I am reminded of Friday Night Lights, which came out in late 2004 and was hailed as the best sports movie ever made, a bold statement that inspired me to eventually watch it. Fairly entertaining movie, but the ludicrous statement that it's the greatest sports movie ever made becomes even more ludicrous if you consider Million Dollar Baby to be a sports movie. This is one of the great films in all of film history. Do NOT miss it.<br/><br/>And with that, it's almost 4 o'clock. I'm going to go up to Hollywood Blvd. and see if I can catch a glimpse of Clint Eastwood."
"zetes","7","5","13","31 January 2005"," Probably wouldn't crack my top 50 of 2004
","I don't understand all the praise. Sure, it's a pretty good movie, but it's flat, obvious, and not at all memorable. Eastwood's last film, Mystic River, was ten times better. Hilary Swank plays a boxer who persists in trying to get trainer Clint Eastwood to make her his student. He finally does accept her, especially after his friend, Morgan Freeman, who works as a janitor in his gym, convinces him of her talent. Most of the movie is a pretty straightforward boxing drama. Swank and Eastwood become each other's surrogate father and daughter, both making up for lost loved ones (Swank's father is dead, and Eastwood's daughter refuses to talk to him). The final act adds a tearjerker. There is also a poorly developed subplot about a few of the regulars at Eastwood's gym. It's slow, but mostly entertaining. Swank is good, but nowhere near the level that she hit with Boys Don't Cry. It's impossible to believe that Eastwood got nominated, especially over Paul Giamatti for Sideways. His direction is fine, but he can barely speak. Plus, he's so old it looks like his skeleton is trying to escape from his body. Morgan Freeman isn't especially great in his supporting role. He can't speak clearly, either. He narrates the film, and it can often be very hard to understand him. Million Dollar Baby is worth seeing, but it certainly isn't award-worthy. 7/10."
"lkdg32","1","8","25","17 January 2005"," Boring
","This movie does not connect you to the characters at all, in fact you should doze off and have thoughts about something else several times in the movie. The main things that happen are: Girl wants Eastwood to be her trainer, Eastwood agrees because he is down, girl wins a lot of fights in the 1st round, girl gets seriously injured, family won't support girl (I actually read this, I dozed off at this part because it was so boring), Eastwood pulls plug on girl. Obviously this sucks for the girl, but there is no attachment to her or any of the other characters. The retard character seems to be filler. This movie is long and you should be just waiting for it to end. This is no Mystic River. Zero stars."

","I went to see Million Dollar Baby with every expectation of being entertained, maybe even exhilarated by the end-of-year accolades for what, in Toronto, was essentially unheralded and unhyped. Well, I tried. And after half the film I was distracted by the many plaudits it has earned, the number of #1 ratings it has accumulated from critics everywhere. I found the movie formulaic in the extreme, predictable at every turn, written with the sophistication of a middling junior high school student and portentous when it wasn't pretentious. We won't begin to discuss Mr. Eastwood's score. Clichés tumble over each other and the narrative device, better by little than phone conversations that tie up creaky plots, made me squirrelly. And all the earnest acting, barely audible grunts and endless fadeout shots made for another ersatz experience in Hollywood. Is the American scene so desperate for an auteur, someone they can claim has the rights to immortality, that they leap over themselves to find a winner? Sideways makes this movie look like kid's play. A Very Long Engagement is head and shoulders above this corny and Oscar-focused pulp film. And sure, it will win plenty of awards, much money will be made from the fraudulent effort to tell a story that we could have done ourselves. So, what's all the fuss about?"
"twistoffate38","3","7","21","8 January 2005"," Disappointment: Ruined by Bad Ending
","I'll avoid spoilers at the beginning of this review. MDB was well-acted and directed and had me interested in the story up until the ""twist,"" which took the film in a different direction for the final 45 minutes.<br/><br/>An important element in a good film is being able to make the viewer care about and sympathize with the protagonists. MDB lost me and I stopped caring about the main characters because of some of the decisions that they made near the end of the film. MDB tries to be a drama, but a number of unrealistic scenes make it play more like a melodramatic comic book. One scene, in particular, involving Morgan Freeman, is laughable in its lack of believability. In the end, the film comes off as being preachy. Out of the blue, it tackles a controversial societal topic and tries to force its point of view upon the audience. In doing so, it betrays the integrity of the film and ruins everything good that had built up to that point. The last half hour was torturous to watch and just dragged on at a needlessly slow pace.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS BELOW*** I get the feeling that the intention of MDB was to make a case for euthanasia all along and just use the boxing story as a disguise. I strongly disagree with the message of the film: that it is better to die as a championship boxer than to live a life in a wheelchair. The film is a slap in the face to all those who have achieved great things after paralysis, such as Christopher Reeve. Maggie could have used her celebrity status to go on to do great things and raise money and awareness for her condition, as Reeve did. Instead, she makes a terrible decision. I am truly baffled as to why some people applaud the films ending or are emotionally moved by Maggie's death.<br/><br/>On a final note, I am not against euthanasia, per se. I think it depends on the situation. For example, in ""One Flew Over the Cookoo's Nest,"" I was deeply moved when the Chief took Jack's life at the end, and I agreed with the decision. This was a case of someone who had a lobotomy and had his personality robbed of him. Maggie, on the other hand, had her personality and intellect still in tact, which is more important than her body.<br/><br/>***END SPOILERS***"
"GManfred","Null","4","10","2 July 2008"," Maudlin Dollar Baby
","Where to start. Difficult to relate how much I detested this movie. I think my biggest objection was the flop ending wherein the picture descends into bathos. About 40 minutes from the end the film throws out its anchor as the heroine dies a heroic death, and the film also drops dead. Hard to believe a veteran like Clint Eastwood would allow it to come to a grinding halt, but why not - the picture was handicapped by its inane plot and uninteresting storyline from the beginning. I was misled by all the hype and the big names involved, as I like Morgan Freeman as well as Eastwood. I should have been forewarned by Eastwood's last preposterous Oscar picture, ""Unforgiven"" (1990). He is starting to show an unattractive tendency to pander to unsophisticated moviegoers, although it could be he's just aging ungracefully as a director.<br/><br/>One of the headlines under the title page here on the website says that Eastwood is going to have another whack at Dirty Harry. We can only hope."

","I am truly on the fringe in even posting my reaction to this film since my reaction, enjoyment and assessment is in the one percent. I have read every review after my viewing and they all say the same words, as if they all got a handout before a screening and were nudged closer to the grander thoughts of Eastwood.<br/><br/>Yes, I missed something in this minimalist script with minimalist direction with minimalist emotions in a minimalist development.<br/><br/>I guess it was simply not my movie. We all have those experiences, I assume.<br/><br/>The most distracting character was Danger Barch  that clown that other training boxers would want to kill and take out. Danger's presence not make sense either on the front side of the story or his later resurrection with some sort of immaculate redemption in having seen God and awarded a new nose without scars in the surrounding facial tissue. No emotion in my viewing.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman was simply Morgan Freeman. That is what he is good with and comfortable. No emotion in my viewing.<br/><br/>Maggie Fitzgerald came on with a strong Texan drawl or whatever that did not fit the character and which soon disappeared. And we never know the comfort she gets from Southern boxing and taking out other females on the canvas. Did she hit a guy first and got her rocks off? Or was it a female that she jabbed and got a jolt of estrogen? Did she pounce on her mother? No clue. I was clueless once again.<br/><br/>What did I miss? There are two parts what were good: (1) the fighting mano a mano (okay, I admit that I do no know the female equivalent in that male expression) with the ladies. (2) the moment upon delivering a house to the mother and family. At that moment, we know something about the family but not Maggie since there was conflict undisclosed. Two strong points in the movie. Later encounters with the family at the hospital were just stupid and predictable with poor acting messing it all up.<br/><br/>What did I miss? Okay, now Maggie is in the hospital with some sort of spinal injury that requires assisted respiratory breathing tubes. Air is forced in the lungs and air is drawn out of the lungs where her normal breathing and speaking were bypassed. The machine pumped air in and the machine pulled air out.<br/><br/>At no time during the visit of Frankie Dunn was Maggie's breath in talking disrupted between the mechanical uptake and outlet of air. She spoke perfect tomes to Frankie. Hey, just try talking while inhaling and exhaling --- you can to it!!! And your voice changes!!! Okay.<br/><br/>How was Frankie Dunn able to get into a hospital late at night from an outside, unlocked door that leads directly to an Intensive Care unit??? We are now at the end of the film and at the Intensive or Critical Care unit. An attendant at the end of the hallway is going on a coffee break and all we see he her announcing here intent at a typical hospital counter in a small view setting.<br/><br/>The attendant leaves and that is when Frankie pulls the plug on a Critical Care patient. We see the monitors slowly beeping into existence as we assume the same for Maggie. Blank. The patient-side monitors are dead as is Maggie.<br/><br/>Now one must wonder at this point: is patient monitoring in Critical Care for the benefit of the patient to listen to the bleeps and blips of sounds? Or are those signals sent to a Critical Care central point where the coffee going nurse turned over monitoring responsibility to the unknown skilled care nurse beyond our view? Frankie walks down that long, dark hallway and exits a door that is open 7-24 at this hospital that holds about 20 other patients. Anybody can walk in that door and the hospital staff does not care.<br/><br/>If Hilary Swank died that night in an unattended manner, what happened to those other 20 patients in need of care? Hmmmmvery stupid stuff.<br/><br/>Or, perhaps this film was mapping at a local hospital in Los Angeles that is controversial at this moment. It is the King/Drew hospital in which the Los Angeles Times newspaper a few weeks ago exposed a setting that perhaps was presaged by Clint Eastwood hospital health care incompetence.<br/><br/>But I doubt that his film was about King/Drew. Yet that is my closest interpretation of being lost in the dust."
"harbor21usa","Null","4","10","22 December 2004"," ""Million Dollar Baby"" Flirts With Greatness
","Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank are three of our national treasures who happen to be actors. With a cast of this caliber, movie fans are compelled by logic to pay serious attention. As many of us already know, these three leads and the entire cast of ""Million Dollar Baby"" do NOT disappoint. This story of a not-quite-young woman's journey to the top of the boxing sport delivers a wallop from the opening bell to the closing credits.<br/><br/>Through the first two acts I was convinced I was seeing the American version of storytelling greatness unfolding upon the screen. Through a combination of deep athletic talent, deeper courage and, beyond even that, something intangible and, perhaps, spiritual, boxer Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) (known to fans in the story by a Gaelic name I can neither spell nor pronounce) earns her shot at a major title fight. The protracted action of the title fight (as do all of the fight scenes) delivers the kind excitement that had me concluding this is the best boxing movie since ""Raging Bull."" When the fight is over, Maggie's upward momentum is tragically broken.<br/><br/>And then comes the start of the third act. If there's a problem with the third act, which many will dispute, it's that the movie's dramatic momentum collapses in perfect parallel with the collapse of Maggie's career momentum. This, I believe, happens because the third act makes a sharp turn away from being a hard-boiled action-drama focused upon desire to being a four-hanky tearjerker about euthanasia. For an uncomfortably long interval of the third act, we're allowed to ponder the significance of the dirty fight business, to simmer with hatred for Maggie's one-dimensionally evil family and to psychologize about fight manager/trainer Frankie Dunne's (Clint Eastwood) tragic character flaw. Individually, all of these story elements are good; in combination, the story starts feeling over-the-top in the waterworks department. I was seriously fearful about boxing gym manager Scrap Dupris (Morgan Freeman) not appearing again; but then he does reappear and, thankfully, his conflict with Frankie resumes. The resumption (and resolution) of this conflict partially redeems the heretofore tearjerker third act by turning back the story to the hard-boiled account of epic desire made good by a champion.<br/><br/>Euthanasia, although understandable as the preferred choice of a fallen warrior, as a story element still carries too much of a charge to share center stage with another major story element, and thus much of the third act meshes poorly with the first two acts from the standpoint of momentum. For the most part, the third act on its own is good, but it awkwardly meshes with the first two acts. The problem may stem from the fact that the movie is cobbled together from the short stories of boxing manager F.X. Toole, as opposed to being an adaptation of a feature-length story. This may very well mean that the full arc of Maggie's story is a creation of the screenwriter not intended by the original author.<br/><br/>For the first two acts this movie waltzes across the floorboards, held gloriously within the close embrace of greatness. It sputters and stumbles into the third act, and then it recovers its balance before the final curtain."

The first time was in the theatre after it won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director (Clint Eastwood), Best Actress (Hilary Swank), and Best Supporting Actor (Morgan Freeman). The last was hours ago on HD DVD with my parents. My dad thought it dragged a little while my mom thought it was about more than boxing and liked the slow passages. In between the drama with the three stars, there's some humor involving Clint and Morgan as well as with Morgan and some of the other boxing hopefuls including a really enthusiastic kid who initially calls Freeman the ""N"" word but says he doesn't really mean it. Morgan's character also narrates the story in what is revealed to be a letter to Eastwood's long-estranged daughter who we never see. The movie does take its own sweet time and makes Paul Haggis' dialogue shine throughout. Since I've only seen one of the other Best Picture Oscar nominees of 2004 (The Aviator), I can't judge if this was indeed the finest of that year. However, Million Dollar Baby was certainly one of the most compelling."
"duvel71","3","3","7","20 July 2005"," Million dollar rubbish
","Am I the only one who thinks Million Dollar Baby is a terrible movie? It won best film, best director (Clint Eastwood), best actress (Hilary Swank) and best supporting actor (Morgan Freeman) at the Academy Awards. (And all four Oscars were prominently displayed during the cast interview.) I'd avoid plot spoilers for those who haven't seen it, but the plot is so clichéd, thin and predictable, I can't offer guarantees.<br/><br/>The only change to the old poor-boy-makes-good-boxing formula is that it's a poor girl this time.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank is pretty good and the boxing scenes are fairly well choreographed, but neither are good enough to rescue the movie from dreary predictability. The direction is marginally competent in places, and I even think I spotted Clint act at one point. Otherwise, his caricature of a bitter old grouch was simplistic and one-dimensional.<br/><br/>But neither Swank's efforts, nor Morgan Freeman's characteristic likability, could save the movie from a premise that is such a tired old workhorse that I'm surprised anyone bothered with it. It's a politically-correct Rocky rehash.<br/><br/>Apparently, it made everyone who read the script cry, so that justified making it. Well, I cried during The Champ. But that was 30 years ago.<br/><br/>This was pure self-indulgence on the part of Clint Eastwood. The grand question that tears at his soul was the cherry on top. ""Look how strong and moral and basically good I am!"" It was shot in 37 days. That shows. Even the screenwriter said he was surprised that his first draft was shot. He wouldn't have done that, and he would have been right not to. There were a loose ends all over the place, implausible scenarios (you'd think fingerprints in the hospital ward would have been an issue), and a lot of stock scenes that could have done with some disguise.<br/><br/>And how about that pukey guy talking to Eastwood, Swank and Freeman on the DVD cast interview afterwards? I'd be embarrassed to be interviewed by such a fawning fool. ""I know I shouldn't say 'genius', but *sigh* GENIUS *faint*"". It was creepy.<br/><br/>Swank made the only worthwhile contribution, both in her effort in the role, and in commenting afterwards that the movie did something for female boxers. It's not all just crude trailer-trash violence, and some of these women deserve a bit of respect - and self-respect.<br/><br/>But other than that, it was a load of codswallop. A waste of money. I give it three out of ten, as a consolation prize to Swank. Clint Eastwood - of whom, incidentally, I'm a big fan - gets nada."
"ronibklynbroad","4","3","7","14 February 2005"," Very underwhelming
","I saw this movie yesterday after seeing all the acclaim and boy, was I disappointed. There are many implausible plot lines, and frankly who needs another boxing movie about man/woman reaching glory by winning boxing matches. Many reviews stated that the boxing theme was minor but I didn't find that to be the case at all. After Rocky and Raging Bull, the turf has been covered. I thought that Eastwood eclipsed with Mystic River and this was a letdown, same with Hillary Swank who was more interesting in Boys Don't Cry. I never saw Los Angeles come off more like a rural hick town than in this film. There is this relationship with Eastwood and his daughter that is mystery estrangement and it is never resolved. The pacing was also very slow. This has to be the weakest of the Oscar contenders this year."
"squirrelsatemynuts","4","3","7","13 February 2005"," Somewhere, Spike Lee is mad. Right here, I'm disappointed.
","Much like Clint Eastwood's last supposed masterpiece, Mystic River, Million Dollar baby combines stereotypical, recycled characters with overwrought photography and an inexcusable score to create mediocre Oscar bait (check the release date - suspicious). Perhaps the film's worst offense is Eddie, the custodian/trainer at Frankie's gym. The character is a blatant example of what Spike Lee calls the ""super Negro"" - a wise old black man who uses his uncanny insight and common wisdom to help white people who either take him for granted or treat him like crap. Eastwood even gave Eddie a severe cataract in one eye to emphasize that his vision is not like ours (or Frankie's). I don't know why Morgan Freeman accepts these roles. In Million Dollar Baby, a minor character even uses the n-word against Eddie; it's in a context that strives to be non-offensive, but it only adds to the ""super Negro"" character stereotype. The other two leads, Frankie (played by Eastwood) and Maggie (Hilary Swank) are just as stereotypical but not nearly as offensive. They are the grizzled old stubborn veteran and the hard-luck, hard-working gal who does things her own way. Eastwood forces the surrogate father/daughter relationship between the characters with corny, overt dialog at tender moments and with the letters Frankie's own daughter returns to him each week. This subplot goes unresolved - it exists only to drive an already obvious point about the lead characters' relationship into our minds.<br/><br/>Eastwood and his pet DP/former gaffer Tom Stern blanket their walking stereotypes in shadows. In some scenes more than 50 percent of the frame remains true black. Stern offsets this with contrived lighting that highlights pieces of objects or faces with no relation to the supposed sources in the story world. For example, Maggie often has a triangular swatch of highlight on her nose and forehead, and in the last hospital scene, the far corner of her bed mysteriously glows in the moonlight while her head, with nothing between it and the window except the glowing sheet corner, remains in complete shadow. I imagine Eastwood and Stern used this high-contrast look to make the film gritty and ""real,"" but with the outrageous point sources and conveniently-placed flags it looks about as lifelike as Jurassic Park III. Perhaps Stern's background as a long-time gaffer made him into a cinematographer who pays much attention to complicated lighting schemes and little attention to composition as a whole. Sure it's nice with Eddie literally casts a long shadow in scenes where he's in a position of power, but it's a bit over the top. I feel sorry for Swank and Freeman for having to act while frozen in those tiny, micromanaged pools of light.<br/><br/>Stern's photography, however, seems masterful compared to Eastwood's score. I thought he did a fine job developing emotion at the key story points through direction and editing, but he seems to feel it's necessary to cue his viewers with grating strings (sad!) or bright piano (happy!) that reflect exactly what's happening a few moments before it occurs on screen. Apparently Clint doesn't trust his storytelling enough to leave his amateurish songwriting skills out of the mix.<br/><br/>Eastwood seems to pay so much attention to craft that I imagine he could make a truly great film instead of overrated Oscar bait in his old age. I wish he would ditch his old buddy Stern, hire a real composer and get a script with characters that are more than tired stereotypes."
"bubsy-3","4","3","7","6 February 2005"," Slow, boring, and lacking in emotion
","I know I'm in the minority regarding this movie, but I have to say that I found it slow, boring, and lacking in emotion. Eastwood seemed to feel that each point needed to be dwelled upon for an extended period of time. Numerous times during this movie, I kept saying to myself, ""OK, you've made your point, now move on!"". I found this movie devoid of any emotion and totally numb. I also can't understand how Hillary Swank was nominated for an Academy Award for this movie. Her performance was nowhere near her exceptional performance in Boys Don't Cry. Also, the priest said that he has seen Frankie at mass every Sunday for 23 years!. Yet the priest looked under 40. He became a priest at 17?!"
"lazarus_ca_48","Null","3","7","30 January 2005"," Boxing film fails to deliver knockout punch
","Clint Eastwood's role as boxing trainer Frankie Dunn is by far the best thing about ""Million Dollar Baby"". His gruff, gravelly portrayal gives the film its heart and soul. He earns our sympathy for his character, without lapsing into cloying sentimentality.<br/><br/>As boxer Maggie Fitzgerald, Hilary Swank is limited by the narrow range of her role to giving a one-note performance. I was not convinced that her character had sufficient motivation to escape the confines of her life as a waitress. Swank is more believable in her response to her trailer-trash family. She is generous and well-intentioned at first, hurt when her generosity is not appreciated, and incensed when she finds out what vultures her mother and siblings really are.<br/><br/>Margo Martindale is excellent as Maggie's mother Earline. She strikes exactly the right note in both of her scenes as a woman who cares more about welfare payments than the welfare of her flesh and blood.<br/><br/>As washed-up boxer Eddie ""Scrap Iron"" Dupris, Morgan Freeman serves as little more than a chorus in this modern Greek tragedy. His voice-over provides expository material. In other words, Freeman tells us what the film should show us. This kind of exposition is deadly in a film, the opposite of what good screen writing and good cinema should be.<br/><br/>""Million Dollar Baby"" earned Clint Eastwood an Oscar nomination as best actor and best director. He richly deserves the acting nod, but his directorial skills on this film are open to question.<br/><br/>Eastwood's craft gets in the way of the story instead of helping it along. The music in the final reel is too syrupy and saccharine. Too many scenes are cloaked in shadow, as if to remind us symbolically of the darkness that lurks in men's souls.<br/><br/>A well-crafted film is one where the craft is seamless and invisible. When we become overly conscious of the director's (or actor's) craft, it becomes obtrusive and distracting. It keeps us from entering the world of the film, being enthralled by the story told.<br/><br/>This flaw prevented me from buying into ""Million Dollar Baby"". The film did not move me, or draw me into its human drama, but left me a cold, distant bystander, an observer. ""Million Dollar Baby"" failed to deliver a knockout punch. I ended up feeling suckered instead."
"Artless_Dodger","10","2","4","17 April 2016"," This is Eastwood's masterpiece.
","Clint Eastwood's beautiful film tells the simple story of Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) and Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman), two old friends who run a boxing gym together, and the impact that Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) has on both their lives. Eastwood allows his characters centre stage, trusting in a marvellous script by Paul Haggis (based on stories by FX Toole) and the tremendous work of his players. The result is a wonderfully unfussy and affecting tale of people who feel as real as you or I, each line and expression ringing as true as anything we have seen on film.<br/><br/>Eastwood and Freeman use every single line to wonderful and curmudgeonly effect, portraying a deep friendship borne out of shared experiences and disappointments. Maggie is set on Frankie being her trainer and manager but he resists, unwilling to train a girl. Eddie sees something in Maggie, and encourages Frankie to train her. Slowly, Maggie's determination wins an unwilling Frankie over. Watching their friendship take root and blossom draws us deeper into the story, with the malcontented Frankie slowly warming to his new, if unwanted, charge. These three characters are the heart of the movie, and it's a film with a seriously huge heart.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman won Oscars for their roles, and Eastwood won an Oscar for his direction, with the film winning Best Picture. However, Eastwood the actor has never been better. All three give beautifully pitched performances, and Eastwood the director captures them perfectly.<br/><br/>There's fine support work too from Jay Baruchel as Danger Barch, who dreams of being a world champion and Margo Martindale as Maggie's mother. <br/><br/>It's a story to make you laugh, it's a story to make you cheer, and it's a story to make you cry. This is Eastwood's masterpiece and one of my favourite films of all time. It's emotionally challenging, but I urge you to watch it."
"manitobaman81","7","2","4","22 August 2014"," Good
","It's never boring. Eastwood is good when he is bad and good when he is good, so no point in dwelling on him. It's worth watching this movie just to see him. Here he has chosen to make a heart-felt, character-driven film. All of the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. It's not the thing to see if you're in the mood for something uplifting, or something with tons of action. But it is a true gem in which the only thing that keeps it afloat is the sensitivity of the desperately needy relationship between the characters. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. A gritty, hard movie about gritty, hard people."

","Million Dollar Baby is a very inconstant film in quality terms. The start, I mean, the first twenty minutes of film are full of over the top situations (such as the conversation with the priest scene), silly inane dialogs, and a weird voice over by Morgan Freeman narrating everything that happened in the film, even when wasn't needed at all. Yes, horrible way to start a film. I felt that the actors were very uncomfortable saying certain lines because it was truly awful. Paul Haggis, no wonder. The guy who wrote and directed the arguably most moronic and inane(and undeserved) Oscar Winner Picture ever(Crash). Clint's direction was really really good, because the film was brilliant since the 30 minutes and this 'briliantism' lasted until the final 30 minutes. Was really good. The main problem with this film is the quantity of unrealistic situations. A hospital would never allow a patient's leg gangrene, for example. The priest was also completely put of the reality in the film. These among numerous other problems. I could enjoy a lot this film, which is technically very good too, I think Clint and Swank gave their best performances in their careers, but there is way too many awful parts that can't be forgiven. 7/ 10"

"ElMaruecan82","9","2","4","30 April 2013"," Emotional Knock-Out ...
","""Million Dollar Baby"" is undoubtedly the most acclaimed movie of 2004. It has often been referred by movie critics as a cinematic come-back to a more traditional film-making, like the dark and gripping Hollywood underdog stories of the 30's and 40's, a comparison that has been made for ""Rocky"" in its time.<br/><br/>""Million Dollar Baby"" is a film of a few characters that yet constitute a solid and powerful acting ensemble. But has Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman ever gave a disappointing performance? Even Hillary Swank who won the Oscar for Best Actress, is totally diluted in her role as Maggie Fitzgerald, the white trash Southern girl whose only dream in life is to become a professional boxer. 'Dream' is too vague a word, 'reason to keep faith in this world' is more appropriate. And faith is a redundant theme in the story, faith as a strong belief in life's driving forces, including ours. It's definitely an underdog story, but told with great respect to the viewers.<br/><br/>Like its glorious 'underdog' predecessor, ""Rocky"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" restrains all the emotions until finally imploding during a poignant and heart-breaking third act. The first ones consist on building relationships until their reason-to-exist within the story emotionally bloom. Clint Eastwood is Frankie Dunn, the hardened boxing trainer and Morgan Freeman, his assistant Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris, an ex-athlete whose dead eye symbolize other unconcealed wounds in his heart. Frankie also has demons to exorcise, and the film never tries to hide them. We understand it's about a daughter life has taken away from him, that he tries to find some meaning about God, harassing a priest with pointless questions ... that would take all their significance at the end.<br/><br/>It's also easy to see that Maggie would complete Frankie, that he's going to help her as much as she will. It takes time before he takes the crucial decision to train her, maybe too much time but this is the mark of a film that cares more about characters than action. It's true sometimes, we can feel some events coming, when Frankie seems reluctant to engage his most valued protégé in Heavyweight championship; we know it's a matter of time before the man leaves him. Why? Because there has to be a gap in Frankie's heart, and relationships are all about ""filling gaps"". That's what Balboa said about his romance with Adrian, the same goes between Frankie and Maggie, in a father-and-daughter way. There is a mystery surrounding the Gaelic nickname he'll gave to her, the translation, if not surprising, is nonetheless poignant.<br/><br/>That's the point, if you expect surprises, if you expect twists and new artistic licenses on the Sports genre, get ready for disappointment. ""Million Dollar Baby"" has the one flaw of Clint Eastwood's film: things are obvious and straight-forward, the bad guys are bad, the good ones are good. The way Maggie is treated by her opportunistic Welfare-cheating family, almost as villainous as the Big Blue Bear, is Eastwood's trademark, the depiction of a world in black and white. The film itself has a dark and shadowy atmosphere, conveying the nastiness and cruelty of a world, where the most precious moments have to keep intimate and secret. Rather than an exercise in obviousness, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a film that focuses on these intimate interactions, these moments where something sacred is transmitted: a secret, a declaration, a revelation  <br/><br/>And only Eastwood and Freeman can get away with their own clichés without ruining the film's intents. Yes, we have Morgan Freeman and his noble voice-over narration, translating into words what sometimes images can't express. Yes his gravely, deliberately monotonous voice, has a hypnotizing effect in our ears. Yes, Eastwood is groaning, grumpy character. Yes, the comparison with ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is inevitable, and it's impossible not to laugh sometimes at Eastwood's bad moods. But ""Million Dollar Baby"" has to be judged in its entirety, if you feel manipulated, ask yourself about the movie's pay-off, what does it speak to you? What does it say about life, about dreams? Sentimentality is one thing, but movie-making is an art-form whose merit can only be judged on its capacity to inspire emotions. And emotionally, the ending is satisfying.<br/><br/>I feel like I would spoil the film if I go further in this review. I don't want to reveal the events that constitute the final third act, although the film's ranking among one of the greatest tear-jerker give enough hints not to expect a happy ending. But again, it's not about happiness, but about people meeting each other, and filling each other's gaps. It flirts with some obviousness, but to be sincere, I never felt it forced or stereotypical. I wish I could be smart and cynical enough to dismiss the film, and label it as propaganda, manipulation and dangerous influence, but the fact is that the three performance touched my heart. I understand the criticism, I even understand the hatred, but the film deeply moved me.<br/><br/>The 'obviousness' is precisely what critics refer as renaissance of Hollywood tradition. Maybe in this era where psychological thrillers and non-linear narrative are overused by new talents, a movie like ""Million Dollar Baby"" that doesn't care about subtlety and nuance yet cares to tell a gripping and powerful story about three people, maybe this is the refreshment cinema asked for. And the fluid directing, the shadowy cinematography, the patient editing and the acting, contribute to a powerful movie, showing people evolving with time, people with dreams and hopes.<br/><br/>Reviewing a film is a matter of genuine feelings and sincerity; I would be lying to myself if I started to criticize it for the sake of it. If I did, no matter how clever and hip I would sound, I wouldn't dare to review other movies. In all sincerity, I loved ""Million Dollar Baby"" and it's indeed one of Clint Eastwood's best works."

","I'm caught again without knowing anything about this great film. I had no idea what it was about, but pleasantly surprised that it presents a documentary on a topic I knew/and/know very little about: women's boxing league. So many great reviews have been posted here, there is little else to write.<br/><br/>The entire film is done with perfection: the dark lighting of the gym makes the incidents that happens in it believable; it is the reflection of the misery most of the characters bring to it. I don't agree with some reviewers who say the story lagged and was incomplete: the script was gut-wrenching, because it lead one to believe ""Maggie"" )Hillary Swank) is going to win her life-long dream. ""Frank"" (Clint Eastwppd) has begun to believe he has won redemption for whatever he has done to cause all those letters to be returned. ""Scrap-Iron"" is content to live in a place where he began a journey to a lost title, but holds no bitterness against the man who could have done more for him to win his victory. ""Maggie"" is relentless, and successful, to have ""Frank"" manage and train her - the other characters are the types of people you'd expect to find in the gym. Bullies taunting a totally inept boy who also dreams of becoming a title-holder; ""Scrap-Iron's"" defense of him brings him complete peace with the realization he is in the right place. ""Billie, the Blue Bear's"" resentment (and realization she has met her match) brutally illegal attack on ""Maggie"" is completely unexpected (but believable), and provides the reason for ""Frank"" to do ""the right thing"" and move-on. ""Scrap-Iron's"" realization that he must keep the gym operating, for ""Frank""s return, solved that whole problem, and brought viewers such relief that ""Maggie"" almost accomplished her dream - and left her misery in a hard-won peace.<br/><br/>Script, directing and casting couldn't have been better. Every actor/actress was brilliant. Although it brought me to a point to think about incidents of pain and happiness in my own life, it wasn't with more pain......that's just what happened.

It really felt like 2 different movies in 1.<br/><br/>Clint and Hillary's performances were superb. Morgan doesn't ever seem to do much ""acting"" in his movies, it appears he just plays himself in every role. However, I do love his voice and think Clint did well in choosing him to narrate. I absolutely despised the people playing Maggie's family so that was a good piece of casting.<br/><br/>Yes, this is a sport movie, but it's also a very touching story of a relationship between 2 unlikely characters. This a movie that both men and women can find something to keep their interest."
"Christopher_Reid","10","2","4","2 July 2007"," Great film, always entertaining and very powerful at times.
","Million Dollar Baby is a rare kind of film in that it manages to express so much more than what's happening on the screen and in the soundtrack. Even though the film generally has a very calm pace, it is never boring and although a number of scenes are very quiet and with little movement, they're always engaging and often quite powerful.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood all deliver great performances and manage to give their characters a depth that few movies can match. The script flows well and gives the characters room to breathe and take on a life of their own. It also has plenty of humour which is always welcome in a drama. The music by Clint Eastwood (he composes music as well!) is simple but extremely effective. It has the weight of someone working comfortably within their range rather than someone limited by some kind of inexperience. It enhances the impact of the movie and never distracts.<br/><br/>The boxing scenes are very well directed although as many have pointed out, Million Dollar Baby is not so much a boxing film as a film about a boxer. The third act is especially well made and is very powerful and beautiful. Those that suggest Million Dollar Baby is making some kind of stance on certain controversial topics are missing the point completely. It is about the characters, the decisions they have to make and why they choose to do what they do. Arguably it is all about love.<br/><br/>This is probably the best movie of the year (even though The Incredibles was also excellent) and everyone should definitely see it!"

","Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is a boxing trainer whose daughter is painfully estranged from his life. He doesn't take risks with his fighters, he's calculated and protective; leaving him less than successful at his art.<br/><br/>Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank) is a wannabe boxer, with an remarkable and unshakable focus on success; but her age is against her. Her family are less than supportive of her ambitions, and they are disrespectful to her in-spite of her desire to do the best by them.<br/><br/>When Frankie begrudgingly agrees to teach Maggie, they learn to share a common feeling of fulfilment, and find the sense of family that they have both lost, in each other.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman plays an integral part in the story, his is Dunn's helping hand in the gym, while also being his council and his guide; but he is also the narrator of the story, in a very similar manner to the one used in the Shawkshank Redemption.<br/><br/>Eastwood's direction is sublime, again he proves his knowledge of what a film needs to truly tell a story and compel an audience. All of the support characters are interesting, sometimes funny, but always well portrayed; the story itself is excellent, it has power and passion, and if it fails to provoke your emotions then i'm afraid you may in fact be dead.<br/><br/>What completes this masterpiece is the performances of the leads players - <br/><br/>Eastwood is typically brilliant, he's inspiring and impossible to take yours eyes off.<br/><br/>Freeman is on top form, he's faultless and plays the voice of reason and rationality throughout the film.<br/><br/>And finally Swank, she is simply awesome in this role, her physical ability as a boxer is astounding enough, but when coupled with her exemplary acting talent, she commands the screen in every scene with ease - Awesome <br/><br/>Whatever your expecting in this film, it won't fail to move you or impress you; it's a masterpiece 10/10"
"DeeNine-2","10","2","4","10 January 2007"," A brutally realistic tale not suitable for all viewers
","Hilary Swank won her second Best Actress Oscar for her performance as Maggie Fitzgerald, woman boxer, in this outstanding movie directed and produced by Clint Eastwood. Her first was for Boys Don't Cry (1999). It's clear she put a lot of work into the part and was outstanding and clearly deserved the award. The movie is one of Clint Eastwood's best. I would not however recommend that everybody see this. The latter part of the movie is brutal and the ending is not pretty.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman as Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, a tough-as-nails veteran of 109 fights and owner of only one working eye, narrates part of the action as the jack of all duties at the Hit Pit Gym for boxing hopefuls run by Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood). Scrap is addressing somebody. At the end of the film we find out who (but of course I can't say). This is a nice touch that adds some depth to the theme of the movie which is the love that exists (or should) between a father and a daughter.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood plays the father figure to Swank's irrepressible Maggie, ambitious trailer trash girl with a heart as strong as a bull. Eastwood's Frankie Dunn is a deeply troubled man who is continually writing to his daughter only to have the letters always come back unopened with the words ""Return to Sender"" on them. Apparently Frankie did something so bad that his daughter will no longer have anything to do with him. I didn't notice that we ever find out what this something was, but it doesn't matter. Frankie's character is such that we forgive him even if his daughter doesn't.<br/><br/>The story starts out like any one of a hundred Hollywood fight movies with the difference being the boxer is a woman. But the story does not end like a ""Rocky"" contrivance. Instead Eastwood and Paul Higgis, who wrote the heart-wrenching script, opt for a kind of stark realism that will not please some people. There is the sense that this could really happen and is the kind of tragedy that Shakespeare and the Greek dramatists would appreciate.<br/><br/>But the tragedy is not Maggie Fitzgerald's alone. It is also Frankie's. And it is Scrap-Iron's as well. If only Frankie had not trained her. If only Scrap-Iron had gone to Vegas for the title fight and been in her corner. If only Scrap-Iron had not encouraged Maggie. ""If only,"" like so much of life, has no meaning after the fact of what actually happens. Scrap wants to believe that Maggie was the better for having really lived and had a chance at a great personal triumph; and even Maggie herself seems to at least want to believe that. Frankie however is clearly not in agreement.<br/><br/>At the end Frankie, who is a lifelong Catholic who goes to church every Sunday and is looking for the meaning of life, must face a terrible dilemma. Maggie asks him to do something that he cannot do, that goes against his religion. Yet he feels he must do it.<br/><br/>How one interprets the ending--did he do the right thing?--may very well determine whether one likes the film or not. His moral dilemma is very real and I, for one, cannot say what I would have done in his situation, and so for me the horns of the dilemma are very sharp indeed.<br/><br/>I quit watching boxing on TV many ago because of the way the fights excite the blood, since the point of a boxing match is to make the opponent helpless. I don't like feeling like that. This movie, in a way, perhaps accidentally, comes to the same end as many a fight: the winner goes on to another fight, and to an eventual loss, while the loser is made helpless.<br/><br/>Some people might be wondering what the message here is. I'm not sure, but I can tell you this: Shakespeare essentially said there is no message. Life is tale told by an idiot...in the end signifying nothing. And the existentialists will tell you that life has no meaning except for that which we ourselves bestow upon it. I guess Scrap is the existentialist and Frankie the Shakespearean.<br/><br/>And who is Maggie? And who is everywoman and everyman?<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)"
"cinelyze","10","2","4","23 December 2006"," Worthy ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a Champ
","Despite its subject matter, ""Million Dollar Baby"" will bring a million dollar smile to your heart, if only metaphorically. As with the previous year's ""Mystic River,"" a similarly dark though decidedly different film, veteran filmmaker Clint Eastwood reveals his authority with the art of storytelling through the nuanced behavior of his characters. In this, the director's 25th feature film, Eastwood proves there is such a thing as a quality film that can appeal to the masses.<br/><br/>Based on Rope Burns: Tales from the Corner, F.X. Toole's collection of stories about prize fighting, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a throwback to the kind of films that Warner Bros., the studio which financed it, produced in the Golden Age of Hollywood. Eastwood's mastery with the material is such that he has crafted a timeless film, one that will be as much of a treat fifty years from now as it is today. And what a treat it is.<br/><br/>Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, the curmudgeonly owner of the Hit Pit, a gritty, money- losing boxing gym in downtown L.A. Once known as the ""best cut man in the business,"" Frankie now spends his days going to church, reading Gaelic poetry, and training Big Willie Little, a fighter whose desire for a shot at the title is hampered only by Frankie's mantra that he'll be ready in ""two or three"" more fights. That Big Willie disagrees becomes not only a point of contention between the two men, but also an early turning point in the plot.<br/><br/>Overseeing the day-to-day needs of the Hit Pit is Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris (Morgan Freeman, in one of the best turns of his career), an aging former fighter who lost an eye in his last bout, and whose tendency towards gambling has left him virtually penniless. It is to Freeman's credit and astute understanding of the character, however, that Scrap is never pitiful. On the contrary, the quietly philosophical janitor, who is also Frankie's best friend, is the emotional glue that anchors the film and keeps its center intact. He not only maintains order in the often chaotic, testosterone-laden gym, but also provides advice to Frankie in subtle, ambiguous ways. The moments when these two interact on screen, as in the scene about Scrap's holey socks, provide much of the film's comic relief. They also illuminate into the bond of affection the two share.<br/><br/>Into this unlikely mix comes Maggie Fitzgerald (Academy Award winning Hilary Swank, for ""Boys Don't Cry""), a big-hearted young woman from the wrong side of Missouri's tracks whose only desire is to have Frankie train her. ""I don't train girls,"" Frankie tells her, but Maggie's headstrong ways prevent her from accepting this as a deterrent. Despite Frankie's resistance, Maggie continues to show up at the gym, trains well into the nights she doesn't wait tables near the beach, and begins to improve her skills under Scrap's occasional, secretive training tips. <br/><br/>Frankie's multilayered defense mechanism is no challenge for Maggie's determination. His warning to her that ""tough ain't enough"" only further encourages her. In a scene that lays the foundation for the rest of their relationship, Maggie tells him that boxing is the only thing she ever felt good doing. Frankie relents, with the understanding that the two will part ways as soon as her training is complete and she's ready to enter the ring. But Frankie's own heart, ""so big, he's doomed to take a fall,"" overrides this caveat, and he winds up doing ""something he hated doing."" He takes a chance.<br/><br/>In addition to teaching Maggie the necessary mechanics of the sweet science, Frankie constantly reminds her of the first rule of the fight game: Always protect yourself. But as Scrap's voice-over tells us, people never take their own advice, and Frankie is no exception. As time seamlessly passes during Maggie's career development, Frankie embraces her and her winning spirit in a way he cannot with his own estranged daughter. Such magnanimity can only be rewarded by heartbreak, and from there it's only a matter of time before they careen into the inevitable.<br/><br/>Much has been made over the years of Eastwood's quiet style of working, and the fact that he repeatedly employs the same creative team. One benefit of this practice is the work of the nearly ninety-year-old production designer Henry Bumstead, whose desaturated color palette contributes to the film's somber tone. The conjunction of Bumstead's production design with cinematographer Tom Stern's mostly chiaroscuro lighting creates a spare and haunting look that is rare among modern films, but one that works successfully in this context. <br/><br/>Such a backdrop calls the greatest attention to the actors, and one would be hard- pressed, even during this mad-dash-to-Oscar season, to find any better. Hilary Swank once again proves dauntless when it comes to taking on physically demanding roles without compromising the characters' humanism, but it is Eastwood and Freeman who turn in the kind of nakedly honest performances that suggest a natural understanding of character that comes with age. While one might expect this from these veterans, it is the rare film that provides the opportunity for them to display their skill. That alone makes ""Million Dollar Baby"" a winner."

","I originally started watching Million Dollar Baby because I was bored and had time to kill before work. One of the best movies I have seen in my lifetime. The characters are so rich and complex that you can't help but fall in love with them. Swank was amazing and she deserved the Oscar, no doubt about it. There are very few movies that I insist my husband watch but this is one of them. I cried for the last 30 minutes of the movie and did not like the way it ended not knowing what happened to Frank. If you have the chance to see this movie, toss out all preconceived notions about Swank and Eastwood, if you have them, and just watch the story unfold. I was shocked, amazed, and saddened. Excellent movie."

I don't know what to really say and I am not questioning it, but perhaps due to my thick skin is the reason why I am not sobbing in tears but damn, you have to be heartless to not take this movie to your being.<br/><br/>Many people have nit picked and were very critical in their reviews and comments but such is the world of criticism. But, if you ask me, they're clowns, finding any reason to tear anything down for whatever reason that momentarily soothe their pathological problems because to $h!t on this film shows that their clowns.<br/><br/>I will give a big up to Clint; er-hurmm, Mr. Eastwood for his work because now I see what the hype is all about.<br/><br/>I am one for realism when it comes to movies.

"fullonrobotchubby","9","2","4","15 August 2006"," Eastwood's 2nd Best
","Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, a long-in-the-tooth boxing manager and trainer who is too timid to allow his pupils to pursue the championship. As soon as Dunn loses his last protégé, along comes Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank, in her second Best Actress Oscar victory) into his gym, determined to be Dunn's next and first female boxer. After some nudging from his gym's janitor/companion and the film's narrator Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman, winning his first Oscar for a sub par performance), Dunn reluctantly takes young Maggie under his wing and finds the best fighter he's ever helped. From this point, I can't say too much more due to a major plot twist, but the film as a whole is a perfect example of the typical formula for a Shakespearean drama. Once again, my favorite scene is because of Eastwood's performance, about 15-20 minutes from the end, when the tough Dunn breaks down into tears in front of his priest, desperate for a perfect solution he ain't gonna get. Half a star is held back thanks to a pile of clichés like Maggie's pit bull of a final opponent, the bully of the gym getting his at the end, and Freeman narrating (sooo Shawshank). Besides that, holy McCuishle! If anything at all propels M$B into classics territory, it's the second act."

Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood are great together they provide what the movie needs for Action even though i loved Hillary Swank's role in it to, very feisty and yet so relaxed. the movie does have some bad point indeed but that makes the movie the best of its genre.at first i thought that it would be a boring movie until i actually watched it and loved it."
"intcountzero","9","2","4","16 July 2006"," How does Eastwood do it?
","Time and time again, the old school of Clint Eastwood has demonstrated that quality over quantity is the name of the game in the art of movie making. He manages to pluck winners with a pristine and clarity that would rival any producer/director of age today. He churns them out slowly, but when they arrive at our movie screen doorstep, the reward is well worth the wait.<br/><br/>This movie rivals the effort and result that came from ""Unforgiven"". It will be regarded as a classic modern tragedy in the years to come. No one will forget seeing it. It deserved every Academy accolade it was given, if not short a few more.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is the world best supporting actor of all time. Very few have the ability to debate this fact. No one fits this role better, or has mastered it better than he. Don't believe me? Rent ""Shawshank Redemption"", ""Seven"", ""The Power of One"". Hell, you could even rent ""Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves"" for all I care for the sake of argument. He shines even in a weak film.<br/><br/>For Hiliary Swank, all I can say is that I misjudged her early. This woman was made for intense dramas. I had earlier thought that Hollywood propped her up as what was ""in"", but she has time and again since ""Boys Don't Cry"", proved me wrong. She is the real deal, and she has one hell of a career still ahead of her to dominate the industry and the acting peer space as one of the best of her generation."
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","2","4","24 May 2006"," Completely Oscar-worthy (spoilers)
","The reason why Million Dollar Baby works so well is because it's not really a boxing film. It's really a film about paternal love. Therefore the two main characters could be anything and the film would still probably work. However, that's not to say that the boxing doesn't help the film, because it does. It helps give the film grit, it works as a metaphor for all the knocks the two main characters have suffered in their lives and it gives the film a certain novelty value  female boxers being rare in cinema.<br/><br/>And this little bit of novelty value is important because a lot of the film has already been covered  the plucky amateur, the reluctant trainer, the wise old man who never quite made it and the cocky youngsters. So initially there's a feeling that we've already seen this loads of times before. But even before the 'twist', and despite the sense of over-familiarity, the film has a certain something that intrigues and appeals. It isn't that it's about a female boxer, because that doesn't differentiate it much from other boxing films, it's that it has a lot of soul. Unlike other films about boxing it doesn't glamorise the sport. Instead it acknowledges that people watch boxing because they like seeing violence and because they get off on human suffering. So instead of a triumphant film you have a rather melancholy one.<br/><br/>However, despite the slightly sombre tone, there is quite a bit of humour in the film. And some of it works and some of it doesn't. I liked the scenes where Frankie (Eastwood) torments his pastor, and I liked the banter between Frankie and Eddie (Freeman), but the special needs kid who wants to be a boxer was far too cute. It really felt like something out of another movie. It isn't needed and it adds nothing to the film  except to give the audience a cheap 'Yes!' moment when Eddie punches the bully's lights out.<br/><br/>Something else that wasn't needed was the evil white trash family. Had they been realistically nasty they would have served their purpose  they push Maggie (Swank) into Frankie's arms, a man who becomes her real family  but instead they're far too cartoonish. I can well believe that a mother would try and take her injured daughter's money from her, as families do horrid things to each other all the time, but it just didn't feel right. It wasn't well played.<br/><br/>But the special needs boxer and the evil white trash family don't take up that much time and therefore they don't detract from the rest of the film. And the rest of the film is great. One of the little things I loved was Frankie's strained relationship with his daughter. You never get to find out what went wrong between them, but with her sending his letters back you begin to understand part of the reason why Frankie is reluctant to train 'girls' and why he eventually relents  his relationship with Maggie is some sort of atonement for past mistakes. And there's a powerful little moment after Maggie has broken her neck when Frankie goes home and sees yet another returned letter on the floor. The sadness on Eastwood's face speaks volumes (his performance his wonderful, as is Swank's).<br/><br/>But another wonderful little moment is when Frankie cleans Maggie's bedsores. He says the nurses don't know what they're doing. At that moment he really is her father. He's doing what any man would do for his daughter if they were in such an unfortunate position. And there's a great little moment where she quietly says thank you. It's a line that can pass by unnoticed if you're not paying attention, but it says so much.<br/><br/>And there are quite a few nice little bits between the characters during the film, moments that don't call attention to themselves but which generate a depth of feeling for the people involved. One such scene is when Maggie busts her nose. At the hospital, when she has to go off to be seen, Frankie says that he'll be right there. Again he's acting exactly like her dad. And I also liked the scene where halfway through Maggie's first proper fight Frankie joins her corner. She looks delighted to have him and he looks proud as punch when she wins. And afterwards there's a nice little exchange. ""You gonna leave me again?"" ""Never."" And another small moment that helps greatly is when Frankie gives Maggie an expensive robe for her fight. It's a dad giving his daughter a gift.<br/><br/>However, this does lead me to one final problem I have with the film. I didn't particularly like the fight where Maggie gets injured. The dirty German boxer again was just a bit over the top. I mean, I know boxers have lots of dirty tricks, but can someone really get away with punching an opponent when they're getting up off the mat? Rather than coming across as a dirty fighter the German came over more like a scheming villain  although I do like the fact that the German's actions are somewhat motivated by Frankie insulting her earlier, meaning that he's somewhat responsible for Maggie's injury; but I do think Eastwood took the German's rule breaking a step too far.<br/><br/>But the final scenes between Frankie and Maggie more than make up for the film's shortcomings. They hit really hard. And Frankie's last act is a genuine act of compassion; it's entirely selfless and it expresses how much he's come to love Maggie  he ignores his feelings to give her some dignity. And the very end itself is both hopeful and hopeless. It's hopeful because there's a chance that Frankie's daughter will find out what sort of man her father was and it's hopeless because Frankie will never get over what he did. A wonderful film."

","""Million Dollar Baby"" (MDB) is the best movie I have seen in years. Maggie Fitzgerald (played by Hilary Swank) played a 31-year old amateur who wants to be a boxing pro and stands on top of the world. She has come from nowhere and always is a nobody in her entire life. The only thing that keep her sticking to her life is her love and passion for boxing. <br/><br/>Frankie Dunn (played by Clint Eastwood) is a veteran coach and cutman in the business who refused to train Maggie in the first place no matter how hard she tried to convince him and persuade him. After all, nobody wants to train a 31-year-old-knows-bearly-nothing-about-boxing woman to be a pro. At that age, many fighters already retire from the ring. <br/><br/>Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (played by Morgan Freeman) is a maintenance crew and a retired pro working in the boxing gym and he sees the potential inside Maggie and finally persuaded Frankie to train Maggie to be a monster inside the ring. In spite the fact that Maggie is 32-year old and has only one year training, her career turns out to be a huge success. Nobody can beat or even slow down the girl from a winning streak...<br/><br/>Hilary is born for this role and you can tell the strength and perseverance even by her appearance. Yes, she might not grow up in a rich family or get any education, but she has the **HEART** to pursue her dream.<br/><br/>Yes, a man with nothing but heart is a meat on the board, but a man definitely cannot succeed if he has no heart of all. This movie is so inspirational and moving and strengthens my belief that you are a walking dead if you have no heart at all.<br/><br/>I would give kudos to Hilary, Clint and Morgan for making such a great movie which is obviously underrated on IMDb.<br/><br/>Bravo!"

There was two different thing in this movie (from my eye). The first was that dirty boxing box, the dark boxing gym and that little word-fight between old veterans, with a beautiful music. The second was the nights and days in hospital, with no sound but the sound of machines around poor Maggie. I admire the attitude of Maggie Fitzgerald.

It is hard to think of Clint Eastwood as the High Plains Drifter anymore - he has simply achieved a brilliant work of art, both with his directing and his acting. What this movie boils down to is people who learn to love one another and then take care of each other during extreme hardship. This is a love story, but not a romance. I wonder if I shall ever see another movie this good. Did I mention I really liked this film? In addition to a riveting story, the film deals with a contentious social issue of our century.

"jdberkley","10","2","4","17 February 2006"," It deserved every award it got...
","I was reminded of a great observation I'd once read about film acting when I was watching Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby."" I believe Roger Ebert said(I could be mistaken there), in an analysis of great film actors, that Marlon Brando showed us all everything that could be brought to a film performance, that Paul Newman learned that from Brando, and then went on to learn what could be left out. Clint Eastwood learned from a lot of great directors in his days as one of the greatest movie stars in the world, and he's become one of the greatest directors we have, because he's confident enough, and disciplined enough, to know exactly what he needs to show you, so that you understand why the characters have made the choices they've made.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is one of the two best films Eastwood has given us(his other Best Picture winner, ""Unforgiven"" would be the other one), and it's superb because every single scene, every single line, builds on the one before it. It's a masterpiece of story-telling economy(all the more miraculous because Eastwood shot Paul Haggis' first draft of the script) that pulls you in to the classic story of an underdog boxer that gets a shot at the big time only to then break your heart without ever taking a false or cheap step. This movie doesn't depend on a twist-- the ending is where this story was heading the entire time. It's just that the writer, the director, and the actors(Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman, all perfectly cast and at the top of their game) have too much story-telling integrity to let you ever get ahead of them.<br/><br/>It's simple, it's powerful, it's honest, and it's heartbreaking. You can't ask for much more than this."

","One of the best new films I have seen. Swank plays her character to perfection, the down and out waitress who just wants to give her life a go by doing what she feels happiest doing, boxing. Fully deserved Oscar for her. Eastwood is wonderful as the hard headed trainer who doesn't wanna give the girl a chance and finally gives in when he realises she isn't gonna give up. The relationship between he and Swank is so believable. She becomes more like his daughter and he manages to make a star out of her. Freeman gives a Oscar deserving performance in his narration and acting as the boxer who's way of the world helps him see things that Eastwood cant or wont see. The direction is brilliant, everything about this movie makes me wanna watch it over and over. Touching ending that would even make Eastwood's character feel a little emotional. Full marks to the team who worked on the movie!"

","Didn't expect to like this movie. It was an unexpected and rare treat, a movie I expected to be like many other ""boxing"" films. It's still with me, weeks after seeing it.<br/><br/>What makes this film stand above most others is that it could be anyone's story, just interchange the dream, the guilt, or the focus of hindsight. And because its anyone's story, its stellar. Hillary Swank and Clint Eastwood are at there believable best. Morgan Freeman ""supports"" the story, Swank, and Eastwood with subtle finesse.

","I can tell you that seeing the goodness of mankind in a movie these days is so rare. In this movie, you see raw passion that is not driven by revenge or anger. The characters are so believable and real - you feel like you want to know more and more. The story was simple, but the emotional tones were complex and interesting. Clint Eastwood has a unique talent in showing an audience kindness and sincerity in a person's character without making them look or appear meek or mild. I took away a refreshed hope and relished in the wholesome quality of his artistry. So many people heralded this movie as a ""best yet"" or ""movie of the year"", but it surpasses these statements as a BEST EVER. I am so thankful Eastwood took a rather unattractive story line (woman boxer) and made it a legend!"
"GOWBTW","10","2","4","10 January 2006"," Worth Every Dollar!
","Clint Eastwood is always at his best. This movie in my opinion tops ""UNFORGIVEN"", hands down. Yet, this is ""UNFORGIVEN's"" equal. Hilary Swank was great playing the heavily determined boxer. If it hadn't been for her tenacity, she would automatically given up. Morgan Freeman who worked with Eastwood in ""UNFORGIVEN"" is back with him. He's the more somber character in the movie, while Eastwood plays the harden one. Given the spot to teach Maggie the ropes of boxing wasn't all its cracked up to be, at least it was Frankie's first to teach a girl. Maggie(Swank) is nothing like her role Julie in ""The Next Karate Kid"". In that movie, she was surly. Frankie Dunn(Eastwood) is nothing like ""Dirty"" Harry, yet he displays some hardcore attitude in the movie which makes it watchable. To me, Maggie was the person who show determination, and receives inspiration from Frank, cause to him, he's reminds her of her late father. Since she has complete distrust in her family, she tries to give them what they needed, in return, they ended up being ungrateful, so why send them something? All they want to do is snuff it up. This movie also shows that even the gruffest of all grumps can have a softer side. And it's the first I've seen Eastwood get soft. AWWWWW! But Hey! This movie was no hype. It's a clear winner to me! 5 stars!"
"mitsubishiman2","10","2","4","8 January 2006"," A truly excellent movie!!
","Clint Eastwood really plays his part in his role great. The movie was great and I will watch it again and again. It is almost like the modern day Rocky movie except with an awful ending. I almost cried at the end, but you all have to realize what you would want if you were in the fighter's situation at the end of the movie. This movie will really make you think about your life and make you realize how fast something bad could happen. Anyway, if you watch the movie, you will understand what I mean. Another thing I didn't like about the movie was Maggie's family. They were so ungrateful that it made me mad and I wasn't even in the movie. Maggie was out there trying to be the best she could be, and they were so ungrateful for the things she was doing to try to help them. I really believe that they were my family, I would have turned my back on them just because of that reason. Either way, I still give this movie a 10 and would give it an 11 if allowed."
"jeromec-2","10","2","4","7 January 2006"," Terrific Movie
","I don't know if I can write a review on this. There are 83 pages of reviews  many of them good. Many are fair in both their praise and reservations. I found the details wonderful in both their simplicity and effect.<br/><br/>The film starts like something done as a film noir. In fact, Million Dollar Baby would have been an ideal candidate for black and white.<br/><br/>After winning a particularly brutal fight, Frankie Dunne's (Clint Eastwood) championship caliber boxer begs a favor. He asks Frankie to go get his wife's car back, which Frankie does. The boxer comes to thank Frankie, (we think, but there is hesitancy). He wants another manager and he leaves Frankie. Though it turns out to be a good move for the younger man professionally, it shows him to be rather thankless and ruthless. Certainly Frankie is not part of his family: he owes Frankie nothing. We don't see any loyalty and gratitude: just a cold business relationship.<br/><br/>Though there is no evidence in the film to suggest it, I think that explains why he so hesitant to take on Maggie. He spent eight years with the other fighter and he thinks he will have to spend another 4 on Maggie. It's too much. He's tired. He just wants to go to church write his weekly letters and banter with Scrape. We see Frankie begging for the easy way.<br/><br/>Perhaps that is why Scrape (Morgan Freeman) keeps needling him. He wants Frankie to try again. He sees something in Maggie and he instinctively knows she will be good for Frankie. Frankie doesn't know. He's a devout Catholic (about which his priest is almost totally opaque): he doubts he can stand the guilt of the failure of yet one more relationship.<br/><br/>The priest in the first scene is totally unsympathetic (or seems so). He asks Frankie if has written his daughter. Frankie tells him every week. We are led to believe that the priest does not believe him. It is a brutal miscalculation from the church's representative. Frankie is used to that: he deals with brutality daily. Why should the church be any different than the rest of his life? These details are foreshadows of what will come.<br/><br/>What Frankie finds in Maggie is a woman trusts her feelings. Probably the best part in the movie is the diner scene where Scrape tells us why he never had fight 110. Much has been said about this scene. (The best description is in Roger Ebert's review. Check it out). Maggie learns why Frankie is such a good manager. Maggie knows class when she hears it and she knows life poetry when it's spoken to her. Another manager? Not on her life.<br/><br/>There is nothing but love and loyalty in this girl. Contrast Frankie as a father with her actual mother. Maggie does everything a daughter should and her mother insists on treating her as a ten year old who has to be corrected. But Maggie knows some things and tries to be a kind loving adult daughter only to be reprimanded by a fool and a course lazy lout of a mother. It is no wonder she loves Frankie. He was the parent she never really had.<br/><br/>Now we come to the real spoiler. We find out that Frankie really has written his daughter once a week. He has kept all his letters (which were returned unread and unopened).<br/><br/>After a terrible event in the ring, Maggie has her neck broken. She is a vegetable compared to the way she was. She is not sorry. There are no heroics in any of her statements. She tells him that she has heard the crowds and she does not want the voices to go away. She wants to die. She wants him to help her. In her mind, she is the same as a crippled dog she had as a child. The dog finally had to be put down by her father.<br/><br/>He is horrified. He cannot do such a thing. <br/><br/>He goes to the priest. He is completely torn apart. Not even his daughter had this effect on him. His tears are those of someone in the deepest anguish. <br/><br/>He knows she's right. This was a girl who was nearly a champion athlete who now is not only confined to a bed but who can only be put in a wheel chair after hours of effort.<br/><br/>Perhaps because I'm not Catholic, I find the priest's attitude almost incomprehensible. He does not seem to be able to think outside the box. He gives Frankie the standard position about taking life and threatens alienation from the church and with it eternal damnation (the latter implied from the former). The priest does not truly see the problem and Frankie in tears, knows it.<br/><br/>Maggie will not accept life that is really a prolonged death and tries to commit suicide by biting her tongue. It is then that Frankie knows what he has to do. It is the tenderest scene in the move. It is so touching that no one with feelings can avoid registering the over powering human conflicts that take only minutes to show. It is one of the great love scenes ever made. Who knew that Dirty Harry had it in him? In the end we are left with Scrape who tries to explain to Frankie's daughter the nature of the man she has stubbornly refused to have anything to do with. She is making a terrible mistake in not acknowledging him. Scrape does it not for Frankie. He does it for her.<br/><br/>If there are people who thought this was an OK movie, they either did not see the one I did, or they can't feel. It is the summary of a man's life and it has nothing to do with occupation. It has to do with value."
"ReneeCoulmbine","10","2","4","13 December 2005"," This movie elicits every emotion imaginable
","This movie is definitely not a sugar coated portrayal of the sport, this script does not hold back! The characters are very well developed and Hillary Swank delivers an amazing performance. The movie goes much deeper than just the sport itself. It's a story in which each character posses their own inadequacies which they must learn to overcome. The boxing aspect simply symbolizes each individuals struggle to fight their way to the top and learning to ""roll with the punches"". Hillary Swank's character becomes the inspiration that seems to have been lost somewhere along the way. An excellent example of how what we put into the ""fight"" is more important than the outcome."

","When Eastwood directed Unforgiven and took home the directing Oscar, many people, myself included, thought it would be his only moment of glory. Wrong. Predictably enough, those same people thought that after he directed Mystic River. Wrong again. Eastwood slams another one home with Million Dollar Baby, the movie that took home the gold for all those concerned with the picture. Hillary Swank's stock just keeps going up and up she should be listed on NASDAQ. Freeman is stunning as ever with his performance and narration and let's not forget Eastwood. Eastwood hasn't shown that wide a range of acting ever. For the first time in my life I felt truly connected to one of his characters.

","This is not so much a review of just the excellence of the film but also of the DVD extras that come if you purchase the DVD special edition.<br/><br/>Not only is Million Dollar Baby one of the greats of film, the DVD extras disc is one of the best extras discs which I have seen. Why? Well unlike Peter Jackson's ""Rings"" epic's extra features, the extras with this DVD don't seek the average moviegoer to understand the concept of storyboarding, nor to be interested in the minutiae of film making. As meritorious as the compilers of the ""Rings"" DVDs may have been, they could learn much from those who compiled Million Dollar Baby's extras video. We see interviews with not only the major performers in the cast (Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank) but also other segments feature the minor but quite influential characters and one other segment features the producer and also the writer of the screenplay.<br/><br/>The film itself? Absolute brilliance. I first loved Eastwood's direction in a passionate sense after seeing Unforgiven. Gone are the panoramic shots which were characteristic of Unforgiven and The Bridges of Madison County. The camera adopts the claustrophobia of the gym and the hospital ward for much of this film and it succeeds wonderfully. Here is a film that well and truly deserved the Academy Awards which it secured. The plot? Why bother? A superb piece of film-making is a superb piece of film-making. <br/><br/>See Million Dollar Baby."

"jstarr2002","3","2","4","6 November 2005"," Maggie is touching but movie is flawed and cliché
","With the exception of Hillary Swank's, the characters were 1 dimensional or stolen out of previous movies. I like that Morgan Freeman role; I really do. Perhaps no one plays the quiet, down on his luck, sensitive but tough narrator like Morgan Freeman does. Of course, he should be good at it since years before he played a nearly identical character in Shawshank Redemption. I guess I just didn't want to see Red again with only his name changed. I can't be so generous with Clint. If you put him up for best actor this time then you have to put him up for all the other times he played a good man of few words. Can you really say this was an original character for him? It was Maggie's family, however, that bothered me most. They weren't bad, they were 1 dimensional evil. There was nothing misunderstood or complex about them; they were just plain rotten. And the mother tells Maggie she lost the fight. Am I supposed to be stupid? ESPN broadcasts a title fight in which a boxer does a cheap shot for the ages and we're supposed to believe that never mind jail, she was actually given the win? One long time boxing analyst has commented that he has never seen or heard of an event like that in all his years of following the sport. You can put an extraordinary cheap shot in the movie but don't ask me to believe that girl wasn't at least disqualified. That's just absurd. These pieces aside, the movie splits into 2 sections. The first part is a typical overcome adversity sports movie that was pretty good within that highly populated niche. It could have just ended there but instead it used the absurd cheap shot to transform into an outright depressing story. Here the movie benefited from how likable Swank's character was, but was hurt by the introduction of her unbelievably horrible family. I could only come to the conclusion that Clint was willing to use any tactic to make it more upsetting. When you step back and look at the film, it wasn't telling us much about real life unless Clint's view of the world is that there's no point digging yourself out of a hole because no matter what you do some ridiculous cheap shot will knock you back in. Maggie didn't fail on her own. She did absolutely everything right and just took some freak accident that has no real world place in the activity she was involved with. If that wasn't bad enough, she was stuck with a family so 1-dimensionally nasty as to lack credibility. What's the point? What did I learn from that? If you want to be depressed in a legit way that actually teaches us about the world we live in, watch Terms of Endearment or Ordinary People. Those movies are about the real world and what people have to overcome. They don't have mothers yelling at their daughters for buying them houses. And they don't focus on the non existent problem in this world of too many people somehow breaking their spine by getting hit in the back of the head while walking back to their boxing corner."
"tim-walker4","10","2","4","31 August 2005"," I Remember Rowdy Yates.............
","I've watch Clint Eastwood on TV and film nearly all my life - and I've watched him become the full-rounded actor/director he is today. He hasn't tried to stay with all-action hero as he's got older, and a good decision that's been. Now he is capable of turning out a small masterpiece like this. I don't like boxing, but this movie held me enthralled. All the actors played their parts wonderfully well. Miss Swank was totally believable, and Eastwood and Freeman bickering relationship sets the film off perfectly. The fight scenes are well filmed and I found myself wincing as each punch landed. I won't spoil the film for by giving anything away, but I suspect the Eastwood/Swank scenes at the end will challenge the hardest of hearts. Please, even if you don't like boxing, go and see this. You won't regret it."

","What was this movie supposed to accomplish? Clint Eastwood's character seems too familiar--cardboard familiar. Morgan Freeman's just being himself: it's like they were both chosen because they wouldn't have to work hard at the roles.<br/><br/>The fact that Swank's character faces paralysis can't possibly be considered a spoiler now, and I went into the movie knowing the ending. But it just didn't ring true--The turn from achiever to victim feels false; if she stoutly pursued a generally unachievable dream with such ardent fervor, why the sudden collapse? It's as if her whole inner strength is just a facade, and the movie doesn't do a good job of reconciling them.<br/><br/>It's an interesting morality play, but without a compelling message."

","I'm not being very generous with the stars here, as I'd expected much of this Oscar-winner, and it left me with a feeling that someone had edited the best bits out of my copy of the DVD. Maybe it's a genuine step forward for a Clint Eastwood movie, but the man must be about a hundred, and he's in no danger of catching up with the cutting edge of world cinema. Most of the movie plods along pleasantly enough, with shades of Shawshank in atmosphere but not a great deal to back it up. Then it rushes headlong through matters of real importance and my overall impression was somehow of cosy predictability. Given the nature of the subject matter (I won't spoil it for you, but as you may have heard the later part of the movie is not so cosy in content), this is both ironic and appalling! <br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is not a bad movie, and I did enjoy it, and Hollywood can do much worse, but don't rent it thinking you're getting a film of the year.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is also a great title for a movie, but not this one. They appear to have lifted it from either one of two pre-war features; I don't know."
"dfranzen70","7","2","4","30 July 2005"," Fine until insincere final reel
","Hilary Swank plays Maggie Fitzgerald, a gutsy bundle of spit and verve who wants more than anything in the entire known universe to be a boxing champeen. So she takes her novice skill level to Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), notable trainer of he-man boxers. Noting that Maggie's not really male, Frankie treats her with a lot of disdain and disrespect, but grudgingly - with the help of his canny janitor/man-at-arms, Scrap (Morgan Freeman) agrees to train Maggie. At least until she can find a manager. Which she never does.<br/><br/>Swank again gets the Oscar nod (she also won for Boys Don't Cry), but this isn't her show at all - it's that of the two old codgers, Eastwood and Freeman. Freeman's excellence finally gets the level of recognition it deserves, as he won an Oscar, too, and Eastwood won for Best Director.<br/><br/>The first three-quarters of the movie is pretty standard little-punk-against-all-the-odds fare, kind of a step or two above The Karate Kid, but along the same lines. Scrap and Frankie impart wisdom both practical and metaphysical to Maggie, who nods and flashes the largest set of teeth this side of a sabre-toothed tiger. Seriously, Hilary should look into getting those things capped or chiseled down, or something. Swank's job is to look innocent and deserving, but still appear skillful and eager to learn more. Eastwood and Freeman just need to look smart and worldly, not to mention world-weary. All succeed in these broad characterizations.<br/><br/>The final quarter of the movie, though, takes us on a sharp left turn away from the norm. I won't give away the plot turn - it's not a twist, just a turn - but it quickly moves the tone of the movie from inspirational to sappy, from Rocky to Lifetime cable movies. As the audience, we're supposed to feel for Maggie, no matter what happens, and that almost works against things here; Maggie Fitzgerald is shown as a saint, quite frankly. Everything she does seems to be right, or at least Well Intentioned, and most people on the planet aren't quite that ethereal.<br/><br/>Still, it's tough not to root for the little dickens. Maggie's feisty and is determined to succeed; no small feat, considering she's scrawny even after a couple years of self-training. She's motivated by having been told how much of a loser she is throughout her life (she's 31 when the movie begins); if she's unsuccessful as a fighter, she has nothing else to do, nowhere else to go. Presumably, anyway. She's waitressing, after all, and does have a job when she begins training with Frankie, so she's really not as bad off as she wants to appear.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the toothy Swank and the toothless Eastwood should have been fantastic - Oscar winners both, of course - but for me their verbal interplay fell flat. I felt like I was watching two people do a cold reading. On the other hand, old pros Eastwood and Freeman played off each other perfectly, for dramatic and comedic effects. Their scenes together - and one gets the impression that Freeman's Scrap Iron wasn't as huge a character in the original version of the script - were flawless and highly enjoyable to watch, sort of like seeing a married couple interact.<br/><br/>As with most athletics-related movies, Million Dollar Baby will try to manipulate you, and it's fairly successful in that arena. However, the final reel of the movie just didn't completely work for me, seeming more like a disease-of-the-week teleplay than an Academy Award-winning movie."

The relationship between the characters is just so real that I felt like I was taken into the movie myself. I felt like I was there actually watching everything happen. I've never been interested in boxing, but this was okay because the movie was about so much more than the sport. It was obvious to see that Hilary Swank's character, Maggie was not a failure even though she wound up on the floor after fighting for the winning title. She won because she achieved what she wanted to achieve in life, and there aren't many people who can be satisfied with that. This movie can teach us all something about life and how to appreciate it and though many may find the message behind the movie cliché, I don't think it could be emphasized enough since we all forget how to appreciate life over and over again.<br/><br/>The acting was amazing. Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman work so well together, and I had no reason to be displeased with how they acted out their roles.<br/><br/>Warning: If you have not yet watched the movie, do not read the next paragraph. It will ruin the ending for you!!<br/><br/>The only part of the movie which confused me was when Frankie pulls the cord. Isn't this illegal and immoral to some people? I'm not sure if he should have done this. The movie was really good so I'm not going to dwell on this. It's just that he developed such a fatherly relationship with Maggie and it's kind of odd to see him make the choice he makes. Anyway, the movie earns about a million stars from me, but since I can only give it 10, I guess that will do."
"jmille42","10","2","4","20 July 2005"," most deserving winner of the Best Picture
","In honor of its recent release to DVD, I have chosen Million Dollar Baby to review. Never have I had so many ask me about a single film, ""Josh, is it good? Should I buy it? Is it worth it?"" After telling them how great it is, I usually tell them that I called it back in January when I was walking out of the theater and said to my dad, ""That's gonna win best picture pops."" (He smartly agreed with his great prophet sonOK, so maybe not great, but a proved prophet by that statementhaha) Clint Eastwood directs and stars as Frankie Dunn, the spiritually lost and hard nosed boxing manager of many successful men. Hillary Swank, who won best actress for her portrayal of Maggie Fitzgerald, battles through poverty and a trashy family to finally get Dunn to manage and train her. Morgan Freeman also offers his much welcomed services as Eddie Dupris, which he also took home an Oscar for best supporting actor.<br/><br/>As Ron Howard did with Cinderella Man, Clint Eastwood brings a contender from the pits of a metaphorical hell in order to contend for the ultimate dreambecoming world champion in professional boxing. In a special twist, it is the women's division of boxing, instead of the over-used men's division. The boxing ring works as a sanctuary for the character's, keeping them from an outside world that seems to bring them nothing but bad news (I don't think Freeman's character leaves the gym once in the film).<br/><br/>""Baby"" is a film filled with Eastwood's Dirty Harry attitude that is meant to cover up a sensitive heart and caring man. The interaction between the cynical trainer Frankie and hard working Maggie can be so comical that you sometimes forget you are watching a serious drama. The comic relief along with the tough decisions we must make in life play well in this most deserving winner of the Best Picture of the year for 2004."

All good. The dialog was simply the best. And, a lot of it was funny, really good stuff.<br/><br/>And, get this: this was the first draft by the screen writer, Paul Haggis. Eastwood didn't want to change anything. Something, eh? I know this from watching the second DVD in the package.<br/><br/>Eastwood, Freeman and Swank worked nothing short of a classic. All the acting was first class. You won't forget this one. The boxing scenes were real, I believe. If not, you could have fooled me.

The others, while good, never really stood a chance. You'll see.<br/><br/>There is only one little thing that really didn't fit. Frankie gives Maggie a robe to wear into boxing rings. The words on the back are in Greek or Gaelic. He tells her that he will tell her what the words mean when she wins the big one. She wins a number of fights leading up to the title fight wearing the robe. In today's world, those words would have been mentioned in magazines, newspapers, TV spots etc. Also, some fans might have called out the meaning too. Maybe it was just a case of Maggie wanting to hear the words from Frank. Maybe. Anyway, go see the movie and you, too, will learn what the words mean. No, you don't have to fight anyone, just pay for the ticket or the DVD rental.<br/><br/>As much as I liked this movie, it still did not make me a fan of women boxing. Doesn't make sense to me.

","What happened to the critics, what happened to all the fans of this film? What did you guys find interesting in this boring production? How could this film fill in shelves with Oscar prizes - I believe that this says more about the poor state of the film art in US than everything else.<br/><br/>It's a rather simple story - Swank is a destiny-hit young woman, working as a waitress and gathering every penny to become a boxing girl. Why - probably just for the seek of the script, we are never told why does she not invest her money in going to college, for example. Clintwood and Freeman are box trainers, quite failed ones, with a common past, and a broken family (Eastwood) finding in Swank's character kind of a surrogate daughter.<br/><br/>The first 40 minutes of the film are spent with Swank convincing the two to accept her as a trainee. Then, a few fights, and it's the best part of the film. The last 40 minutes are spent in pure melodrama, and I would say no more, as people will still go and maybe enjoy it - I did not.<br/><br/>Acting is reasonable, especially Eastwod and Freeman. Swank is average, her work is far still from Oscar level. The director Eastwood never convinced me, and he is not doing it in this film either. There are good box movies, I remember Zefirelli's 'The Chanp' with Jon Voight - that one was a melodrama too, but here, 25 years later Eastwood has nothing new to say. It just does not ring me any bell, I was simply disappointed by this film."

","This movie deserved all of the Oscars it was nominated for and won.<br/><br/>Winner: Best Picture, Best Director (Eastwood), Best Actress (Swank), Best Supp. Actor (Freeman).<br/><br/>This movie follows the story of Maggie (Swank), a waitress near the poverty line who has one dream...to be a professional boxer. She saves every dime she has for weeks in order to buy a punching bag to prove to the local boxing trainer (Eastwood) that she has the will to be a great boxer.<br/><br/>This movie moved me in more ways than one. I will not spoil the ending, but it is one of the most dramatic surprises and turn-arounds in movie history. The acting performances of Eastwood, Swank, and Freeman were all spectacular and warranted every award garnered to them.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a carbon-copy of Rocky or a cookie cutter rise to the top film, this one is not for you. And do not let the movie's several fight scenes take away from the true meaning of the drama that unfolds.<br/><br/>This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I rank this movie in my top 10 just under Shawshank Redemption and Field of Dreams. Yes, this movie is that good. Please do yourself a favor and see the best movie of the year."
"christopherhaan","3","2","4","29 May 2005"," Television Writer Hits the Big Time
","This movie won the Academy Award for best picture, and has been hailed in many quarters as profound and moving. Either I am getting more and more out-of-touch with modern Western (maybe American) sensibility, or some kind of hyper-calculated dark force is taking over the dramatic arts (American TV and movies especially). I could barely stay awake as I watched it. The movie starts out oddly flat and moves slowly through one calculated scene after another. In terms of the boxing background and the fight scenes, although maybe it is more accurate than Rocky, it certainly was only technically average. Of course, the cinematography is first-rate, and the three lead actors, Eastwood, Swank and Freeman, all have great screen presence, but the movie smelled of melodrama from beginning to end and it left me feeling strangely cold. I think we need a new phrase to describe the kind of mood this movie evinced. What comes to mind for me is 'cynical corniness.' The same phrase aptly applies to what has metastasized on American television in recent years, i.e., the CSI franchise and the Law and Order franchise. <br/><br/>Paul Haggis is the television writer who wrote the screenplay, and he transferred into the film the same sensibility that has taken over much of TV: Protagonists (heroes) are cynical, cold, and sardonic, yet totally loved for all their deficiencies, and characters who are weird or odd are definitely worthless and possibly evil. However, to conceal the cynicism of this dark social matrix, the de rigueur of this sensibility is to press the correct socio-political buttons. If the pathos is false and calculated, it is much harder for an audience to detect it when the drama is cornered with progressively correct structures--i.e., Hilary Swank as the poor, female boxer. So when she is paralyzed in a fight at the cusp of being champion by a ridiculously evil tactic by the 'weird other' (the other boxer), then we are supposed to feel so sad as she is heroically euthanized on her request by America's Tough-Guy-With-A-Heart Hero, Clint Eastwood (with wise black man Morgan Freeman as a muse). It is a foolproof, bathetic structure that hides from the audience the deeper, more general bigotry and facile stereotyping in the film. For example, Swank's character comes from white trash, and the way the movie shows this is done with all the subtlety of a bad cartoon. Her amazing progress as a fighter is extremely corny. She goes from wide-eyed ingenue to a totally dominant fighter in awkward and unrealistic steps. But because we have Clint as the cynical foil, and Morgan Freeman looming around in his typical saint role, many of the contrived scenes somehow served as ballast to keep this turkey afloat. <br/><br/>The pathetic, southern, white-boy, wannabee boxer named 'Danger' also fills a void in the film by being just the right category of odd thing that the modern, hip person can hate safely. His vibe is corny and his existence is totally unrealistic in a gritty, underground boxing gym, but, just like Clint's, Morgan's and Hilary's, his character constitutes exactly the right socio-political button. I have to be careful here: I am not trying to give ammunition to right-wingers. I have no problem with progressive ideals, i.e., women being tough as men, and freedom of choice over dogma. The problem I have is when these ideals are simply buttresses to conceal and build a calculated cynicism. This ideological process is manifesting very strongly on American television right now and, I fear, it is spreading to the movies. Can't anyone else see this???"

","Well, thinking about Eastwoods career: Tarzan, series cowboy, not too good Dirty Harry sequels and adventures with the monkey, his last 15 years has been absolutely triumphant. And now A million dollar baby. Last night I walked away from theater, weeping with joy. They still do movies with heart, they still do movies without digital workout, they still do movies where actor and actresses do really act IE. perform the art. The brilliance of the three was extraordinary. Just watch Freeman and Eastwood picking on each other, like old couple. And just watch Swanks reaction when she finds out she is going to fight for the belt. Or watch her waisted talent lying in the bed. I don't know many who can make a tear. She can. Here in Finland many say, tear is the ultimate work of acting art. This definitely is the best boxing movie since The Harder they fall... where Bogart made his last role."

Clint and Morgan were simply pro's acting with ease! But the movie took me from a quick surprise to shock! I had no idea where the movie would take me!

","Despite the fact that the movie makes friends of the main 3 characters, too many drama's on top of each other lead to some disconnecting feelings. Next to this I asked myself afterward why people (like me?) visit a movie which shows this big of a portion of human bad luck. And yes the movies gives some food for thinking but most of the time in a black and white simplistic way. Still I got hooked by the atmosphere,characters and (sometimes predictable)development of the story. Especially interesting for those fond of tearjerkers and fans of Clint, Morgan and Hilary. Three totally different character create sympathy in their own original ways. Great acting!

Swank's powerhouse performance in Million Dollar Baby left me in awe. She is truly one of the most gifted actresses around and seems to deliver an artful kick in the ass if given the right script. She blew me away as Maggie Fitzgerald and truly deserved her 2nd Oscar! The scene where she is practicing in The Hit Pit on the night of her 32nd birthday was one of my favorites. Clint Eastwood gave probably the performance of his career and the ever graceful Mogan Freeman deserved his long overdue Oscar for his amazing performance and ""Scrap Iron"" Dupris..."

","This movie had just about everything a viewer could possibly want. There are very few movies I see that I think deserve the awards they receive, but million dollar baby more than earned the four ( I believe it was four) academy awards it received. I think just about everyone is expecting a ""Rocky"" style plot with a female for the twist, and at first it seems as if it might be just that, but in a good way. You quickly realize, however, that this movie takes it's place among the truly greats, with more than just a twist of originality. This movie is not a modern ""Rocky"". Clint Eastwood is a genius in his own. As for Ms. Swank, the only other work of hers I am familiar with is the fourth Karate Kid, but after her performance in million dollar baby I think we will all be seeing a lot more of her."
"El-Redik-Fy-Fazan","Null","2","4","4 March 2005"," True greatness from Eastwood again!
","I saw this movie yesterday, and it maid such an impact that I now write my first comments on the IMDb. On the outside Baby is about woman boxing, but on the inside it's about personal lost and gaining. We follow a man who is wisecracking with his best friend a lot in the boxing studio and seems happy, but inside he is hurting a lot. Frankie is easily Eastwood's best role since ""Unforgiven"", he gives a emotional depth to the character I was dumbfounded by. Eastwood and Freeman workes great together, and the scenes they share are often very funny, like the dialogue you would expect between two old men who have shared a good 25 years together as friends.<br/><br/>In comes Hilary Swank as white trash Maggie, wanting to be a fighter. She's 31, and got some rough talent, but are a long way from being a professional boxer. Frankie at first doesn't want a woman in the gym, but is impressed by her anyway, so all end of course with him training her. Maybe he sees her as a second chance in life for a lost family member? Anyway, Maggie is extremely willing to train a lot to get to the top, and shows herself as one though lady in the ring. But will she go all the way and be world champion? It's one brilliant movie. Easily the best I have seen so far this year, and one that will live in the memory for a very long time. Eastwood, Freeman and Swank are great. Swank is like De Niro of the 21th Century, and gives one of the really big performances with her female fighter. I really fell in love with Hilary Swank and won't say anything of her destiny. It's a thrill ride with lots of humor and laughs, some good fights and some very touchy and sad scenes. Very recommended!"

The only exception was the comically stereotypical portrayal of Maggie's family.<br/><br/>I could have handled the melodrama at the end if it had been portrayed more realistically, but instead it came across as manipulative and shallow.<br/><br/>Without exception, though, Hillary Swank is amazing throughout. Her character was a great mix of sweetness and toughness, attitude and humility."
"FilmLover-4","10","2","4","6 February 2005"," Elements of movie-making shine in this film
","This is an almost flawless movie (other than needless profanity from a Catholic priest). Extremely poignant for a movie centered on the boxing world, this movie is a female Rocky for the 2000s.<br/><br/>Of course, it is more multi-dimensional as it takes a hard look from not only the boxer's vantage point, but also that of the trainer-manager, too. The intricacies of the protoypical father-daughter relationship -- and the inferred protectionist attitudes therein -- are juxtaposed with the hard-knock, gritty world of female boxing.<br/><br/>The twist at the end is surprising. The movie may end a bit too abruptly, but it makes one think. It has a strong moral play that goes beyond the bounds of boxing, and raises questions of utility for those possibly discard by the rest of society. I can't say any more or this will be a spoiler.<br/><br/>Almost all of the elements of movie-making shine in this film. None more so than direction and acting. Truly artistry at every turn."

","I myself am currently a film school student so to measure the quality of a film is much more complicated considering the things we learn to take into account. (Which characters have arcs, who's the mentor, who's the weight-and-mass character, where and when is the second act turning point, etc.) In the 22 years I have been in existence there was until recently only one utterly flawless film in existences and that was ""The Shawshank Redemption"".<br/><br/>But now this gem of a film must serve alongside the blatant brilliance of ""Million Dollar Baby"". Unlike most film enthusiasts I did not have the highest expectations of this film seeing as how I was not that big a fan of ""Mystic River"" so when my buddy convinced me to go I was skeptical. Fifteen minutes in I knew if the film just kept it bearings the result would be metaphorically orgasmic. Everyone from Morgan Freeman to Hilary Swank and Jay Baruchel played the emotionally draining script to a pristine glimmer.<br/><br/>This film is undoubtedly the best film of the year and one of the best I've seen in my entire life. (And I've seen than most.) The acting, directing, script, and plot are all top notch.<br/><br/>Igive this film 15 out of 10!!!!"
"tghoneyc","10","2","4","6 February 2005"," Now I see what all the fuss is about...
","I never doubted this movie was good, but I was eager to find out why it was good. And I was, of course, curious about the ""plot twist"" everyone was talking about.<br/><br/>This is an incredible little movie. Keep in mind that it is ""little,"" because with all the awards this movie has taken home already, some might be fooled into thinking it is more than that. But hey, little is good.<br/><br/>If you don't know already what the story is about, I'll give you a brief synopsis. Ageing, haunted Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) owns an old boxing gym. He is so full of guilt over his estranged daughter, Katie, whom he hasn't seen in years, and who refuses to read his letters, that he goes to mass every day. It's starting to get on the nerves of his priest. His only friend is Scrap (Morgan Freeman), a former fighter who watches over the place for Frankie, and keeps people in line.<br/><br/>Frankie has a good fighter he's managing, but he doesn't like risks. He's holding him back from a title shot. His fighter likes Frankie, but he wants his shot at the title. He realizes if he's going to get anywhere, he needs to look elsewhere. Simultaneously, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank), a white-trash waitress from Missouri, wants to learn how to fight. Frankie won't train her, until he realizes her potential, and is egged on by Scrap. That's as much detail as should probably be revealed.<br/><br/>The movie is almost entirely shot in underexposed film, giving it a dark, washed-out look that complements the boxing theme. It's like the entire movie takes place in a boxing ring, and that's where the lighting and colors are most alive. Eastwood has made a superb follow-up to his masterpiece of scarred Bostonians, ""Mystic River."" Like that film, this one has a strong undercurrent of Irish heritage and Catholicism. Frankie reads Gallic in his spare time, and even gives Maggie a nickname in the language. The detail given to the environment is also very similar. While in ""Mystic River"" everything seemed cold and stark, here it's just dark and claustrophobic. This is a smaller movie, but it is just as good.<br/><br/>And everyone in the movie gives first-rate performances. Hilary Swank has tapped into that same great ability that won her the Oscar for ""Boys Don't Cry."" I have always liked Morgan Freeman, and a lot of other people have, too, I know, but after a number of relative duds, he's reminded me why he's such a good actor. And finally, the real treat is Clint Eastwood. Some people may have written him off as a man who can't really act much. But either way, he's almost always played the same tough, hard-edged characters, people who at some point or other are willing to take a stand. Here, that persona, his persona, is not even there. Here, he is a man who has been falling apart for some time, and has payed the price for holding people back. But he unfolds into a man of compassion, who just wishes he could have the chance to fix his mistakes in life. The fact that he's seventy-four and looks it only helps in conveying his inner demons.<br/><br/>This I know is not a movie for people who don't like to watch boxing movies. I don't like boxing, but movie depictions can be good. There are some bits of dry humor in the movie, and some that even take place inside the ring. The movie is also very heartrending. If you don't care for deeply emotional movies, don't watch it. But I personally give it a 10."

","I hate boxing. The only thing I hate more than boxing is movies about boxing. The only reason I went to see Million Dollar Baby was that it was the only one of the Best Picture nominees that I hadn't seen and there was nothing else playing.<br/><br/>The good news is that for a boxing movie, it is first rate. It ranks up there with Requiem for a Heavyweight and Raging Bull. The technical quality is great. It has a decent script, good acting, and a surprisingly atmospheric soundtrack.<br/><br/>Film critic Roger Ebert defended this movie by saying it not about boxing, it is about people. While that is true to a point, a lot of this film is about boxing and a large chunk of this film shows people boxing. The first 2/3 of the film is almost like Rocky except the acting and dialog is much better. The professional film critics have all agreed not to talk about the last third of the film except to say ""it takes a dark turn."" If you don't like depressing films, you should skip this one.<br/><br/>Overall, I gave this film a 8/10 rating. It's really good but it's a downer and it's a boxing movie."
"gcrokus","Null","2","4","3 February 2005"," Pugilistic Poetry
","The more I think about it, the more I am convinced this is the Best Picture of 2004, and it may be better than any since ""L.A. Confidential"". What we have here is a topical rumination on how people generally try and do the best they can, that things still often go askew and how we cope. This is Clint's spin on reducing all to Hemingway's view that the greatest impediments in conducting life are fear and sentimentality.<br/><br/>The story is a simple one, it seems. Trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) and ex-fighter Eddie ""Scrap Iron"" Dupree (Morgan Freeman) have their less-than-idyllic but tolerably comfortable gym existence invaded by the likes of an aggressively and intensively focused female boxer. Talk about turning lives upside down! The entire scope of the known pugilistic universe is imperiled, and so are the lives of all those that touch newcomer Maggie Fitzgerald's (Hilary Swank) own.<br/><br/>It is a truth that the promotion of this movie has been clever. Packaged as a girl-boxer flick, this is an enormous deception. In all fight films that have preceded this one  and there have been some very very good ones  not one will have left you, in a word, captivated. This is the only poetry I ever saw with gloves on.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood has graced us with  and I am not sure whether he is to be congratulated, or his questioner, or Film Comment  as cogent and compelling an interview as has been seen in that fine magazine in a long time. I refer you to http://www.filmlinc.com/fcm/1-2-2005/ceint.htm for Eastwood's views, but how about this for erudition while speaking volumes to the intelligence of us viewers: ""There is a tendency to treat the audience as if they won't stay with you unless you explain every little thing along the way."" And this speaks to the niceties of Eastwood's efforts in his later years. Look for the small things, a gesture, an aside  Morgan Freeman mutters some niceties, the lighting and especially the music.<br/><br/>I cannot in good faith recall a movie that moved me as much as ""Million Dollar Baby"". Not ever. Maybe it is my academic research in subjects of this ilk, perhaps my 52-year old maleness, or that I have one child  a major-babe remarkably-gifted go-getting daughter, or that I had I've had my own questions about what greatness entails and what a successful life might be, or how I've dealt with just about any and all of the human issues Mr. Eastwood touches on in this remarkable film. And it must be said that the knockout blow delivered by ""Million Dollar Baby""  a message or perhaps reflection on topics that speak to our most private fears  is truly the stuff of a Best Picture.<br/><br/>Rating: Four Stars."
"Balthazar-5","10","2","4","2 February 2005"," As deep as the ocean...
","Though many claim that 'Unforgiven' is a masterpiece, Clint Eastwood has never quite managed to get there for me. But this is finally it. Using a story bordering on the clichéd he has plumbed the depth of the human soul in a totally unforgettable film.<br/><br/>Many great works of narrative art have structuring absences. Here we have the absent daughter whose loss has defined the life of Frankie Dunn. In a moment of unforced but powerful emotion, we see a shoebox full of returned letters. This defines the yawning emotional chasm at the centre of Frankie's life.<br/><br/>The joy this wonderful film gives us for its central section is precisely the joy of filling that chasm with the love and closeness to his, initially, unwanted protégé, Maggie Fitzgerald. The three lives at the centre of the film, Frankie, Scrap and Maggie live, essentially, solitary existences, and Eastwood uses a leisurely approach to character development that only very gradually reveals the pain and pride of Frankie, the regret and loyalty of Scrap and the feisty determination of Maggie. But it is this slowly-paced, methodical and austere approach that makes the film so powerful. It goes in slow - but very, very deep.<br/><br/>We have seen the rise of great boxing champions many, many times in the cinema... but this is, for me, the greatest of them all (and I am not forgetting 'Raging Bull', because it is not, ultimately about boxing. Frankie says it at the beginning of the film. 'Boxing is about respect - keeping it for yourself and taking it away from your opponent'. And so, when Frankie's agonising moral dilemma is forced upon him, he has only one possible course of action.<br/><br/>So that is what the film is about: self-respect, and by the end both central characters, Frankie and Maggie, have it in the most tragic and ironic manner imaginable - her by her death, him by losing the one thing that made his life worth living.<br/><br/>Anyone looking for the best film of the year doesn't need to even think about anything beyond this luminous masterpiece."

"thepoet26","10","2","4","31 January 2005"," Cinematic Masterpiece (SPOILERS INCLUDED)
","HILLARY SWANK! I know people (most likely people who have not even SEEN Million Dollar Baby) will try and say that Swank shouldn't take home the Oscar because a)She's won before and b)She won previously for a tomboyish type of role. I say it doesn't matter how many damn times a person wins- If that person put out the best performance of the year then they should damn well take home the prize. Swank is a woman that I think we will see standing in front of that podium SEVERAL times in her life. This role had absolutely nothing in common with her role in Boys Don't Cry, in which she played Teena Brandon, a young woman who passed herself off as a man. She deserved the Oscar that time around and from what I have seen of the other nominees, she deserves it this year again. <br/><br/>What Swank manages to do is play a female that has a tough as nails exterior WITHOUT coming across as not being feminine. What I saw in her character was a woman in search of love. This woman was brought up believing that she was pure D white trash and rather than following in the footsteps of her fat, greedy, welfare receiving mother, she went on to pursue her dream- Even at the age of 31 when being told she was ""too old"" and ""not good enough."" Although she was a kick ass boxer- Swank never let you see her as a fighter without first seeing her as a woman with love to give. Not romantic love- The kind of love that exists between father and daughter- Something the character had not known since her father's death. <br/><br/>That's where Clint comes in. For a split second you think Clint is going to play the typical Eastwood tough guy role but within minutes of the interactions between Eastwood and Freeman, we see that there is a gentler side to this character. Once he forges a bond with Swank's character and we see the letters to his daughter continually sent back, ""return to sender"" we really begin to see the tender side of Clint's character. There are REASONS why this man has become such a hard ass over the years and the film never lets you forget that or think for one moment that Clint's character is simply a crotchety old man. Difficult, weathered, and bitter- yes. Intentionally cruel-no. We get the feeling that part of his hesitation in training Swank's character is that he doesn't want to set her up for failure, more than wanting simply to be cruel or to crush her dreams. <br/><br/>I will not comment on the ending because I want you guys to go out and see this film but I will tell you that this is Clint's finest acting EVER and I hate to say that I didn't know he had this in him. Don't get me wrong- I give him major respect as a director and all around film maker. And Clint has always been great at playing the tough, renegade outlaw or cop. In Unforgiven, he let us see him from a more vulnerable standpoint but he still came out shooting in the end, giving the audience what they expect from a film starring Clint. In Million Dollar Baby, Clint completely steps away from any of the familiarities of his past roles. At one point, he breaks down in Church in front of the Priest and the raw emotion that he exudes made ME break down with him. There I was in the theater, constantly wiping tears, trying not to make a damn fool of myself. I FELT the character's pain and cried right along with Clint. <br/><br/>And I LOVE that they had Morgan Freeman narrate the story. Some people (Kevin Costner in Dances With Wolves, Leo DiCaprio in Gangs of New York) simply cannot narrate a film with any emotion. They sound as if they are just reading lines off a page and in the case of Dances With Wolves, the film was so great that it overshadowed the horrid narration and overall acting by Kevin Costner. Morgan once again, as he did in The Shawshank Redemption, finds the perfect balance and narrates the tale as though he were taking you, personally along for the ride. His narration is part of what makes the film feel so personal to the viewer and connects us that much deeper with the characters. <br/><br/>All in all, I must say this is the best film I have seen in YEARS. I would still say that Unforgiven is Clint's finest work to date, but in terms of ACTING, this was the greatest performance of his career, IMO. I am still pulling for Jamie Foxx to take home the Oscar for Best Actor (and I DO think Jamie will win) but I give Eastwood MAJOR props for his acting and I hope like hell he wins Best Director and Best Picture. I haven't seen The Aviator but I just can't imagine that it could be anywhere near as great as this cinematic Masterpiece. <br/><br/>It's something that I grew up watching Clint's movies all my life because of my dad but never truly came to appreciate his greatness until his later years. Beyond Dirty Harry and the spaghetti westerns, Clint Eastwood is a BRILLIANT film maker with a style all his own. I hope to see Clint, Swank, and Freeman leaving with gold in their hands come Oscar night."

The ref clearly said ""You try that stuff again , your outta here!"" All title fights are videotaped. Even if the ref missed the brutal sucker punch, one of the judges would have seen it. Of course, it makes the story sadder and more Ironic and also sets up some other plot points such as Frankie not telling Maggie what her Nick-name means , etc. So I can see why Clint did it that way.<br/><br/>A pretty minor point to most I suppose but it is important to realize that Boxing is not THAT dirty and corrupted."

","Boxing used to be exciting. When the circus surrounding boxing became a bigger story than the matches, boxing lost its immediacy and descended to a tawdry sideshow status, like so-called professional wrestling. ""Million Dollar Baby"", a boxing movie that's really not about boxing is more believable than ""real boxing."" Clint Eastwood convinces you that he actually can train boxers, and Hillary Swank convinces you that she really can be trained to become a boxer.<br/><br/>But just as ""The Unforgiven"" was not really a movie about the Wild West gunfighters, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is not really a movie about boxing. Both movies are about people--their lives, personalities, and how they got that way. And both give you such an insight that you feel for the characters, and understand why and how they got that way. You also understand why they do what they have to do.<br/><br/>Predictably, Hillary Swank enters Frankie's(Eastwood)life unasked, unwanted, and untrained. Frankie, a tough but competent trainer does not want to take her on. Frankie has torments that keep him from taking chances on the ""big"" fight. Predictably, Swank's persistence forces Frankie to accept her as a fighter. Predictably, she becomes a winner. But unpredictably in her big fight...oh no, no spoiler here...watch the movie for yourself. You will agree that this is one of the best movies of the year. It certainly is Eastwood's best.<br/><br/>""Unforgiven,"" ""Mystic River,"" ""Million Dollar Baby""...I hope Clint Eastwood directs another 100 movies, because they are honest, realistic looks into the lives of people in all of their complexities. 10 stars out of 10."

","Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is an old boxer, trainer, and sometimes manager who owns a boxing gym. Frankie has trained and managed a boxer for the last 8 years to a title fight, but he says he needs some more work, before he goes for the title. Frankie has been overprotecting his fighter, because he had a problem with another title fight many years earlier. The fighter drops Frankie and gets another manager. Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank) an untrained 31-year old fighter wants Frankie to train her, but Frankie tells her that she is too old and he doesn't train girls. Maggie begins to train on her own. Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman), an old boxer who lives in and looks after Frankie's gym, gives Maggie some tips on hitting the bag. Frankie wants Maggie out of his gym until he finds out that she has paid 6-months of gym dues in advance. Maggie trains day after day and finally gets under Frankie's skin. Frankie agrees to train Maggie, but she must follow his number-one rule, protect yourself at all times. Maggie begins to win fight after fight, and after 1-Â½ years, Maggie gets a title fight in Las Vegas for a share of a million dollar purse. Clint Eastwood not only stared in this movie, but also directed, produced, and wrote the music. The movie shows the determination a woman must have to fight her way into the male dominated world of professional boxing. Hillary Swank will surely be nominated for an Academy Award. The movie also shows the friendship and sense of family that is formed between a trainer and his fighter. You may shed a few tears at the end of the movie.

"dgagnon75","10","2","4","21 January 2005"," Clint Eastwood's Best Movie Ever!
","Van Gogh had ""Starry Night"", DaVinci had ""The Mona Lisa"", and now Clint Eastwood has ""Million Dollar Baby"". At first glance this movie seems like a typical boxing movie. This movie runs much deeper than your typical ""sports movie"". Clint Eastwood stars as Frankie, an aging fight manager, who runs a boxing gym in Los Angeles. Frankie goes to church daily for sins that are not quite known. With Frankie is his friend ""Scrap"", a former fighter that is blind in one eye, that has been with Frankie for several years. Frankie changes when he meets Maggie, a superb Hilary Swank. Maggie is a 30 something waitress who aspires to be a champion boxer. At first Frankie refuses to train Maggie. But Maggies persistence and attitude gives Frankie a change of heart. Frankie takes Maggie to the top and grows to love maggie. The movie has a lot of boxing scenes, but is more about the longing for family. In just over two hours Clint Eastwood creates a masterpiece of emotion and heart, with an incredible cast, and great dialouge. Clint Eastwood stars, directed and composed the wonderful score for this movie. People may think going into this movie that it might be another ""Rocky"". This movie has one thing a boxer really needs in the ring, a lot of heart."
"moneyben","9","2","4","20 January 2005"," Absolutely essential - Eastwood has done it!
","OK, I will admit from the outset that i like Clint Eastwood. I like his style, both his acting and directing style. I like the look of him, and whats more i think that he lends a certain gravitas to any movie he's involved with (whether he be on or off screen). However i will also say that although i found both 'Unforgiven' and 'Mystic River' to be satisfying movies on the whole, they each suffered problems which kept them from being all they could.<br/><br/>I'm happy to say that with 'Million Dollar Baby' Eastwood has finally done it. His direction is as precise and exact as one could want, and with a unbelievable sense of balance he still manages to create a truly intimate and obviously personal picture. For me it is balance that is the key to why 'MDB' outdoes his previous efforts and elevates itself to the practically flawless. The emotion and atmosphere is never over the top (and if anything is slightly restrained) this maintains a hard-to-watch realism which demands your attention, draws you in and keeps you involved throughout. <br/><br/>The real star of this picture is the beautiful Hilary Swank. As Maggie Fitzgerald she has done something many (including myself) thought impossible and surpassed her Oscar winning performance from 'Boy's Don't Cry'. With this mature, subtle and thoroughly expert turn she has proved that she is one of the most promising and talented actresses in the world today. <br/><br/>Swank becomes the character. Swank is Maggie Fitzgerald. In this picture, Swank doesn't steal scenes, She owns them. She holds her own and more, even when sharing the screen with Freeman or Eastwood.<br/><br/>This is a perfect example of classic direction, real emotion and fantastic acting from all involved. Swank deserves Best Actress without a doubt and likewise the Best Director should go to Eastwood.<br/><br/>9 / 10"

","This movie is everything I usually detest in a movie: sports and hospital victims. Both usually try to teach 'deep' lessons while canonizing cardboard characters. This movie was incredible. Clint Eastwood does the nearly impossible. He tells a story well. Hillary Swank is nearly flawless (although I know southern Mo..and that accent is something else again...but it's no worse than the entire cast of ""The Aviator""). I think this movie is going to wear well...not another ""Good Will Hunting"" or ""Driving Miss Daisy"" that embarrasses with each future viewing, but instead it should become the kind of movie that most American directors have never learned to make. An aside: it was a 'movie day' for me and I paired this up with ""The Aviator"" Dicaprio was much better than expected, Cate Blanchette made the ""great Kate"" a real person and not a saint for once (and actually dared imply that she was a ham movie star, at that!..movie almost succeeds on that note alone). What fails is Scorcese. It's too long, too flat, too filled with terrible supporting acting (make Alan Alda and Alec Baldwin STOP...can they play anything else anymore????) Most strangely, for a lover of movie history like Scorcese, it's time lines are wildly inaccurate. I understand artistic license....but even the most casual of viewers of TCM would be confused by his chronology. For god's sake..Rufus Wainwright's flaying in the beginning of the movie???!!..It was like he threw the kitchen sink of 'hot' into the mix..and only managed to detract from a couple of decent performances. Please don't give him an Oscar for this....even he will regret it later."

"bluesbreaker","Null","2","4","16 January 2005"," Wonderful Film
","A brilliant, thoughtful film from Clint Eastwood. The 3 main performances are very realistic and excellent and the acting is deliberately and delightfully underplayed. The theme of a women boxer may seem trite to UK audiences but stick with it - it's worth it.<br/><br/>Eastwood has a role befitting his age and his trademark minimalist style. Freeman's acting , as a seen-it-all ex-pro boxer, is sublime. But it's Swank who catches the eye in a role that she was made for.<br/><br/>Its a typical Eastwood film - slowish with artful camera angles and empty spaces. The central setting is a run-down gym and this is beautifully realised. Also typically for Eastwood , the film has more plot than one would imagine from the first hour-or-so of set-up."
"nr-uk","6","2","4","16 January 2005"," It's not what you think
","I went to see this film last night and I have to say straight away that it's not about boxing. Okay there's boxing in it but I don't see it as being for boxing fans. On the other hand I think non-boxing fans won't necessarily hate it.<br/><br/>It's a slow start with Hilary Swank's attempts to persuade Eastwood to coach her. Personally I don't think her character is set up very well. You get an idea of her domestic situation through her living conditions, family and dead end job but somehow it doesn't convey her desperation. In fact I didn't find her character particularly engaging at all (see my comments about Eastwood's character below).<br/><br/>The fight scenes were excellent. I certainly thought they were convincing. Elements of the back story (Morgan Freeman's injury, Big Willie's departure) hint at one ending - a straightforward and predictable ending.<br/><br/>However, the film doesn't take this easy option. There are other elements that hint at its real route (Eastwoods daily attendance at mass, Eastwood's guilt for his part in Freeman's injury).<br/><br/>And that's the key - if you want to be able to guess the twist then you have to realise that Eastwood is the star of the film - it's all about his character. He's the one who develops.<br/><br/>It's a slow build towards the end after the twist - but it's fairly neatly wrapped up in terms of character development, lessons learned, acceptance and understanding etc.<br/><br/>As I say, a good film but it's not really about boxing."
"straightcurve","Null","2","4","14 January 2005"," Layers
","There's a lot of critical acclaim for this film, and rightly so. There's also some negative criticism. Now maybe it's just me, but everyone is only looking at the surface layer of this film. Notably the acting, the characters and (worst of all) the ""realism"". Such fickle people. The only movies where 'realistic' things truly get in the way is when science is heavily involved. For example, 'The Day After Tomorrow', and even then it's the least of the problems.<br/><br/>There's always more to a film than the surface layer.<br/><br/>Danger (played excellently by Jay Baruchel), for example, is a critical character. He's hope and desire, undying hope and desire, the same kind that Maggie (Swank) had. It was that hope and desire that took her from nothing to the championship fight. Except in Danger's case he's no good so won't really ever amount to anything, but they let him stay, why? Because it makes him happy, he doesn't want to do anything else. He's the central theme of the movie in a microcosm, and that's absolutely fantastic. And as Scrap (Freeman) so fittingly says, ""anybody can lose one fight"", be they Danger or Maggie.<br/><br/>Eastwood's acting was entirely in his eyes, the grimace never changed and it didn't have to, it was all in the eyes. Swank was utterly superb, the best female performance since Monica Bellucci in 'Irreversible'. And I, for one, don't care if Morgan Freeman's voice-over was just like it was in 'The Shawshank Redemption', it was an effective way to annotate the visual action and provide a bookend for the film.<br/><br/>The parental theme is something you'd expect in Spielberg, but Eastwood had a go at it and did a fine job. It was mainly there to sell the tickets, which, ironically, is the opposite of how Spielberg uses the parental theme.<br/><br/>The formulaic nature of the plot was deliberate, because you're supposed to look beyond the surface layer, to the smaller things, like hope and desire represented in Danger. To paraphrase Jack Lipnick: ""it's the poetry of the streets."" If such a thing can indeed exist, this is it."
"Captain-Planet","10","2","4","13 January 2005"," Heart-Warming, Amazing and very Thought Provoking
","Not knowing anything about the film before watching it, I was amazed and taken aback by what seemed a ""by the numbers"" sporting drama was done.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman's narration, and 2 of the most moving performances by Clint Eastwood and Hilary Swank all add up to a moving masterpiece that should live on for many years, and left me wanting more, yet glad that it ended when it did.<br/><br/>Within the space of 2 hours you see each character transform and ""grow"" as actions, decisions and consequences affect the life they lead. Comparable to Shawshank Redemption in terms of the mood of the film, the cinematography and the uplifting feeling, only good can come from watching this film and I urge you all to see it.<br/><br/>10/10"
"andrewsk8s","8","2","4","10 January 2005"," Great Sports Drama
","This is an excellent, nicely acted sports drama meant to evoke emotions and I gave it a strong 8 rating (maybe an 8.75). It was a interesting and seemingly realistic glimpse into the boxing world, but the movie had far more to show about the great characters having heart, seeking redemption, having guts, achieving goals/dreams, being selfish, and being selfless. I was particularly impressed by Morgan Freeman's performance and voice-over narration reminiscent of his great work in Shawshank Redemption. It could have been just a remake of The Next Karate Kid, but in the third act, the movie takes an unexpected departure from the Hollywood movie formula, which made me admire this film even more. That is the extent of the ""spoiler"". Suffice it to say that it made a deeper impression on me about the nature of goals."
"Bobbyh-2","Null","2","4","10 January 2005"," Eastwood is a master filmmaker, but sorry--this wasn't a ""masterpiece"".
","My expectations are very high when I see a movie directed by Clint Eastwood, and they were further fueled by the rapturous reviews this one got...and, largely as a consequence of these expectations, I came less than overwhelmed. Despite splendid directing and wonderfully unselfish and solid performances, this fell short of my hopes. Ultimately, I'd have to agree with those who found it somewhat manipulative and, in places, downright bogus. SEMI-SPOILERS AHEAD...and NO, I am not one of those who are outraged by the suggestion that it is always a sin to want to end one's own life; I can well imagine circumstances under which such a choice is reasonable. But there was a sort of Capra-ish manipulation of the heartstrings that, for me, went against the grain of the movie's admirable efforts to achieve an authentic atmosphere. For example, I found it hard to accept the notion of Eastwood's efforts to learn Gaelic so that he could read...YEATS? When he reads Yeats--in Gaelic--to his fighter, It was bizarre, given that Yeats wrote in English. I suppose there are translations of Yeats's verse into Gaelic, but it would seem more sensible to read it in the original. This seems to have been done in an effort to show the Eastwood character as a smart guy who goes his own way, is proud of his heritage, etc. etc....but I wish it had been done in a way that was more legitimate. END SPOILERS That said, I give this film high marks for many fine qualities. Compared to it, ""Rocky""--with which it shares some parallels--comes off as the potboiler it ultimately is. I only wish it had lived up to previous Eastwood films that were masterpieces, in my opinion, like ""Mystic River"" and ""Unforgiven."" But for me, this one is, in the last analysis, an honorable but somewhat flawed effort, though worth seeing."
"gregsrants","9","2","4","9 January 2005"," Move over Raging Bull, you have a sister
","With the release of Million Dollar Baby, Clint Eastwood has officially entered the sweepstakes for golden statues in 2005. Already nominated for Five Golden Globes including Best Picture and Director, expect the same when the Academy announces its category finalists on January 25.<br/><br/>Written by Paul Haggis (a Canadian that has spent most of his time writing for the small screen) and based on stories by longtime boxing manager and cutman Jerry Boyd (under the pen name, F.X Toole), the story surrounds boxing trainer Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) who reluctantly takes on a persistent female boxer named Maggie (Hilary Swank).<br/><br/>The start of the film is textbook storytelling and you can see most of what is going to happen before it unfolds. Dunn is the reclusive manager that is reluctant to take on a female as a client believing that boxing is a sport for the Y-Chromosome's only - ""Girlie tough is not tough enough"" he mutters.<br/><br/>But when a career waitress with aspirations of making a name for herself in the ring shows up in the gym with a work ethic that continues long after the lights are turned out, Dunn becomes intrigued by her determination and takes her under his tutelage.<br/><br/>It is here that that Million Dollar Baby begins to separate itself from the formulaic. Although there is plenty of ringside action, the movie somehow is able to have the gruesome boxing matches as only a back drop for what becomes a budding relationship between the two leads. Match after match and day after day, Dunn and Maggie become closer, sharing each others hopes and dreams and inviting each to share in family experiences.<br/><br/>But just when you think you have figured out where Million Dollar Baby is headed, it takes a sharp turn. One of those turns that we as critics like to see but hate when we have to review. The last third of the movie revolves around the consequences and situations of the device and it would be a disservice to anyone reading a review to have it revealed.<br/><br/>So, we focus on the positives of the first two-thirds. The wonderful understated performance by Morgan Freeman (together again with Eastwood after 1991's, Unforgiven), as former boxer Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris, for example. Freeman is the driving force of the growing relationship between the two leads and pushes the story along with such subtlety and effortless motion as to put him also in line for a golden nomination.<br/><br/>Even the tiny little subplots work well to create atmosphere and build character. The characters that participate in daily training at Dunn's gym, Maggie's trailer-living family and Dunn's estranged daughter are all crafted masterfully by director Eastwood into telling a moving story that will haunt you long after you leave the theatre.<br/><br/>Client Eastwood struck gold with Mystic River last year and hits the same vein with Million Dollar Baby. It is his 25th attempt behind the camera and he just gets better with experience (I will forgive him for Bloodwork, but barely). I think this new career high for Eastwood is because he simply 'gets it'. He understands that life doesn't have happy endings all the time. That movies don't have to put an aging acting icon together romantically with a young budding actress in order to get audiences to take notice. And that movies can just end when they should, not all wrapped in a bow.<br/><br/>It is surprising for this writer how boxing movies have had more critical success than any other sporting depiction despite the fact that the sport itself is in a time of mistrust, arguable decisions and no true heavyweight icon like Ali and Foreman were back in its heyday. But when you take the Rocky's, Raging Bull's and now Million Dollar Baby into account you can argue that not even the Field of Dreams, Pride of the Yankees and Eight Men Out's can stand as consistently proud of their output.<br/><br/>That noted, Million Dollar Baby stands alone. Alone as a boxing movie. Alone as a character study, and alone as maybe the best film of 2004.<br/><br/>www.gregsrants.com"

I'll just state here that I had nothing occupationally to do with this film, although I wish I had.<br/><br/>The sad thing is that most often, something is either over-done or under-done in the films that make it to the market. Usually, it's the script that hasn't quite been thought through and finessed.<br/><br/>""Million Dollar Baby"" is a once in a blue moon type of movie that satisfies the audience member in pretty much every way possible. The story in the script is strong, and most important, simply told. It is essentially about a man who has lost his ability to give both support and independence to others due to a failed relationship with his daughter. It's about a young girl who is so driven toward what she wants, that she affects others around her. And essentially, it's about the man learning to let go when he needs to.<br/><br/>The scenes are shot with such care, just the right length, just the right amount of dialog, just the right amount of information, and just the right amount of emotion from the actors, that I must congratulate the director for doing what so many strive for, and so few are unable to do.<br/><br/>I also think that the cinematography is beautiful in this film. When I think back, I feel like I saw a beautiful black and white film. This tells me that the Director of Photography must have taken care to look for interesting shapes with light and shadow to create a sort of film-noire ambiance in many scenes.<br/><br/>I have recommended this film to everyone I know."

While I do agree that this was the best of the nominees(though I have not seen Finding Neverland), I personally love The Passion of the Christ and Spider Man 2(by one spot) a bit more.<br/><br/>This stars Hilary Swank as Maggie, a poor waitress who struggles so much that she has to take hardly eaten steak home to eat for dinner.<br/><br/>She asks Frankie, a trainer played by producer-director-composer Clint Eastwood, to train her.

That pretty much summarizes what makes this movie so great. It put me through a ton of emotions, and the story was so well told.<br/><br/>The ending made me tear up and cry a little, and few movies make me do this. Million Dollar Baby has the saddest ending since The Green Mile, assuming few sadder movies were made in the next 5 years.<br/><br/>(Besides The Passion of the Christ, which came out earlier that year-though that makes me tear up throughout, so that doesn't count in this scenario.)<br/><br/>As I watched the movie, I thought that this must be a true story-it seemed very realistic, and the kind of true story that would be adapted to film. But as I looked at the special features, I found out that it was fictional. Isn't amazing how great of a story humanity can tell to others?<br/><br/>If I had to have one gripe about the movie, it would have to be something that may not apply to you. I have partial hearing loss, and it was hard to hear the actors most of the time, so I watched the movies with subtitles.

Beautiful color palet, I thought also, this movie had watching it on blue-ray last night. But the movie is extremely boring. And depressing.<br/><br/>I heard it won some Oscar's. Yes, I can see that, that sounds about right, this is like made for Oscar's, someone did their homework.<br/><br/>Anyway, pretty good movie.

","Given this is an Oscar winner for Best Picture, I had high hopes for an entertaining film. After the opening hour, the plot seemed to take on a Rockesque narrative, a rookie boxer, taken under the wing by a has been coach who manages to turn her into a fearsome unit. Then, suddenly, the movie takes an unexpected twist and the dreams of the boxer are shattered. Eastwood plays the trainer, a man who visits church every day and regularly writes to his daughter in the hope they will reconcile. We never find out how they fell out but it seems that his reluctance to initially work with the female boxer is made up for using her as a substitute for his daughter. The acting is impeccable from Freeman and Swank. However, I can't quite see how this film was given Best Picture...I'm a big fan of Eastwood's other work, such as Gran Torino, but Millon Dollar Baby lacks charisma and is not a film I would watch again in a hurry."

","First of all let me say that I liked this movie. The actors did a great job. Eastwood and Swank were great obviously but sometime Freeman made me forget he wasn't the main character. Up until the 'broken neck' moment it was good and then it just stayed good. Eastwood had the chance to tell a story that could have inspired people for greatness and instead just left them feel depressed. Some people may say that's the way life is. Sometimes people try very hard but fail to achieve their dreams and just have a glimpse at victory before being thrown in hell. Well it may be like that sometimes but this was a movie and not real life although I do not believe Maggie was hopeless even in her condition. I believe not matter what the circumstances living is better than dying. If you live you will find the way to be happy again. The ending gave the wrong message to the audience and I do not accept it. Some people may think it's cool or realistic or whatever that Maggie could only accomplish so much and that asked to die, but it's not."

","Million Dollar Baby<br/><br/>The movie Million Dollar Baby stars Oscar award winning actors Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank, the storyline is Maggie, played by (Swank) was an amateur female boxer from a same town in Missouri, went to the big city to train to become a professional. Swank's performance really added to the theme of the movie, it was an emotional drama with a sports back draw, it could bring to mind the first (Rocky) with its emotional tie. Maggie sought out trainer Frankie played by (Eastwood), who is a great trainer but has little success training championship boxers, in the past. Maggie, a quiet loner was turned down by Frankie, but continued to come to the gym and train anyway. Eddie, played by (Freeman) was a partner of Frankie and pretty much the overseer in the gym, he befriended Maggie and watched her dedication and gave what he could to assist her in her endeavor to be a champion. Although turned down by Frankie, Maggie continued to come in everyday and train, Frankie gave in and became her trainer. He agreed to train her but told her he'd train her until he could find her a manager. Before Maggie's first fight Frankie left Maggie with another manager only to come back and see Maggie win the fight. As the movie goes on, the relationship between Maggie and Frankie becomes more of a father/daughter then a manager/boxer partnership. Maggie's skills were honed to the point that she began knocking opponents out in the first round, although she was becoming a great fighter, Frankie being the father figure protected her from fights against top ranked contenders. (Ebert, 2005) Maggie's grew frustrated and requested to fight the best; Frankie agreed to fight against the women's welterweight champion Billie ""The Blue Bear"" a German fighter that's known for fighting dirty. Maggie unshaken by the German's fight game, she gave the champion all she could handle to the point that she was beating the champ and forced the champ to throw a sucker punch from behind when Maggie wasn't looking. This caused Maggie to fall head first on a chair that was being placed in the ring that fighters sit on in between rounds. The fall caused Maggie to break her neck and become a quadriplegic. Maggie, refuse to accept the prognosis that she would never recover and regain mobility in her limbs, Frankie being that father figure steps up to help her through this trying time and help with anything she needed done. Including dealing with Maggie's family trying to use her and take all her money. Clint Eastwood did a great job using the slow motion and still photograph when Maggie was hit from behind in the ring and showing her head hitting the chair. That scene was very shocking and emotional; it intensified the moment and added to the emotional quality of the film. This added to the dramatic effect of the film and tied Maggie and Frankie together to build up to the climax of the movie, where Frankie assisted Maggie in taking her life because she didn't want to be a vegetable for the rest of her life.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt one of the best films of the year, a must see."
"imagiking","8","0","0","5 July 2010"," Million Dollar Baby: Stunningly Brilliant
","If I'm not wrong, Million Dollar Baby was the first Clint Eastwood directed film I ever saw. A good number of years having passed since then, I recently decided to sit down and watch this again, to see if the original impression still stuck.<br/><br/>Having waitressed since her early teenage years, Maggie Fitzgerald has yearned for years to make it as a professional boxer. Introducing herself to aging trainer Frankie Dunn, she latches onto the crotchety sceptic, insisting he take her under his wing and refusing to take no for an answer.<br/><br/>As with all of his films, Eastwood's direction becomes instantly evident as a facet within the very first moments of Million Dollar Baby. The literal gritty darkness of his scenes form the basis of his work's appeal for me, the corresponding themes in no small part furthering this. Our early introduction to Dunn shows him as a classic Eastwood character of the latter day era: curmudgeonly; emotionless; granite- faced. His blank refusal to acquiesce to Maggie's unending requests comes as no surprise. The eager friendliness of Duff is a delight, her continual hope in spite of Eastwood's gruffness a bright and warm antithesis to his cold darkness. The inevitable change in this dynamic is well constructed, neatly avoiding the potential pitfall of seeming contrived and uncharacteristic. Fleeting moments of kindness punctuate Dunn's continuing harshness, gently developing him over the whole span of the film. Worth noting, most certainly, is Freeman. An exquisite supporting character, his Scrap is the sagacious guiding light of Dunn's conscience and morality, forging a formidable double act offering solid laughs as well as essential and unmissable dramatic scenes. The progress of Maggie's career is perhaps a little too cinematic, though never much the focus of the film. It relies constantly on the strength of the relationships of its characters, and on the fact that these are expressed almost wordlessly. Maggie's family, when we are unfortunate enough to encounter them, are sickeningly horrible people, telling us a great deal about her character in a most wonderful way. The film's final act is what sets it above most others: a beautiful, compelling, touching, unexpected, and masterful finale to a captivating character drama. Harder hitting than anyone in the film, it remains one of the most stunningly brilliant segues in cinematic history.<br/><br/>Bearing the hallmarks of Eastwood's ever exceptional direction, Million Dollar Baby combines a darkness in both lighting and subject matter with universally inimitable performances. Getting the very best from his actors as only he can, Eastwood takes us on an intoxicatingly enticing journey, dragging us through a minefield of emotion and giving us a truly unique experience, one of the best American cinema can offer."

","Maggie Fitzgerald is a thirty-one year old amateur female boxer, and all she wants is a fighting chance. ""I don't train girls,"" says Frankie Dunn, a grizzled, but respected trainer who wants nothing to do with a girl fighter. With the help of Frankie's old partner and gym caretaker, Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris, they convince Frankie to coach and to be Maggie's manager. Frankie has a relationship problem with his long-lost daughter and adopts Maggie along with her career, until she is seriously injured in a fight for championship and Frankie has to make a decision.<br/><br/>This movie was made in 2004 and directed by Clint Eastwood. Scrap (Morgan Freeman) is narrator through out this entire film. Maggie (Hilary Swank) is trying to escape her trailer-trash life and dysfunctional loser family. She accomplishes this by boxing, which she feels is her ""way out."" Frankie (Clint Eastwood) does not want to coach girls, but is finally convinced to not only coach Maggie, but also to become her manager. Maggie works very hard. She follows all Frankie's instructions, and does not ask any questions. When she finally starts fighting, she knocks out opponents in the first round. Soon nobody wants to fight her, so Frankie moves her up in class. She gets a fight against the champion, but everything goes wrong.<br/><br/>This movie does not have one particular plot, but several subplots. Frankie has a long-lost relationship with his daughter. He is constantly writing her letters, but they are all sent back to him. Maggie has a dysfunctional family which she is trying to escape. She also has a dream of becoming a professional fighter. This movie shows me that great films do not need one storyline, just great actors and directing.<br/><br/>This movie had excellent use of light and shade. There could not be any better characters put in one movie. I thought the part when Frankie asked Scrap why he had on socks with holes in them, his response was ""I like to get air to my feet at night,"" yet Frankie gave him money to buy socks, though the money made its way to the tracks. This movie will make a viewer laugh, cry, and be moved by this powerful boxing classic."

Anyway could the film deep down be about the conseqences of choosing to seek glory in a way that compromises your nuturing nature.Hillary Swanks character didn't have a nurturing relationship with her mother and her father wasn't around for long.She wanted to fight,she had been fighting all her life for people to respect her she felt she had always been seen as a nothing.she wanted to prove herself, yes she could make it,i guess she wanted to make clint eastwoods character proud,he was the father figure.Her mother didn't care about her so all she wanted to do was make her father proud,Hillary swanks character wanted this so you cant blame clints character for what happened to her he wanted to protect her,but you cant blame hillary's character as she was seeking the love that would complete her, her mothers which wasn't evident and the fathers by making him proud but if a father cant protect and a mother cant nurture if its not there what happens ?if protection and nuture are not with someone if in a sense it is given up,it makes room for everything that is opposite a total disrespect for human life as seen in the former prostitute title holder who had no problems about fighting with fatal blows to just get rid of her opponent.I really cant think about this anymore there are some big questions in this film i know its going to stay with me many more days yet ,i have to watch it again to get clearer on the film.I guess this comment wont help anyone as i wrote it for you to help me with the film."

","In some ways Million Dollar Baby is as simple as movies get. It's a story about three people. And one of the three seems to be there really just to tell you some things you otherwise might not know about the other two. The two principals in question are aging boxing trainer Frankie Dunn, played by Clint Eastwood who also directs, and the aspiring female boxer he will soon train, Maggie Fitzgerald, played wonderfully by Hilary Swank. The only other character of any great significance, played by Morgan Freeman, is Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris. Scrap, a former boxer himself, now helps Frankie with the operation of his rather seedy boxing gym. But perhaps more importantly for the film, Scrap serves as the narrator who tells us things about Frankie and Maggie that otherwise would have taken too long to flesh out. We get to know Frankie and Maggie as much through what Scrap tells us about them as by what we see them doing ourselves.<br/><br/>The three main characters are brought together by boxing but it's really not a boxing movie. It's more about the life's journey of Maggie Fitzgerald and how Frankie, a man near the end of his own journey, will help her fulfill her destiny. Maggie and Frankie's unlikely partnership drives the movie forward and Swank and Eastwood each do a great job in bringing their characters to life. As the determined and somewhat naive underdog Swank shines. Very few actresses would have been able to handle the emotion and the physicality of this role. Swank absolutely nails it. Eastwood's character has a lot bubbling under the surface and initially we're not really sure if we should like this guy. But despite his initial misgivings (he is very emphatic in stating that he doesn't train girls), Maggie brings out the best in him. They have an unusual but undeniably strong bond and they go on a fascinating journey together.<br/><br/>The story is an intriguing one, the characters are compelling and the acting, from Swank especially, is excellent. But Million Dollar Baby seems to lack a certain energy driving the film forward. For much of the film it seems we're just biding time waiting for the inevitable climactic fight. And that climactic fight? Well, it's how shall we say, quite interesting, and certainly puts a different spin on all that has come before. Part of the charm of movies is in delivering the unexpected but I'm not sure how many will be charmed by the climactic events here. In the end, Million Dollar Baby is certainly powerful, thought-provoking and full of emotion. No all-time classic but a fine story well worth seeing."

","I think (strange but I do) this movie is a good movie for its realism, and it's not really a movie which you could put the Hollywood's brand on, because something has been solved (the discovering of a legendary ""National Treasure""), but describes a real rough situation, where mostly everyone of us has passed in life, even unconsciously. I believe this is a good movie. But I don't think is helpful in any teachings. It may tell us how a simple and mostly lonely man can deal with the toughest decision. But after that anyone of us may just get out of the theater hoping not to go through anything like that. <br/><br/>That is the defeat of our era. Probably Eastwood has been so great in singling out this fat worm in our shiny apple. <br/><br/>Because the ones who come out of the theater thinking the movie had a serene (maybe melancholy but serene) ending, probably didn't get there is tragic situation in the end, a continuous remorse which will always knock on everyone's door, and the only question is ""how can we prevent it?""<br/><br/>I don't know if Eastwood wanted people to question about themselves, probably He just wanted to show us in reality there are some really uneasy human case."

","What I loved: Maggie was truly a diamond found in a mountain of broken glass. She was sweet, tough, cute, and passionate. The boxing scenes were realistic and nothing was glorified. Everyone seemed down to earth. What a great feeling! What I didn't like: The last 45 minutes could have been reduced down to 20 minutes and the other 25 minutes could have been made up with showing more of her training. We didn't see enough of Clint teaching her everything he knows. The bonding and father/daughter relationship doesn't necessarily develop from her knocking everyone out, but would grow through the countless days of training to become that champ.<br/><br/>Also, Maggie won that fight. Blue Bear would have been DQed, but that was never addressed. I wanted to see Magie's belt hanging over her bed. And I guess her money ended up going to her family since that wasn't addressed either. Lastly, in the very end he told her that her nickname meant ""My Darling, My Blood."" That was really sweet and tender, but why didn't he tell her that he loved her? As Maggie said, ""no one told me that they loved me since my daddy."" I thought that was a little foreshadowing, but I was wrong.<br/><br/>The movie went from Feel Good to Feel Bad movie of the year and that was tough to deal with.

","""Million Dollar Baby"" is as well acted and executed a movie as one will likely see. Clint Eastwood steals virtually every scene he appears in, and Hillary Swank is great as his sidekick. The story is simple, yet quirky, and Morgan Freeman and the rest of the cast set up an appropriate mood of desperation. Although the remainder of this review will not be completely complimentary to the feature, I would recommend the movie to anyone wanting to see good cinema and an outstanding Clint Eastwood performance.<br/><br/>Now, it is time to put ""Million Dollar Baby"" into perspective. The film is simply not in the same league as the classic Paul Newman/Tom Cruise feature, ""The Color of Money"". Both movies have the making of a champion the central plot. However, ""The Color of Money"" is more fun, more realistic, and finally and oddly, more optimistic than ""Million Dollar Baby"". Tragedy and boxing always seem to go together. That has become cliché. Tom Cruise in ""The Color of Money"" is not a tragic character and strangely enough, neither is Paul Newman. Opening up the world of championship pool, and showing it for the joke it is, was far more entertaining and enlightening than yet another feature on the brutal and barely acceptable culture of boxing.<br/><br/>To conclude, I would recommend anyone who has seen ""Million Dollar Baby"" to view or review ""The Color of Money"" and come to your own conclusions on which story was better."
"cdumitriu-1","8","0","0","5 June 2005"," I think the story has the ""appropriate"" end
","I think the story has the ""appropriate"" end. If would have been an happy-end I should have felt like cheated (happy endings are not so common as in movies) and we would have had another ""american dream"" story told by Eastwood himself (hopefully it wasn't). I do also see that the central issue of this story is about winning (or getting esteem or respect, fame, call it like you want) and is about the hated side of winning, meaning losing. Everybody expects you to win but can you afford to lose, especially when you are supposed to cry if you get hurt? And she turned out to be the toughest. The rest of the story is merely a pretext: boxing seems to be a pretty impressive (and accessible through fighter's ""guts"" mixed with inspired training) way to honestly get ""people chanting"" your name (a sort of fame); Dunn's daughter is the receiver for Scrap's all film's length read letter, she could possibly even not exist anymore, Dunn said she was ""his family"", someone whom he could care if left. Although there are a few other characters (Freeman has a fine performance), the story follows the two main characters in three places: gym, boxing ring and hospital (which makes it brilliantly simple). There was much ado about the father-daughter relation (something like need/offer of dearness, protection etc.). I don't think this prevailed a more fine relation as it is between honest fighters sympathy, loyalty and generosity. She had the kind of innocent dream plus passion that tempted him to be loyal to (once again); so he decided to play the role of the experienced guide and there were little risks because there were no so high stakes. She wanted so much to play for the highest stake and he couldn't refuse to (could be by vanity: it is the first time that is training a challenger; could be by pride: he cannot step back; could be by loyalty: he wanted to give back his best for her belief, she couldn't be wrong coming at him, could she ?). But all the decisions seem made by her and all the other are assisting doing their best sympathetically. Everybody knows the unwanted sides of competitions of that kind (the scene where she find that one of her's blitz won had a broken timpani). It's all decided there in the ring, you do not know the number of the fight that sends you out. She faces that with a great courage and consciousness (I think Swank's best performance was for this side of her acting). Actually she is continuing her fight in the hospital bed, and this time the stakes are too real: with her greedy family, with the coach and with the rules that kept her alive. It is impressive that she doesn't complain or ask compassion. A real classic hero. If there is an impression that the movie ""is melodramatic"", that could certainly not be imputed to Swank. Overall I consider Eastwood's and Freeman's characters well pounded. Their characters, although could have been more rough, more cynical, are in fact rather sensitive and kind, I hope not one of the last signs of human tenderness on screens. Clint Eastwood is a great director for this movie. The image and the setting are good and right.<br/><br/>This might be looked as well as another modern version of Icarus myth."

","Million Dollar Baby is one of those films which leaves you sitting in silence as the end credits roll. The silence is one of awe, but also one akin to being unable to speak after being floored by a sucker punch. ""I didn't see that coming"" will be the prevalent thought.<br/><br/>The film starts predictably enough; a 31-year-old girl (Swank) wishes to become a champion boxer, and to achieve that she seeks the best trainer around: Frankie (Eastwood). Although he initially refuses she continues to train and, after Frankie's friend (Freeman) intervenes and convinces him, he decides to train her. Under Eastwood's coaching she progresses rapidly, ultimately earning a championship shot. At this point you would be forgiven for believing this film to be a simple boxing movie, a female version of Rocky. However, Eastwood and writers Paul Haggis and F.X. Toole have loftier ideas than this, and it is here the knockout punch is delivered to the audience, taking the film in a radically new direction.<br/><br/>The film cleaned up at the Academy Awards, and deservedly so, for it is a truly great piece of film-making. Eastwood and Swank are certainly worthy of their awards (for Best Director and Best Actress respectively) but it is Freeman who is the outstanding turn here. In a typical understated role, as both Frankie's friend and the narrator, it is he who lends the film sincerity and gravitas. His chemistry with Eastwood in particular is excellent, thanks partly through their prior experience together on Eastwood's earlier Unforgiven. Freeman has long been a mainstay of Hollywood, and his Best Supporting Actor award is both richly earned and long overdue.<br/><br/>Eastwood's handling of some delicate material towards the end of the film, although brave, is commendable, and the change in direction, whilst not quite a twist on the level of The Usual Suspects, is an intriguing one. Overall a rather harrowing film, and although it is a film to be savoured, it is not one that can be watched comfortably a second time."

Eastwood has taken up directorial, producing and scoring duties, but, like his past twenty-four pictures, has left the screenplay to another: Paul Haggis (adapting stories from F.X.

"christian123","8","0","0","1 April 2005"," Not the best picture of the year but still pretty good
","Million Dollar Baby is one of the best pictures you will see all year. A young woman named Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) is taken under the wing of a crotchety boxing trainer (Clint Eastwood) and his long-time friend, a retired boxer played by Morgan Freeman, as she tries to become the women's boxing champion. The plot is nothing new but they certainly do a good job of making old material feel and look good. The story was just executed so well that I really got into the film. The screenplay may be full of clichés but the film is able to rise above those to pretty great heights. Some of the movie isn't very realistic but that's just a few of the scenes. The characters are all interesting but they could have done a better job with Maggie's family. The boxing scenes may not be as good as the ones in Rocky but they are still done pretty well. The acting is great and probably some of the best you will see all year. Hilary Swank sure makes up for The Core with this knockout performance. Morgan Freeman does a good job too but I'm not really sure if he deserved an Oscar for this. Clint Eastwood did a great job of directing keeping the film at a nice pace and he did a good job acting as well. The film is 132 minutes long but it didn't feel that long since the film keeps you interested. Even though most of the film is pretty predictable there are still a couple of twists that may take you by surprise. The ending is pretty depressing and it made me want to cry since she had gone all that way and went through all that training and wanted to die like that. It was a very emotionally powerful film that will pull on the heartstrings at some scenes. Rating 9/10 a very good film while it may not be perfect its still worth watching."

","I forced my boyfriend to go see this with me the other night with the promise (false, though it may be) that it involved some boxing. Well, he just hated it. Not because it didn't involve too much boxing, but because it made him feel so sad, so depressed as we left the theater, that he just hated it. He said he was nauseated at the end (and throughout the last 30 minutes of the film) because it was just too heavy. My perspective is unfortunately quite similar. We both agreed that the acting was superb, but the story itself was just too sad. It was refreshing to see a movie without the cliché happy ending, but this takes it to new extremes. It was difficult to watch because of the sadness. I can only describe it as 'heavy.' There were a few moments of levity, but not enough to help us escape from the grips of depression and despair the movie so masterfully conveyed. I gave this film 8 out of 10 because it was a great movie. However, I will NEVER see it again. I can't go through it again, and I think my boyfriend would kill me if I brought it home. Just a note... we at least made it through the entire film, but others in the theater were not as tolerant. That being said, I will defend the film, because I am certain the people did not leave because it was bad, but because they just couldn't take any more. I guess that is why it deserved the Oscar. But, all in all, it was a VERY difficult movie to watch. That makes it excellent, I suppose. Unfortunately, MDB will not go on my favorites list. I can appreciate it for the masterpiece it was, but I don't want to suffer through it again. It was just too hard to watch (mainly towards the end). Also, I am usually a crier, but I managed to compose myself through MDB. However, the other patrons, as mentioned earlier, were also not as fortunate. An amazing film that perfectly demonstrates the genius of Clint Eastwood as well as Morgan Freeman, and the amazing ability of Hilary Swank to morph into any character.... it was just SO sad and TOO HEAVY!! I know I keep saying it, but that is the best way to describe it. <br/><br/>P.S. - ""Danger"" was some nice comic relief, but even he was victim to minor tragedy.... just another example of the heaviness of this film."

","Masterpiece. Engrossing. Heartbreaking. All words that describe a Johnny Betts movie review. But they can also be used to describe Clint Eastwood's latest project - Million Dollar Baby. Make no mistake about it; I'm a huge Eastwood mark. So you might be inclined to believe that since I'm a fan, I'm just gonna praise whatever he does. That's not entirely true though. The man has an Oscar resting comfortably upon his shelf, so he certainly doesn't need my validation.<br/><br/>Clint is no stranger to critical success, but for my money Million Dollar Baby is a better movie than his other two most heralded movies - Unforgiven (which I felt was overrated and one of Clint's weaker Westerns) and Mystic River, Clint's Oscar-hyped wristslitter of 2003. They all have their merits, but Million Dollar Baby has a fascinating combination of deliberate, gripping storytelling, great acting, sparse but well-placed music, engaging drama, and subtle humor that the others don't have. Oh, and the boxing in the movie is very realistic, nothing fancy or over-the-top.<br/><br/>Speaking of boxing, the word alone is enough to turn off some viewers. One of the first responses I get whenever I start explaining the plot to this movie is, ""Oh, I don't like boxing movies, so I probably won't like it."" One thing you need to understand is that this is not a boxing movie. It's a movie about human relationships that just happens to use boxing as its backdrop.<br/><br/>There's the relationship between Frankie and Scrap. Frankie worked as a cut man for Scrap many years ago, and twenty-three years later, Frankie still feels responsible for Scrap losing sight in his right eye after a particularly brutal fight. But their friendship has remained strong. Clint and Freeman display such a great chemistry that you actually feel like they've been friends for over twenty years. Well, I did at least. They sound like an old married couple at times, arguing over silly things like the holes in Scrap's socks or Frankie's less-than-jovial demeanor. The dialogue is funny and crisp without being overly eloquent. Exactly what you'd expect from a couple of guys who've been around boxing their whole lives.<br/><br/>Then there's the father/daughter relationship between Frankie and Maggie. Frankie has no relationship with his actual daughter - as evidenced by the fact that the letters he sends her every week always return un-opened and marked ""Return to sender."" We never really find out why his daughter hates him so much, but I assume his involvement in the boxing business kept him from being around her, and she hasn't forgiven him. Maggie's dad died when she was young, but Frankie reminds her a lot of him. Once he starts to train her, Frankie is really the only person she can depend on, and they form a strong bond that both were previously missing in their lives.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank, as Maggie, is impressive enough to finally make us all forget about The Core. I didn't expect to like her character very much, so I walked away pleasantly surprised. Her southern accent just sounded too fake in the trailers, but I got used to it, and I was shocked to find myself caring about Maggie. Note to Hilary: KEEP YOUR HAIR LONG! I like the movie's straight-forward message about how sometimes in life, having the heart and desire to do something isn't always enough. It's like Frankie says, ""Show me a fighter who's nothing but heart, and I'll show you a man who's waiting for a beatin'."" It's not a lesson a lot of people want to hear, but it's just the kick in the pants that a lot of people need.<br/><br/>I wasn't as pleased, however, with the movie's ending. And this is something that might cause a lot of people to be really upset. I can't say much because I'd give too much away, but I can say that a couple of characters make some decisions I don't condone. But it's done in a way not to be preachy. A character is even advised against taking a certain course of action, and then the audience is left to see what choice is made.<br/><br/>In a recent interview, Clint was asked about the controversial ending, and he replied, ""I'm just telling a story. I don't advocate. I'm playing a part. I've gone around in movies blowing people away with a .44 magnum. But that doesn't mean I think that's a proper thing to do."" That's honestly the best way to look at it.<br/><br/>Is the ending depressing? Sure. Do I have my own ideas of how the movie could've ended on a better note? Yep. But that's life. Reality isn't always pretty, and this movie does a good job of capturing that realism, regardless of whether we agree with certain decisions or not. You can choose to put a situation in God's hands, or you can attempt to solve it on your own. You just have to be willing to accept the consequences of your decision.<br/><br/>THE GIST <br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is simple at its core - a movie that uses great performances to do a great job of storytelling. If you're a fan of anybody in the cast and you can handle something with a less-than-cheerful ending, then Million Dollar Baby will keep your interest. Just make sure you bring some Kleenex. But if you prefer to walk out of a movie whistling and tapping your feet, then I suggest looking elsewhere.<br/><br/>Oh, and guys, if you happen to notice a salty liquid substance forming around the rims of your eyes, then don't worry too much. It's like the Memphis Tigers football coach (Tommy West) says, ""Men don't cry, their eyes sweat."" Keep that excuse handy, and you'll be fine."

","This film certainly deserves the Oscar nomination and to my mind is a better movie than The Aviator.<br/><br/>The film focuses on a wannabe boxer who like most boxers is from a poor background. The only difference here is that the boxer in question is a woman. Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank) wants Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) to be her manager. He doesn't want to manage a woman, but I don't think it's giving too much away to say that he finally takes her on.<br/><br/>One of the best things about this film is that the boxing is realistically shot and the fact that it's womens boxing doesn't feel out of place. Whilst Swank deservedly takes the honours for acting, Eastwood and Freeman are as dependable as ever.

","Frankie Dunn is a grizzled boxing trainer who tries his best to protect his fighters from the pressure of the big shot and prepare them as well as he can. When his most recent hope abandons him for a title shot Frankie is downcast to the point where he humours a hopeless gym regular, Maggie Fitzgerald by agreeing to train her. After a short time her potential is obvious and Frankie starts her out in minor bouts where she is so successful at knocking her opponents out that she struggles to get more bouts arranged. With the big time beckoning, can Maggie continue this trend to her title shot and can Frankie trust her enough to let her try?<br/><br/>My plot summary makes this sound like a very tired and clichéd sports movie then that is intentional because that it how it sounded to me when I heard about it; having seen Girlfight recently I wondered why I should bother with what sounds essentially like a retread of that. And for the majority of the film this is what it appeared to be albeit it a pretty professional and enjoyable genre film. However at some point during the film it moves away from the genre formula and becomes something much more interesting. I won't spoil anything but the plot becomes much more low key and interesting  suffice to say this is not just a clichéd sports movie. However this doesn't mean that it is a brilliant film and I must admit to being a little bewildered by the high praise that everyone seems to be heaping onto it. Lets not forget that it is a genre film for the vast majority and only stands out due to consistent good touches and the different direction at the end making it better. It is all interesting and surprisingly low key but don't expect to be totally blown away  it isn't that sort of film.<br/><br/>The acting is very good and I would suggest that Swank is looking at a second Best Actress Oscar for this simply because we is as good early on as she is at the end and adds character to her performance  a whole history with her family build in just one or two scenes, thanks mainly to her performance. Eastwood is the same  a clichéd character made better by hints of deeper issues; I would have liked more time with him in the film to get to know what has brought him here, but he is good considering the limits he is working within. Freeman is also limited to a very small role but is still pretty good although at times his narration was a bit too much and I felt it was over used  a small mercy was that, when the film became most thoughtful, the narration is significantly dropped to a minimum and we are trusted to think for ourselves.<br/><br/>Overall this is not a perfect film but it is a pretty good one. It is 70% the sports cliché that you expect it to be and 30% something different that is a lot darker, low key and interesting. This is an uneasy mix and doesn't totally work  and changing 30% of a genre movie isn't enough to make me cheer from the rooftops about it but I did enjoy it nonetheless."
"Quinoa1984","8","4","12","15 February 2005"," boxers' blues- one of the more notable points in Eastwood's career
","Something a friend of mine talked with me about after he and I had seen the film was a good point about the film's dramatic structure (which prompted me to see the film a second time, aside from knowing intrinsically it would get doused in Oscar liquid). It's like a darker, slightly harsher Aesop tale, with simplicity in its message ingrained into it, but with power none-the-less. I wouldn't say even after a second viewing that Million Dollar Baby, Clint Eastwood's latest film as one of the few remaining Hollywood auteurs, is one of his very best films (I don't know if I may be one of only a few that found Mystic River more shattering on the whole). Still, I think that at the least with these two latest films, Eastwood has reached on his own level the heights of one of his great dramatic influences- director Vittorio De Sica. His films were filled with an intuitive touch of humanity, observing where heart lies within people, and where it doesn't. Aside from the darker themes that the film brings up, it's also at the core a simple tale of those who observe who has heart, kindness, and who doesn't.<br/><br/>Eastwood is better than usual as Frankie, a trainer and owner of a boxing gym. His friend and observer of the film's details, Scrap (Morgan Freeman, supreme in his understated performance), was once a boxer too, but with going too far with a fight, he became half-blind, but given a job and residence by a guilt-ridden Frankie (who is so for that and a few other things, some kept perfectly ambiguous). When he loses his boxer for being 'over-protective', a woman, Maggie (Hilary Swank, intuitive as always in her scenes), asks to be trained. After much convincing, Frankie takes her on, and little by little, he gets looser on his strict terms of not being questioned with his teachings. Then, as Maggie finally reaches the top, there comes what is called in screen writing as the second turning point, and the story turns its last act into the contemplative, the deep, and the tragic.<br/><br/>One thing that grabbed me even more so on a second viewing was that the theme of what boxing does to the human spirit and psyche is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, as Scrap observes, it's ""un-natural"", to be moving around getting right in the face of pain and not running away, and how it is not a very glamorous 'sport' at all (a theme that makes it more worthy than a lessor boxing movie would give). On the other hand, it also goes in hand with the theme of having heart; the two supporting characters of Danger (in a satisfactory performance by Baruchel) and Shawrelle (Mackie), who are a major contrast. I really liked how Eastwood and writer Paul Haggis (from a book of short stories) dealt with the sub-plot to go so well with the main plot of Frankie, Scrap and Maggie. Another exceptional scene that makes this point clearer- and more resonant as the final act unfolds- is when Maggie gets a treat on her 33rd birthday from Scrap, and he tells his story about how he lost sight in his eye. In this scene, both of the actors are brilliant in their tone and reactions, it makes for one of the more meaningful, and dramatically compelling, pieces of the story.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say, as I said, that the film is entirely flawless (which is arguable, I know). One problem I had both times I saw it, though not overall, was with Morgan Freeman's narration. For the most part it is insightful and narratively correct, but unlike Freeman's key narration role (as the key observer in Shawshank Redemption), not every line seemed very crucial for the story. It is a simple story with simpler, sometimes philosophical notes of narration, but I sometimes wished that everything had to be outlined - one can sense things right in Eastwood's face and eyes while Freeman talks gruffly behind him. And, arguable still, the sheer simplicity of the film does leave it so that one can't figure out parts of the story for themselves.<br/><br/>Never-the-less, the film is an extraordinary stroke of skill for Eastwood as a director. If one can't say that his performance is one of his very best, one could say that his direction, his use of the camera (via DP Tom Stern), is at a peak. The way he uses his strokes of lighting and darkness, and with the way he can control the camera and not be (un-appropriately) flashy, makes it extremely professional. That he's been known to shoot scenes in one or two takes makes for such a sweetly spontaneous result, however totally controlled. Indeed, I agree whole-heartedly with one critic who said ""to call this an old man's film is a sincere compliment"", especially on the craftsman side. A-"

Then all hell breaks loose when Swank's character falls on the stool, and the last third of the movie becomes so bad.<br/><br/>If the screenwriter could have stuck with the great story telling in the first two acts, maybe the third act wouldn't come off as some ridiculous soap opera. Maybe I should have seen it coming after Swank's character talks about her father bringing her dog out to the woods.I would have liked to see the dirty boxer ""blue bear"" being punished in some way like having her titled taken away, being banned from boxing and being sent to prison, or better yet, have Clint Eastwood get all ""Dirty Harry"" on her(just kidding on that one).<br/><br/>This could have been a great film showing that Swank's character wouldn't give up in achieving her goals and Eastwood's character learning to forgive himself for the past.<br/><br/>The Good: - The acting, the first 2 acts of the script, and Swank's character.<br/><br/>The Bad: - Last third of the movie, the minute Maggie lands on the stool. Another bad third act film is Collateral.<br/><br/>The Ugly: - Maggie's family and Blue Bear.<br/><br/>That's just my opinion.

","Million Dollar Baby does not solve any questions it presents. I can't believe it's in the top 250.<br/><br/>OK, where shall I begin? Well, for a start, it was incredibly predictable. Clint Eastwood plays one of the most clichéd characters ever. He's a tough man with a heart of gold. John Wayne anyone? Also, Hilary Swank was garbage in it. She was so wooden, and I didn't believe for a second she was a remotely good boxer. I hated it how she got all the good scenes instead of Morgan Freeman who was the only good thing about this film.<br/><br/>Paul Haggis is perhaps the most overrated writer in recent times. He uses such formulaic dialogue, it makes a Tarantino fan like myself vomit feverishly when I hear a line like ""You're all I've got."" There are tons of other examples but I can't remember them because I was so bored.<br/><br/>Also, it tries to do too much. It tries to deal with the father daughter relationship, Rednecks, euthanasia, how you have to take chances, how you shouldn't gamble etc. Never heard those issues being discussed before have we lades and gents? Especially not in one film. I can imagine Haggis at his typewriter thinking ""How can I spread the plague of my crap TV writing to the wider audience? I know, I'll try to make a boxing movie, WITH A DIFFERENCE!! I'll deal with tons of issues to win the critics over."" Sadly Paul, I'm not fooled.<br/><br/>I admit, the cinematography was good in the car scene where the light moves and you can't see their faces and stuff but this light dark thing didn't work for a lot of the film. There were countless scenes where a character stood with their head in darkness. That's not an overused technique is it? And the ending, oh God the ending was abysmal. For those who haven't seen it, let me just let you know it is predictable the second she gets knocked out by a one dimensional East German evildoer. Ahhhhh! I hate characters like that boxer. They don't exist in the real world and how the hell is she world champion? She would get disqualified for breaking the rules obviously. It's such a cop out from the idiot that is Paul Haggis of making poor innocent Hilary, who has just knocked like 20 people out with one punch (realistic huh?), get knocked out by a cheating communist bitch.<br/><br/>If only Pauline Kael was still alive and writing. I am certain she would have shown this film for what it is, sentimental garbage. She is famous for hating unrealistic idealism and that is exactly what this appallingly overrated film is about.

"johnnyboyz","8","3","8","24 December 2007"," Million Dollar Film-making.
","I suppose when you discuss the most famous boxing films about people who didn't actually exist; nine out of ten film fans may point at Rocky for one reason or another and whilst I haven't seen Rocky at this present time, I would challenge them to give Million Dollar Baby a chance in trying to de-throne Rocky as the film at the top of their particular opinion. I hear and read that some say this is better than Raging Bull; well yes, as a boxing film I can categorically say it is better than Raging Bull but in terms of individual acting performance and character study it isn't  we really got to know La Motta in Raging Bull; we were there through everything and experienced it with him even if the actual boxing scenes in the film were rather poor.<br/><br/>In Million Dollar Baby, rather than put everything into one character in a blisteringly entertaining and effective way; Eastwood spreads the study around the whole cast: We discover what we need to know about Eddie Dupris (Freeman) when it's necessary and he fulfills his own little goal in the film; we come to learn what sort of a person Danger Barch (Baruchel) is and his story is more tragic than it is anything else and of course; there is the relationship between student and teacher that Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) and Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank) share which is the primary study of the film. First of all, I would in no way say this was a typical sports film where the hero starts off good; suffers a tragedy; works their way back up; gets a mentor and then gets ready for a final showdown with the bad guy. Million Dollar Baby sort of starts at point three in the last sentence and then skips the final point altogether as there is no antagonist in this film. Any 'showdown' that you could feasible use as an example would be when Maggie must face up to her redneck family who have shunned her her whole life up until a certain point but of course; this has nothing to do with sports: the film's genre.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is a film that studies the space within the frame. It utilises a boxing ring, a gym and its surrounding areas as a statement about certain characters early on in the film in a brilliant manner. Frankie has his office which is set away from the rest of the gym, up high looking down on everything since he's the boss of the place  he is reminded as well as haunted by his previous success as a trainer with his masses of trophies and victories staring down further yet upon him. Danger is a lost and wondering soul who keeps saying he is going to challenge a champion boxer for a belt yet little does he know that boxing has long since retired: Danger occupies the ring most of the time which acts as a large and open space of nothingness as he repeats his dream he will never achieve and his boxing skills he cannot use. Eddie occupies a small room set away from the gym and everyone else; he is secluded from most of the action and occupies the lowest quality dwelling of the establishment; although not a racial element, this says things about his character that he is a cleaner; that his life is now simple after the dizzying highs and lows of his own boxing career.<br/><br/>Given these pieces of evidence, Maggie's own space is one of many. She is seen in the ring, in the gym, in a new home and later on in two new spaces which would give away the tragic event that propel the final third. Maggie persists on using the 'speed back' which perhaps reflects she wants to hit away in fast motion the depravity through relief of her bad life. Like most sports films, the middle section of the film usually contains a montage: I recently saw John Dahl's 'Rounders' which follows such a formula mentioned earlier on but cleverly informs us that Poker is in fact, a sport but in Million Dollar Baby; the obligatory montage doesn't seem to come yet at the same time, it's there. What I mean by this is that although Maggie knocks everyone out in the first round; this is due to the fact she has such a drive in her quest for the American Dream through boxing that she really is that good: every time we see the hero wipe the floor with everyone in a montage, maybe we roll our eyes but here I was sold  she's wiping the floor with them because she really is that determined and that skillful.<br/><br/>The film also challenges sexuality and what males find sexually attractive in films. Laura Mulvey once wrote that every film is shot for a male to watch and yet the women in Million Dollar Baby are hard bodied boxers who get sweaty, build their bodies and keep their hair short: there is nothing attractive in the film no matter how badly you get turned on by the thought of a woman beating you up. The evidence here is in the form of extremely quick shots of girls dressed in tight bikinis holding up numbers telling us what round it is in-between rounds. This is the film identifying that the boxers are not objects of the gaze whilst Eastwood knows he has to prove that they're not: the ring girls do this. Despite it's poor representation during the final fight where the final fighter is black and German (a black German girl!?) whose trainers dress in shady leather coats and look menacing; Million Dollar Baby succeeds through excellent spread characterisation and a stupendous narrative even if some of the people attending the fights look a little like they don't belong there but that's what the film's about: spaces; wrong place at the wrong time."
"s.kelly-25","6","3","8","10 November 2005"," Great film with frustrating, unrealistic plot
","Okay to start with I liked the characters and the acting was great and the lighting gave great mood. The score was good, the writing was sharp, and the cinematography was perfect for the kind of film it was. BUT I hated the MOVIE. The reason why is the course of events and the way things played out is completely unrealistic in a totally realistic film. <br/><br/>SPOILER WARNING <br/><br/>Where in the hell do Eastwood and Haggis get off expecting any kind of person knowledgeable about sports (boxing in particular) to buy the fact that when Billie Blue sucker punched Maggie and she subsequently fell on the stool she became paralyzed. I mean where the hell does that come from? It was complete and utter bullshit. In not only being totally unrealistic the entire sequence is so contrived and aggravating in its stupidity I sat in the theater in shock. There is no precedent for anything like that ever happening in real life and this is a film that trumpets its realism and is what makes the film so good in other areas. <br/><br/>Besides that Billie Blue would have served jail time for assault or something, or at least been suspended or stripped of the title or something (anything) but there is no retribution against her (jail time or physical) and this is one of the major downfalls of the film. She's only there to get the film from its boxing story to its paraplegic story. As far as plot devices go this is the biggest stretch I've ever seen in a film that is great in so many other areas.<br/><br/>Also the fact that the whole story was a letter Morgan Freeman wrote to Eastwood's daughter was good but there was no finality with that either. We don't see her read the letter and if she did read it we don't see her do anything about it (positive or negative). The movie turned from a boxing picture with great metaphors about life to a major drama. <br/><br/>There are two separate stories here. Maggie coming from nothing and struggling to become champ and a paraplegic who used to be a great boxer but got hurt in the ring. The problem is everyone has seen the first story so much and the second story doesn't have enough material to fill an entire movie. <br/><br/>So combined you get Million Dollar Baby, a really great film that ends up sucking big time. The main reason for this is because it is a film so grounded and immersed in reality and real characters but its plot is so un-freakin-believable that it overshadows everything else to the film's demise."

","Well acted movie is ruined by a Hollywood morality ending that doesn't jive with the character's make-up. Someone who fights all of their life doesn't want to anymore because they ""have tasted fame""? Stupid! Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank are excellent actor/actresses and Morgan Freeman is solid as always. The movie is well-paced and provides excellent entertainment. The Rocky movies could take a page from this script on how to film authentic fight scenes. The only problem is that the climax of the movie doesn't jive with the rest of the movie. Hillary Swank's character overcomes many obstacles and shows competitive spirit (which makes her awesome). However she decides that life isn't worth living if people aren't chanting her name anymore? Her love for Clint Eastwood's character is thrown out of the window because she just isn't ready to live anymore? One of the more disappointing endings ever to a fabulous movie -- drops it considerably IMHO."

I haven't yet seen the other Oscar nominees of 2004, but then Beautiful Mind, American Beauty, Forrest Gump and English Patient too have won that Oscar (not to mention the all time greats such as Gone with the Wind, Midnight Cowboy and Kramer Vs Kramer) Is this movie on par with those? The movie does not truly explore the human relationships since we are not aware of many circumstances of the main actors. There appears to be a father-daughter relationship but we are not aware of the real father-daughter relationships of them. So how can we be sure? Are we supposed to read the book too? I am reminded of great story tellers such as David Lean who in Ryan's Daughter and Doctor Zhivago told complex stories while at the same time delving into the depths of human and social spirits.<br/><br/>I have a feeling that ""Raging Bull"" is far ahead in exploring the human being beneath the boxer than this film.

Morgan Freeman is cast in his usual role of a wise, quiet observer with a heart of gold. All this becomes ultimately too cloying. Perhaps I expected more because so much was written about it.

","I cannot believe anyone really likes this movie. I could understand it if people were simply extolling the artistic elements of the film. It is certainly a film made with artistry -- three well-defined and interesting characters, haunting score, amazing lighting. But aren't films supposed to tell a good story?? Here we have Hilary Swank who has been paralyzed after losing (??) a title fight in which her opponent cheapshotted her after the bell. Now she wants to die because she has nothing left to live for after the wonders of female boxing fame. She can't do it on her own (though not for lack of trying -- the tongue swallowing sequence definitely gets her an A for effort), so she asks Clint to pull the plug. He has a very brief bout with his conscience, talks to the world's meanest priest (who, by the way, must HATE his own job since he can't understand why on earth anyone would actually want to go to Mass), but ""compassion"" wins in the end and Clint shoots her full of adrenaline and pulls her air (hospital security here leaves a little something to be desired). He just couldn't watch her live an empty meaningless life in a wheelchair. (No offense to the thousands of courageous people who live very full lives from beds and wheelchairs -- if you haven't climbed to the top of the female boxing world mountain, you just wouldn't understand.) After this heroic murder, Clint goes off into the sunset. I think this is just to set us up for the sequel. You see, Scrap (the Clint character's best friend) has had a pretty empty life as a one-eyed janitor who lives in Clint's gym ""cleaning up other people's spit."" He needs to die. And Dodger, the desperately sad never-gonna-be wanna-be who is always hanging around the gym, he can't be having a good time -- Clint can take care of that one, too. Finally, Fr. I-Hate-Catholicism-So-Of-Course-I-Became-a-Priest will get the two shots to the back of the head he has been crying out for. Then Clint can take a look in the mirror and realize that all this killing is getting kind of monotonous, not to mention the fact that he is getting really old and is bound to be incapacitated in some way. Hopefully before he offs himself in one final act of courage, he'll pick up a book on the rules of boxing and discover that boxers who sucker punch their opponents after the bell (and after being warned by the ref about dirty moves) are disqualified. Then he can die happy (although probably a little confused as to how he spent his whole life in boxing not hearing about these rule thingeys), knowing that his first victim was a champ."

Freeman, of course, the story teller with so many important advices, like always. Swank.. Fighter, doesn't want to be treated like a girl, she has to help her family, she wants to show her couch that she can make it...The words that describe this movie the best -it' s all seen before, so I'll have to agree with this few other people who said the same. And it wasn't easy to find someone with that opinion, I have been fighting with my best friend and boyfriend for the past 2 years because they, like everyone else claim that this is some kind of master-piece. The director maybe did a good job, but the screenplay is awful. Oscar for the movie of the year? Oscar for the best actress?

"cliffcarson-1","Null","3","9","23 December 2004"," The POWER of MERCY
","This is by far Clint Eastwoods darkest film and I'm don't mean just the color timing of the negative either. Nothing quite prepares you for the turn in which this film takes three quarters into the picture. From then on MILLION DOLLAR BABY becomes extremely difficult to watch. Several times during the course of the film I looked behind me to see people in the audience either squirming in their seats or covering their eyes. <br/><br/>What I find extraordinary about this picture is that Eastwood directed this powerful film while at the same time delivering the best performance of his career. Everyone is good in this with Eastwood and Freeman being the standouts. <br/><br/>The scene in the hospital room when the family visits the paralyzed Maggie is nothing short of riveting. The boxing scenes are handled straight forward, intelligently and aren't played for audience manipulation the way they are in movies like ROCKY. <br/><br/>However, for all it's realism there is a big gaping hole in the script. There is NO WAY Eastwood's character would have been allowed to walk into that hospital room at NIGHT without being stopped. A visitor just can't walk in and out of a patient's room anytime they feel like it. There are nurses, staff and office administrators monitoring a hospital 24 hours a day. Nobody has free access anytime they want. Visitors are always screened. Patients are monitored all night long and if they flatline in the middle of the night the signal is transfered to the hospital data base and detected immediately. There would have been someone rushing into that room. Eastwood just stands there looking at her. <br/><br/>That notwithstanding, the images in this movie will stay with you long after you've walked out of the theatre, so I suggest you see an afternoon screening. The sunshine will help off set the gloomy and gut wrenching aspects of the story. It's like a very dark THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN. The film doesn't lie to you.<br/><br/>Indeed, MILLION DOLLAR BABY does bring up questions of assisted suicide. And if you're the type of person who regularly entertains thoughts of taking your own life . . . this film will either turn you off to the idea completely or help to encourage you. It has the power of mercy written all over it."
"MartinHafer","10","2","5","3 August 2011"," This film made me think...
","The SPOILER from ""Million Dollar Baby"" is perhaps one of the least best-kept secrets in movie history. Most people know what the big twist is in the film, but in case you are one of the few who doesn't know what it is, I have marked this review as ""contains spoiler""--just in case! This film was directed by Clint Eastwood and he also directs--and he has an incredibly great track record over the past couple decades in these capacities--such as ""Unforgiven"" and ""Gran Torino""--so I knew I had to see this film. I am very glad I did...though I must admit it tore me up emotionally watching the movie. This is not a criticism, but actually a complement. That's right. Too often, movies have nothing to say and don't take any risks--and this film clearly takes risks and has a lot to say. So, when a film like this gets me crying, it's not at all a bad thing.<br/><br/>The first 2/3 of the film is a boxing film. Yes, it's well-acted with Hillary Swank, Morgan Freeman and Eastwood at their best. But, it's still only a boxing film--a feel-good boxing movie. However, the up and coming boxer (Swank) is unexpectedly paralyzed in the ring-and from then on the film really is at its best and darkest. It asks the poignant questions ""is assisted suicide okay?"" and ""do we have an innate right to die?""--especially in cases where there is no apparent quality of life. It's an important moral and ethical question that most people avoid and films almost never address--and I am glad they created a scenario where you feel very torn. It's hard to just categorically say that taking a life in such a situation is immoral--and this moral ambiguity made the film for me. Because of this, unlike most film, it has staying power. I can imagine that thousands or millions of viewers had their beliefs challenged and many were spurred on by this film to have discussions with friends and loved ones about this debate. Few films will provoke you like ""Million Dollar Baby""--this, combined with a great script and great acting, make this one of the best films of the decade and I can easily see how it won the Best Picture Oscar.<br/><br/>By the way, it's not at all a huge criticism, but I felt that the fight scene with the spinal injury could have been handled a bit better. Having the opponent being even more vicious than Clubber Lang from ""Rocky III"" was a bit silly, as she would have been disqualified about 30 seconds into a real boxing match. It was a bit over the top. But, considering how perfect the film is otherwise, this should be overlooked...except for cinema freaks like myself!"

"SteakSalad_101","6","2","5","7 July 2007"," Rather overrated, but still a good film
","Every once and a while, and sometimes even more often than that, there comes a film that critics practically drool over. Erupting headlines shoot like geysers from The New York Times, Rotten Tomatoes, and IMDb. I get excited when there's a film like this, because I'm excited to see it and get my own opinions on it. Unfortunately, many times, I don't exactly like the film. For 2004, that film is Million Dollar Baby.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank plays Maggie Fitzgerald, a southern 31-year-old from Missouri who has come from a broken home, and has one dream: to win the title of a boxing championship. Clint Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, the acclaimed boxing manager. ""I don't train girls,"" is Dunn's immediate reflex once Maggie asks him to train her. Eventually, Dunn takes her as a trainee and eventually manages her boxing career, and the two of them begin an extremely strong, non-romantic emotional bond as Maggie advances towards her dream.<br/><br/>Of course, there's more complex elements to the story than that, but really, that's it in a nutshell. For some reason, I believe that the all-star cast (Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman) helped bring this mediocre film to it's blockbuster status, and also helped it go on to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Yes, you'll hear critics say it's ""Remarkable"" and ""The best film of the year"" but none of them will ever say ""Unique."" Quite simply, because, there is nothing original about this film at all. There are so many films about someone going after their dreams I've lost count, and frankly, most of them are better and less appreciated than Million Dollar Baby.<br/><br/>Of course, there are some huge highpoints this film has hit. One--Clint Eastwood really was the right choice for director. He did a superb job with the film, made it detailed without making it boring, and made it an easier film to watch without having to concentrate super-hard like you're taking the SATs in high school. Two--Paul Haggis's incredibly talented writing skills shine through like rays of sun through a thin white bed sheet in this film. It's not so much that the screenplay was original, funny, and creative like the Oscar-winning one of Little Miss Sunshine, but it was so extraordinarily well written and the dialogue is extremely realistic. Three--astounding performances by Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman (in my opinion, ALL of them worthy of Oscars) bring the film to its feet. Mixed with Paul Haggis's exquisitely written screenplay, it's almost like you're watching a documentary. And in no way is that a bad thing! Now we'll go back to the negative points for a bit. My least favourite thing about Million Dollar Baby is the ending. I can't really say much without ruining the film for you, but it was evident they were going for a very emotional and hard-hitting ending. Unfortunately, I didn't feel it. I get very emotional at sad films and am considered a rather emotional person, but the ending felt very rushed, overworked, and sloppily done. If they had spent another few weeks working on the ending, the ending alone would have made this film a classic.<br/><br/>Overall--don't get me wrong. This is a GOOD film. It's just very overrated, and in my opinion, isn't deserving of all people say it's cut out to be. And definitely not worthy of the Best Picture Oscar."
"jboothmillard","10","2","5","19 April 2006"," Million Dollar Baby
","The meaning of the title is more obvious in what is pretty much the ""second half"", and it might make you cry more than The Bridges of Madison County. Personally, I think Clint Eastwood deserved his Oscar and Golden Globe for Best Director much more than Unforgiven (even though that's great too), and it deserved Best Motion Picture of the Year as well. Basically Maggie Fitzgerald (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Hilary Swank) wants to become a professional female boxer, with the help of trainer and ex-manager Frankie Dunn (Eastwood, Oscar nominated for acting). Frank for a while refuses to train a girl, and only his sidekick Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Morgan Freeman) sees a good opportunity, but eventually Frank agrees to teach her the basics, just till she gets a proper manager. However, when a manager does come along, Frank sees that she is not remembering the techniques, and stays with her throughout all her fights. She starts well and continues, knocking many out in the first round, till she is taught to leave a knockout longer. Eevntually she reaches the bigger stadiums, and a after one or two fights, she faces the Billie 'The Blue Bear' (Lucia Rijker), the most aggressive fighter known to Frank, and she is pretty hard to beat. The unexpected (first time you see it) moment though is when Maggie turns with Billie looking finished, and Billie throws a final blow and Maggie lands on the resting corner chair, cracking her neck and permanently damaging her spine. This is where the film gets really emotional, as Maggie, kept alive 24 hours a day by breathing apparatus, and Frank struggling to cope with the fact that he was a little responsible for getting her to the ring. After a little while, Maggie does the unthinkable and wants Frank to kill her to end her pain (euthanasia). He refuses, and to try and do it herself she bites her tongue (twice), and Frank eventually decides to carry out her wish. Swank and Freeman perform worthy Oscar winning performances, Eastwood is great acting and directing, it is just essential viewing for the boxing, acting and emotional power. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Editing and Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score for Eastwood (!). Morgan Freeman was number 27, and Clint Eastwood number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was also number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Outstanding!"
"maxlebow","8","2","5","21 March 2006"," Just A Few Words
","This is a great film to see once. Acting by cast is always in the moment. Feelings evoked are operatic in scale, and humanely humble. Narration is authoritative, precise, and penetrating. The stories, by F.X. Toole, on which the film is based, richly reveal the true grit of human nature. The boxing is as good as that in Cinderella Man. That is good.<br/><br/>There three major characters in this film. Freeman, as Scrap, doubles as the narrator. Whenever he narrates, his voice brings authority, precision, and penetration to each and every word.<br/><br/>Eastwood, as Frankie, doubles as director, and writes much of the haunting score.<br/><br/>Swank, as Maggie, has to deal with a character not quite as finely-drawn as the heroine of Girl Fight, but she, like Eastwood, brings pathos to many scenes that require ""doing nothing, very well."" She reaches peaks of performance she aimed for in Boys Don't Cry. She brings authenticity to the role of Maggie, the poor girl struggling hard to overcome poverty.<br/><br/>They all earned Oscars for their work.<br/><br/>Some of the dialog in Million Dollar Baby is terse, telling, and subtly beautiful. For example, Scrap tells Frankie that people die every day thinking they never got their shot. It is a short speech, but worthy of the line of poetry about people leading lives of quiet desperation. It should remain in the living language for quite some time.<br/><br/>The film may suffer, however, from the rash decision by director Clint Eastwood, to shoot from what was essentially screen writer Paul Haggis' rough draft. On repeat viewing, some of the longer scenes that evoke true empathy the first time seem to drag. The whole work then becomes clunky and manipulative.<br/><br/>On the DVD, the bonus features are great!"

","""Million Dollar Baby"" is, quite simply, the worst movie in memory to win an Oscar for Best Picture. The movie only became interesting following Maggie's having been injured. The gym scenes are ludicrous. Clint Eastwood should be embarrassed for his putting such silly crud onto film. Maggie's been train for how long and she cannot hit a speed bag? And was Danger retarded? If so, the portrayal of someone who is retarded by Jay Baruchel was ridiculous, if not retarded in itself. Then, the gym tough guy gets his lights punched out by an old man, former fighter Morgan Freeman? What a joke. That would be akin to Joe Montana, at age 50, engineering the winning drive in the Super Bowl. It ain't gonna happen. Then, could the white trash family of Maggie have been anymore stereotypical? Screenplay writer Paul Haggis' work is, to me, a joke. During Maggie's title bout, she is repeatedly and flagrantly fouled by her opponent . . . yet the referee does nothing? What a joke! Even the gruff voices of Eastwood and Freeman characters are ripoffs of the trainer of Rocky, played by Burgess Merideth. And could the dialogue between Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) and the priest have been any more corny? While people have said, ""This is not a boxing movie"", it is a movie in which boxing was used as a vehicle for a message. The problem is, the boxing portion of the movie is horrendous. I am a huge fan of boxing. Given how Eastwood and Haggis portrayed boxing, they should have used cheerleading as a way of getting Maggie injured. That way, they could have used something they might have more easily understood. As it was, they made it abundantly clear that their understanding of boxing is abysmal, at best."

Characters wallowing in contrived dramas hardly elicit interest, let alone sympathy. As respected film critic Roger Ebert pointed out, ""Deep movie emotions for me usually come not when the characters are sad, but when they are good."" In ""Million Dollar Baby,"" the characters are more sad than good.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the film won awards for Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Director. This is not about the Academy paying tribute to a future film classic, it is about the Academy paying its last respects to its favorite 74-year-old cowboy. True enough, in the film's last moments, the Frankie character disappears.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is ""Rocky""(Progesterone version) meets ""Terms of Endearment"" (plus the narration cut-and pasted from ""The Shawshank Redemption""). How's that for cinematic schizophrenia?"
"Fong_Chun_Kin","7","2","5","23 March 2005"," A million dollar question
","Million Dollar Baby... a good film? Yes. Good enough to be the year's best picture? I have my doubts. Don't think it deserves the best picture Oscar, although the best director, actress and supporting actor awards were richly deserved.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood has always been an intense character, whether in his acting or in his film-making. He displays his vast directing experience and channels it out well through his own, as well as his co-stars' acting performances. Hilary Swank once again shows that she is in complete control and command of the tough characters she takes on, snagging another Oscar after Boys Don't Cry. The danger though is that she runs the risk of being typecast for such masculine roles and limits her versatility, thus restricting her from taking on other roles. To me, Morgan Freeman is the one who truly deserves his accolade. It's tough to find such a humble and well-respected actor in plastic Hollywood, and even tougher for him to put in such understated but highly influential and impressionable presence in every show he has been in. His superb touches in gems such as the Shawshank Redemption and Driving Miss Daisy alone more than makes up for the many crap films he has taken a part in.<br/><br/>So why is it that the film, with masterful directing and convincing performances from the actors, fail to stir up my emotions? I hope I have the answer, but even I'm stumped. It's just one of those movies that has almost everything, yet a vital 'something' is lacking and leaves you feeling not completely satisfied with it. Perhaps it's the way the show gradually ended... it could have taken a tad too long, which could have taken away much of the emotional impact it had intended to make.<br/><br/>Who should watch: Fans of superb acting and audiences with the patience to sit through lenghty and intense dialogue <br/><br/>Who shouldn't watch: Boxing fans, because there isn't really that much punching going on <br/><br/>Rating: 7.9"

","Let's just talk about the movie as a story and the characters as characters and forget what it's trying to teach us for a minute.<br/><br/>As a story, it sucks. The characters are unmotivated. The characters and events are not believable. Non-essential characters litter the screen.<br/><br/>Off the top of my head: - The movie's Jar Jar Binks character - the retarded kid who can't figure out how they get the ice in the bottle - if he were not in the movie it would be shorter and not lose any ""impact"" (such as it is). He's unessential to the story. Lose him.<br/><br/><ul><li>The German boxer who is widely known to cheat but hasn't been kicked out of professional boxing. This isn't WWF, it's supposed to be real boxing and yet this character is not in jail. Unbelievable.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The priest who, upon hearing Hilary wants to commit suicide, tells Clint he'll go to hell and walks away. No offer to visit her, provide counseling for her or Clint, etc. Unbelievable character.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Hilary has a very Catholic name (""Mary Margaret"") while her siblings all have hillbilly names. Her name is obviously Catholic so the movie can take a poke at the mores of the Catholic church without considering that there are few Catholic hillbillies in southern Missouri.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The constant, unending, never yielding voice over. If someone the caliber of Clint Eastwood can't tell a story through the actors' words and actions, and if actors the caliber of Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman can't tell us what they're thinking through their reactions and facial expressions, then none of these people are worth the price of my ticket, let alone an Oscar. And it necessitates that Morgan Freeman follow Clint to the hospital -- only required since he's narrating that part.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The alluded to, long-standing conflict between Clint and his daughter, which apparently exists only as a vehicle for the narration. Drop the conflict, the movie stays the same. If you can drop a character without changing the story, the character is unnecessary.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Hilary's character spends a few days in bed and decides to kill herself. Think about it: This is a woman who has sacrificed everything to achieve a goal. She's single-minded and determined. But she encounters just one set-back and boom! she gives up. Professional athletes just aren't like that. Consider even Christopher Reeve - he was just an actor and yet he fought for years to overcome the same injury and made a substantial recovery. Another unbelievable character.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The intensive care unit where you can shut off (not just disconnect from the patient, but reach over and SHUT OFF) a breathing machine and no alarms go off nor do nurses come running. Unbelievable.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The unbelievable ending where Clint kills someone and walks away and eats pie. No investigation, no consequences.</li></ul><br/><br/>This is the movie that refuses to die. It's too long. Within minutes of the incident in which Hilary Swank is injured, we get the picture. Bring it to an end. But there's like another hour of nothing after that. Kill somebody. Blow something up. Burn something down. End it.<br/><br/>One reviewer said most of the audience sat through the credits in order to get ahold of their emotions. When I saw it everyone just got up and left. My wife cries at just about everything in movies and she found nothing emotional in this one. As for my part, I was crying tears of joy that it was over. Finally.<br/><br/>Here's the kicker: The movie tries to change your mind about the idea of ""mercy killing"", but the fact that the goal-oriented, determined, all-sacrificing professional athlete star of the movie COMPLETELY GIVES UP sends this message: If you're pursuing a goal and you meet a setback, KILL YOURSELF.<br/><br/>If you liked this movie, you don't understand anything about how movies should be put together. You're focusing on the questionable moral implications and thinking that makes it ""deep"". Frankly, Sideways was deeper, and it was shallow. This is a horrible movie that serves only to reveal the deep liberal political and moral biases of the motion picture industry. They abandoned their status as professional story-tellers to award a movie based on their politics and religious views. Nobody who knows anything about storytelling could possibly give this movie an Oscar unless their political and religious feelings overwhelmed their common sense."
"criticalview","6","2","5","16 March 2005"," Overrated and over hyped, typical of Hollywood
","I heard so much hype about this movie with the Oscar and all I decided to see it against my better judgment about Hollywood's history of awarding bad movies top awards. Unfortunately, the movie, while entertaining and fairly acted, failed to impress me, not to mention live up to its hype. I continue to be puzzled by Hollywood's award giving standards.<br/><br/>The story is very typical and too simple. Hilary Swank is a highly motivated woman from a very trashy family with a very unlikely dream of becoming a female boxing champion. She seeks the help of a very skeptical trainer Frankie (Eastwood) who eventually believes in her and trains her. Of course she did not disappoint him and quickly rose to the top (way too quickly) to face the evil German boxer. They unnecessarily over demonized Swank's family and the German boxer, a cheap way to glorify and gain sympathy for the main characters. I never understood why Swank's character has such an unrealistic passion for boxing (very rare for a woman). The movie never really explored her motive other than the fact that her family was quite mean. The movie, while well directed, never developed into a true boxing story. It was like they were trying to remake Rocky, the female version of it, but failed to bring the realism and emotions of Rocky. I never really understood the point behind that movie. May be someone or some people are attempting to promote female boxing. Swank is a fine actress and she did a good job portraying a boxer despite her soft and feminine quality. Eastwood did not fit the part of a boxing trainer who is a loner with an odd relationship with Freeman that included a mixture of guilt and regrets. He was acting more like a cop than a true boxing trainer. Freeman's character, a very wise and calm washed out boxer, was typical of every Freeman role I've seen. I think his in good company with Eastwood, they both lack acting versatility. They are only good for one role. The movie never really took off and it almost ended as it started, except with fewer characters."
"Murchison21-1","Null","2","5","3 March 2005"," The Best Film of Eastwood's Long Career
","The first third of ""Million Dollar Baby"" plays out slow and indifferent. But through a series of poignant and insightful scenes midway through the film morphs into an emotional powerhouse. Traditionally, Eastwood was never able to construct great pieces of storytelling with great character acting. He only recently was able to assemble inspired pieces of narrative cinema with ""Blood Work"" and ""Mystic River"" but this film handily outshines them both. Pay attention to the back-story involving Eastwood's character's estranged relationship with his daughter and it amplifies the dramatic pull of his relationship with Swank's character. It's the best film Eastwood has ever been involved with. Ultimately, it's a must-see."

You would think, watching it, the film could be a straight, ""easy to digest"" story till the end, but it's not.<br/><br/>As to the technique of the movie - from my point of view, witch gathered my attention from the beginning - is that the sources of expressions are simple, I would say somewhat ""rough"", yet they are so reach in their meaning.

","I can only imagine that the film industry and its critics feel that Clint Eastwood only has a limited time left on this planet, and deserves one last rave review before he goes to meet that big 'gun-slinger' in the sky. Million Dollar Baby is all hype! The movie is slow moving and predictable lacking any sign of an intelligent story line. If you have ever been involved in the Boxing scene you will know that there are plenty of interesting avenues to travel down for a really good story line; looking for this avenue Clint lost his way and found himself in 'Jerry Springer-land'! Yep! This movie is that believable! The fight scenes in this picture were as bad has those we have witnessed in the 'Rocky' movies and Eastwoods fake 'gruff' voice helped continue the misleading stereo-type of Boxing trainers. The thing that separates Eastwood's movie from Stallone's (particulary the first of the Rocky series)is the lack of empathy the audience can share with the characters.<br/><br/>Finally, what was the moral of this story? Girls with fat mothers in trailers should Box?? I sat this movie out until it's 'drawn-out' end, hoping that a referee would step in and save me from further punishment.

"slokes","6","2","5","5 February 2005"," Rocky: The Debbie Downer Version
","""Million Dollar Baby"" is a lean, mean, fighting machine of a movie, pulling no punches and throwing no towels. It stars Clint Eastwood as a ringside ""cut man,"" Morgan Freeman as his gym manager buddy, and Hilary Swank as a struggling waitress who seeks glory in the sweet science.<br/><br/>I wish I could say I loved it. I think I liked it, because the acting is awesomely good and the story has its moments. It's a film with merit. But there are people in the world who like movies like this and ""Terms Of Endearment"" and ""Rocket Gibraltar"" because they like movies that make them feel. ""Million Dollar Baby"" made me feel, too, feel confused at what the dialogue was on screen in the latter part of the picture with all the sniffling in the theater.<br/><br/>Eastwood as a director has a definite style, one that complements his acting métier. Terse lines, acerbically delivered. Some laughs, preferably dry ones. Camera-work that tends to the dark and monochromatic. ""Million Dollar Baby"" as a story suits his direction well.<br/><br/>Eastwood as an actor has never let go the way he does here. He's awesome in several scenes, quietly breaking apart. He has to give it all he's got, though, because he's working opposite Hilary Swank, who just tears your heart out with those eyes, that big-toothed grin, and the way she delivers lines like ""You gotta do me a favor, boss."" There's a scene with her just sitting in a car, making eye contact with a little girl and her dog from across a gas pump, and that wordless scene is probably the best piece of acting in any film this year. Freeman is good, too, reading comic books and working on getting his friend to warm to the girl with the gloves.<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast is disappointingly one note. Swank's Maggie Fitzgerald has a trailer-trash family who wear their nastiness like tourist-trap T-shirts. No subtlety. There's a priest that glowers at Eastwood's Frankie Dunn and his wry questioning in such a way one wonders how he handles hearing confessions, and one nasty German boxing opponent who does everything short of don a swastika in the ring.<br/><br/>The story is kind of rote, too, all very montage and quickly edited to discourage deep thought. Just what does this boxer find in ""Boss"" Frankie to make her suddenly so powerful in the ring? I know, you say the power of love. But there has to be something more, and it's lightly explained.<br/><br/>So is the run for a boxing title, which is handled in a way that feels like Cliff Notes, with a series of one-punch knockouts from Fitzgerald that neither ring true nor set up the dramatic tension needed to propel the story past the rags-to-riches cliché. There's also some business with some characters around the gym, like a mentally retarded man who gets picked on, but it's so truncated with the focus on the Fitzgerald story it feels like the padding it no doubt is.<br/><br/>I think the main performances are so incredible, they carry the rest of the film with them. In time, though, people may not be as wowed with ""Million Dollar Baby"" as they are now.<br/><br/>""Million Dollar Baby"" is good, solid entertainment through the first two thirds, then takes a very challenging turn that probably cost it some admirers. It's very engaging, and then it tears you up, and you will carry the experience of seeing the film for a long time, longer than maybe you want to. You can't fault a film for making you sad, or for being manipulative. But I think the films that endure are the ones that don't forcefeed you with emotions the way you are fed them here."

","I have to say, that while this is a good movie, it could have been so much better. This is because of the little things. First of all, the voice-over narration. This is always a cheap way of moving the plot forward, and in this movie it's no less cheap. It's also very distracting. Do we need to hear Morgan Freeman narrate a story again? Didn't we already get that in Shawshank? At least in that movie he wasn't simply pointing out what we already knew.<br/><br/>Second, Clint Eastwood just really didn't act very well. Hilary Swank was very good, and deserves her Oscar nomination, but Clint and Morgan were just their typical selves, and didn't really show anything more than that.<br/><br/>The boxing scenes were fun, and they were compelling. But they didn't make up for the clichés that came later. It was a good movie, but not Oscar material."

""Rocky"" and ""Chariots of Fire"" were two not-particularly-special films that won Best Picture, and ""Million Dollar Baby"" is another.<br/><br/>If it hadn't won, I wouldn't have bothered to see it. The premise did not sound particularly interesting. It does speak well for Eastwood's effort that the movie held my attention even though I was prepared not to like it. It's a serious effort, but the more I thought about it, the less impressed I was.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I already knew the ending, so the last 30 - 35 minutes of the movie had a kind of grinding inevitability about them. I can't really judge the ending fairly because of the spoiler, but half an hour seemed a bit long to lead up to the climax.<br/><br/>Ultimately the movie reminded me of another wildly overpraised story, ""Love Story."" Remember ""What do say about a girl who died?"" If you ever saw that flick, you know what I'm talking about. While ""Million Dollar Baby"" tries hard to be serious, it's really just a tear-jerker. Man finds girl, bonds with her against his initial reluctance, and has his heart broken. There's a touch of ambiguity, because we never learn exactly what becomes of Frank, but it's still a weeper.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman, who won the Best Supporting Actor award, is good as always, but his character is a stereotype. Freeman has done more significant work elsewhere. Eastwood plays essentially the same ultra-laid-back character he's portrayed in his last few films. Hilary Swank probably deserved his Oscar, because she's the only performer who's playing a character that hasn't been shown on screen a few hundred times.<br/><br/>Her ogre-ish family are also stereotypes (the acting is good, but the characterizations are clichéd). Also we don't get much back story from her --- coming from a family like that, how did she turn out to be such a wonderful person?

How often you see a boxing ring being on top and still its Principal manager (Freeman) mopping floors and toilets? My God! I am not religious at all but I liked the fantasies of the ""Passion"" better than the realism and ugly emotionalism of this movie. And THIS got the Oscar for the Best Movie?! Swank, Eastwood and Freeman were all very good but the entire plot was so weak, predictable and clichéd.<br/><br/>And those of us disgusted by junk mails and commercials are not going to appreciate over exposure of ""Apprentice"" on city buses and other overly exposed insignias on sporting goods.<br/><br/>Tut. Tut. Tut.<br/><br/>Okay, not the worst movie I have seen, but not better than 6 stars out of 10 for sure."

","I don't need an uplifting ""Hollywood"" ending. I'll take whatever ending a director wants to give as long as it works with the story. If the ending is bleak, I'll take it, as long as it works with the rest of the story. I really like Fat City. I really like The Last Detail. I really like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. I really like Donnie Darko. All these had protagonists that died or declined at the end. <br/><br/>Should Eastwood be praised because he was ""brave"" enough to give us a sympathetic character, build her up, and then kill her? Is this movie worthy of a best picture Oscar? I guess in the world of Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences members, it is worthy. But once you get past the contrived emotional manipulation, the thoughtful and rich Morgan Freeman narration, the ""sparse"" performance of Clint Eastwood, the ""immense feeling and grace"" with which Freeman, Eastwood, and Swank played their characters, and the ""tragic poetry"" of this film, what do you have left???<br/><br/>I'm still trying to figure that out. <br/><br/>There are 117 links to external reviews on IMDb.com, and as far as I can tell by reading many of them, professional movie critics don't get it either. Sure most of them praise the film and gush over the ""rugged, haunting beauty"" of this movie. But I can't find a positive review that examines or spells out just what exactly makes this a GREAT movie: <br/><br/>""... is a measured movie, deeply involving us in its characters and their problems..."" <br/><br/>""... is a great film, but this one finds the simplicity and directness of classical storytelling..."" <br/><br/>""... transcends the rules of the genre and shows us, with an unvarnished simplicity, how human beings struggle to come to terms with the unthinkable.""<br/><br/>Most positive reviews written about this film mention the return to ""classical"" Hollywood storytelling, or some such nonsense. They spend a good paragraph or so speaking about Clint Eastwood's career. They speak to almost nothing that has to do with why this is a GREAT movie. WHAT MAKES IT WORTHY?<br/><br/>I wouldn't say that Million Dollar Baby is a poorly made, poorly acted movie.

","I found the film extremely disappointing, my expectations having been fuelled by all the hype surrounding its release. I find it difficult to understand why it has received any awards, when looking beyond a superficial emotional level. This is a film about values and relationships and as such it fails badly. The characters should have been important and they are merely stereo-types uttering inane, over-sentimental clichés. The story line is predictable and telegraphed in advance in case we miss anything. There is no subtlety and we are left wanting to know more about important background issues that would have given the characters some depth. The actors are going through the motions of previous roles; there is nothing new in any of the performances. I will take the time to read the story upon which the film is based and it may be that the source material is the weak spot, in which case it has been poorly adapted and the result is a film that is sadly lacking in the qualities to raise it to the levels at which it is being pitched. I feel the industry should be ashamed to be heaping accolades on such a shabby, ponderous bathos-ridden work that clearly fails to hit the mark."
"HulkVader","6","2","6","7 February 2005"," Good, but not great film
","Million Dollar Baby is getting a lot of press, and not completely undeservedly so. It's certainly not a mainstream film, perhaps even more distressing than Closer. As one would expect, the movie is brilliantly acted and directed with much skill. Once again watching Eastwood and Freeman play off of one another is a treat, and Hilary Swank excels as well. Million Dollar Baby is, throughout most of the film, understated. The poverty level of the bulk of the characters is done so with subtlety, though it cannot be ignored. The touch of Freeman's narration being a letter to Eastwood's daughter is well done.<br/><br/>The most glaring issue with the film is the reality of the fight scenes and, particularly, the illegal shots by the character named ""Blue"". As many likely know, numerous illegal tactics may be employed in small club fights. However, the tactics that Blue employed were supposed to be taking place in sanctioned, championship level matches. That is terribly unrealistic. World championship sanctioned bouts are held under a microscope. Aside from the referee there are judges at ringside and officials from the boxing commission. Blue would have long been disqualified and/or suspended for her continued illegal actions. A shot like the one she threw at Swank's character going unrecognized in a championship level bout would be not unlike had the BC ignored Tyson biting off Holyfield's ear. Aside from that, as skilled a manager as Eastwood's character was supposed to be and having already acknowledged Blue's many illegal tactics, I imagine he'd have advised his fighter, ""This is a cheap shot artist, you don't take your eyes off of her until her ass is sitting on that stool!"" <br/><br/>Those flaws are not meant to detract from the telling of a story, however. The ending of the film and Maggie's eventual death are a bit overdrawn. Nonetheless, the story is well told and the focus of the relationship between Eastwood and Swank is far from lost. All in all, this is a good film. 6/10."

","I really like this Clint Eastwood film.

This is a gutsy film, gritty in emotions. It can be a tear-jerker yet not at all sentimental. It tells it like it is - the down to earth hard living of boxing (the theme being a 'crutch'), while the crux of the story concentrates on three main characters (each with haunting past): Eastwood as Frank the weathered boxing trainer, Hilary Swank as Maggie the enthusiastic spark in this whirl of boxing energy, and Morgan Freeman as ""Scrap"" - besides being the voice-over narrator, provided the bridging catalyst as the cool and caring mainstay to both Frank and Maggie. There are sprinkles of wit and humor here and there - that's how life is: making up of laughter and smiles occasionally in the midst of challenges and struggles, joys and disappointments, hesitation and reinforcement of faith, plucking up courage to take that risk, and mishaps nevertheless happen. There is ""whose life is it anyway"" dilemma - the confrontation of death, to be or not to be."

This movie sends out a big message to me which is 'pursue what you love in life to the best you can'. <br/><br/>The movie makes my cry from the sheer power in Maggie's character. Sure she's strong physically, but her willpower and passion is where she is a knockout. Hillary Swank outshines any performance i've ever seen in acting in this movie and every scene involving her is powerful. I remember (after seeing this movie) watching most movies she's acted in and seeing her supreme acting skills shine through in all roles. Clint Eastwood is also top notch as Frankie, and the bond that develops between fighter and trainer is so well done and tasteful. <br/><br/>Sure there are some extreme moments a little overdone at times like the absurd sheer ignorance of her family or the rediculous fighter she ends up competing with for the title. However, these extreme moments only make it more emotional and make you feel more strongly with the two main characters who are just trying to do a little good in the world.<br/><br/>I come out of the movie with Maggie and Frankie feeling as role models and people to look up to in rough times. Make the most of your life whilst you have it. Prove to yourself you've got what it takes in whatever you do! <br/><br/>This movie is almost in my heart as a true great!"

"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","2","2 February 2016"," Possibly Clint's best film as a director
","""Million Dollar Baby"", the Best Picture Oscar winner for 2004, was the second of Clint Eastwood's directorial efforts to claim that prize, the first being ""Unforgiven"". Here, the story concerns a raw but determined female boxer (Hilary Swank) who seeks the aid of a grizzled trainer (Eastwood) in her quest to become a professional.<br/><br/>At first glance, ""Million Dollar Baby"" appears to conform to the standard template for an underdog sports movie; not that there's anything wrong with that. In fact, within those parameters, the movie holds its own against the classics of the genre. However, what elevates the movie to another level is the dramatic heft of the unexpected final act. I'm reluctant to divulge any details about the territory that the movie finds itself in but I can say that the story is ultimately satisfying on multiple levels.<br/><br/>As compelling as the story turns out to be, the cast is just as good. Living legends Clint Eastwood & Morgan Freeman shared the screen once again here, reuniting the duo that made ""Unforgiven"" so memorable. They were joined by Oscar winner Hilary Swank, soon to nab another (well deserved) statuette for her work here. Speaking of Oscars, Morgan Freeman finally managed to win one for his wonderfully understated performance and distinctive narration. The movie also offers early glimpses of Jay Baruchel, Anthony Mackie & Michael Peña, not to mention a memorable turn from the always dependable Margo Martindale.<br/><br/>Eastwood's direction isn't too flashy but that suits the movie just fine. The attractive cinematography also supports the film's realistic look. Yet another key piece in the puzzle is the restrained yet affecting score, surprisingly penned by Eastwood himself.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Million Dollar Baby"" was a deserving Best Picture Oscar winner that still endures today as a modern classic. Not just a sports movie, the story defies expectations and successfully tackles some tricky subject matter. My only reservation is that the movie has an old-fashioned feel from time to time but that's really part of Eastwood's style and not worth dwelling on considering all of the things that the movie excels at."

"classicsoncall","10","1","2","28 July 2012"," ""Girlie, tough ain't enough.""
","If there's a film that can rightly be called a masterpiece, this would be one. The acting, directing, cinematography, story telling, pacing - it's all superb with a terrific cast that grabs you from the opening moments and weaves it's magic right through to it's tearful conclusion. I'm coming to the realization that Eastwood as a director is now a master of the craft. ""Mystic River"" and ""Gran Torino"" are thoughtful and provocative films in their own right, and ""Million Dollar Baby"" is right up there with them as virtual capstones to a stellar Hollywood career. A world, no, an entire universe away from the uncredited actor who made his movie debut in ""Revenge of the Creature"" way back in 1955.<br/><br/>What's extraordinary here is that Eastwood could have taken the easy way out and filmed a female 'Rocky' picture, but that would have been way too clichéd. Instead, his protégé shows up destitute and pitiful, but with a desire to make something of herself with the only God given talent she's able to come to terms with. Hillary Swank is brilliant in the role of Maggie Fitzgerald, and if she never takes on another role, this Oscar winning performance would by itself recommend her as one of the premiere actresses of her day.<br/><br/>What one doesn't expect from the picture going in is the moral dilemma posed by Maggie's condition as a result of her match with Billie The Blue Bear (Lucia Rijker). This one forces you to confront your feelings about the ethical consequences of assisted suicide and doesn't let you off the hook. Frankie Dunn's (Eastwood) relationship with his parish priest paves the way throughout the story for a personal choice that will weigh on him for the rest of his days. As a fighter all his life, Frankie faces a confrontation that he'll have to meet head on, and does so out of loyalty to a person who may have started out as a nuisance, but wound up a devoted student and ultimately a friend.<br/><br/>I don't go out on a limb with very many top ratings on this board, but this one's a solid '10' with me. I've seen it three times now and it gets better and more powerful with each viewing. Though the general theme might recommend it as a boxing film, this one transcends the genre and puts it in a category all it's own. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is worth a million."

","Saw ""Million Dollar Baby"" in Manhattan last night. Clint Eastwood, one of the all-time most famous actors -- and directors -- has more than enough money where he could choose to pull the strings on block-buster, mindless action pictures, ala Jerry Bruckheimer, or comic books. Or, hell, in his twilight years he could just lay back and enjoy his millions. But no. He has chosen instead to make quieter, lower-budget, heart-felt, character driven films like ""The Unforgiven"" ""True Crime"" ""Mystic River"" and now Million Dollar Baby. And the world is a better place for it. Eastwood uses his multiple talents to make films that have something valuable to say. In the emotionally powerful, Million Dollar Baby, he tells an allegorical tale of boxing to subtly express themes of hope, redemption, sacrifice, persistence, and belief in one's self. The movie emphasizes that failure is a more honorable and personally fulfilling trait than never having tried, while also frowning upon laziness and leeching off others. But see the movie and judge for yourself. I personally consider great films as the ones where I leave the theater with a better understanding of human nature, or a desire to improve the world by even a little bit. Eastwood's latest more than succeeds on those counts."

Often in life we don't know why people act the way they do---we just speculate. Perhaps the movie would have lost something if we were given an answer.

","""Million Dollar Baby"" marks Clint Eastwood's 41st film as a leading star, 25th film as a filmmaker, 19th film as a producer, and - notably, second film as composer. Not that it matters, but I'm just stating this to assert the fact that Mr. Eastwood is truly one of the most versatile faces in the history of movies. Be it an action icon, call him an actor, a filmmaker or a musician, Eastwood has done it all, and in this film, does it all.<br/><br/>I was 13 when this film came out, and I didn't see it upon it's release in the cinemas. Now, after having finally watching the full film, I now regret that decision.<br/><br/>The story of a crusty boxing trainer and the woman who wouldn't give up her dream might sound right at home with the usual Hollywood sports film tropes, but Eastwood's subtle yet strong direction grounds the film into reality and plausibility. Also, it isn't exactly about boxing, although that is one of it's stronger themes - it is really about three people whose lives revolve around this sport - one who's good at it, one who really wants to be in it, and one who used to be in it. What were the Hollywood marketing department thinking when they were marketing this movie as some sort of female ""Rocky""? Seriously. Just watch the trailer. And never trust it.<br/><br/>The story is told in a way that doesn't glorify it, nor underscores it. It's that nice balance that makes it very engaging to watch. The story takes a deep dark turn at the last third of the movie, which makes it harrowing and heart-wrenching to watch. I'll be honest. I nearly cried. And I rarely cry in movies. The turn of events could've been handled in an uninspired or overdone way but Eastwood is smart. He tells it as it is - without excess fat or meat. The result - the emotional effect hit me hard.<br/><br/>The performances of all three main actors are superb, with Morgan Freeman as the gentle caretaker of the gym whose personality will make anyone easy to warm up to, yet there's a somewhat sombre aura emitting from him - made obvious in his narration. Hilary Swank is excellent here in a homely, humbled and confident performance as Maggie the determined fighter who would never give up her passion and her dreams - no matter what life throws at her - and no matter the cost. Her character is the central focus of the movie - but Swank does not over or under-act, she embodies the simplicity of the character perfectly and shines in the really subtle moments (Eastwood's masterful direction helped here). However, as Eastwood the actor I honestly have to say that this is the best acting performance of Eastwood. And I have seen both ""Unforgiven"" and ""Gran Torino"". Eastwood here is terrific, he has that trademark grizzled personality during the first half with shades of darkness here and there, but during the duration of the film he slowly opens up to the complex and tormented man inside, until the last half of the film where Eastwood gives a revelation of a performance, channeling his character's demons from the past to create a very emotionally complex character. Eastwood was honestly robbed of the Oscar for Best Actor that night, not that that stopped him from winning the Best Director one, but hey. Paul Haggis (who would later win the Best Picture Oscar for ""Crash"" the next year) wrote the screenplay with raw honesty, so that the dialog sounds natural and earnest, and not just actors reciting or improvising lines.<br/><br/>Eastwood the composer scores a very beautiful, simple and yet haunting music score that is not overblown, but gets the job done very effectively - with help from his longtime conductor Lennie Niehaus. His theme for the movie ""Blue Morgan"" is especially very beautiful and emotional. Tom Stern's cinematography is also masterful - loved the way that Stern casts dark shadows over the character's nearly rim-lit faces giving them an extra edge in character (and there are a lot of dark scenes). The fight scenes are quite engaging but they're almost nothing new like in any other boxing movie, although Lucia Rijker's presence as ""The Blue Bear"" is quite unnerving.<br/><br/>The subtler moments I really admire - Scrap's conversation with Maggie in the bar; Maggie's monstrously evil white trash family; Frankie's letters to his estranged daughter returned unopened every time; Frankie's message to Maggie - always protect yourself; and finally the phrase ""mo chuishle"" (spelled incorrectly in the film - on purpose I think) - coupled with Eastwood's touch, give the film more power and credibility than it's supposed to.<br/><br/>It's the simpler moments that makes a good movie great, and ""Million Dollar Baby"" proves it tenfold. Had it fall under the hands of a lesser or more stylized filmmaker, it would've been melodramatic or cheesy. Eastwood has been in the business for more than half a century. He really knows what he is doing. And he tells it as it is, and doesn't hold back any punches. This film is indeed the best film of 2004 because it has it all - a great inspiring and yet harrowing story, great cast giving great performances, and brilliant direction from a true master. Is ""Million Dollar Baby"" a masterpiece? Maybe, but it's definitely one of Eastwood's finest films - his best since ""Unforgiven"". One of the Oscar- winning films that I say truly deserve every award it won - and it should've won more."

So as I was laying in bed feeling sorry for myself, I turned this movie on just as it was starting, and I was enthralled for the next three hours.<br/><br/>I've seen quite a few Eastwood flicks over the last several years, and I loved Gran Turino, his most recent movie. But this movie tops them all. First of all, Eastwood is outstanding. He was nominated for best actor by the Oscars the year this came out, and it's easy to see why. He's the perfect boxing trainer. He channels a little bit of Mick, but he comes across as a heck of a lot less cartoonish. But the multiple directions that he takes the character, from his estrangement with his daughter to the protecting of Swank's character (maybe he saw her as a replacement for his daughter) were great.<br/><br/>The only person that upstaged Eastwood, however, was Hillary Swank. I hadn't taken Swank seriously as an actress for several years since her Beverly Hills 90210 days. She seemed like she was set for TV from the get-go. But in the last few years, she's acted in two movies that have really changed my opinion of her acting abilities. This movie is the first one, obviously, and the second was Freedom Writers, which she also directed. She was outstanding in both, but this movie set the bar extremely high. The thing is that she's so believable as a boxer, but there are so many other facets to her performance. Anybody that's grown up in a small town and escaped could tell you what it's like to try to reconnect to a family that doesn't understand you anymore, and she portrays that so well on the screen. It's heartbreaking. Swank took an Oscar for best actress from this movie (her second), and there is a lot of dispute as to whether it was earned, as always. Coincidentally, this was also the second time that she beat out Annette Benning for best actress. Personally, I thought her performance was Oscar-worthy.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman was playing Red again from Shawkshank Redemption, but this time he was nominated and won an Oscar for a supporting role, rather than losing best actor in a leading role as in Shawshank. He was typical Freeman. He's the glue that holds things together.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was a real eye-opener. The main theme ""Always Protect Yourself"" is so true in all walks of life, and it's a truth that a lot of us have to discover the hard way, I suppose."
"eonbluedan-1","10","1","2","2 January 2011"," Perfect
","Clint Eastwood is simply a master, and of all his directorial achievements, this for me is the sweetest of the bunch. A film adapted from a short story and fleshed out to be something so much more incredible, and which blindsided everybody as a great deal more than ""just another sports movie"". The story is told with so much cinematic swagger it should be illegal; it is perfectly paced, with not a frame wasted.<br/><br/>Clint and Morgan Freeman work as well as two masters should, to the extent that you could watch every scene with just them and simply enjoy the banter of the characters they create. Hilary Swank impresses, and together with ""Boys Don't Cry"", this performance shows that when given the chance, she can go toe-to-toe with the best and stand her ground.<br/><br/>The whole thing is beautifully played out; it is intelligent, surprisingly emotional, and finds its way into your heart. Literally a perfect film."
"KnightsofNi11","8","1","2","23 December 2010"," A very sincere drama
","So many years down the line, Clint Eastwood has proved that he still has what it takes to be a great actor, as well as director. Million Dollar Baby is one of his finest efforts, so much so that he took home the best director and best picture Oscars for the film. The film is about fictional female boxer, Maggie Fitzgerald, who wants nothing more than to make it to the top and to be the best. To do so, she convinces hard boiled Frankie Dunn to train her. The two become like father and daughter as Maggie becomes better and better. It is a very sincere and dramatic movie. It is not light hearted by any means and is successful at being serious without being pretentious. It is a very good film.<br/><br/>In one sentence this film is a dramatic character study. It is very emotional but also very smart. The story is very rich with sincere dialouge to drive it. The characters are all real for the most part. There is some melodrama, but it is always fitting for the morose dramatic tone of the film. The film is definitely not a happy one. It can be uplifting in some respects, but overall it is very depressing, but very real. It doesn't provide all the satisfaction we want in a happy ending. It doesn't try to brighten things up just to give us some sort of cathartic relief. It develops very emotionally and with utmost sincerity. It's rough but it's worth it.<br/><br/>The film is very well driven by great characters played by a very high quality cast. Clint Eastwood is at his emotionally charged best here. He plays the detached Frankie Dunn who is weary about training a girl at first, but grows to love her like a daughter. Their relationship is beautiful and so compelling. Hilary Swank does a fantastic job as Maggie. Her and Eastwood have a lot of chemistry and it keeps the film at a highly emotional level. Morgan Freeman plays the washed up ex-boxer Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris and his performance as well as the character himself is amazing. He plays this tragic role with such focus and sincerity. He is a sad character and it so easy to love Morgan Freeman that we feel a lot of empathy for his character as he develops. Then of course there is one final reveal in the last line of the film that rounds out his character so perfectly and, while not resolving anything, still provides some sort of hope in the bleak reality the characters find themselves in at the end of this film.<br/><br/>I can understand why some people wouldn't like this film. It can seem unrealistic and over-dramatic at times, but in the big picture, it is all fitting. The film doesn't try to be anything more than the dramatic piece of cinema it is. It still provides a great story with emotionally compelling characters. The only problem I had with the film was one storyline point that was left completely unresolved by the end of the film. I would have to give away too much to explain it, but it is something that should have at least been mentioned. Other than that I found this film to be a very sincere piece of dramatic cinema that was very well made in every aspect."

","I don't know how to start this review and I am not sure what to say. I have written reviews on other great movies. My review for The Shawshank Redemption poured out as smooth as heavy cream. Million Dollar Baby is as good as The Shawshank Redemption which I have watched over and over again, and is, in my opinion, the best movies ever made.<br/><br/>But I will never be able to watch Million Dollar Baby over and over again. I may watch it once every 10 years are so to reaffirm it's brilliance, it's depth and it's gut wrenching impact. I am sure I have never seen before or since such an emotionally powerful film. I avoid reading about films before I see them. I don't want to taint my first impression. I had heard it was very good and how could I go wrong with Eastwood, Swank and Freerman.<br/><br/>As I watched it, I was thinking it was better than Rocky, better than many many movies I had seen. I was especially impressed with Eastwood and thought it was one of the best performance I had ever seen by him - maybe the best.<br/><br/>Then I got to what you might call Act III. Hillary Swant's performance was brilliant: a complete fulfillment of all her potential. Clint Eastwood's performance was transcendent. It was greater than any performance I had seen by any other actor in film or theater. It was emotionally devastating. His actions reflected the greatest act of love I had ever come across in film, theater or fiction. What sacrifice could you make for love - even threaten your immortal soul and destroy your mortal heart? It is greater than The Shawshank Redemption but so much harder to watch. Greek or Shakespearian tragedy has nothing to equal it. Maybe nothing ever will."
"ritabaasch","8","1","2","2 February 2009"," A million dollar effort
","I saw two Clint Eastwood movies. Gran Torino at the theater and MILLION DOLLAR BABY on DVD. I already talked about how much I liked Gran Torino.<br/><br/>In MILLION DOLLAR BABY, writers F.X. Toole and Paul Haggis have delivered a hard hitting and powerful screenplay. It is a very touching subject matter that constantly pulls at your heart strings.<br/><br/>And it can only do so if it were directed with great sensitivity. Eastwood again approaches his material meticulously and methodically, like a true artist. <br/><br/>His actors Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman and Eastwood himself, are exceptional in this movie. Swank deserves all of the accolades that she has gotten and more. I found her totally believable. Freeman has proved that he never hits a false note whenever he is acting on the screen. The supporting cast is pretty good also."

The movie not really about boxing but about  love, devotion and surrender parting; death! But, without death can  there be life? Why do we have one anyway, a life, and what's it all  about? It the case of this movie, to hear your named chanted by the  crowd, only to lose it all in a flash! 'What's it all about, Alfie?'  It's for you to find out--why else be conscious? Without death, life  would have no meaning! Thank you 'Clint baby' (Haggis the writer) for  making me sob at the end when 'Frankie' whispers in her ear the Gaelic  chant (he had stitched on her robe: 'Mo Chúisle'): 'My darling, my  blood!' (literally 'my pulse'). This before pulling the plug to end her  life! I judge movies by what they make me feel, and this one is a  'masterpiece!' Congratulations Mr. Eastwood, for bringing this to life,  one of the most emotional endings to any film I can remember! 'The  Eddie Duchin Story,' similar! But, you're way too young to remember!"

"polar24","10","1","2","5 January 2007"," A Masterpiece
","Masterpiece. That was the M word that Roger Ebert used to describe this superlative piece of cinema is his much lauded 2004 review. Whether or not you agree with his integrity as film critic, it remains an outstanding film. Since then, it went on to win the much deserved Academy Award for best picture and director in a time when the awards are losing much of their credibility.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood has structured a film that plays straight to the heart. It is honest, simple and thoughtful film-making, The story is tremendously moving, beautiful to watch, and to be drawn into the world of long-lost, fallen, and overdue fighters.<br/><br/>Written by Paul Haggis, who achieved success with Crash in the following year, it tells the tale of Maggie (Swank) who intends to make it in the often misunderstood world of female boxing. She has come from the wrong side of the trailer park, with only one aspiration in life - to box. Eastwood has once again paired up with Freeman, last seen together in their successful outing in Unforgiven. Along with Swank, the 3 main principals all manage career best performances thanks to Haggis' strong script and Eastwood's perceptive direction.<br/><br/>Eastwood's Frankie Dunn is a conflicted man passed over by dreams, accomplishments and failures both personally and professionally. He seeks solace from God but in issues of boxing, he's a strict atheist. His daughter and apprentice-boxer have both abandoned him; he almost lost Eddie in a fight. Over prudently, he refuses to make the same mistake again. So he spends his days managing the rejects trying to box their way out of their miserable lives. He is played with such regret and loss by Eastwood which display the fragility of a man who achieved so much but at a great personal loss.<br/><br/>Eddie ""Scrap"" Dupris (Freeman with glass eye) narrates the film, serves as consciousness to Eastwood, and the observer in the gym and boxing ring to the viewer. His reputation as a former boxer as coached by Frankie is demonstrated through in gruff undertones, masked by a dogged, scar-faced demeanor. Freeman is a remainder of Frankie's bygone days, his success in the ring and as a painful memory of the ugly side of boxing. His life now amounts to nothing more at the gym than cleaning up the spit, beating up bullies and retiring to HBO in the gym where his dreams were almost realised.<br/><br/>Swank provides the turning point for the two men that ultimately brings them to desperate measures in the film's final act. She is for Frankie, the daughter he wishes he had; for Scrap, the opportunity to prove himself as a real fighter. With Frankie's coaching, she makes into the world of professional boxing, and more importantly, she has the opportunity to live her dream. Swank inhibits the role. As her own life story mirrors that of Maggie, she connects with her on all levels. She is defiant, rough, inspiring and raw. The challenges ahead of her are overwhelming in their adversity. But in her heartbreaking delivery, she knocks them out of the park.<br/><br/>The script by Haggis is heartfelt, honest and true. We smell the sweat and blood in a rawness that is both pungent and violent. Broken bones and bloody noses are part of road to victory. The paradoxical relationship between boxing an life is convincing and saddening.<br/><br/>The true star of the film is Eastwood's direction. He presents a story that is hopeful and inspiring but never panders to sentiment or pity. The gym is shot with the faded renaissance of the glory days; the boxing scenes are filmed with humour, energy and a sense of danger. The lighting is also quite amazing; giving us just what we require, allowing the viewer to formulate their own shapes. Sharp flashes of light and darkness suggest hope, mystery, danger, sadness and spirit.<br/><br/>Each turn of the story is a shot in the arm, a blow to the stomach. Things don't always go as planned but hopefully, we can experience a dream for just a few moments.A refreshing take on the rags-to-riches sporting story, it really transcends that genre. This film is about how we can achieve that dream worth fighting for, and go to all lengths to make it.A stunning film that shows us that even though there are many ways to tell a story; we can still be moved in such powerful ways."

","This is a very touching human drama movie, with the best director, best actors, and the best story.<br/><br/>""Million Dollar Baby"" directed by Clint Eastwood was released in 2004, and received four Oscars that year. This is a breathtaking human drama about a thirty-one year old Maggie (Hilary Swank) and a boxing trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood.) <br/><br/>Maggie a waiter from the poor and dysfunctional family decides to make a change in her life. She asks the experienced boxing trainer Frankie to be her coach and manager. Frankie refuses Maggie at first, but with the help form Frankie's old partner Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman), Maggie walks in to his gym and starts training. <br/><br/>Maggie is a very determined hard worker and wins 12 matched on a row by KO. Then she starts receiving offers for bigger matches, and Frankie makes a decision to make her go for the championship match against ""Blue Bear"" Billy in Las Vegas. She enters the ring with confidence, but she and Frankie did not know the life waiting for them after this game. <br/><br/>Hilary Swank went for a three months training to prepare for this role, and plays very powerful and emotional role. It is certainly a magnificent performance, and she won her second Oscar for this role, after winning her first one for ""Boys Don't Cry."" Morgan Freeman also plays a wonderful role as Frankie's partner, very quite but has a strong presence. He won his first Oscar for his role, after being nominated four times in the past.<br/><br/>I will give this movie ten out of ten, and recommend it to anyone over 13 years of age. Especially to those who are in a relationship or having trouble with family members. This is not just a simple boxing film, but it makes you think about life and death. This movie has a twist in the end, so do not go to the bathroom in the last 20 minutes. Be prepared, it is going to leave you speechless."

But at the end the viewer is bound to feel contented with the effect that it leaves on the mind. This will leave an indelible mark in the history of Hollywood films.

","I steered clear after this movie even when it won best picture. I suppose I wasn't interested in watching a film about female boxer just as Eastwood's character wasn't interested in training one. That said, I finally watched it. The movie is simply captivating. Each character is equally interesting. Watching Freeman and Eastwood interact is brilliant. The story itself is about a desperate, white trash, waitress, (Swank) who dedicates her life to a sport that doesn't necessarily want her. Eastwood is a jaded boxing coach with a deep past. And Freeman plays a long retired boxer who was never able to make good with his big chance. It's a dark film, and the cinematography is appropriate to that. The only issue I had is that the antagonists are simply too easy to hate. They are not complicated enough. However, considering everything else in is to its advantage i rate this one 10/10."

It is a very inspirational movie because of all these aspects. Maggie (Swank) shows that no matter what anyone says if you work you'll achieve.<br/><br/>This personally motivated me to work a lot harder in my training. ""Play like your in first, train like your in second."" Even though Maggie was able to knock these girls out within 5 seconds of the first round she never quit training and practising.

And after seeing Mystic River, I wanted to see Million Dollars Baby cause Clint Eastwood is an incredible director that brings the actors in his movies in good light. I had only seen Hilary Swank in Boys don't cry so I didn't knew much about her but she just blew me away. They way she talked and living herself into that part were just amazing. I believed her. She's brilliant for being so young. And giving her an Oscar was the right thing to do. Also, Morgan Freeman. He's so ordinary in that movie and brilliant. You just wanna feel sorry for him for being so alone in the movie. I mean living in the gym? Who wants that? The story is gripping and you just wanna comfort them all. Everything in that movie is so human. It's all about making it through the day no matter how hard that is. And sometimes, you just want it all to take it all in the end but you just need a little help to make that happen. It's all about that. It makes you think what would I've done if I was him or her."
"donhaskell","10","1","2","4 June 2006"," An inside look to a well read story!
","This film is made ever so much better by the fact that; for the most part, it is narrated by the attractively engrossing bitter truth that Morgan Freeman brings to everything he reads aloud. If you've seen the film 'The Shawshank Redemption', and enjoyed the narration within, you'll once again find the same comforting friend tell you another story. <br/><br/>Hilary Swank, (as Maggie Fitzgerald), gives the performance of her career, as a woman not quite middle aged, but not exactly young either, chasing a dream of her youth that she just can't let go of. Clint Eastwood's, (Frankie Dunn), portrayal of a burnt-out & cantankerous boxer/trainer character, is so believable, it makes you feel as if you'd be anxious to try to please him, were you in Maggie Fitzgerald's,(Hilary Swank), place. How she plays into that interaction is the key to the tenderly complicated relationship that Maggie & Frankie develop. Morgan Freeman, (Eddie 'Scrap-Iron' Dupris), plays the character that ties everything together & bears witness to it all. His elocution of the facts are the base of the narration given throughout.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the cast is exquisite, and the collision of fates within the story is inspiring. Definitely a must see!!!"
"charlessmith702210","9","1","2","30 May 2006"," A mixture of happiness with a very tragic outcome
","Of course, ""Rocky"" was the best series of boxing-related flicks involving Silvester Stallone, but ""Million Dollar Baby"" adds a twist to what the ""Rocky"" movies brought out to boxing enthusiasts.<br/><br/>The twist is that instead of a underdog male prizefighter like in ""Rocky"", ""Million Dollar Baby"" involves an underdog female prizefighter. <br/><br/>It was good that there was narration in the film, because some of the characterization was moderately complex---especially between the narrator (Morgan Freeman) who was a fight trainer and Clint Eastwood, who was also a fight trainer too.<br/><br/>The bout scenes remind me a little bit of the flick ""Ali"". You see Maggie (played by Hillary Swank) knock out opponent after opponent...usually in the opening rounds. and then by the middle of the movie you pull for her to go all the way---to win the women's welterweight championship.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood, taking something out of Rocky's ""Italian Stallion"", decides on a stage name for Maggie, taking a Gaelic phrase that means ""My Darling"". The probable purpose of that foreign phrase was to make her unique from other female boxers.<br/><br/>When Maggie faces Billie the Blackbeard, things turn to disaster for her. Billie was somewhat similar to character Ivan Drago in ""Rocky IV"" who kills Rocky Balboa's friend and boxer, Apollo Creed during an exhibition fight. Like Ivan Drago, Billie doesn't care about boxing rules and thinks of boxing as a death match--as she brings a very powerful uppercut on Maggie after one round is over, and she falls head-first into the hard wooden stool before the referee could see that punch. You hear the cracks after the crash...and that means her spinal cord shattered...and hence, her boxing career was over in milliseconds....<br/><br/>Maggie is now in her hospital bed. She realizes that she is paralyzed from the neck down and has to be on a respirator for life. Clint comes in and tries to find out what he wants to do with her.<br/><br/>Seeing the blood in Maggie's mouth on her attempt of her suicide by biting her own tongue was moderately horrible. It was like someone punched her several times in the mouth.<br/><br/>Clint realized this and the only way to end Maggie's suffering was to put an end to her life..right on her hospital bed....by first dismantling the respirator, and then injecting her with a vial containing a fatal dose of a chemical.<br/><br/>The narrator does say that the vial that puts Hillary to death for sure was ""adrenaline"", but instead, I believe that the poison that killed her, in my speculation, is liquid cyanide, probably 10 times the dose that can be lethal to a person...As her vital sign indicators end up on flatlines....indicating that she is definitely dead....this is reminiscent of the ending of ""Witness to An Execution.""<br/><br/>Clint walks away, realizing that he had committed a mercy killing. You feel so sad for Maggie...a middle-aged lady who had a lot going for her...and in the happiest part of her life...only to have her life destroyed by Billie's nasty punch."

","Beautifully written, produced, acted; Eastwood continues to grow, and it's great to see that. May he continue to be the maverick who takes on stuff like this and do things few dare to do.<br/><br/>You can't ask for better; a movie which says everything that needs to be said about the choice to make the search for truth one that involves a fight. For Dunn, life is a fight. Contenders for claims to the divine must run through searing heat, so the dross burns off and what comes out the other side is pure gold. This movie pushes us right into the volcano. Do we come out with or without hope that this process produces something ultimately beautiful? Sorry, but this movie declines to convince or reassure. That is for each of us to decide at the movie's end, just as we will have to assess at our lives' ends. If that sounds like a ""stone bummer, man,"" then don't watch this film.<br/><br/>This movie joins others, like Fellini's Nights of Cabiria, that dare to leave us with no clear and pat conclusions about the fates of the protagonists. In the end, the real issue involves our feelings as we face life's challenges--and deal with the outcomes, both desired and undesired.

"SmilinIvey","9","1","2","12 April 2006"," ""Million Dollar Baby"" definitely on my Top Ten List.
","""Million Dollar Baby,"" is an epic film directed by Clint Eastwood that has definitely sealed a spot in my ""Top Ten."" I, personally, am a Hillary Swank fan and she lives up to and excels her leading role as Maggie Fitzgerald, a woman coming from nothing to attempt to succeed in a mans sport that she loves. Maggie is working to live and then spends the rest of her time working out in the gym to become the best. This film is full of many different genres and feelings; drama, hope, despair, persistence, and even David vs. Goliath. Maggie isn't the youngest, the quickest, or the strongest, but what she lacks in skill, she compromises with her heart. So much heart, that the once stubborn Frankie Dunn, Clint Eastwood, agrees to become her trainer, even though she's a girl. Throughout the training and success of Maggie's career, they spark up a friendship as strong or even stronger than family. This is a great film and a must-see, it's amazing and has you rooting and leaving the theater with a want to better yourself and follow your dreams, despite the possibility of failure."

","Plot: Maggie (Swank) is an ambitious woman who walks through boxing trainer Frankie's (Eastwood) door with nothing but guts and her wish of becoming a pro boxer, but she is too old in in his opinion. Oh, and the fact that she's a girl doesn't make it easier for her to be accepted. Frankie doesn't like to lose and is convinced he will with a girl boxer. Frankie finds himself being persuaded by Maggie and former boxer Eddie (Freemind) and at last gives in. Then starts the hard work, but Maggie is eager to learn. As other reviewers have mentioned; there are some subplots, but it's more fun if you're not aware of them before after you've actually seen the movie. And you should see the movie. There is a lot more that happens, but you need to see it for yourself.<br/><br/>It took a while getting used to Swank playing anyone else than Brandon (Boys Don't Cry), but it didn't take long before I realized what a great actress she is to be able to make the character her own. Swank, Freemind and Eastwood make a great team and that is probably why Eastwood has not included a broader cast when directing.<br/><br/>This is quality!"

","I admire Clint Eastwood a lot and think he is a genius film director comparable to John Huston and John Ford proving again and again that he is capable of handling any subject and giving it a fine finish. The talent of Clint is not limited to film direction only but he has excelled in acting as well. His forceful acting and direction has given us many good films: Fistful of Dollars, Good bad & ugly, Where eagles dare, Paint your wagon, Breezy, Play misty for me, Outlaw Josey Wales, The gauntlet, Beguiled, Pale rider, The unforgiven, Bridges of Madison, Midnight in the garden of good and evil and now Million dollar baby-the list is very impressive. Well done Clint but we want more films of high standard from you as we can't accept less than that. So please continue producing and directing and for that we wish you a long and healthy life."

"happy_hangman","Null","1","2","19 January 2006"," Hits The Spot
","With a face seemingly hewn from Mount Rushmore, Clint Eastwood is as much part of the iconic landscape of American cinema as the titular letters on the Hollywood hills. Unlike that signpost his appeal is rather more than superficial. There are few more successful reinventions in tinsel-town. It could be argued, indeed, that as a producer and director he is far more interesting than he ever was as an action-hero leading man. I suppose this shouldn't be surprising, as his earliest directorial effort, 1971's 'Play Misty For Me', made when he was one of the most bankable stars in the world, is (though overlong) an effective, intelligent and genuinely unsettling thriller  nicely paced and relying on a carefully crafted suspense rather than standard shock-tactics. It's easy to forget just how many films he has directed  twenty four in all  ranging from run-of-the-mill studio fare like 'The Eiger Sanction', 'The Outlaw Josey Wales' and 'Sudden Impact' to more ambitious and intellectually engaging offerings like 'White Hunter, Black Heart', 'Unforgiven', 'Bird' and the splendid 'Mystic River' (one of my favourite films of 2003). Oddly, given that two of those films have won 'Best Film' and 'Best Director', we still think of him principally as an actor (in which field, one should also note, he has improved considerably in later life). In maturity he's shown that he has something to say. Not only that, he says it with force and subtlety. Given his own oft-expressed right-wing sentiments his filmic approach to issues of personal ethics (as opposed to public morality) is refreshingly ambiguous: his characters' opinions, dilemmas and life-choices are their own to make, rather than being determined by middle-American public consensus. <br/><br/>In 'Million Dollar Baby' Eastwood eschews the bright lights of the ring for a muted palette of shadowy greys and browns, and this carefully toned visual approach extends to the plot and performances. We are told just enough about the characters to care about them, and are shown just enough in the boxing ring to capture the energy and determination of his principal players. As in 'Mystic River' his interest seems to dwell more on the cause and consequence of a particular action than the action itself.<br/><br/>This is nowhere better exemplified than in the presence of Morgan Freeman. Freeman actually does very little  his character existing on the fringes of the main events of the film - but does it superbly well, his subtle understatement more effectively commanding the camera (and the emotions of the audience) than the histrionics of any number of current leading men. Eastwood has the same emotional authority. <br/><br/>Hilary Swank is also quite excellent. I have yet to be disappointed by her  even in studio toss like the abominable actioner 'The Core'. Her turn in 'Boys Don't Cry' was astonishingly instinctive and direct, and the near disillusionment of her earnest, optimistic policewoman in 'Insomnia' was utterly convincing. Here one cannot help to be swept up and carried off in the wake of her character's indefatigability. Obviously, given the nature of her role, her performance is by far the most physical in the movie, but she has learned from her co-stars that less-is-more, that more sincere emotion can be conveyed by what chooses not to do on screen. <br/><br/>Subtle and deceptively complex. ."
"TheUnknown837-1","10","1","2","18 January 2006"," Wow, what a great show! Eastwood's just getting better!
","I personally am not a huge fan of boxing movies or any other films falling into that kind of category. However, I have to say that Million Dollar Baby, with the legendary Clint Eastwood as lead actor and more importantly, as director, made this movie into a masterpiece. It just works wonderfully on every level necessary to make a great movie. Along with Clint, we have Hilary Swank and the also well-known Morgan Freeman, who won on Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in this movie.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is a great movie with tremendous good boxing action and later on, heart-breaking drama that will bring tears to your eyes. The bond between the two main characters and what eventually happens to one of them just rips anybody's soul apart. And I just love how Morgan Freeman is playing an in-the-background, but equally important character. He definitely deserved the Oscar he won.<br/><br/>And Clint deserved what he got as well. Just like he had done with his hit Western ""Unforgiven"", he made a great movie out of this by directing and playing the lead role in this. He did a great job as a cantankerous and rough boxing trainer who eventually realizes that he can have a heart."

Why wasn't the corner going nuts trying to get the fight stopped? Why weren't the -judges- demanding that the ref stop the fight? I know the movie is focused on other matters, but a just little bit of police action after the ATTEMPTED MURDER in the ring would have been nice. Why did her hospital-visiting mother say that she ""lost"" the fight? Why did Franky say she ""didn't win"" the fight? Are they saying she was disqualified for not being able to continue? Is this some kind of a joke? Am I missing something here? There must be a way to make the villain a villain without straining suspension of disbelief so severely. This,after all, was not a movie about professional wrestling. How can these absurd errors be tolerated by so many reviewers?"

Of all the injuries, one that is worst to get is such, irreversibly saddening and heart-breaking.<br/><br/>I cried towards the end of the movie as the buildup from the beginning of it was filled with passion and interest. Imagining that to create a worthy chance in life for just one single attempt, you have to choose it wisely, accept the complications and move on with the implications. This movie shows directly how such a short successful life of an ascending champion who though did not achieve full fame, but get what she really desires in her life. She went to the full extent to get it, and the way the film depicts the way she live it out in the ring showed much enthusiasm and worthiness plus of course a non-regrettable decision towards the very end.<br/><br/>I was hoping for a turn of the table for this movie towards the finale, but sadly, it didn't. An excellent and touching movie, I shall say!"
"luzgannon","10","1","2","31 December 2005"," Masterpiece Of Great Complexity
","With Unforgiven, Clint Eastwood made his bid on Greatness as a film creator, and nearly made it. Now, he goes all the way and beyond with A Million Dollar Baby.<br/><br/>The themes, and the story, are n-o-t original. Eastwood aims at the most general rather than the specific. It's a basically a story having been told a zillion times already, about a hero going up like a sun and down like a pancake... oh, that's not the word. We have loads of the usual painfully sentimental stuff.<br/><br/>Still, this is a towering Masterpiece. Why.<br/><br/>It's because of Haggis' Screenplay and Eastwood's exceptional intelligence. Out of this cliché scheme of a story they together dig an amazing profundity, and presents it all in an exceptionally subtle way.<br/><br/>I will here concentrate on that particular feature of the film that made the strongest impression on me, namely the beautifully arranged d-i-s-c-u-s-s-i-o-n of that basic Big Question Of Life the story actualizes.<br/><br/>I see this film as kind of a classical duel debate between Humanism and Christianity; between Truth and Faith; between Realism and paradoxical Hope - and it is not in any way clear on which side Eastwood, the main creator, ends up himself. Both standpoints are presented with great specificity and convincing force.<br/><br/>On the side of Humanism / Truth / Realism we see the two main characters, the boxer-esse, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank), and Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood); these two are of course in focus, and represent the realistic view that in extreme cases you must bow to adversity, let go, and give up. This viewpoint is expressed with great force and intensity: the proposition is stated by Maggie, and Frank gives the unwilling acceptance and concurrence in the end.<br/><br/>The opposing standpoint, that of Faith and Hope, is far more subtly advocated by appearance of the priest Father Horvak (Brian F. O'Byrne) and the Gym owner Eddie Srap Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman). Father Horvak - the role is little but crucial - makes the statement, and Eddie it's practical support.<br/><br/>Thus the philosophical dilemma is rendered a marvelous quadruple structure.<br/><br/>It's not easy to see that the film does not end with a Question, but with it's Answer. It's the latter standpoint that wins.<br/><br/>How is this achieved.<br/><br/>Very subtly. Maggie, the dignified Stoic, draws her conclusion and leaves without remorse or bitterness. Frank bows to her pure will; and this is perfectly logical given the resources available for them both.<br/><br/>Then, we have Father Horvak, the rough, but impeccably orthodox and sincere Catholic priest, who with startling terseness states the opposite case; and then the low-keyed, thoughtful, but beneath the surface uncompromisingly resilient Eddie, who simply, so to speak, quite IS what he believes, with no conceptualization or religious superstructure of ideas whatever.<br/><br/>And, as I see it, TWO short episodes of the movie makes this clear: just a few seconds of Father Horvak saying it with some magical show of personal charisma - and at the very end, where Eddie unhesitatingly and with surprising decisiveness goads the retard poor Danger Barch (Jay Baruchel) on with his impossible ambition. <br/><br/>So: the conclusion and the sens-morale at least to me seems unequivocal: knowledge is not, faith must be there as well, and whatever we think about life, one thing is clear: Reality is not all there is to it! <br/><br/>Oh, there's much more to the movie, of course. Only one conspicuous thing to be added here: the perfection of the cast and the crew. Hilary Swank is optimal as Maggie, that terrific acting ability, that rather brutish still genuine beauty. And who could ultimately well do that calm, unpretentious strongman Eddie if not Morgan Freeman? O'Byrne is just amazing in his rough but convincing appearance. And last but not least, Clint Eastwood himself renders the most really human and complex character of them all, Frank Dunn, with an accuracy to which I can see no improvement possibly being added.<br/><br/>This is a great film. One of t-h-e Great Movies."

"bugman7007","8","1","2","16 November 2005"," Very close to the bone - classic Hollywood cinema
","First of all: ""Million Dollar Baby"" is not a movie about boxing (neither are ""Raging Bull"" or ""Hurricane"", for that matter). Every film needs a setting, and the setting of ""Million Dollar Baby"" (adapted from several short stories by F. X. Toole) just happens to be the boxing world. Of course, there are a couple of rather violent fight scenes, but, as in all of the truly great 'boxing-movies', these are only a necessary means for telling a story that is about something completely different and much more universal.<br/><br/>In the first scene, which happens to be one of the aforementioned fighting scenes, there is an impressive close-up shot of an open wound  a cut in a boxer's face, close to his eye  that defines the theme for the rest of the film. This is, indeed, a story about open wounds. Frankie (Clint Eastwood), a veteran boxing trainer, was once known as the best cut-man around  an expert in treating such wounds in boxer's faces. Ironically, he lacks expertise when it comes to taking care of his own (psychological) wounds. Some cuts, it is said at one time in the film, are just too deep or too close to the bone. <br/><br/>Frankie lives alone. For some reason his daughter, apparently the only remaining member of his family, has deserted him and returns all of his letters unopened. All he has left is his business, an L.A.-based boxing gym crowded with some real fighters and a whole load of wannabes. His life suddenly changes when his long-time companion and ex-protégé Scrap (Morgan Freeman), who is also the narrator, discovers Maggie (Hillary Swank) among the many seedy characters in the gym. Maggie, a 31-year-old, uneducated, lower working class woman  ""trailer trash from the Ozarks"", as she puts it herself  wishes to be trained by Frankie and become a professional fighter so she can break the cycle of her unsatisfactory life and support her family. At first Frankie is skeptical; he's opposed to the idea of training a woman, and he obviously doesn't want to be involved in any way with a woman about the age of his daughter. But after a while, persuaded by Maggie and Scrap as well, he agrees and, of course, Maggie becomes one of the most successful fighters worldwide.<br/><br/>In boxing, it is said, the final round is the hardest (that is, of course, unless one of the two fighters gets knocked out before that). The same thing is true for Eastwood's movie, which takes another abrupt turn towards the end, when after a drastic incident Maggie and Frankie's world is turned upside down once more and everything that seemed certain is in question again. It is up to Frankie now to make one more fateful decision.<br/><br/>On the surface ""Million Dollar Baby"" has all the clichés and stereotypes: the loser who, through a metamorphosis achieved by hard practice, turns into the ultimate success (Maggie); the veteran mentor who has been through almost everything and has a hell of a time coping with all his grief (Frankie); the streetwise, somewhat poetic observer/adviser/narrator  blind in one eye  who serves as a moral authority (""Scrap""); the outright ridiculous and disgusting hillbilly clan (Maggie's family); and even a rather bizarre version of the terrifying, evil foreigner (Billie, the black, ex-prostitute, fighter from East-Berlin, played by real-life boxer Lucia Rijker). It is its frank and modest tone above all(just pay some attention to the sparse use the editors made of music and sound effects) that saves the film from being just another shallow and cheesy affair, and allows viewers take an interest in the characters' development and the outcome of the story, which can be said to raise more questions than it is able to answer.<br/><br/>Essentially, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is an American story, the first half driven by a lively from-rags-to-riches or you-can-get-it-if-you-really-want mentality (furthered by constantly drawing on certain myths of the boxing world), the second half dominated by an atmosphere of absolute doubt. Clint Eastwood, along with screenwriter Paul Haggis, has created an outstanding piece of classic Hollywood cinema, dialogue-driven and simple in style. Highly recommended, not only for fans of boxing or movies about boxing!"

I would not run out and buy this movie personally, renting it once will suffice, yet it is a good flick to watch at least once. Some movies are just to close to real life, in the sense that there is no fairy tale ending. It is too grim for me to sit through again.

","by Morgan Young.<br/><br/>In this movie that features award winners, Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and Morgan Freeman, you are taught a lesson: never let anyone stop you from fulfilling your dream. Scrap (Morgan Freeman) was a retired fighter. He cleaned Frankie Dunn's (Clint Eastwood) gym, and he always saw the good in everyone. Scrap was the one who saw something in Maggie (Hilary Swank) way before Frankie did.<br/><br/>Maggie was a small town girl from southwestern Missouri. She grew up knowing that she would never amount to anything more than trash. All she wanted was someone to believe in her. Even without the approval of her family and others around her Maggie never let go of her dream of being a big time boxer. She always kept her unshakable focus.<br/><br/>Frankie hated taking risks and never allowed himself to get close to anybody. That all changed, however, when he met Maggie. He took a chance and agreed to train her, not knowing that she would win him over. They would both face 'a battle that would demand their hearts and courage' stated by Scrap. They grew to have a strong friendship and found a sense of family in each other that both had lost a long time ago.<br/><br/>As you follow the journey of Maggie and Frankie you will not only grow to cherish their friendship, you will see that the real magic in boxing is 'fighting battles beyond endurance and risking everything for a dream that no one sees but you'! No matter what, always remember the one key rule: ""Always protect yourself."" You will learn what happens if you don't, but only if you go see Million Dollar Baby!"

","I hate to see everyone nitpicking at stupid details such as when Maggie goes down and hits her head on the chair, everyone is silent. ""In real life there is no way that would happen, fans would get up, throw things, the trainer would retaliate."" People, first of all, Eastwood isn't wasn't nor will he ever be a boxer. He could have chosen any sport or medium through which to tell his tale. Boxing and a woman just so happen to be great choices for a few reasons, #1 not everyday stuff (woman wanting to be a boxer) #2 great way to symbolize a desire and hidden feelings toward the unexpected for both the female boxer and the trainer. This movie was shot with such impeccable detail that you can bet 80% of most viewers have these things go unnoticed, and cannot identify them, yet almost all of these people are subject to the effect the cinematography has. THAT is truly brilliant. The subtleties like the noir-like voice overs and typical lighting (darker) and word choice in dialog esp between Swank and Eastwood as we see how Maggie truly loves her trainer as a father. And he the same. When Maggie falls down in the ring and gets injured, it is such a dark moment because Eastwood has realized the (in his mind) inevitable tragedy which he has led Maggie into. At that point in time, he already realizes retaliation would be of no use. I actually think that part is one of my favorites. Eastwood is so hit by the fall that he is already past anger and revenge. As if there was a part of him that knew this would happen and now he is feeling guilt and hopelessness. Its really an amazing scene. The filming of that scene also totally emphasizes his inner darkness and pain. This movie stays away from clichés and doesn't give the audience what it wants to see. It doesn't even deal with Maggies death in a ""noble"" way. Its very real. And that is shocking. This movie is 100% guaranteed to withstand the test of time. I don't know much about Clint Eastwood, but this is all I need to know. The man is brilliant. If you don't shed a tear in this movie, you have no heart. Swank deserves an Oscar, so does Eastwood for the directing. Freeman is the only Cliché (the wise old has been black guy) but if you study his character closely you will see how he is actually not clichéd at all. This movie is so powerful that you need a few hours to recuperate and that gut feeling you get during the movie sticks with you for days, and the appreciation will last forever. GREAT MOVIE. MASTERPIECE."
"patrick_dunne","10","1","2","20 October 2005"," A triumphant drama about triumph
","I don't think I need to say much. Million Dollar Baby is Clint Eastwood's masterpiece. Clint showed his knowledge of capturing melancholy elements, and casting them out gratefully in Mystic River. This was different. Some may say that the drama in the film was the last 20 minutes, where the characters face a drastic experience, but that was not the main point.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is a triumphant drama about triumph. We see Maggie Fitzgerald (played by Hilary Swank) triumph and conquer her way through boxing matches by hard work, determination, and the love of her boxing trainer named Frankie. (played by Clint Eastwood, himself) We hear Morgan explain ""If there's magic in boxing, its the magic of fighting battles beyond endurance, beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys and detached retinas. It's the magic of risking everything for a dream that nobody sees but you."" <br/><br/>The story is narrated by Mr. Scrap. (played by Morgan Freeman) They couldn't have chosen a better choice. Morgan Freeman is an excellent narrator; he captures the emotion in the scenes where it is necessary. After all, why would of he narrated in March of the Penguins and War of the Worlds? Most dramas have plenty of emotion, but those with a short attention span will probably not realize it, because of all the dialogue. This is different.<br/><br/>There is just something about this movie that makes it so beautifully touching. The music that Clint showed off in Unforgiven is apparent here. The acting is better than good- It's so excellent. <br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby knows when to be light-hearted and fun, and when to be moody and depressing. For example, in the first scenes, Clint shows off how much heart he can really put into a movie with the bond between Maggie and Frankie. The film becomes even more fun with some jokes added here and there. ""You spent so much time on the floor, that I thought the canvas had a pair of titties."" Crude, but hilarious. During the final scenes, the film goes on kind of long, but Clint Eastwood still manages to show all the heart he can put into a movie, and he knows how to put in the dark and tragic elements he added into many other films.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby does have some dialogue, but manages to grab a hold of your interest. There is a certain unexplainable feeling that is in the movie. It seems to have a magical quality to it. Maybe it's the fact that the relationship between Maggie and Frankie is sweet and beautiful. (Beware, it is not a romance.) It could be that you think of a girl-who knows she's poor trash-work as hard as she can with the love of Frankie. Or, it could just be the fun boxing scenes, where people beat each other up. Who knows? This is surely one of the greatest and most memorable films of the year. Not many other films capture the glory of victory like this one does. Million Dollar Baby is truly triumphant, beautiful, touching and almost flawless. There are simply not enough words to describe it.<br/><br/>Best Picture is only the start of the praise that this film truly deserves.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>Good: Beautiful, good boxing scenes, full of heart and joy, funny, carries a certain light-hearted tone throughout<br/><br/>Bad: The last scene is pretty long"

Dunn, still reluctant, sees her progressing and finally he concedes and becomes her trainer. Maggie got talent and patience, and finally it pays off. She quickly makes a name for herself, Mo Cuiishle, a nick name given to her by Dunn. Finally, she gets her championship match, but now the competition is though, will she make it?<br/><br/>Comment: At the start, I didn't think I would like this move very much. But it has, like the three main characters Dunn, Maggie and Scrap, a big heart and when it was time for the championship match, I found that I actually did care. Both Eastwood and Freeman is starting to get old, but they still can act and act well. So does Swank, though she's not that old yet. One could actually divide the movie into two halves, as it has a break (literally) in the middle. The first half deals with the training and boxing, and the way to the championship match. It is the part I liked best, because it was there I found the most heart, the most joy, and the will to take the next step. Such feelings are infectious. The second half is much more about humanity, relations and almost another story. The heart and joy (quite naturally) was lost, and even if it was interesting and joy was exchanged to sorrow and concern, it never got as good as the first part. One should say though that it didn't end like I thought it would at the start of the movie, and in a movie that's almost always positive. Though the story now is very different, the acting is still very good, I think especially Eastwood gives a good performance. One final thought though, I believe the movie treads on thin ice, considering the end (I'll try not to reveal it). I felt Dunn got something of a hero label, that one should be very careful to hand out, as it concerns a very difficult matter. I won't judge one or the other way, just note the above. But maybe that's another good thing about the movie, it actually made me think about some serious and difficult matters, I hope I was not the only one to do so...<br/><br/>7/10"
"raypaquin","10","1","2","28 August 2005"," Thank God for Clint Eastwood.
","Thank God for Clint Eastwood. Every time I am tempted to despair of the American cinema industry, along comes Clint with one of his masterpieces. In this film, he starred, directed and produced. He even composed the music ! Clint Eastwood has a gift for avoiding the typical Hollywood clichés and superficialities without sounding pompous and yet manages to reach the true depth of any given situation. His films avoids any distraction which would not help the story along. This film is long - over 130 minutes - but it seemed short to me. The very tragic ending of this film could easily have been mishandled, but Clint keeps it simple, concentrating on the essentials. For the first time in years, I admit that I cried. Eastwood also made me doubt for the first time about my moral positions on euthanasia. I am still against it, but readily admit that reality has a way of creating situations which are more complex than what a philosopher would imagine. The main actors, Clint Eastwood along with Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman, are all simply superb. Now we expect that from veterans like Eastwood and Freeman, but Hilary Swank was an agreeable surprise, at least for me. She is a stunning actress and I hope she will be given other opportunities to star in quality films. Won't Hollywood ever learn ? Don't 'they' ever watch films made by Clint Eastwood ?"

","I thought Eastwood impressed once again. A solid drama, with an inspiring story, good direction, great acting and amazing score. The script about a female boxer (Swank) who trains with an experienced trainer (eastwood) as told by an old fighter(Freeman) who lost his eye in a fight who works for the trainer at his gym . I thought Morgan Freeman outshined in this film, his performance, although supporting, was better than both of the leads. I liked Hilary Swank she was solid, and although Eastwood had the same look throughout most the film his performance was decent as well. Jay Baruchel was hilarious, great character. I thought this film was good, it was slow but got its point across, a great drama. 9/10"
"gordonm88","9","1","2","6 August 2005"," Great acting, powerful story but ""What did he say?""
","Acting: Overall, the acting is superb. Morgan Freeman and Hillary Swanks were brilliant, and Clint was good but not great. How difficult is it to play a crusty old man that grouches at everyone? Clint's acting could have been a bit more nuanced at those times in the story when he is supposed to feel sad or uncertain or frustrated. Most supporting characters were also tremendous - totally convincing and they did a lot with their characters. A priest and a family lawyer were the two characters that did not work for me.<br/><br/>Cinematography was good with an effective gritty realism to the first 70% of the movie. There were some some noticeable lapses in story-telling and continuity.<br/><br/>Worst problem with the film was the sound. Much of the narration and dialog early in the movie were hard to make out, Morgan Freeman is occasionally unintelligible. And in a climatic scene, Clint Eastwood chooses to deliver the most memorable line in the movie in a whisper that left my wife and I asking ""what did he say? What did you hear?"""
"sparky200555","10","1","2","23 July 2005"," Million Dollar Baby
","Compared to what I normally see come out of Tinsel Town, this is wonderful. One thing though, did you notice that Dunn walks past his fighter when she is working the heavy bag, she is winded, he tells her, ""you can rest when your dead"", very ominous warning, also remember how the music became very dark and haunting when the champion comes into the ring. You just knew something tragic was going to happen. Earlier in the film Freemans character is talking about the champs style and fighting ability. They show her hitting a fighter who is on one knee, then another scene where she wrenches on the other fighters head and throws her to the ground, knocking the ref down also, they don't show her throwing elbows but she does in the fight Dunns challenger, this is very common in boxing, especially when fighters are in close throwing hooks at the head, they let there elbows follow thru where the glove would have been, anyway you would have figured that Dunn would have expected this champion to do these things again, but when she elbows, throws her shoulder and elbow to knock down her challenger, then his the fighter while she is on one knee, Dunn acts totally surprised at this and stares at her corner, then the fatal blow after the bell was horrible, it just seemed odd that Dunn didn't tell her to expect very dirty tactics and never take her eyeball off that woman at any moment. Although Dunn did tell his fighter to fight dirty right back as soon as he realized there was no getting around it. Everybody who watched that film up to that point was ready for Dunns fighter to become champion and live happily ever after, not so, and the way the movie leaves the fight game, with nothing from the other boxer or any kind of closure to the championship fight, nothing, not one thing, just a quadraplegic who asks her only friend to allow her to expire, thats tough stuff."

","I would give this a 10 if it filled in a few more gaps for me but the movie would have been 4 hours long if it did. Hilary Swank was fantastic in this and you can't help but fall in love with her attitude, determination and unselfishness. Clint was perfect in this role, he reminded me of my grandpa, angry at the world in his own lovable way. My biggest criticism is that they don't go into enough of his past to explain him. Morgan Freeman plays perfectly right along side Clint and they do a great job playing the roles of long time friends. There is a magical touch to this film that is indescribable, you can feel the connection between the characters and you feel like you are watching something real. Unfortunately the ending leaves you a little down and incomplete. I think they could have cut that shorter and spared me the long drawn emotional pain. All in all it was a great film and definitely worth your time."

","About Clint Eastwood's last movie I'd heard it was something we had seen a million times; very cliché. I don't pretend to get inside the story, because I shouldn't tell much of it, but it is, with a simple look, what we've already seen in ""Rocky"", and maybe in ""Karate Kid""; two classic movies of the genre. But Clint Eastwood doesn't dig the classic, he digs the proper; and the fact of not winning the awards he won this year with ""Mystic River"" is intriguing. And ""Million Dollar Baby"" won them not because of its relation with other films, but on its own right.<br/><br/>The emotional power this movie has and many other things, are comparable to the equally good ""Mystic River"". The thing is Eastwood knows how great he is and he closes with the credits in white; simple, over the black screen in both films. Anyway, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is another movie, and if it entered late in the radar, it didn't matter because Eastwood knew what he had in his hands and what it would be, more than anyone.<br/><br/>Again he looked for stories that excellent screenwriters would adapt (Brian Helgeland the last time, now Paul Haggis), composed the music and produced his piece. However he is not proud, and if one doesn't know what is to see, finds out about all this in the end. This round, he added an habitual detail in his directions, that turned down a couple of years ago, but concluded now in another Oscar nomination: his performance in the movie. Between the darkness and the lights sow well handled under his lead, I was able to see some faces that spoke for themselves, and acted. The pro was also thrilling in the beautifully written chats Frankie, his character, shared with Scrap (played by Morgan Freeman). With a lot of knowledge, both men exchanged words as the figures they are and as their characters, friends who have been giving each other support since always, and know that's not going to change, so they're not afraid of honesty. These chats turn out to be between the film's best moments.<br/><br/>Clint directed and acted in top form, without forgetting about the partners around him. In Hilary Swank he saw the love and commitment with acting, getting the best of her, en what is more than a transformation. The transformation is part of the commitment, but the love enters in knowing how to use it, because: What good does a transformation has if it won't be taken advantage of? Completing one of the best ensemble works I've seen since...Well, since ""Mystic River"", Morgan Freeman played his cards once again, narrating and talking wisely to receive the Oscar he should have had over a decade ago for ""The Shawshank Redemption"", were he was splendid.<br/><br/>The way Clint Eastwood has to escape from the obvious (a man who directed lots of westerns, which are pretty obvious), can be seen clearly in all those moments where you're waiting something typical and his camera, or his movie's script, doesn't give it to you. In ""Rocky"", the man trained by himself, and felt proud of that; in ""Million Dollar Baby"", our girl is in desperate need for one only trainer, and besides being proud of, loves him. It's amazing how he loves her back."
"jfreela","10","1","2","20 July 2005"," A movie with heart
","Million Dollar Baby is a boxing movie with a twist. It's a treat to see three great stars (Eastwood, Swank and Freeman) all hitting their marks. This has to be Clint Eastwood's greatest performance on screen and he directs with the level of excellence that we've come to expect. Hillary Swank proves that she deserves to be a 2 time Academy Award winner and gives an unforgettable performance. Morgan Freeman is basically himself, which is always a good thing and earned his long overdue Oscar. This is not so much a boxing movie about bravado, but it has as much heart as any sports movie ever made. This one will stay with you long after the closing credits. Not to be missed."
"eternal_sunshine426","10","1","2","18 July 2005"," A Modern-Day Masterpiece
","Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby is a complete and utter masterpiece. It's a realistic piece of film that makes you think long and hard about many controversial subjects, and in a way, inspires you to make the most of your life. <br/><br/>Hilary Swank gives a heart-wrenching performance as Maggie Fitzgerald, a woman who dreams of one day becoming a boxing champion. She is an example of someone who truly earned their Oscar, not due to the dramatics of her performance, but because of the simplicity and truth behind it. She's playing it as a real person with real feelings who gives real reactions, a concept that many previous Academy-Award winners have failed to grasp. She's not out to impress or to out stand, she's simply portraying a character with extreme honesty, and because of that, she succeeds.<br/><br/>Also portraying their characters with brutal honesty and realism are Eastwood (as Frankie Dunn, Maggie's trainer) and Morgan Freeman (as Scrap, a has-been boxer who lost his eye in his last real fight). These three actors have amazing on-screen chemistry, and together, they add to the overall effect of the film.<br/><br/>Although a lot of attention is being brought to the film's controversial ending, I sincerely hope you go into it with an open mind, and decide for yourself how you feel about the right to die.<br/><br/>All-in-all, this is everything that a film should be, and more. From its stand-out performances to its simplistic yet beautiful method of storytelling, Million Dollar Baby is without a doubt the best film of 2004."

"departed07","10","1","2","12 July 2005"," 2004's Best Picture Masterpiece
","Today I finally had the pleasure of watching ""Million Dollar Baby"" on the DVD and I got to tell you that this is one of best boxing films and also the greatest Clint Eastwood film ever made at the same time.<br/><br/>The film concentrates on the principal actors Clint Eastwood as the trainer, Morgan Freeman as the Narrator and friend, and Hilary Swank as the woman who wanted out of her old life to be a boxer, in which we get to study these look at these characters as human beings rather than just actors playing a part.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, a former professional boxer and trainer who runs a local boxing gym with his buddy Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris (played by Morgan Freeman) in which Jimmie knows the ropes on how to fight, how to move and how to win. In the prologue of the film, we see Frankie trying to heal a scar from a boxer before the boxing doctor comes to check. The character of Frankie Dunn doesn't have faith in the people he trains, after in a scene he tells the boxer that he doesn't want him to fight to get the title or else he'll get hurt; especially when Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) tries to come in and box at the gym, he tells Maggie that he doesn't train girls because it will look bad on his reputation.<br/><br/>Maggie Fitzgerald has always dream of becoming a boxer as she attends every fight event that takes place in order to talk to Frankie, but he refuses to train her because she is too old. It doesn't stop Maggie as every day and night she trains at the boxing gym where Eddie gives out advice and tells her how to posture her movement. She doesn't quit until Frankie decides to help her. During the prologue of the film, Eddie explains the story behind Maggie as we see her working as a waitress in a dead-end job where she steals most of the leftover food and takes it back to her house where she eats the food.<br/><br/>Eddie is the narrator, and the character that Morgan Freeman portrays is similar to Red Boyle from ""The Shawshank Redemption"" in which the character talks about the events that took place especially getting to know the characters a little better. Eddie is blind from one eye as he explains to Maggie that he lost it in his 109th fight when Frankie was his manager; he also lives in the gym where he has a small room near the entrance where he sleeps, eats and watches TV. Like Frankie, Eddie takes in a poor retard from the streets named Danger Barch (Jay Baruchel) in which the retard has dreams of winning the championship title; though the kid may never have a chance, Eddie will believe in him.<br/><br/>""Million Dollar Baby"" is more than your ordinary boxing flick; it's also a character movie where we get to know these three characters and actually have feelings for them as we root them on. I was cheering when I watched this film as I watch the character Maggie win all the fights, including having a smile on my face when we saw Maggie and Frankie talking during a road trip. The last forty minutes of the film is a sad tragedy as we lose one of the main characters of the film; it is truly a great and powerful scene.<br/><br/>Last year I saw Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"" a tragedy about three men and the nightmare that came back to haunt them; that was one of the best films I've ever seen from a Clint Eastwood movie; now after watching ""Million Dollar Baby"" on the DVD, Clint has completed his tragedy masterpiece where I will never forget that people do have chances in life."
"bburns","10","1","2","8 April 2005"," A sentimental masterpiece from Clint Eastwood. . .the old softy
","From 1964 to 1993, Clint Eastwood was the epitome of the all-American tough guy. He brooked no insult, pulled no punches and was always committed to (violent) action, regardless of the consequences. Through much of the late 1970's & 1980's, this act got a little worn out, especially in ""Heartbreak Ridge"" and the final two ""Dirty Harry"" films. But then in 1992, he did a movie with Morgan Freeman called ""Unforgiven"". In that film, his trademark machismo gained a new dimension as he played a man who is haunted by all the horror he has caused through killing, but who is simply unsuited for anything else. The movie was rightly hailed as a masterpiece and won Oscars for Best Picture & Best Director. Things seemed to be looking up for the re-invented Clint.<br/><br/>And then in 1995, the unthinkable happened: he went all soft on us with a movie adaptation of ""The Bridges of Madison County"". Ever since then--even when he played the tough guy--the movies he did had a sentimental bent. Typically, there was a subplot involving Clint trying to re-establish a relationship with an estranged grown daughter and either a too-neat happy ending or a syrupy tear-jerker of a denouement.<br/><br/>With the release last year of ""Mystic River"", many of us had high hopes that Eastwood was back on his game again. In that film, he seemed to have abandoned sentimentality altogether and--like Woody Allen and Spike Lee in the last few years--realized that he should stay behind the camera. But now he has gone and made another unabashedly sentimental movie where he plays an old guy looking to re-connect with his estranged daughter. However--like ""Unforgiven""--""Million Dollar Baby"" co-stars Morgan Freeman, it won Oscars for Best Director & Best Picture, and it is rightly hailed as a masterpiece.<br/><br/>In this one, Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, a gym owner/boxing trainer/manager who reluctantly takes on Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank) as a trainee, but only because his star boxer dumped him on the eve of a title fight. Freeman plays basically the same role as he did in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (narrator/best friend/voice of wisdom). The only real difference is that instead of a pork-pie hat and prison grays, he wears a battered fedora and a bushy white mustache reminiscent of the one he wore for his ""Mad Scientist"" character on ""The Electric Company"". (When are they gonna get around to putting that out on DVD?)<br/><br/>The movie starts out as a better-than-average take on the ""Rocky"" story, only with a female protagonist. But then, about two-thirds of the way into the film, Maggie has a crippling accident in the ring, and the film becomes an emotionally wrenching meditation on the true definitions of love, family, dignity, sin, and life itself. The far right has attacked this film because the definitions that these characters have of those concepts do not fit the fundamentalist theocratic agenda. But if the film conformed with their wishes, I don't think it would be nearly as good. (And those who think these statements are anti-Christian are advised to read my review of ""The Passion of the Christ""). We see Clint give his best performance ever as Frankie goes through the torment of the moral dilemma of either killing the girl he has come to love as a daughter or letting her unwillingly lie in a hospital bed for untold years. And we get to see a brilliant scene where Maggie rejects her own family in favor of Frankie that was probably the tipping point that won Hillary her second Oscar.<br/><br/>The main thing that struck me about this movie, though, are the voices of Clint and Morgan Freeman. In ""Unforgiven"", their voices were only slightly raspy, but 12 years later their voices are downright gravelly. I was also struck by the visual similarities with ""Mystic River""--the blue tint of the film & the long, dark shadows that hide the character's faces at crucial moments.<br/><br/>The film has only one weakness: Screenwriter Paul Haggis apparently believes the shopworn stereotype that all red-state dwellers--especially Texans--are illiterate, unreconstructed, welfare-cheating, trailer-dwelling, racist white trash. However--like the racist caricatures in ""Gone With the Wind""--it is not enough to diminish the artistry of a truly compelling cinematic masterpiece. 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>P. S. The next time Clint thinks of making a comedy (he's made a handful--all bad) or musical (he's made two--both bad), he needs to cast Morgan Freeman. That way, the movie will be a true masterpiece & will win Oscars for Best Director & Best Picture."

"paulhoughton02","Null","1","2","18 March 2005"," Good but over-rated
","This is a good movie but over-rated. For the first hour and a half, it retreads very old ground. It's basically Rocky with a woman. Eastwood's acting is kinda wooden, the script is a little cheesy and Morgan Freeman's character is, well, unnecessary. It's only when the tragedy at the end occurs that the film really begins to come into its own. Don't get me wrong, it's still pretty unoriginal, but at least there isn't the token happy ending. And why doesn't the German boxer from hell get arrested?? I would've liked to see Hilary Swank kick a few men's asses, and maybe Danger to rise up and defeat his tormentors, but hey! In my opinion, Hotel Rwanda is a better candidate for film of the year."
"valadas","8","1","2","17 March 2005"," Is this moving really about boxing?
","I must begin by confessing that I hate boxing. So I'll make this comment notwithstanding that. Well but is this movie really about boxing? I don't think so, I mean, in my opinion boxing is here a mere pretext to tell a story about love, friendship, dedication, will strength and fighting spirit for an aim. The main character is a boxer by chance as she could be a soccer player, a singer, a dancer or a pianist. And this is also the story of a false hard hearted guy who loses a daughter and meets another to whom he can give his fatherly love and get it returned. This movie is made with a, shall we say, atrocious realism both visual and psychological and the acting performers do their best to express it. The outcome, though caused by a fortuitous (or not?) fact, inserts itself totally in the atmosphere created by the two main characters (or three if we consider that the old ex-boxer is also a catalyst of the whole process of events, playing a fundamental part in the consciousness of the other two and acting somehow like their counterpoint). I think we are perhaps in presence of one of the best 2004 movies if not the best one."
"chrisq28","Null","1","2","15 March 2005"," Great film, but still somehow overrated.
","There wasn't a whole lot wrong with what the Academy of Arts and Sciences called 2004's best picture, but I wasn't necessarily moved to tears by it--Clint Eastwood has put out better pictures.<br/><br/>""Million Dollar Baby"" is the story of Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank), a thirty-one year-old woman who grew up as trailer park trash with the dreams of being a boxer. She seeks out Frankie (Clint Eastwood), a life-long trainer and cut man who has a particular distaste for training girls. Maggie has been practicing boxing for four years without any training whatsoever, and dilligently courts Frankie to train her. Frankie denies her time and time again, but finally gives in with a combination of embarrassment of her poor skills, and the fact that his former protégé has left him for a manager that will put him in a title fight.<br/><br/>After taking Maggie under his wing, Frankie trains the eager but often disobedient boxer into a top-notch fighter. He still hesitates to take chances and put Maggie at risk, but if movies have taught us anything, it's that without big risk, there is no big payoff. The trainer and the fighter grow closer and closer as Maggie moves up in the ranks, but when Maggie goes up for the title fight, tragedy strikes, and the two are forced to work through it together.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood has a fondness for character-driven pieces, and he does a good job in this one (as he did in ""Mystic River"" (2003)). In the extras on the DVD for ""Mystic"", Eastwood is interviewed and says that he enjoys stories where characters ""have to overcome something."" I agree that this makes a story more interesting, but there were moments, albeit only a few here and there, where I felt like the whole story was just a bit cliché--a nobody rising up to become something! only to tragically lose it is a theme that's been explored time and time again. Wisely, the story doesn't follow the same old pattern that many of these do, but it's still part of the reason that I viewed the movie as less than perfect.<br/><br/>Many critics have called ""Baby"" a character piece, which it is--mostly. The film is driven by Frankie's internal struggle with his demons from the past (including a sub-plot reminiscent of Kevin Bacon's character in Mystic--Frankie's daughter returns all his letters, just as Sean's wife in the 2003 release would call him and hang up without saying a word), and Maggie's role as ""the fighter"" who rises up to become something!--as Scrap (Morgan Freeman) says, ""She grew up knowing one thing--she was trash."" It is within Maggie though that I found the movie to become a bit less believable. Once she is paralyzed, and things don't look so good for recovery, she asks Frankie to put her out of her misery, and allow her to leave with the memory of all those people in the stands cheering her name. I had a hard time believing that Maggie would just give up and resort to assisted suicide. (""This? From a woman who had to fight for everything she ever got?"" I wrote in my notes while watching the film.) Of course, following this storyline allows Eastwood to avoid the tired montage of scenes where Maggie learns to walk again with inspirational pop music playing in the background--I'm not sure which is worse, sacrificing the character for the story, or maintaining the character at the expense of the story.<br/><br/>Also frustrating to me was being beaten over the head with Maggie's hillbilly family. OK, they're ignorant rednecks. I get it. They don't appreciate or believe in Maggie. I get it. They have old-fashioned beliefs and are greedy for Maggie's success which they never helped make happen in the first place. I get it. The whole presence of the family was a bit over-the-top for me.<br/><br/>I'm willing to give Eastwood a bit of artistic license in his use of Scrap as the narrator. Scrap describes events he wasn't present at (the climax of the movie, for example), and in the end we find that Scrap's narration is actually the reading of a letter to Eastwood's daughter, to let her know ""what kind of man (he) really is."" Forgivable, but still, chinks in the armor of what many critics called ""a masterpiece."" Don't get me wrong--this was a good movie. It was an example of great storytelling, the acting was very good, it was light in all the right places, the lighting and cinematography was very well-done, it explored a set of characters in such a way that made you believe and care about their story, and it kept my interest. My point is simply that it wasn't film-making perfection, and furthermore, Eastwood has put out better films. (Unforgiven, is the obvious example, and Sean Penn's performance in Mystic River was better than anything I saw in this movie.) Frankly, it's time I grow up and stop expecting the academy to make consistently good decisions--I guess I should have figured that out when ""Gladiator"" won best picture in 2000. Despite its flaws, ""Baby"" won awards for Best Picture, Best Actress (Hillary Swank), Best Director (Clint Eastwood), and Best Supporting Actor (Morgan Freeman). I shouldn't be surprised--the film is exactly what the Academy looks for--it's not too challenging, it's emotional, it's a slight twist on an old theme, and it stars actors and a director that we have come to expect good things from.<br/><br/>8.0/10.00 for ""Million Dollar Baby""."

","First, I would like to say that every actor hopes to land a role of a lifetime. This is that one role for Hilary Swank. I know that we will see her for years to come in other roles but this could be the role that defines her career. She deserves it. She is the most gracious person to walk the red carpet at the Academy Awards. I don't know if anyone caught it but when she was interviewed on the red carpet, she thanked her 5th grade teacher for giving her the chance to do a skit in front of the class. She even said his name. She is one classy individual! She really conditioned hard for this role. She is ripped in the gym! She really looks like a boxer. It's a gritty performance. That is what makes it such a pleasure to watch. She is not afraid to take on the roles that do not show off her beauty. She is gorgeous but she chooses not to take the fluffy, cutesy romantic leads that too many others get sucked into doing for the big money. That is why I applaud her. She will be remembered as a great actor.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman is also exceptional. He is such a good actor. He does it so effortlessly. He said in an interview that Eastwood doesn't like to do a lot of takes. Freeman said that is okay with him but you better come to the scene prepared to deliver. Eastwood likes to use an economy of scale method in order to stay within budget. He's very professional and likes to work with others that hold the highest standards of excellence as well.<br/><br/>I like films that have conflict and good character development. This movie has both. It is a touching relationship between Clint Eastwood's character and Hilary's. It develops so expertly. You really have to hand it to Eastwood. He has reached a level of directing others in his class envy. He is doing some of his best work in his later years when most actors his age walk off into the sunset.<br/><br/>He's an actor's director. Although it is a formula film, the characters are so strong and compelling, you just can't help but care about them. This film made me misty eyed. Any film that can evoke emotions from its audience such as this is definitely worth the price of admission. Don't forget to bring the Kleenex."

","Clint Eastwoods latest movie Million Dollar Baby have been awarded in the Oscars. What more to say. I've seen all of Clint Eastwood movies whether he directed it or in which he acted in it himself. This particular movie evolves around a boxing center where all boxing champions wanna be are training their butts off in pursuing their dreams, there are exceptionally a few funny moments in this movie but the main character comes with Hilary Swank as the main focus. Quite long semi heavy drama; but worth watching. Could have been cut short but hey, its not my movie. Overall a good movie to watch. Makes you understand more on human nature and how to deal with it when it comes and should it come. Indirectly, its just another story of a trainer, apprentice, manager in boxing center and going through a boxing match championship with a twist of gender in between. Not quite the ending one would expect in any movies watched. Kudos to Clint Eastwood for his million dollar baby."

","Clint Eastwood and Mary Shelley may not seem to have a lot in common, but both have a dab hand at Gothic Romance  dark stories of wish-fulfilment in which the central characters battle Fate, and lose, but do so heroically. Wagner wrote operas around such themes. Here, Clint has taken his text from the obscure ""F X Tool"", a former boxing trainer and ""cut man"", who published one well-received book of boxing short stories. ""Rope Burns"" when he was nearly seventy. Here, aging, never quite has-been Frank against his better judgment takes on enthusiastic woman boxer Maggie, who though past 30 is aching to succeed, despite being a self-admitted piece of trailer trash. Maggie of course is literally a knockout and goes from strength to strength  until she comes up against the Bear, the meanest female fighter in the world. And then we flip over into almost a different story about the testing of faith.<br/><br/>There is plenty of moody, gloomy photography and some fine boxing sequences (the Bear is played by a real women's boxing champion). Boxing is not my favourite sport but you do get to appreciate its attraction for those who are good at it. The lamentable thing is that so many derive real pleasure from watching. But as I said the movie is not really about boxing as about a heroic struggle against overwhelming odds, or the fates, if you will.<br/><br/>There are only three characters of any real consequence, Frank, Maggie and Frank's sidekick Eddie, who provides a mordant commentary on the story. Frank, as played by Clint is gnarled and tough, yet not quite tough enough. Guilt-ridden, he grieves for his estranged daughter and Maggie fills the gap. Hilary Swank as Maggie, despite the deprivation and loneliness, is all brighteyed ambition. We are never allowed to dwell on the improbability of such a character; instead we nod approvingly as she storms into Frank's twilight years, batters opponents senseless and gets into the ring for the big one. It's a remarkable performance and Hilary might as well have the Oscar, in a lean year. Morgan Freeman is very comfortable as Eddie the commentator in what is almost a repeat of his performance in ""The Shawshank Redemption"".<br/><br/>The trouble with Gothic Romance is that we know from the start that the protagonists are going to fail no matter how hard they try. Their failing is not a function of some fatal flaw in their make-up, but because the Universe is against them. Failure is thus reassuring. Clint however points out that this should not stop us from trying. Maggie at least gave it her best shot. For her, the ride was worth it. ."

","This is paragonless cinematic storytelling. Clint Eastwood plays an aging boxing trainer who reluctantly takes under his tutelage an aspiring female pugilist, played by Hilary Swank. Boxing is just a sub-genre here, providing a platform for a compelling story about life circumstances, human character, and the vagaries of fate. Morgan Freeman, in a near flawless performance, plays Eastwood's sidekick in the management of a decrepit gym. Hilary Swank is brilliant in the portrayal of someone determined to realize a dream against tough odds, and overcome humble beginnings. The pool of characters in this movie is an excellent sample, or so it seems, of the human landscape in modern society. You will relate to one or more of them as they cope with personal demons and jockey for position in the rat race. This, however, is not a reprocessed rags to riches tale a la ""ROCKY"" , as many moviegoers would rather have it, I'm sure. This movie imparts a brutal reminder that there is absolutely no method to the madness of fate, and that in the boxing ring of life, good people are not always the last ones standing. This is as good a film as you'll ever have the opportunity to watch. To say otherwise, I respectfully submit, would be a hopeless attempt at contrariety."

It was always an element within the fight, one that is not normally noticed in a boxing movie.<br/><br/>Then if you remember, Morgan Freeman wouldn't make the trip to Vegas for the title fight, so Clint hired a local trainer. A few rounds in, the local trainer kept putting the stool in the corner, and in one scene, Clint yanks it from him, and says, ""I'll do that"".

"anhedonia","7","1","2","16 February 2005"," Clint Eastwood is a national treasure
","At first glance, ""Million Dollar Baby"" seems like it should be pedestrian fare. An aging boxing trainer and his old sidekick take in a poor white girl who dreams of becoming a champ and, together, they work to get to the top. It's the sort of pulpy stuff the likes of Jim Thompson and Charles Willeford might have reveled in.<br/><br/>So why does ""Million Dollar Baby"" work? One reason: Clint Eastwood.<br/><br/>At 75, Eastwood might very well be the best American filmmaker working today. A true auteur, it's evident of his amazing talent that he's taken a generally conventional story and turned it into a rich, deep, insightful character study.<br/><br/>As for conservatives enraged by the film: Get real. They're all for promoting free thought and expression so long as it doesn't differ from what they believe, their worldview. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a movie. What the characters do, the decisions they make fit with what makes the story work.<br/><br/>There's no great conspiracy or agenda at work. It's good storytelling and conservative hosts should worry more about having an administration that fabricates evidence and seems quite keen on stifling due process and expression in the name of security. Now, that's a frightening agenda.<br/><br/>What propels ""Million Dollar Baby"" are three spectacular performances. Hilary Swank, as the young wannabe champ Maggie Fitzgerald, proves beyond any doubt that her Best Actress Oscar for ""Boys Don't Cry"" (1999) was no fluke. She imbues Maggie with grit, determination and courage; and when the story requires her to change focus, she makes Maggie vulnerable without ever making her weak. After watching Swank in this film, you'll understand why she's winning all the awards for her performance.<br/><br/>Eastwood as the trainer Frankie Dunn and Morgan Freeman as his assistant Eddie Dupris rarely have been better. Not only is he a great filmmaker, Eastwood's also turned into a fine actor. Frankie, like many of Eastwood characters, is a man of few words. He struggles with his own dilemmas and remains emotionally distant. Yet, there's real depth of feeling in Eastwood's portrayal. He conveys more genuine emotion with his craggy, weathered face than most actors can with superb dialogue and Actor's Studio training.<br/><br/>Watching Eastwood and Freeman work together is a treat. There's tremendous chemistry between them. They play off each other with supreme ease like an old couple very familiar with each other's idiosyncrasies. They're good friends, old pros whose riffs go down smoothly like a glass of great scotch.<br/><br/>Despite directing many films, Eastwood always was known primarily as an actor. But in the last several years, he has emerged as one of America's great filmmakers with work such as ""Unforgiven"" (1992) and ""Mystic River"" (2003). Heck, Eastwood even turned that horrible novel, ""The Bridges of Madison County,"" into a good film in 1995.<br/><br/>True, ""Million Dollar Baby"" works with numerous cinematic clichés. But Eastwood still creates visual poetry, from his choice of camera angles to eliciting tender, effective and moving performances, from his superb use of his own musical score to creating the perfect mood.<br/><br/>The film's flaw perhaps is the over-use of Freeman's voice-over narration. Telling an audience what to think, how to feel, the real emotion of a particular moment are something the actors must convey through their performances; Eastwood and screenwriter Paul Haggis shouldn't have to rely on narration. Narration is an easy way for screenwriters to cheat and, more often than not, I got the feeling that's exactly what Haggis was doing.<br/><br/>Freeman's voice isn't the issue here. That's amazing. But, at times, his narration is obtrusive. The reason for the narration's made clear at the end, but I wish Eastwood had limited its use, that he'd used it as cleverly as he did his music.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, ""Million Dollar Baby"" remains touching, funny, poignant, powerful. It's a superbly acted film made by a master craftsman."
"the_godfather424","8","1","2","13 February 2005"," This film nearly made me cry
","Clint Eastwood made a fine film but I think it only makes 4/5 of a million. I am a big Eastwood fan by the way. Eastwood is boxing club owner and manager Frankie Dunn, who has an untold past between him and his daughter. One day he meets Maggie Fitzgerald(Hilary Swank), who tries to make Frankie her boxing manager. During their journey to the top of the boxing world they become more of friends as anyone else can until a fatal injury that ruins Maggie's life. The film starts out very slow in the beginning. They should have shortened the beginning and beginned with the start of Frankie and Maggie in the boxing fights. I expected it to be a lot like ""Rocky"" with its joyful theme that comes on during the fights and training but I can't say that Eastwood's music is bad. It is more of a film for adults. The film nearly made me cry because of the subject matter. When Maggie died, the film changed its direction afterwards and we won't even know what happens to Frankie next. What made me nearly cry is the whole time that Maggie was in the hospital bed. I knew she was going to die anyway. Freeman does a great performance. The make-up is first-rate and the best(I think it is going to win an Oscar for that). The big part of the picture is Swank's performance. She is going to take the Oscar this year no matter what. Clint's direction and performance is good but ""The Aviator""s Scorsese and Dicaprio is probably going to win. The movie is good but i'll give it an 8/10."

I knew the story wan't going to end like Rocky but what happened threw me way off course. I know it was depressing and not the uplifting feeling we were looking for but it did have some unrealistic things happening that bothered me. Could Frankie really have done what he did without getting caught? No. Any yes, everyone knows she would have been named champ based on disqualification. I know these things aren't central to the theme of the movie but don't treat us like we're stupid. They could have changed the screenplay to make it more factual and still kept to the same storyline. Still a great movie. If Swank doesn't win Best Actress she was robbed. I think with this picture she might have positioned herself as the top actress in Hollywood (any thoughts on this?). I mean real actress, not movie star. Morgan Freeman was fantastic as usual and Clint was good but not his best acting work. I think the reason I'm writing this piece is due to the fact that I had such high expectations for this film, over the past week I've had several people say it was the best they've ever seen.

","I went to see Million dollar baby after reading raves over it. I carefully avoided reading anything that alluded to what happens in the latter part of the movie, but I knew it was going to be emotional.<br/><br/>This is a story of a young woman (Hilary Swank)who has nothing, but she wants to be something/somebody by learning to box. Her persistence pays off when a well known trainer (Clint Eastwood) agrees to coach her, though reluctantly. With training and hard work she becomes highly successful, and almost unbeatable. Her finances improve 'considerably'.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD: <br/><br/>The movie is told from the eyes of the trainer's assistant (Morgan Freeman). That alone gave me a hint of what was to come, but I was not prepared for the turn the movie took. I was totally overwhelmed. It was such a powerful experience that next morning I was still feeling the emotions. The acting is subtle and powerful by all three major characters. There is no melodrama, no overacting, which shows that emotions CAN be communicated with subtlety just as powerfully as with any other approaches. Eastwood deserves a lot of credit as director.<br/><br/>Major SPOILER ahead: There are several unanswered questions, like what happened to the boxer who injured Maggie by throwing an illegal punch? What were the legal implications? Did Maggie or Frankie or Freeman's character feel a rage over what had happened? The events in the movie are obviously devastating and these questions may actually be only minor points when it comes to developing the characters. Nothing could reverse what happened to Maggie, and what Frankie eventually did was out of love, which made it 'right' from my perspective. I am still heartbroken for these characters. This is what life is. It is not a 'feel good' movie but it is a very powerful one. It definitely deserves the best picture Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>The boxing gym atmosphere is created very well. The minor characters too are portrayed well. I thought the crazy guy was a bit of a nuisance in terms of the flow of the story, but again the purpose was to create an atmosphere and bring characters to life. This was done extremely well. There are touches of humor throughout, which add to the entertainment value, but this is a movie that will make you think about life, values, and our intentions.<br/><br/>I will probably see it again to fill in on anything I may have missed. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that appreciates drama."

The story is simple, deep, but still interesting, and provides many humorous, dramatic, shocking, and entertaining moments. Much better then Mystic River, which was only worth seeing once, but this is a movie that will be remembered because you can tell Clint was passionate about it, very, and it comes into you. Its better then Rocky, so its the best boxing movie, even though there's only a total of about 20 to 30 mins of actual boxing, but even in that area it beats Rocky which had 1 fight only, the fights are sometimes funny, sometimes enthralling, and most of the time shocking. Ebert actually got one right this year, somewhat, he said this was the best film of the year, close, id say the fourth, Alexander, Troy, and Passion of the Christ are still the top three, for me, not for very many else, but i don't care, i like what i like.

"seattlebookdude","Null","1","2","6 February 2005"," Uneven but mostly satisfying
","I'll skip the full-blown review, as you have undoubtedly plowed through dozens already. <br/><br/>As brilliant as director Eastwood continues to be in presenting carefully nuanced main characters, he falls short when it comes to his supporting players. Margaret's family were too broadly drawn (though the actress playing her mother did pretty well with the script she was given), and the ""Blue Bear"" was needlessly reduced to a one-dimensional cartoon heavy. Had the latter been portrayed as a morally neutral opponent - simply a professional athlete defending her title - the overall tone of the film would have been a bit more thoughtful. Why go for the stereotype Evil Cheating Bad Girl? Was Eastwood afraid we wouldn't root hard enough for Maggie if her opponent were presented as anything other than irredeemably wicked? And, on the same note, the Big Eventful Punch ought not to have been any less tragic had it been presented as a legal (or even accidental) blow. In this sense, Eastwood sort of took the easy way out. (One might add that in 99 fights out of 100, a fighter who hits his or her opponent while the opponent is already on the canvas is going to be immediately disqualified.) <br/><br/>The controversial social issue at the heart of the last act of the movie was handled better than I had expected it would be. I did not feel that it was excessively manipulative. Indeed, under the circumstances it was handled in a less sentimental manner than many other directors might have approached it. <br/><br/>Hilary Swank deserves ten Oscars for her phenomenal performance. It's a shame they can only give her one - and rest assured that they will. Morgan Freeman is reliable in a role which - let's face it - differs little from most others he has played in the last ten years. He ought to be expected to play this sort of role in his sleep by now. Yet he always manages to find something fresh in these seemingly similar characters, and he is always utterly believable. Clint's Frankie is perhaps a bit too self-consciously crusty, and how many times do we have to see the rough-edged curmudgeon with refined literary taste to recognize one of Hollywood's more irritating modern stereotypes? (Rowdy Yates reads Yeats! How clever.) <br/><br/>The camera work was quite good, but the sound editing was generally poor; I suspect a good deal of intelligent dialogue was missed by the audience as a result. <br/><br/>All in all, worth the ten bucks, especially for Ms Swank's sublime performance."

These two guys are the best of the older actors that are still around. AS for Swank, I don't believe I've ever really cared for any of her movies, good or bad...but this film was great for her.

A completely character-driven story, Million Dollar Baby had excellently textured characters, brilliantly but subtly acted by the main three, Eastwood, Swank, and Freeman. The pace is easy; it carries the viewer along, keeping him involved without sweeping him away.<br/><br/>But if you're going to base your movie on the characters' distinctive, impressive, and sometimes surprising actions in the film, on what they have gone through off-screen in their pasts, don't you have an obligation to the viewer to reveal what happened in their pasts that account for how they're responding to the events of the present? In Freeman's case, the viewer gets satisfaction. Scrap (Freeman) reveals to Maggie (Swank), and thereby to the viewer, all about his 109 fights, how he lost his eye, what happened to result in him settling in as a janitor in Frankie's (Eastwood) gym, and why he risks his old body to come to Danger's defense.<br/><br/>But Scrap is a secondary character. You don't get the same satisfaction with the mains.<br/><br/>Frankie feels so guilty about something that happened between him and his daughter in the past that he goes to Mass and sends her a letter every week for years on end, and never gains absolution. What happened? Not knowing, the viewer is forced simply to accept at face value that Frankie would all but turn his life over to taking care of Maggie. The acting is so good, we can accept it, but the movie loses some of its power by not explaining to us.<br/><br/>Same for Maggie. She is willing to sacrifice her body for her dreams and she displays an ambition so powerful it's nearly superhuman. It all comes, we learn, from her relationship with her father. But who was he, what happened to him, and how was he such a powerful influence on her? The movie never tells us. And so, as Maggie dedicates herself to Frankie, again, we can accept it at face value, but since we don't know these important details about her, that's all we can do -- we cannot fully understand her. Thus, again, the movie loses some of its power.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm asking the impossible. Many will say, ""Just appreciate the movie for the masterpiece of characterization and acting that it is."" And I do. I do appreciate it. I appreciate how the characters interact, their dialog, the richness of their portrayals. I appreciate the movie's use of light and shadow to create mood, its subtle cinematography, its understated way of presenting the characters to the viewer.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I am left not . . . quite . . . satisfied.<br/><br/>8 of 10"
"miknnik","Null","1","2","30 January 2005"," Simple but profound story
","No one or no movie can please everyone, but I'd like to think that even those who complain how depressing Million Dollar Baby is are suffering from a severe case of empathy. Just in case you are not too familiar with that territory of your emotion, it happens when one cares about someone else. After all, those same people don't get depressed after watching cartoonish, two-dimensional characters getting blown to bits in other movies. Calling M$B a boxing movie is like saying Amadeus was a biographic movie of Mozart. As all the critics and other reviewers point out, this movie is about human relationships, about a platonic but intense bond between two strangers who needed each other that transcends time, place, race and creed. That's why most viewers are singing praises of M$B. Having said that, the movie is full of light moments--Frankie tormenting a Catholic priest with questions about Holy Trinity and Immaculate Conception, a 'night socks/day socks' conversation between Scrap and Frankie. And let's not forget that delusional 'Danger' kid. With all these funny scenes and Maggie's meteoric rise as a female boxer, the ending may catch some viewers off-guard, but I don't think reading a 'spoiler' review will diminish your movie experience because M$B touches you at a much deeper level.<br/><br/>I like just about everything about the movie. And just about everything in it is understated, allowing us viewers to draw our own conclusions to fill the gaps. When Frankie and Maggie meet for the first time, he asks two questions, ""Do I owe you money?"" ""Do I know your Mama?"" implying right off the bat that he probably doesn't have a stellar financial/credit background, and that he probably didn't enjoy monogamous relationships in the past. The people who saw the film agree that the story is about a surrogate father-daughter love story. There's no question about that, and yet you'll notice Maggie and Frankie never express their love for each other in words, never utter those most overused words, I love you. We just know they do when Maggie says ""I got nobody but you, Frankie,"" or when he takes a quick peek at her checkbook like a worried father checking to see if his girl is eating right. Or, when he finally reveals what she means to him by telling her the meaning of her ring name. Maggie asks for only two things from Frankie. Both times he grants the wish of his darling girl, grudgingly first time, against his own desire and belief second time. Though the movie runs over two hours, it has the quality of a short story. Some scenes have the feel of Rembrandt paintings. Boxing may be the integral part that bonds all three main characters, but the core of the story is the tie that binds Maggie and Frankie, and there's not much else in the film. We'll never know why he has a strained relationship with his own daughter (though it's not hard to imagine if you remember those two questions mentioned above), or what happens to Frankie at the end because that's another story. But I do wonder. The last scene is a shot of the roadside diner that Maggie and Frankie visited on the road trip back from Missouri. As the camera closes in, one can see the back of an old man at the counter through the dirty window pane. I bet most people thought, HOPED, it was Frankie, but we never get to see the face of the man. Yeah, I wonder..."
"bigtint24","Null","1","2","30 January 2005"," Father, Son, and Holy Ghost--religious imagery in ""Baby""
","I have seen ""Million Dollar Baby"" twice now and have been absolutely blown away by the subtle symbols present throughout-- and astounded by this religious allegory Eastwood has created.<br/><br/>First of all, we see Frankie at church, and he asks the priest about the trinity. He can't figure out how the trinity works. How can three beings be one being at the same time? Something clicked in my head (having seen the movie before), and I couldn't believe how I missed it the first time around.<br/><br/>Frankie is the Father, Freeman is the Ghost, and Maggie or Mcuishla (sp?) is the Messiah or Son or The Christ Figure.<br/><br/>Let's look at the facts that Eastwood gives us.<br/><br/>The afore mentioned question of the trinity plainly sets up this theory. When Frankie finally takes Maggie on to be his fighter it's her birthday--32 to be exact--as if Christ is being born. IMMEDIATELY after the first fight, Frankie asks the priest about the immaculate conception...with a smile.<br/><br/>Maggie goes through her trials and is lead into temptation by the Holy Spirit (Freeman) when he takes her to see the slick manager at the diner. She is left ""in the desert"" as it were like Christ to fend of this temptation. Of course it's a great offer, but she must stay with here offer.<br/><br/>Frankie also gives here the name Mcuishla almost Messiah. And we find out that it means my darling, My BLOOD at the end of the film.<br/><br/>After Maggie's neck injury she's seen lying on the mat in a Christ like pose with the red stool sticking out like a crown of thorns.<br/><br/>In the hospital bed, Maggie is frighteningly close to most popular images of Christ. Her brown locks draped over her face, sores appear on her body like Christ on the cross. Blood drips down her chin after she bites her tongue.<br/><br/>And then, Maggie dies when she is 33 years old. The age of Christ at his death.<br/><br/>Freeman is the Holy Spirit as he breathes the voice into the film. He is ""the body"" of the gym as he lives in the basement.<br/><br/>Of course, Frankie is the father. He creates Maggie, sacrifices her, names her. Maggie is always shot on the right side of him. As Jesus is seated at the right side of the Father.<br/><br/>There's a great parallel when Clint is at the church for the final time and he says, ""she's not asking for God's help, she's asking for mine"". That blatant connection is just another hint how Eastwood wants us to be thinking in this film.<br/><br/>You should really keep your eye open to look for these images. And, of course, enjoy this brilliant movie for all of its other attributes."

","I just saw ""Baby"" yesterday and I'm still half in a daze over the impact it made on me. The characters were excellently portrayed. So what if all of the actors cast for their parts have remained little changed from other similar roles? They may be typecast, but isn't it better to get actors with experience in their role situations than trying to get others to ADAPT to characters very UNLIKE their own personalities? Would you want the three main characters to be portrayed by Matt Damon, Eddie Murphey, and Kate Winslet? Could they ADAPT? Who cares if they could? The casting director did his job. The cast is perfect and the writing was right on the mark. <br/><br/>I am a boxing fan and I have been since my teenage days (I'm now 62) and I was impressed with the near accuracy of the films boxing sequences. Even the ending---which leaves many unanswered questions--was perfect. <br/><br/>I hope that the motion picture academy recognizes the brilliance of this film and bestows several Oscars to its participants.<br/><br/>ONE THING MORE:<br/><br/>I must confess that I haven't read ALL the comments made earlier regarding this film, but I suspect that few if any of the commentators noticed something I did about the movie.<br/><br/>It contained little or NO PROFANITY and little if any SMOKING! How great to realize that these are two ingredients we can do without--in the movies AND in our lives.<br/><br/>WHY DOES THE FILM INDUSTRY USE THE TERM ""contains ADULT language"" in its ratings? The term should be ""contains PROFANITY!"" NORMAL adults don't speak with profanity. People I care to associate with need not use profanity---even when they get EXCITED!! How do they manage to express their aggression without profanity, some of you may wonder. It CAN be done and IS done by most adults.<br/><br/>Is the lesson we want to teach youngsters---adults swear like crazy and that's O.K.??

There was Morgan Freeman's depiction of a retired fighter left wanting for more. There was Hillary Swank's struggle from rags to riches and her struggle to prove she was capable of fighting in a sport dominated by males.

"MOscarbradley","8","1","2","25 January 2005"," A Classic
","The title is deceptive. It could be a Betty Grable picture - it once was a Priscilla Lane/Ronnie Regan movie - or a piece of show-biz hype about triumph over adversity. In fact, for it's first half that is exactly what it is and if the plot seems formulaic, Eastwood imbues it with such a feeling for character and milieu that cliché is the last thing you are likely to think of. Then about mid-way it takes a darker turn. Guilt and redemption come to the fore and the up-beat triumphalism of what has gone before is jettisoned in favor of another of Eastwood's bleak studies of the American malaise. Not a bad thing given his skill in handling this kind of material, though you may come away from the film admiring it rather more than you actually like it.<br/><br/>As a director Eastwood has never been one to blind you with technique; this is an old-fashioned movie in the very best sense. The performances and the script drive it and even when it's at it's most austere the closest Eastwood comes to being 'cinematic' is a series of slow dissolves to blackness. And those performances are very fine indeed. If Hilary Swank fits her part of the trailer-trash hick who wants to be a boxer like the proverbial glove she, nevertheless, seems to find shadings and depth in her character that lifts her out of the ordinary.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman, virtually monosyllabic as an aging ex-boxer, conveys more with a look than most actors could do with a barrage of words. He is so much in character here that even his clothes seem to fit him like a second skin. But ultimately the film belongs to Eastwood in every sense. As a director he has developed a classic style that is the very antithesis of what modern movies are about; as an actor he has learned how to inhabit the character he plays with effortless skill. His performance here may well be the best thing he has done on screen, certainly on par with his William Munny in ""Unforgiven"" and this dark, sad, forgiving film bears mention in the same breath as both ""Unforgiven"" and last year's ""Mystic River""."
"willembaars","7","1","2","24 January 2005"," Good, but there is a better one about this subject
","I agree: Million Dollar baby is a beautiful and emotional movie. From the very beginning of the movie you already have an idea about what the movie will end like. But the good thing is that it ends differently, so quite surprising. I really liked the subtle way in which Eastwood handles the theme (especially from the moment that Hillary Swank seems to be paralyzed). I am sure the movie will win loads of Oscars. Fair enough. But the real reason why I write this is to let you know that there is a movie which is about the same kind of themes (controversial friendship, euthanasia), but done better than this done. It is called Simon and it is the Dutch nominee for the Oscars. People think the movie won't be nominated at the end because the themes are too controversial for the Oscar-jury-members. But if this appears to be the reason why Simon won't win an Oscar, than Million Dollar Baby doesn't deserve nominated either. Go watch and see Simon: very funny, very beautiful, very much about life in The Netherlands!"
"seaview1","Null","1","2","20 January 2005"," Million Dollar Baby is rich in emotion
","Million Dollar Baby is rich in emotion Clint Eastwood's latest directorial effort, Million Dollar Baby, is a drama that starts in the boxing ring and ends in the heart. It is a poignant tale about hope, failure, and old ghosts. It is also the best film Eastwood has ever made.<br/><br/>Frankie Dunn is an aging owner of a boxing gym who trains a boxer to the brink of a title fight only to miss a timely opportunity. When an aspiring female boxer, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), approaches him for training, he rebuffs her as just a girl boxer and too old at 31 years. Maggie is a waitress whose desire to fight is her ultimate dream as she attempts to make something of her life that has been a rural, backwoods existence. Dunn's best friend, Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman), takes a liking to the boxer's heart and work ethic, and eventually the two win Frankie over. Frankie's rules are to never question him in training and to always protect oneself in the ring. A slow but gradual learning curve ensues as Maggie becomes a polished boxer who displays a stunning record of wins, mostly by knockouts. Meanwhile, Frankie takes a liking to his protégé and begins to become attached to her. Their relationship is a contrast to his personal demons. His soul struggles with doubt and guilt as he attends church with constant regularity and the letters he sends to his estranged daughter are always returned unopened.<br/><br/>Maggie becomes the focal point of Frankie's world as she attracts boxing matches from top competition which leads to a possible championship in Las Vegas. It is at this point that the story takes a path that is unexpected and startling. It is here that two lives are changed forever and boxing seems trivial in light of subsequent events. And it is here that hard choices and decisions are made.<br/><br/>Based on a group of stories by the late F. X. Toole, Paul Haggis's screenplay is a beauty, filled with memorable dialogue and a story arc that takes its audience on a journey of humanity. The leading cast makes the most of the material. The scenes between Eastwood and Freeman ring true and validate two characters that go way back. Most actors pale in comparison to these two consummate pros at the height of their powers. Morgan Freeman, whose character narrates the story much as he did in Shawshank Redemption, lends strong support. Hilary Swank, who won an Oscar in Boys Don't Cry, is outstanding in a role which required rigorous training while etching a vivid character whose life takes a dramatic shift. Eastwood has always been a solid director and producer. While his early films took advantage of his tough guy image and did not require much thespian range, he filled those roles quite successfully. In recent years, he has grown as director and as a performer by allowing himself some choice dramatic projects (Unforgiven and Bridges of Madison County). But this is without a doubt his greatest piece of acting. He has allowed himself to let go and get to his inner self, and the results are touching and impressive.<br/><br/>As a director, Eastwood has proved with films like Unforgiven and Mystic River that he has a strong, disciplined vision. His work here is most assured and it is very evident that he has matched if not surpassed his previous highs. He is patient and methodical in how he adds layers upon layers of dialogue and scenes to develop his characters into full blooded people. When Maggie approaches Frankie at first, he has no interest in training her, but you know these two will somehow end up working together. Eastwood does not go for easy clichés as she tries to win him over with help from Eddie. Even when he uses tried and true formulas, he does them well. And when Frankie decides to give her a chance, the journey is earned believably. Eastwood's direction is economic and lean. In fact, the pacing is deliberate and there is really no extraneous material (as in earlier good efforts like The Outlaw Josie Wales) to cut or trim. It may be the best job of directing this past year.<br/><br/>Technical categories are strong particularly in cinematography with the darkly lit scenes that add so much to the mood and texture of the moment, and the editing which lends much urgency to the fights and offers unique transitions in the dramatic scenes. (It is interesting that as Maggie ascends to bigger fight venues, the crowds are more affluent and better dressed by the costume department.) Eastwood does a pretty good job of composing some eloquent music. What a multitalented threat he is becoming! There is not much to quibble with this film. Sure, Maggie's white trash family is a bit too stereotypical and one dimensional. We don't get to the bottom of Frankie's family background as much as we'd like. Some of the fights are bloody and violent but not particularly gratuitous or self serving as in Raging Bull.<br/><br/>What ostensibly starts out as a pretty darn good boxing story becomes transformed into a powerful human drama that eschews even its fighting pedigree. Boxing is just a pretext for a much larger canvas. There is the drama of individual struggle and achievement, yet the story aims much higher and raises the ante in tone and direction in ways the audience can't quite anticipate. Eastwood challenges himself and the audience with a story that is not easy and pat. It is a movie that dares to go to areas that are controversial and gut wrenching. While audiences may have a tough time sitting through Million Dollar Baby a second or third time, they sure as hell will be grateful they did just once.<br/><br/>**** out of ****"

","I recently read the late F.X. Toole's only novel, 'Pound for Pound'; but watch 'Million Dollar Baby', derived from an earlier short story of Toole's, and you enter exactly the same world, that of seedy gyms occupied by old men for whom life is boxing, and boxing is life. The twist in this tale is that the central boxer is a woman; although the meaning of title eventually becomes apparent in a way you don't at first suspect. However, I found the film a little short on back story, the lead male characters (played by director Clint Eastwood, and fellow veteran Morgan Freeman) seem weary without explanation; sighing, which both are good at, is not in itself a sign of profundity. And rather as it did in 'The Shawshank Redemption', Morgan's narration softens the movie, which in fact is surprisingly unvisceral for a story about fighting. Likewise, the issue of how a woman finds social acceptance as a boxer is skirted; Hilary Swank's character feels more at home here than she does anywhere else, although we learn nothing of how she came to discover that boxing was her thing. Of course, in many ways, this film is better for not being 'Rocky'; but I still wonder, did it have to be quite so low-key?"
"sddavis63","6","2","7","24 September 2007"," Good Story; Too Many Caricatures For Me
","I can't say that I've ever been interested in women's boxing (I'm not really a fan of any kind of boxing to be honest) but this story did interest me so I gave it a look see. It's a pretty good, traditional kind of ""underdog goes for it"" story with a solid cast that held my interest, although I can't honestly say that I was ever on the edge of my seat with any of this.<br/><br/>The lead characters are all well played. Hilary Swank surprised me in the role of Maggie Fitzgerald, the 31 year old who decides she wants to be a professional boxer to get out of her life as a waitress. She handled the part very well and was pretty believable. Clint Eastwood played her manager, Frankie Dunn. Personally, I thought he was showing his age a bit here but again he was solid in the role of the over-cautious manager, estranged from his daughter and with some definite secrets in his life. Morgan Freeman, as always, pulled off his part as Eddie Du Pris quite well. He also had probably the funniest lines of the movie: first when he was explaining to Frankie why his socks had so many holes, and then after he KO'd the young fighter who hurt his friend - the mentally challenged ""Danger"" (Jay Baruchel) - and said simply ""there's 110"" - a reference to an earlier scene when we learned he had quit boxing after 109 fights.<br/><br/>The primary thing I didn't like about the movie were the over-the-top caricatures. Danger was one example. There was Maggie's stereotypical hillbilly, welfare family. There was the evil champ (the female Clubber Lang, I guess) who would stop at nothing to stop Maggie from getting her title. I didn't think any of those caricatures were really necessary to the plot, and frankly I found those characters irritating. Aside from that, though, I thought this was pretty good stuff.<br/><br/>6/10"

Listen people: it's always going to be sad if someone breaks their neck in the prime of their game and subsequently dies, but just because that's always sad doesn't mean it's always a good film.

","It's hard for me to say exactly why I hated this movie. Hate may be a strong word, but I was angry with this movie and I will try here to explain exactly why.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that seems to be trying too hard to pack in drama and, in doing so, it spreads itself too thin. I can identify what I would call three main plots of the movie. Frank's (Clint Eastwood) personal struggle with his past, Maggie's (Hillary Swank) struggle (with Eastwood's help) to become a champion boxer, and Maggie's struggles after the title fight. A good deal of time is spent developing all three, and, while they all work, I find that the movie packs too many knockout punches. One might think that these plots along with good performances by the actors would lead to a very poignant movie, but I find that it tries to hard. The movie doesn't seem to know what it is. It is a Rocky story (albeit with a girl this time), it's about an old man struggling with demons, it's about a girl struggling to overcome physical obstacles. We've, of course, seen all these before, and this is not enough in itself to make me hate the movie, but each plot is not told in enough detail. Maggie is a natural once she gets a little help from Frank. Frank constantly beats himself up over his daughter, but we never find out exactly why. There's Maggie's family, an over the top white trash ""hillbilly"" family that seems hellbent on being worthless and self-serving. We understand why Maggie wanted badly to get out, but we don't really know what lead her to be a boxer. <br/><br/>There's Morgan Freeman, whose job it is in this movie to help Frank and Maggie develop as characters, he has no real story of his own. I can get into movies that are less than uplifting, but this movie was ridiculous. <br/><br/>It was good, but not great, and, frankly, I don't see what all the fuss is about."

And I'm about to break it. <br/><br/>So if you don't want to know how ""Million Dollar Baby"" ends, now's the time to turn the page.<br/><br/>But at the rate advocates in the disabled community are mobilizing in outrage, the plot won't be a secret for long.<br/><br/>In the climax of the Clint Eastwood film, Frankie Dunn (played by Eastwood) grants the request of the Hilary Swank character, Maggie Fitzgerald, to die. She has gone from prizefighter to quadriplegic in classic slow-motion Hollywood style.<br/><br/>Death is portrayed as the rational, obviously preferable alternative to living with such a disability.<br/><br/>Laura Hershey, a Denver disability-rights activist who uses a wheelchair, says it reflects Eastwood's hostile attitude toward the disabled.<br/><br/>Amy Robertson, a disability-rights lawyer in Denver, calls it ""Eastwood's vendetta.""<br/><br/>Eastwood, meanwhile, has said, ""How people feel about that is up to them.""<br/><br/>Fair enough, say Hershey, Robertson and members of the disabled-rights organization Not Dead Yet.<br/><br/>They're feeling furious.<br/><br/>Eastwood has long been considered a villain to the disabled.<br/><br/>In 1996, Diane zum Brunnen visited his hotel in Carmel, Calif., and discovered two violations of the Americans With Disabilities Act. When numerous letters of complaint went unanswered, the disabled woman filed suit. Eastwood ultimately was ordered to bring the hotel into compliance, but not before he'd spent $600,000 fighting the lawsuit.<br/><br/>He later testified before Congress in support of a bill to prevent people from suing under ADA without giving defendants 90 days to come into compliance. It didn't pass.<br/><br/>""There are plenty of people who are praising the hell out of this movie,"" Robertson said. ""But if someone was speaking out in favor of segregation or defending the Ku Klux Klan and five years later played a character in a movie who kills all the black characters, would anybody miss that?""<br/><br/>For her part, Hershey objects to the film's portrayal of life as a quadriplegic.<br/><br/>""Nobody's saying it's easy,"" she said. But the depiction of Fitzgerald bedridden in a nursing home, losing her leg to untreated bed sores, having no mobility, no support, no future, is ""nightmarish.""<br/><br/>""It creates the feeling that having a disability is ... worse than death,"" she said.<br/><br/>Hershey, who has spinal muscular atrophy, is proof that's not true. She works for the state in health-care policy and financing, is a successful writer and has been an outspoken activist for the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition.<br/><br/>She said the acceptance of ""Million Dollar Baby"" - never mind the acclaim - betrays the profound prejudice that informs the right-to-die movement.<br/><br/>""The so-called right-to-die movement raises ... serious alarms,"" she said.<br/><br/>Instead of offering the disabled assisted suicide, they should be offered help, she said.<br/><br/>""There are other options,"" she said. ""And if it really is about choice, then anybody that wants to should be able to walk into a doctor's office and request a lethal injection. Why restrict it to people who have disabilities and disorders?""<br/><br/>The activists ripped critics for failing even to acknowledge the controversy.<br/><br/>""For most of them, this was not even on their radar screens, whereas any other stereotypical, distorted, inaccurate, screwed-up image of another minority group would be cause at least for comment or debate,"" Hershey said.<br/><br/>Now, as plans are finalized for Oscar-night protests and other demonstrations, that silence is about to end.<br/><br/>""What I hope - if nothing else - is that this gets people talking and thinking about what's going on in this movie,"" Hershey said.<br/><br/>And preventing Eastwood from cleaning up at the Oscars, well, that just might make their day.<br/><br/>Diane Carman's column appears Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday.

","I never cease to be amazed at how easily manipulated the American public can be: witness the rave reviews and awards lavished on Eastwood-directed movies: that pretentious excuse for a Western, ""Unforgiven,"" got the Oscar for Best Picture for Goodness' sake! As for MDB, its plot is full of clichés and inconsistencies that leave thinking viewers frustrated. (Judging from some of the reviews on this site it seems that I'm not the only one to have been mostly underwhelmed by this Eastwood amateurish confection.) After the first 15 minutes of listening to Morgan Freeman's sappy voice-over comments I felt like beating up Walter Brennan. The best I can say about this movie is that Clint Eastwood gives his best performance since ""Revenge of the Creature."""
"Cosmoeticadotcom","3","2","8","14 September 2008"," Bad
","The problem is in the details. Every cliché from ever boxing film before it is used, from the two versions of The Champ, to John Garfield films, to Jimmy Cagney's City For Conquest, to Kirk Douglas's Champion, to the Rocky films, Raging Bull, and the earlier girl fight film, Girlfight. Name a scene in this film and it's a cliché. Eastwood's trainer, Franky Dunn, speaks in a hoarse, gruff manner like Burgess Meredith's Mickey from the Rocky films. Whenever his fighter, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), is losing a fight, Franky spouts a cliché like, 'She's younger, stronger, and a better fighter than you. What're you gonna do about it?' Wham-bam- she knocks out her opponent. Dunn's lone employee at the gym he owns, the Hit Pit, where Maggie shows up in, is an old washed up, one-eyed boxer-cum-janitor (cliché) played by Morgan Freeman (as Scrap Dupris), in another of his trite Wise, Old Negro roles. Freeman's character also narrates the film, punctuating the clichéd scenes, cardboard acting, and all the rest with the most obvious of restatements of what we have just witnessed. Let's see- what other clichés? There is a retarded boxer named Danger (Jay Baruchel), whom Scrap takes under his wing. There is a cocky fighter named Shawrelle Berry (Anthony Mackie), who thinks he's hot. Of course, he beats the crap out of Danger, only to have blind old Scrap kick his ass with only a single punch. This pabulum that has nothing to do with the actual film's narrative, and serves only to give Freeman his Oscar moment, is almost as bad as the whole premise of the film- that anyone gives a damn about female boxing. To take the film's version of reality, one would think that female boxing is at the height of where male boxing was last century. Even male boxing is in the dumps. Female boxing is a joke sport- right there with obstacles course running with kitchen appliances strapped to your back. Perhaps the most obvious cliché comes when an up and coming boxer of Franky's stabs him in the back to go with another manager, then wins a title.<br/><br/>Those are merely the boxing movie clichés. As for the technical aspects, Eastwood's palette is always limited, his 'key' moments always muddily filmed. Too often, characters wander in and out of frame, which suggests a poorly constructed scene. And, to come full circle, the DVD is a ripoff, with nothing of any real value. Many single DVD films have far more than this bloated 2 DVD set. Pass on this film and find a good version of Champion or City For Conquest, instead."

","Million Dollar Baby may be the worst movie I have ever seen. The worst thing about it is that it could have been so much better. The first half was excellent. Hilary Swank certainly deserves her Oscar. Perhaps the other Oscars are also deserved. However, the movie was seriously flawed. In the first place, Eastwood's character, Frankie, failed in the most important responsibility of a manager and trainer. How could he not have warned his fighter never to turn her back on a dirty fighter? The movie never even indicated how the fight ended. Was the dirty fighter disqualified? Was she tried for assault and battery? Hitting a fighter with an illegal blow, especially one that is so devastating, is just as wrong as taking a gun into the boxing ring! Did Maggie's mother and sister inherit all her money as they would have if no preventive action was taken? Rather than feeling sorry for himself, as Frankie Dunn did, he should have thought of giving Maggie a reason to live. She should have sued the boxing association for allowing dirty fighters. The dirty fighter, Billie, should have been sued in civil court in addition to a criminal charge. Maggie might very well have lived long enough to win in court and her last act could have prevented another tragedy like the one she suffered."

","This film contains all the most infuriating elements of film-making. That's not to say it is a bad movie, but more a movie that elicits little genuine emotion. The little true feeling comes from the character of Maggie, as a pitiful, damaged human for whom you want salvation. Why she sees boxing as her way out is never really explained. Her family are stereotypical white trash who barely have two dimensions, let alone three. The German boxer is actually more thinly portrayed than Ivan Drago in Rocky IV and there is something genuinely disturbing about her portrayal. When frankie calls her a 'Kraut' you feel that is what Clint actually feels, and that he sees her nationality and stereotypical representation as actual character construction. <br/><br/>Morgan Freeman plays the same role he played in Unforgiven, although this is no bad thing. He is one of the few characters actually developed and one that the audience can relate to. <br/><br/>But the structure of the story is really rather disjointed. It feels like one or two plot lines were just tagged on and aren't ever really developed.<br/><br/>The lighting and composition of some of the shots are very impressive. Unfortunately the white and blacks of the images seem to have been carried over into the direction and story as well with no place for greys.<br/><br/>Overall a film that contains many good elements but that you just can't care about."

They release this Million Dollar Baby in very limited theaters, just to make sure it is qualified for Oscar contention. They proudly boast that this picture has won numerous awards. It is a picture of noble merits, according to the marketing people.<br/><br/>So we go, we put up with standard boxing movie, that countless sport movies have portrayed over and over again. The kid with no talent who nobody wants blah, blah, blah. Then of course the kid succeeds. Oh yea, go team. Then the third act follows, the twist, the reason we are here, to follow the story to an ending held secret only by those that have been privileged to view this epic. <br/><br/>I won't spoil the movie, but the third act was probably written by an eighth grader.

","Released in 2004 and directed by Clint Eastwood, ""Million Dollar Baby"" stars Eastwood as a cantankerous boxing trainer who owns a working class gym in Los Angeles, which is maintained by one of his former boxers, the narrator of the story (Morgan Freeman). A waitress from the sticks of Missouri (Hilary Swank) shows up and asks that Frankie (Eastwood) train her, which he refuses to do because she's too old at 32 and he ""doesn't train girls,"" probably because he had an unexplained falling out with his daughter years earlier. Eventually he begrudgingly agrees.<br/><br/>The bulk of the film is basically a female version of ""Rocky"" (1976), except that I prefer the potent drama in this one. The three main characters are well fleshed-out with an all-around reverent tone, not to mention an occasional bit of mild amusement. Frankie and Maggie (Swank) slowly develop a father/daughter-type relationship and it's touching.<br/><br/>The third act, however, takes a left turn that is seriously downbeat. It departs from sports movie formula with a message that contradicts everything the first two acts pushed, which is inexplicable. Sure, I 'get' the point: A certain person basically sacrifices everything to do what's (supposedly) best for the situation and honor the will of a dearly loved soul.

"CinematicInceptions","6","1","3","8 February 2016"," Pretty good, but definitely not a best picture.
","Boxing seems to be the sport of choice for movies to feature. Team sports like football may have more movies about them and may have a bigger following from fans, but they aren't as personal as boxing is. It's much harder to make an audience feel for a collective football team than for one boxer that gets visibly bruised up and can form extremely personal rivalries. It just comes down to a difference in inspiration. Teams revitalize cities and nations, but individuals inspire individuals.<br/><br/>Hence, our movie here centers on two people that the audience is meant to grow close to over the two hours. Frankie Dunn is a grumpy and unmoving boxing trainer that values his fighters' safety over their potential for accomplishment. Maggie changes him by giving him enough hope for him to let her face competition beyond what he normally lets his trainees face. With Maggie's eventual downfall, Frankie's fears come to life, and it tears him apart throughout the final act. In the end, they both come to realize that Maggie's life has already been lived and that there is no point for her to continue. This comes more from a sense of accomplishment than of hopelessness. I thought it was good that they kept Frankie's fate ambiguous because showing what he did after Maggie's death might have turned off a lot of viewers. With the ambiguous ending, you can decide whether you want to believe that Frankie has changed by allowing himself to take risks with his fighters or whether he is now even more protective of them.<br/><br/>The story does not really focus that much on boxing, devoting more time to things like Maggie's burnout family and Scrap Iron Eddie's (Morgan Freeman) training of the others back at the gym. Most of the training and fighting scenes come in brief montages that are treated with little importance. Even the tragic last match with Billie the Blue Bear only takes about three or four minutes, where scenes like that are usually made much more dramatic and triumphant in most sports movies. In that way, it slightly transcends other sports movies by not giving us the overused and inevitable championship victory that surprises next to nobody.<br/><br/>I didn't think it deserved any of the Oscars it won. Certainly the acting from Freeman, Swank, and Eastwood was noteworthy and deserved an Oscar Nomination. But neither the acting nor the overall script or film deserved superlative recognition. The parts were all well cast and written with more care than is normal for any given movie. The directing was also noticeably good. It's not that any of it was bad, it just wasn't *that* good.<br/><br/>I know I spoiled a lot of things in there, but if you're still wondering whether to watch it, I would say that it's above average for a sports movie and is a lot more about Frankie and Maggie's relationship than about Maggie rising above all odds to become a champion. In my own opinion, it's a little overrated and over-hyped, but not so much that you'll come out of it completely disappointed. Eastwood and Freeman are in their typical places, so it might be okay to let your opinion of them shape your decision of whether to watch it. If you want to just give it a shot, I would re-evaluate after Maggie starts facing people in matches. Overall Rating: 7.7/10."

You become stronger as Maggie does as she shows a strong determination and drive even when people tell her she can't do it or it can't be done. As the film progresses you start to understand how Frankie became the way he has and understand why be starts to open up to Maggie and treats her like his own daughter and him as her father. This film has many ties back to Rocky as far as the boxing aspect of the film. You are pulling for the underdog and you are alongside them as they grow as a person, but that is where the ties end.

","Million Dollar baby follows the journey of Maggie (Hilary Swank) as she works toward her goal of becoming a professional boxer. Her first fight is to convince Frankie (Clint Eastwood) to become her trainer and show her the way to the top. This film is set and directed in such a way where there is not a lot of emphasis on a particular characters story or life but simply highlights the ups and downs of each character. The main focus is on Maggie and her journey however the film also incorporates the stories of Frankie and Eddie (Morgan Freeman) who is Frankie's assistant. This film offers so much to the viewer. It does a great job in creating a deep connection between the viewer and the characters. It is set in such a way that the viewer feels like they a part of the film. It is easy to feel for each character especially when Maggie is dealing with her unappreciative mother and other family members. Maggie is a very tough and loyal woman and inhibits the type of determination that does not show any signs that she is afraid to fail. This movie is simple yet complex and offers a very interesting plot and theme. It is refreshing to see a hard hearted character like Frankie begin to soften from scene to scene and be able to appreciate his loyalty and protectiveness towards Eddie and Maggie. He is tough on the exterior and that is what makes his character so believable. Clint Eastwood is a talented actor and was able to make the character Frankie come alive. Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank also delivered outstanding performances in this film. It was also nice to see Maggie as her character grew from scene to scene. You cannot help but appreciate her character and how even though her boxing career begins to take off she still remains the same and never forgot where she came from. When I watched this film I assumed that it would be a movie based and centered around boxing but it was so much more than that. Whether it is boxing, obtaining a new career, or any type of goal that we have this movie showcased how much work and determination it really takes to reach a goal. Maggie's character is a role model for what women of all ages can achieve. She entered into what Frankie saw as a man's sport and took it by storm. This film is a must see."

This film came out in 2004, and even though I consider myself pretty up to date on modern films/films that contain the grizzled bear-like head of Clint Eastwood, I didn't get around to watching it until 2009. I know if there is one thing I like to see in user reviews, it is a little bit of background story. I was at a gig where a load of punk bands were playing, but my girlfriend got too drunk and wanted to go home. We went to hers to watch a film. The bus journey was average, definitely not as good at this film, which is MAGNIFICENT. I wanted to watch the film ""Willow"" but as it wasn't available for eye-tasting at that exact juncture, we searched for another DVD. We found this film and decided to throw it on. We only saw about ten minutes of it, and then I got a blow job. I saw fleeting moments of the film when my eyes opened was I neared climax. I thought this was supposed to be a sad film, but it got me some suck suck. Definitely recommend. It is clearly a babe magnet. 20/10."
"elshikh4","8","1","3","24 May 2010"," Love Stories !
","This is a million dollar story. Amazing how this film looks simple while being deep. At first, I thought it was Rocky meets My Fair Lady, but I was wrong. It's not a Hollywood dream. It's rather a dream to make such a film in Hollywood of today.<br/><br/>Look how it braids many lovely feelings together. There is a father to daughter love (Eastwood - a father without a daughter - to Swank), a daughter to father love (Swank - who lost her father early - to Eastwood), and a friend to friend love (Eastwood to Freeman, not forgiving himself for feeling responsible for the lost of the last's eye), and Freeman to Eastwood (giving the truth that the last desperately needed at the end, summarizing the hard situation smartly within the speech of ""I didn't have my chance"").<br/><br/>However, to some extent, I couldn't quite understand the character of (Danger), the semi-mentally handicapped kid, who doesn't get any tired of dreaming the impossible dream. Maybe he symbolized the stubbornness of the title's character, the incapacity yet the survival's power of Freeman, and the need to be loved of Eastwood; it's obvious that (Danger) insists to go to the gym to belong, and feel that there are people to help him, even if help him dreaming.<br/><br/>The directing didn't try to be pedant. The old fox Eastwood, who by the way becomes a better director as he ages, understood earlier that this is a story to be told by the least tricks. And how it's originally built on the basis of acting. So he led the whole thing so calmly and romantically. The pace is basically acute but significant, sad yet no mourner; simply similar to Eastwood's character. The cinematography is so expressive; notice how the areas of white decrease along the way, till they nearly end, paralleling with the state of pain and losing life. I especially loved the moment of the deal's handshake between the 2 leads; the lighting around them was like emanating dawn, or a full moon in the dark of the night. The final outcome is what deserves to be called literally: an instant classic.<br/><br/>As for the problems, I didn't like the performance of Eastwood the actor. I don't know whether it was his busyness in front and behind the camera in the same time?, or his old school of acting where the star's stardom leads and rules? Both ways, while being a high point of his career as an actor, his performance here looked the least capable amongst the ones delivered by these 2 great actors who he directed.<br/><br/>Then, it's the spoken narration of Freeman's character. Firstly, I don't think that that poor, not well cultured, ex-boxer (Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris) has these literary abilities, or these awfully sentimental expressions, being a F. Scott Fitzgerald-ish for most of the time. And secondly, that very narration seemed kind of superfluous, where the film was better without it; as if it was added after the whole thing was complete, to lighten some of its tragic taste. Moreover, the reason why Eastwood's daughter behaved the way that we saw was vogue; that wasn't for the sake of anything.<br/><br/>And finally, Eastwood's music score for the main theme was so similar to ""Kate's Theme"" which's another score that he wrote, however for his previous movie (Absolute Power - 1997). Although both mirror a sensitive feeling of love from father to his daughter, but whenever this one is played we refer to that other movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, I always say that Eastwood's cinema is mostly about the same theme all along: having a second chance. Here, it can't be more clear. We watched a father who got a second chance to have the daughter who he wants, a friend who lost life with lots of money, but got another with a friend who loves him, and a girl who got a second father who loves her, even if that meant killing her. The film showcases all of that in a bittersweet way. It feels like a very good novel, in which I explore the inside of the characters, sense their humanity, while enjoying every detail, and not feeling any bore.<br/><br/>Looking simple while being deep is what genius is all about. When it comes to that matter, (Million Dollar Baby) is no exception."
"Sandcooler","9","1","3","2 March 2009"," Boxing movie and then some
","I figured this was just heated-up ""Rocky"" but what do you know, it's not. The story seems basic to the naked eye, but it actually turns out to be pretty brilliant once you get halfway or so. This does in fact start out as a true underdog story, and the nobody who becomes somebody out of sheer will power has been done to death. But then you have some more stuff that happens and the whole thing is put in a different perspective. Hillary Swank is pretty good, but this is Eastwood's movie, and not only because he directed. His performance is really intriguing, he's really just close to the stock character of the hard-ass trainer, but he's doing so much with it. And I'm not really much of a fan of presumed emotional highlights but this one really works. Whatever praise it got it deserved it."
"refresh_daemon","7","1","3","3 February 2007"," Drags a bit, but decent character study
","Another sports movie. In fact, a boxing movie. A boxing movie with Hillary Swank, Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman. It's more of a drama, I feel, but it's still a sports movie, but a more individualistic one. Like boxing movies before it, it still has the training scenes, the fight scenes, etc. There is a quiet buildup as the characters reveal more and more about themselves. The movie isn't too sledgehammer, but at times it does put more in your face than it needs to. Like Morgan Freeman's running commentary track. Voice-over narration really isn't necessary for this movie and I think that it took away, rather than added to the film.<br/><br/>There is a whole subplot involving a priest and Clint Eastwood's character's faith (or lack thereof). If it had been ejected from the film, it would've only served to make the film tighter. It doesn't really complexify Frankie, nor does it substantially add to the film. Clint is a mostly talented actor and director (don't watch Blood Work, it's not very good). The cast does a good enough job.<br/><br/>The ending of the film (or, the falling action), dragged on a little too long and Eastwood is known for slightly languid pacing. He doesn't manage to pace any better here, but still, in the end, the film was probably the best of the airplane fare that I saw and I enjoyed it enough that I kept watching even though I was feeling quite sick. It could've been even better if the editing and direction were a little less kitchen-sink and plain, but not a bad movie. Not a happy one either, so don't watch it if you want to feel good. 7/10."
"moviesleuth2","6","1","3","3 July 2006"," Well done, but it's been done before
","Million Dollar Baby is a tired story done well. Everything here has been seen before, apart from the last 20 minutes. What makes it different is that everything is done well. The acting is spectacular all around, in fact, it's easy to forget that it's all been done before (though Morgan Freeman's role is too short for Oscar worthiness. Not that it means he didn't deserve the statue.). Clint Eastwood gets every effect and emotion that he can out of every frame. Paul Haggis's screenplay uses the simple grit of everyday life poetically. While there is a very familiar storyline, the plot elements have been used in ways that make them seem fresh. I mentioned that the last 20 minutes is different than what has been seen before. This is true, and I do not want to give anything away. But the rest of the film leaves such an impression that what originality is left has been tainted. Is this an Oscar worthy picture? Perhaps, for the acting and the directing and the writing. But not Best Picture."
"chris_a2001","5","1","3","15 April 2006"," Academy Award intentions clear
","Clint Eastwood obviously went all out for the big award. He appealed to the slightly conservative voting audience by merely notching up the favourite controversial clichés. He starts with the old favourite feminism, then moves on to the ""Little guy against incredible odds"". Then to appeal to the racial equality vote Morgan Freeman (who seems to have made a knack of choosing interesting films for quite some time now) plays the wise sidekick who is much more troubled and complex than we are lead to believe. Then just when u thought the clichés would end, we have the pained father figure with children troubles and euthanasia. I cant see how anyone would bet against it."

Still, I had decided to see that movie, out of curiosity  after all, it had won awards. The camera and lighting work was flawless and very creative. Hilary Swank does deliver an endearing image. Yet the whole story reeks of ""déjà vu"". The action is linear, usually predictable, and clichés about the tough guys mumbling in a barely understandable tone are, frankly, quite worn out.<br/><br/>Considering I had seen Ingmar Bergman's magnificent Saraband a few days earlier, I experienced quite a sobering evening with Million Dollar Baby.<br/><br/>Another case of Hollywood trying to act intellectual."
"dc_follies","6","1","3","8 August 2005"," I was never bored...
","If you are a fan of the movies, and you probably are since you have come to IMDb and are reading movie reviews, then you will probably not be bored during Million Dollar Baby. The story and the characters are interesting enough to keep your attention and I didn't have any issues with the pace of the movie, but this was a fairly average movie. What was well done? The performances by Clint Eastwood, Hillary Swank and Morgan Freeman were superior and easily the best part of the film. I'm not entirely sure why Morgan Freeman decided to rasp his already deep voice for the film as it was unnecessary. Lighting was used very effectively throughout enhancing the dark nature of the film. Other than those facets, I had a few problems with the movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps I would not be so disappointed had this film not won the award for best picture. I don't understand the fascination with Clint Eastwood in Hollywood. He is an excellent actor, but his directorial skills are pretty average. He doesn't do anything particularly unique to enhance a movie or tell the story in a different way.<br/><br/>It seems to me that he also missed an opportunity in the movie. Since the story centers on loneliness and love and opportunity, he could have used silence effectively. That being said, the entire narration of the movie could be eliminated in favor of silence and the movie may have been a little more powerful. There were also several unrealistic points in the movie, such as certain occurrences in the boxing matches and in his conversations with the priest that just wouldn't happen in normal situations.<br/><br/>This movie was okay. It wasn't great and it wasn't horrible - definitely not best picture worthy."
"Aysen08","7","1","3","1 August 2005"," Good Start, Horrible Ending....
","After hearing all the hype of this movie, the awards it's won, etc., I finally took a moment to sit down and watch it, expecting a beyond wonderful flick. Afterall, Eastwood's previous ""The Bridges of Madison County"" hadn't been that bad.<br/><br/>The movie starts off, explaining boxing through the eyes of an ex-boxer, Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (the marvelous Morgan Freeman) who now works for Eastwood's character, Frankie Dunn, as a janitor in his gym. After Eastwood gets dumped by his current boxing protégé, he reluctantly ends up coaching Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) in women's boxing.<br/><br/>The girl seemingly has every odd against her from age to her trailer trash background. However, she rises up the ranks with Frankie behind her. A father-daughter bond forming. Everything is going well for Maggie, until a bad fight, in which Maggie becomes completely paralyzed save for movement of her face (can't even breath on her own).<br/><br/>It's at this point in the movie that the plot seems to become one huge advertisement for assisted suicide. Maggie states that she can't go on living because she's seen the world, won fights, heard people chant her name. This is aside from the fact that Eastwood's character is even hinting that perhaps she could get a special wheelchair and go back to school. It seems seriously odd that this woman comes from nothing into something, but the moment she has a serious set back she's ready to die.<br/><br/>Hello Maggie! Ever heard of Professor Stephen W. Hawking? A genius despite the odds against him. Or what about Christopher Reeve? He didn't just roll over and die! He lived life to its fullest until the day he died, with a determined smile on his face! I think in the end I found her attitude really offensive. And when Dunn refuses to help Fitzgerald die, she attempts suicide on her own by biting her tongue and bleeding to death which fails.<br/><br/>In the end, Eastwood helps Swank's character die. And I'm wondering the whole time where the hell the nurses were when she flat-lined? And Eastwood walks off to Ira's for a piece of lemon pie while Morgan Freeman's character writes Eastwood's real daughter explaining what kind of guy he was.<br/><br/>So the movie started off promising, but plummets to hades very quickly at the end. The only fighting you even see the character do is she finally tells off her hillbilly family who wants her money.<br/><br/>At times funny, others endearing and almost tear worthy, but the ending makes you pretty angry overall. I gave it a 7 out of 10."
"keith_hansen","3","1","3","19 July 2005"," Pro Euthansia Hype
","We never really get to know the boxer in this film, she remains to the end a one-dimensional caricature and Eastwood's character was entirely unlikeable throughout. Freeman's narration was too eerily similar to Shawshank Redemption and seemed to have no real importance to the overall story, along with the rest of the gym's boring denizens.<br/><br/>Although Swank does a good job with the material she is given, her dialogue never seems to transcend ""oh golly gee boss."" She is a great actress and was breathtaking in Boys Don't Cry, but in this - she was cardboard. What was her attraction to boxing and to Frankie Dunn? Who knows. Who cares. Apparently, that was incidental to the story.<br/><br/>Evil Germans, stupid White Trash, a saintly janitor, and a boxer that rises to the top in 1 year with barely any training - where have we seen this all before? This is a pro euthanasia movie that doesn't even make an attempt to show the other side. The Eastwood character unilaterally takes the law into his own hands without due process or legal recourse and murders the boxer. Sickening and not a good message after the Terri Schaivo debacle. I wonder how much of the hype for this movie is out of political motivation for its seedy message.<br/><br/>The unrealistic boxing, the grating narration, the nasty priest, the meaningless sideshow characters, and the hackneyed clichés that riddled the film seem in the end to have all been mere plot vehicles to depict how wonderful euthanasia is. If that is the case, shame on you Clint.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood has great talent and his Mystic River was an excellent movie but he can't seem to get past his Dirty Harry persona. I've seen enough of it already but apparently most people haven't judging by the undeserved awards this film garnered.<br/><br/>This is the most over-hyped mediocrity since American Beauty. 20 years from now it will be entirely forgotten."

","I can think of no way to better summarize this movie other than ""Not worth watching twice"", accept maybe ""not worth watching once"".<br/><br/>*Spoiler alert* Perhaps the most memorable thing from this movie (other than Morgan Freeman's outstanding performance- the only reason for the ""twice"" in the summary) Is the fact that the main character is paralyzed for the last 40 minutes of a movie that is barely over 2 hours in length (sans the credits). With a third of the movie left, I felt that Swank's character would most definitely recover, but no, the inactivity lasted for a full 40 min until the boredom made it feel as if I myself was the one stuck paralyzed in a hospital bed.<br/><br/>A typical outstanding performance by Freeman, a mediocre one by Eastwood, and a sappy performance by Swank which I found to be quite lacking, makes up the majority of the cast of what is surely the worst ""Best Picture"" yet."

","This is by no means a bad film, it is a perfectly formed piece of cinema... if you like that sort of thing, and I did not.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood is fine here but he is quite a limited actor, able only to play riffs on himself. Swank is of course excellent and Freeman does a good job of playing 'wise old man'... again. The plot is somewhat strange not content with being a normal sports movie (SPOILER) a huge cowpat is thrown into the narrative in which Swank becomes paralysed who ultimately forces Eastwood to kill her. For me this twist was on one hand very unexpected and on the other completely bizarre something like this could happen but in movies things should not happen for no reason. Tragedy is only entertaining if the characters damn themselves through their folly, not if they are damned by bad luck; then it just becomes depressing and meaningless. And I feel that the only reason this was done was to try and rise above the conventions of the genre; but what was created is a strange multi-headed beast which is very well made but it didn't quite work."

I was very moved and broken-hearted by the turn of events and haven't felt so overwhelming sad over a movie in decades. Morgan Freeman's voice-over narration is a bit hard to hear at times and Clint's gruff voice is hard to understand at times. It's a slow-paced movie but always manages to keep your interest. The sheer brutality of the fights that Hillary's character wins is awesome. Who would of thought she'd pack such a powerful punch!

This movie takes another perspective on the boxing world - into the woman boxing world mixed into a story about a woman, overage who really WANTS to be a professional boxer, and an old man, who against his will becomes her coach and doesn't have an idea that it will influence his life forever... and no matter how he denies it, it makes him a better person.

It also has a voice-over by Morgan Freeman, that was really the only thing needed to be given credibility, the same case as with 'Shawshank Redemption'. In my opinion its annoying in the same measure.<br/><br/>Sure, Clint, Morgan Freeman and Hillary Swank are great actors, and they all do good roles of what they're given.

They know that their choices are only a ""one way ticket"" and there is no come back. But they stick to it, and in a strange sense, they find happiness and serenity.<br/><br/>Having the same ending than ""Boys don't cry"" (the same actress, the same Oscar), this movie is thus radically different. But, in the same time, the character/actress shows also the exact state of mind: determination, an insatiability for happiness, and a will that never goes down even in the worst time. I find those movies to give me the ""peach"".<br/><br/>This movie isn't only its last 30 minutes. For one hour before, it talks about boxing, and it was quite interesting. The locations (either, the club or the ring), the lightning of this movie (close to black and white) give a sense of intemporality in a sense that this story could happen in the 20s, the 50s, or in the XXI. As there is no distraction from the settings, the message of this sport, and the long development of the relationship between Swank & Eastwood are more clearly evident.<br/><br/>At last, the music is perfect: tragically beautiful ""à la"" Badalamenti.

Firstly, Clint Eastwood's acting and direction are peerless, while Morgan Freeman brilliantly plays his part in an understated way, but what a performance by Hilary Swank - the Academy had to give her the Oscar. The mood of the boxing game was well-caught, but without giving anything away the last half-hour of this movie is fantastic, and will remain in the memory of all who see ""Million Dollar Baby"".

"leyrpa","Null","1","3","14 March 2005"," Well Acted but FLAWED and OVERRATED
","***SPOILERS THROUGHOUT***<br/><br/>The acting in this film was impressive, but a few comments must be made. Seeing Freeman narrating another movie is a little too familiar for me. In addition, as good a job as Swank did (oscar is deserved), I do think it's a role that 10+ other actresses today could have done just as well. The role didn't ask for much in the way character development or introspection; it was most important that she came off as being a believable boxer.<br/><br/>I think think movie was good, not great, and my reasons are:<br/><br/>1- You can NEVER hit an opponent when they have a knee touching the canvas. If you do, you are immediately DQ'D (it happened to Roy Jones Jr a few years ago)...Maggie would have won the fight as soon as that happened (are we as viewer supposed to ignore the rules?) 2- Are we really to believe that a fighter wears a nickname on their back for a significant period of time, is referred to by that nickname numerous times, but does not know what it means? I know that she asks Franky many times what MO CHUISLE means, and this movie seems to take place in the 1980's or so (look of cars, rotary phones, etc..), but wouldn't an industrious person such as Maggie try and find out on here own---i know there is no internet, but perhaps a 10 minute trip to a local library? 3- The story line of Danger did nothing for me in and of itself, nor did it add to the story line--except to allow for closure for Eddie...pretty hokey for me. 4- Wouldn't Franky have reconnected the oxygen mask and turn the machine back on after he committed his last deed, so that the would avoid suspicion and possibly be accused of murder? 5- Are we really to believe that Maggie's white trash family is that despicable? Wouldn't they have latched on to Maggie after her new found professional and monetary success? I think these characters were too awful for the Jerry Springer Show<br/><br/>There are other points, but you get the picture.

"majikstl","6","1","3","5 March 2005"," From avenging angel to benevolent god...
","In examining a career of five decades and about five dozen movies, it isn't difficult to find within Clint Eastwood's body of work examples of glorified, mindless brutality. Through the spaghetti westerns, Dirty Harry films, war films and assorted thrillers, it would a daunting task to calculate just how many lives have been cinematically snuffed out by Eastwood's various alter egos. The body count must be staggering. With few exceptions, violence and death are given elements, indeed, trademarks of Eastwood's work. <br/><br/>Yet, from that collected carnage, it would be difficult to find even one example of a death that was treated with anything resembling compassion or regret. That makes the ending of MILLION DOLLAR BABY so stunningly poignant -- and yet strangely predictable. Once again a character dies at Eastwood's hands, but the death does not come easy nor is it a moment of violent glory or a display of justice as an ironic joke. Death becomes a moral choice, not a reflex action or an act of calculated revenge. BABY stands virtually alone in suggesting that life has value and its loss is a genuine tragedy. <br/><br/>But it is very late in the film that BABY gains any gravity. Mostly it is a well-acted, nicely photographed collection of boxing movie clichés. Father-figure boxing trainer Eastwood reluctantly takes under his wing an untrained, but plucky athlete and gruffly guides her to the championship. Making the would-be contender a female gives the film a slight nudge toward freshness, but it really makes surprisingly little difference in how the story is told. Even the parent-child relationship is not based on gender so much as on plot contrivance. <br/><br/>The film teases us with references to past mistakes and an estranged daughter, but vital aspects of the older man's life never get resolved. But if we get a too cryptic backstory on Eastwood's Frankie Dunn, the film supplies too much information about Swank's Maggie Fitzgerald. The fact that the film works at all is due primarily to Hilary Swank's ability to infuse a potentially one-note character with depth and complexity. Giving us an authentic interpretation of ""white trash"" trying to literally fight her way out of poverty, Swank's wonderful performance is so nicely self-contained, so complete, that the addition of her kin as abusive, uncaring, greedy Ozark trailer park hillbillies seems not only unnecessary, but stereotypically insulting. <br/><br/>As a film unto itself, BABY is Maggie's story; a bittersweet tale of persevering optimism crushed by cruel fate. It seemingly preaches that the journey to victory is as meaningful as any victory obtained. Going the distance, as it were; even if fate unexpectedly shortens the journey. In this context, the film is sad, yet strangely uplifting. <br/><br/>Even so, most of the film is simply trite. But it does at least set up the emotional bonds that link the characters and gives the film's finale its dramatic oomph. A film of no great insight suddenly risks controversy, tackling the issue of assisted suicide. You have to admire Eastwood for even approaching such an issue, even if the script does stack the deck in favor of it's chosen outcome. To a great degree, it isn't a film about boxing at all, the sport being only a backdrop and a not-so-subtle metaphor for life in general. But by dwelling on the build up to the big bout, the filmmakers short change and cheapen the ultimate focus of their narrative. The film approaches the controversial moral issue almost like an afterthought. <br/><br/>As actor and director, Eastwood has made a career out of glorifying killers, whether he is playing a cop, a soldier or gunslinger. But in the 1990's, the one-note Eastwood film image took on a degree of complexity with films like UNFORGIVEN, A PERFECT WORLD, IN THE LINE OF FIRE and most notably, THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, a film that is most shocking because it is devoid of physical violence. Otherwise, even as his characters espouse a growing philosophical distaste for violence, they nonetheless end up killing. <br/><br/>Now, Eastwood is once more playing a killer, albeit a reluctant one. Though BABY seems like it is light-years removed from the sadism and nihilism of DIRTY HARRY, once again we have a protagonist, living in a violent world, who is given a set of circumstances where taking human life is to be assumed as a logical, and possibly heroic, action. Whether playing a rogue cop snuffing out a serial killer or a saintly father easing a child's pain, as likely as not, Eastwood's characters find reasons to kill. Like Harry Callahan and William Munny and Josey Wales and the ""Man With No Name"" and so many other Eastwood protagonists, Frankie Dunn becomes a man of violence, a man who's acts of violence are romanticized and rationalized as heroic deeds. <br/><br/>If viewed as part of Eastwood's total filmography, the film is more depressing than merely sad, more cynical than tragic. Again we have an Eastwood character who can only solve problems through violence. Seen as an individual act, Maggie's death has a stunning impact. Seen as a new variation on Eastwood's usual shtick, euthanasia seems like just another excuse for Eastwood to portray a noble assassin. And again, Eastwood's character rides off into the sunset, a mythic figure, alone, but unpunished and outside the law. Even though Frankie actually struggles with the morality of killing, he still kills. It is as if the struggle against doing something wrong, in the end, justifies doing it. And instead of defining him as a murderer, the ethical struggle elevates him from avenging angel to benevolent god. <br/><br/>As such, MILLION DOLLAR BABY manages to be both optimistic and opportunistic, deeply moving and coldly calculating, morally thoughtful and cruelly amoral.

","All movies tell a story, of course. Lots of films tell stories that are gritty and don't end well. But the movie should flow. The situations should not seem unreasonable to have occurred. The beginning was good- except for Morgan Freeman's annoying narrative. Needless and intrusive. Hilary Swank turns in to a very believable boxer, with the obligatory self-image problems caused by her trailer trash family. Pinning her hopes on boxing seems odd- beating other people to resolve her own demons, then symbolically adopting Eastwood as the curmudgeonly father figure giving her the only help and hope she has ever had. So far, so good. Never mind that in a real match, the opponent would have been D/Q'd with the first illegal elbow shot- we have an accident so freakish that it is almost believable. Then the mess begins- Swank can speak with a tracheotomy! A medical miracle in itself. She gets bedsores on her forearms- not on any pressure points. She gets her leg done in by something supposed to be either an infection or a clot- no one says for sure, but lop it off anyway. Okay, I'm a neurological nurse. But didn't Chris Reeve show anyone anything? I was so into the hokey medical stuff that I couldn't pay attention to the stupidity of the plot. Then someone *biggest spoiler here* unhooks a machine and no one comes after them for murder? I don't think so. Eastwood has really indulged himself. I couldn't believe how many people fell into this predictable, formulaic BS of an ending. It was creepy to think that Eastwood sat around planning this manipulative nonsense rather than actually finishing his film. When things get rough, cripple the heroine of the film and have a paternalistic manager take care of it. Then Morgan Freeman (after tolerantly dealing with a village idiot when he calls him the notorious N word) is allowed to become redemptive. He saves the white cracker boy twice. Nice touch (right) from Eastwood who does seem hung up still on throwing the occasional offensive word in and then making the victim a hero. Notice how Eastwood insults all southerners by giving southern accents to the people who are the idiots. Thanks, Clint. I was shocked at how crummy I thought the second half of this film was. I was so prepared to like it, and the first part was worth seeing."

"FilmOtaku","7","1","3","17 February 2005"," Another solid and gut-wrenching film from Eastwood
","It is an interesting phenomenon to me that some actors, regardless of their popularity, are much better directors than actors. Sidney Pollack and Ron Howard come to mind immediately, but I feel that the personification of this idea is Clint Eastwood, whose film ""Million Dollar Baby"" is absolutely wonderful.<br/><br/>""Million Dollar Baby"" is the story of Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank), a waitress described as ""white trash"", who is in reality, everything her reputation is not. Born and raised in the deep south and raised in a family of lazy, horrible people, she turns up at the training gym of Frankie Dunn (Eastwood), begging him to train her for the women's boxing circuit. When he repeatedly says no, she continues to train furiously, until he relents and the two (plus Frankie's right hand man Eddie Dupris, played by Morgan Freeman) strike up a working relationship that quickly develops into a deep friendship. When Maggie is injured during the most important match of her life, their relationship reaches an even greater level, where they both have to make decisions that will affect the rest of their lives.<br/><br/>I went into ""Million Dollar Baby"" with a couple of preconceptions, something that I try not to do. Luckily, they ended up working in favor of me enjoying the film. Firstly, of the Eastwood-directed films I have seen, (namely ""Play Misty for Me"", ""Unforgiven"" and ""Mystic River"", I acknowledged that they were good films. In the case of ""Unforgiven"" and ""Mystic River"", they were really good, if not great films. ""Million Dollar Baby"" falls squarely into that category as well. The film's story is compelling (and somewhat controversial, at least for some people) until its conclusion, a very refreshing thing to behold, particularly nowadays when twenty pages of script seem to constitute a feature length screenplay.<br/><br/>Regarding the script, there was not a moment when I didn't buy what was being presented to me, and I think that this is partly thanks to the superior performances of the three primary actors. ""Performance"" isn't even a fair word to use in this case because there was never a moment where I felt that they were ""acting"". Despite the heavy dramatic themes, histrionics were not present. Hilary Swank is simply amazing, and shows that given the right material, she will take the role and make it hers alone; I cannot fathom anyone else doing her complicated role any kind of justice. Morgan Freeman  someone give this man an Oscar. I'm not entirely sure how many times you can be consistently excellent in a role before they are actually given public recognition for their talents, but once again, he pulls out a great supporting role as a variant of his ""Shawshank"" character, only with a lot more vinegar in him. The biggest surprise for me, however, was Clint Eastwood. As I mentioned earlier, one can appreciate someone for being an icon, but an iconic status does not make one a good actor. (See John Wayne, or more recently, J.Lo for other examples.) His performance in ""Million Dollar Baby"" however, was sublime. Frankie's character is a study in dynamics; he is curmudgeonly yet generous, fierce but tired. He attends church daily, but on some level questions his faith. Perhaps it was the role that he gave himself, but he was a perfect fit. Previously, I'd only seen Eastwood as a squinting, growling man in his roles; and frankly, he does the same thing in this role as well  but in this case it works wonderfully.<br/><br/>As far as Eastwood's direction, it is once again dead-on. The film, despite its violent and emotional themes is very warm, with its lighting and cinematography. The pacing is also excellent. Once again, however, while I feel the film was very good, and I certainly wouldn't be staging my 342nd boycott if it won an Oscar, there was nothing about the film that excited me. The story and the performances grabbed me, but I didn't feel ""excited"" when I left, as I have with about a half dozen other films I've seen in the past year. I mentioned Ron Howard earlier in regard to acting, and I feel compelled to invoke his name again in this instance. His films are good, solid films. But (and not to personalize this too much) when, for example, I saw that ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Moulin Rouge!"" were both up for Best Picture, I was disappointed when the former won because it was a ""safe"" choice. A good movie, but nothing dynamic about it. And that's how I feel about Eastwood's films; they are good films, I can't find a lot of things wrong with them, but in general they don't excite me.<br/><br/>I still give ""Million Dollar Baby"" a 7/10, however because it is a very good film, and I think it is very deserving of its Oscar nomination and of the many accolades it has received, both from film critics and regular theatergoers like us alike.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

","MIllion Dollar Baby<br/><br/>***1/2/out of 4<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood is growing older, but nothing can stop him from making original and emotionally powerful films. Many directors like Martin Scorsese and Sydney Pollack have turned to making huge Hollywood blockbusters with crowd-pleasing special effects. Eastwood has not. ""Million Dollar Baby"" defies all Hollywood boxing movie clichés and is certainly one of the best films of the year. Like Eastwood's American tragedy ""Mystic River,"" ""Million Dollar Baby"" is very pessimistic and takes dark and tragic turns. But, unlike ""Mystic River,"" it is a very spiritual film and feels much more personal.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank, in her 2nd best performance (""Boys Don't Cry"" being her best), plays Maggie Fitzgerald. Maggie is a white-trash girl who spends her time as a waitress when she's not in the boxing gym pushing towards her dream. Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) owns the gym and when Maggie asks him to train her, his response is: ""Girly tough ain't enough."" Morgan Freeman, in his best role since ""The Shawshank Redemtion,"" plays Eddie Dupris. Eddie lost an eye when he was training with Frankie and Eastwood does a miraculous job of portraying the two aging friends' sense of loss. As Frankie begins to train Maggie, the film starts as a typical Hollywood film, but then takes an unexpected turn, making an exciting boxing film into a heart-wrenching journey of the human soul. Eastwood's use of extensive lighting gives a sense of all the guilt and sin in the seemingly normal atmosphere. Also, the musical score, as in ""Mystic River,"" is very simple and quiet--one of the reasons why it stays with you so much. Like ""Closer"" and ""Collateral,"" ""Million Dollar Baby"" is one of the few widely- released films this year that surely proves itself, with the help of a masterful artist, to be an extraordinary work of art."

","I have always liked Clint Eastwood. I grew up as a kid watching his so called Western Spaghetti series and then onto the Dirty Harry series. I only relished that this man could act in the movie, 'Bridges of Madison County'. Well, he was a good actor but before that I was more interested in his perfectly delivered punchlines and him grounding bad guys to the ground. 'Million Dollar Baby' is literally about two old men in their twilight years - Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman and the relationship between them, so often revealed by their ruthless dry humour, tells the story of the bond of friendship.... and NEED for each other. Hilary Swank is more of an intrusion into their perfectly balanced world of calm and routine. The whole story takes on an incredible 'timeline' of a time within a time - the superimposition of pace and excitement of Hilary Swank and the fights onto the mundane and dull backdrop of Eastwood's gym. A really fantastic movie. A movie about unusual courage. A movie about honour and respect. And above all, a movie about love."
"MLDinTN","9","1","3","8 February 2005"," the end was depressing, but the film was very good
","One thing that really stands out was this movie has an original plot. And all the actors were great and deserve all the awards and nominations. There are some very realistic boxing scenes and a lot of them are short since the matches don't last long.<br/><br/>The story starts out showing Frankie, an old good boxing trainer who is afraid of risks. We learn he goes to mass every day and it has something to do with his relationship with his daughter. We never learn what happened. Along comes Maggie who wants Frankie to train her. She is too old and comes from white trash, but all she wants is her chance to prove she can fulfill her dream of being a boxer. Eddie helps manage Frankie's gym and sees that Maggie is searching for something. He sort of pushes Frankie to train her. Eddie looks over everyone and he narrates much of the story. Frankie finally gets Maggie matches, and she wins them all. He's afraid to take a chance and book someone good, but finally gives in, and Maggie wins. Finally, Maggie fights the best female fighter who also fights dirty. This boxing match is my one complaint because any fighter that hits someone while they are down or well after the bell would be disqualified and probably banned from boxing for a while. Well, this dirty fighter does all this. And she hits Maggie a second time after the bell. This punch is the worst thing that could happen. Maggie hits her head on a chair and it snaps her neck. She is now a quadriplegic. Frankie is the one who cares about her and sees her every day. Her white trash family shows up only for her money. At least, Maggie sees them for what they are. It is one of the best scenes of the film. Maggie tells Frankie she got to live her dream, and she wants to be able to remember it. She doesn't want to spend her days not being able to do what she loves. She asks Frankie to end her life. Frankie prays at church and is very torn over this issue. Frankie makes the choice I didn't think he would make.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I highly recommend this. It isn't about boxing. It does start out sort of slow, but this is a great character film and you shouldn't go in expecting a lot of action. The ending is sad and depressing."

"elaanela","Null","1","3","6 February 2005"," Great Cast, Over the Top Plot
","SPOILERS I also went to see this film based on its popular and critical reviews. There were elements that I thought were great, but other very weak aspects of the film. The cast was solid, and I am a fan of all three leads: Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman. However, sometimes the characters that they portrayed seemed like caricatures. I like my characters a little more complicated. Eastwood's character was a bit formulaic and overly stoic, but at least multi-dimensional. I did enjoy that they kept his ""unforgiveable sin"" against his daughter a secret, and the fact that he was not actually lying to the priest about the letters. However, while I thought Swank did a terrific job, the character she was given was somewhat flat. She was ever the scrappy, spunky heart-of-gold girl from the wrong side of the tracks, optimistic and just trying to help her poor momma despite years of psychological abuse. It might have been more interesting to see her struggle a bit more with self doubt or anger over her past (the scene in the hospital seemed like an afterthought). The fact that she completely lost her spark at the end was never adequately explained.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the realism of the boxing scenes, although there were times when I had to look away until the blood and guts were over. One thing that I liked about those scenes was the depiction of the audience as often very ""sophisticated"" well-dressed wealthy people watching the ""trash"" boxers beat each other into a pulp as though they were watching a dog fight.<br/><br/>There were some very heavy handed plot elements, and I prefer a little more ambiguity and complexity. The foreshadowing was overdone. As soon as I heard her tell the story of her father's dog, I knew the film would end with one or the other of them performing euthanasia. And you could always tell when an emotional moment was coming because the soundtrack would start into some kind of low bass kettle drum roll. A bit over the top. The portrayal of Maggie's family was truly cartoonish, as were the denizens of the gym. And the whole lost-father-lost-daughter schtick was way too heavy-handed.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought the film was reasonably well done for Hollywood, but I came in expecting to be inspired, and left dejected. I guess the point was supposed to be ""live fast, die young and fulfilled"" but somehow it just didn't work for me. I'm not sure that I would recommend it to others, but I would probably tell them to see for themselves."

That should be a blessing to anyone reading my previous entries.<br/><br/>I am a sucker for good stories, particularly ones about ordinary people attempting extraordinary things. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is one of those films, and because Clint Eastwood knows how to cast, how to act, and how to get out of the way of the actors he uses, this film makes for a great story even if you don't like the conclusions ( and for ethical reasons, I didn't).<br/><br/>Anything I say about this film will spoil its impact but suffice it to say, Morgan Freeman, Hillary Swank, and Clint Eastwood do a great job telling a tale about how people work around their personal limitations to achieve their dreams and how to deal with the options when those dreams fall apart. The boxing business, particularly women's' boxing, is simply the canvas around which such issues are played out. Through this canvas, the characters figure out the meaning of love, loss, separation, and courage in a style that is truly enjoyable and memorable.<br/><br/>I am sure that this picture will not win Best Picture at the Oscars because those cinematic elitists will assume that it is a stylistic mimeograph (now you know how old I AM) of ""The Shawshank Redemption"". Morgan Freeman even narrates this film as he did that one. I promise you that this movie is not ""Clone of Shawshank"". Paul Haggis' screenplay is friendly, funny, and for the most part not ad-libbed. There is enough humor and realistic pathos to carry one though 137 minutes without being bored in the process. Hillary Swank puts in an admirable performance as a girl without a dime and with a dream. Eastwood and Freeman interact classically with one another as trainer and former boxer and confidant. Their banter and one-liners are both poignant and funny. Eastwood is also good (though kind of predictable as in previous offerings) as a trainer who has made many mistakes in life for which he seeks redemption and from which he can never fully recover. Freeman is as comfortable as an old shoe as the has-been heavyweight who still holds the heavyweight title in common sense, courage, and character.<br/><br/>I won't say anything more that this. I despised greatly the ending of this film. If you feel the same way I do about some fundamental issues, you will also despise it. That being said, the issues being presented might be one reason why one should SEE this film. It will certainly be a cause for frank discussion with your family, significant other, or friends. It ought to be. If it isn't a source of discussion, then one probably has no soul.<br/><br/>To cut this short, it ain't the Godfather I and II, but it's a damn nice film. One might well forget about this film in a few years (though I did not forget ""The Shawshank Redemption""), but one won't forget the impact it has immediately after one leaves the theater.<br/><br/>Find out what it takes to avoid having to live life with a trailer, a deep fryer, and some Oreos. Go see Million Dollar Baby. On IMDb's scale, it ranks about a 7 with me."
"SmithWrite","Null","1","3","22 January 2005"," Didn't do it for me
","The first 2/3 of the movie is wonderful -- quirky, warm and often funny -- and the acting is outstanding. But then it turns into a completely different film where it loses most of its credibility, and most of all just doesn't deliver the emotional payoff it is trying so hard to do. Two days after seeing it, I keep finding more annoying elements.<br/><br/>SPOILER -- SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER - SPOILER I agree with the other person who mentioned in a comment that the ending just doesn't flow from the rest of the movie. It's true that in real life, things sometimes happen out of nowhere, but in films we expect there to be a connection -- that events transpire not just because they can, but because they must, given what went before. In MDB, the central notion of ""protecting oneself"" gets an inordinate amount of screen time, yet for the ""twist"" to occur, the main characters have to completely forget it. Thus we have Frank (Clint Eastwood) zigzagging from not being able to protect his fighter (Morgan Freeman), overprotecting his fighter (Big Willy), and then both over- and under-protecting his fighter(Hilary Swank). Here Maggie is in a ring with a boxer known for fighting dirty, and neither she nor Frank seem to be particularly on the alert. The film also leaves dangling the whole concept as to whether Frank was wrong or right to be protective.<br/><br/>VERY BIG SPOILER - VERY BIG SPOILER - VERY BIG SPOILER My biggest problem with the film (and the reason I can't imagine the Holleywood community voting for it as best film come Oscars night) is that I couldn't accept Maggie's decision, nor Frank's decision to help her, in a world that just lost Christopher Reeve, who showed that even people in Maggie's condition can still do meaningful things with their lives. As a personal matter, I am sure that if I were in that position, I might also long to commit suicide, but knowing that people like Christopher Reeve have chosen to live life to the fullest despite extreme limitations, it's hard for me to emotionally get behind a character who isn't even willing to try (I'm certain I would view ""Whose Life is it Anyway"" less sympathetically if I saw it today.)<br/><br/>Not only was this major emotional component lacking for me, but some of the rest of the stuff was absolutely ludicrous. I almost laughed at the last scene with the family, given that under the circumstances, no attorney would fail to bring a notary along to ascertain the ""mark"" to be made was genuine. The whole scene was also completely over-the-top, in that it had already been established her family was selfish and uncaring.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie that would have had a stronger and more honest emotional impact if it had stayed in its original vein and figured out a more subtle way to show the connection between Frank and Maggie than lapsing into melodrama."

","Just saw Million Dollar Baby and thought it was an above average movie and would recommend it to anyone if for no other reason than Morgan Freeman, my favorite actor, is in it. As to the ludicrous comment about Michael Medved, implying he's a closed-minded bigot because he panned the movie, well-not a very open-minded thing to say, was it. There are people in this country who really have to come to terms with the fact that their side lost the election and stop seeing life in blue state-red state dichotomies. How someone's voting habits would affect what they think of a movie, unless it is an undisguised hit piece like Fahrenheit 911, is a little beyond me but I guess there are some people that see political motivations in everything. The election is over-get over it."

","This excellent film is set in the world of boxing, yes, and sure enough it is about fighting - against oneself, against the restrictions of background, against prejudice and preconception. It links with Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN in being about that too - forgiving yourself, not forgiving yourself, forgiving but not forgetting. The screenplay, which is mostly wonderful, has one or two moments, that's all, of clunkiness, in which it feels just a little bit consciously contrived. The only reason I mention it is because nothing else does feel contrived. The rest has the inevitability of the very best drama. Swank is magnificent. The film is superbly directed - the man is indeed a master. Just one example: think of all the overuse that slow-mo gets in movies today, and in previous movies set in the ring. In this movie there is only one moment where it's used, and of course its power is tremendous because of the general restraint. Go see."

","Million Dollar Baby<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby 7/10 Hilary Swank, as she did in Boys Don't Cry, has transformed herself physically for the part. Emotionally, intellectually, physically and - in terms of determination - spiritually, she *is* the character, and it's a stunning achievement. (She plays an underprivileged girl who wants to succeed as a boxer and eventually persuades Clint Eastwood to coach her.)<br/><br/>Sadly, while it's an undoubtedly well (enough) made film, the directing, and acting elsewhere, is to my mind hardly of the calibre to justify the accolades the film is receiving generally. America, if not many other Western audiences, have become so inured to that self-congratulatory style where the camera zooms in for a close up and the actor holds an expression slightly longer than necessary for that 'Oscar moment'. These audiences, in my opinion, should get out more to some good traditional French cinema and see how lacking such Hollywoodized performances are compared to the European tradition of acting in a more 'natural' and believable way.<br/><br/>Another reason for the over-hype on Million Dollar Baby, is probably because the themes towards the end of the film (without giving too much away) now firmly belong to the almost trendy political left wing liberalism that many like to embrace. Whilst possibly putting myself in that camp, I am not in this case convinced that the way it is dealt with here justifies the extravagant kudos the movie has acquired over its more cinematic merits. I can only give it 7/10, but if I were in America (USA) I'd probably give it more, simply because it may have some good socially effect in that morally moribund and religiously intolerant country.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is a very good film, but over-long and too full of it's own self-importance for my taste."

Things were going well with the movie up until the ""darth vader/rocky"" German fighter stuff, this was unnecessary and ridiculous, fighters get hurt without having to resort to a cheating foe, also sorts of questions and intent were raised with this approach that simply didn't need to be raised, further, there were too many changes in tone throughout the movie, fast pace, then slow, buddy picture, bad family picture, surrogate father/surrogate daughter stuff, overly long and empty sick room scenes. I do have to say Morgan freeman and Hilary Swank were great, the rendering of how to treat a quad was good too, as I have some experience with this, but the movie could have been so much more consistent in tone and shorter if they would have trusted their hunches and not reached for obvious didactic explanation or exaggeration. I'm really not sure what the hell you were suppose to think or feel at the end, I'm not really sure the director did either.

Clint always regretted his earlier days how he was perceived as only an action guy. He does not want people to remember him for his violent past.

"MinneapolisJane","Null","1","3","6 January 2005"," Stunning
","Last night I saw Clint Eastwood's latest film, ""Million Dollar Baby"" and it is worthy of a million compliments. As one has come to expect from their past performances, Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman, and Clint Eastwood all deliver dead-on portrayals that should ensure many nominations and, if justice prevails, some awards. Morgan Freeman's ability to keep his voice checked while conveying powerful, searing truths is unmatched. Hilary Swank delivers a combination of raw toughness and undaunted optimism that is incongruously based in pain. Clint Eastwood only gets better with age. This movie had most of the audience sniffling by the end. If you found ""Mystic River"" heart-wrenching, you will find ""Million Dollar Baby"" a worthy follow-up."
"hillari","Null","1","3","1 January 2005"," Worth More Than A Million
","Excellent, excellent. One of the aspects of this film I appreciate the most is that Eastwood and Freeman portray old men as they are. Not stereotypical, not for laughs (even though there are some amusing moments), but as real flesh-and-blood men with opinions as well as regrets. Being an amateur boxer myself, I could totally relate to the love of the sport that Swank's character had. The interactions between the three main characters are letter perfect. Never has Eastwood played such an emotional character, and Freeman is great as his closest friend and Greek chorus for the story. Swank has the right amount of toughness and vulnerability. There are a lot of moments where the characters are filmed in shadows, to emphasize the isolation they often feel. It also emphasizes their isolation from the world at large; the three are part of a sport that is seldom given any time in the press. Swank's character is further on the outs because she is a female trying to gain respect in a male-dominated sport. Eastwood and Swank's father/daughter relationship is the glue that pushes this film along."

It's hard these days to watch any Hollywood film without realising you're being propagandised somehow. Some rich and powerful people want the power of life and death over you and they're using the media as a way to bring the subject of euthanasia up in order to familiarise you with the concept that killing is OK under certain circumstances. I've seen loads of articles recently in the news such as 'The case for killing Granny' and others. Sorry, but killing is killing is killing and thou should not kill. End of. So they serve up the 'exception' to the rule ie. in this case it's a merciful thing to do. But as we all know and especially alcoholics know, the exception to the rule can rapidly become the rule. Before you know it they'll be popping you off 'cause your insurance ran out just like they pop off unborn babies for free 'cause you don't want the hassle of looking after one. Hell, life is cheap these days didn't you know? Also they brought the Church in on this one to get the Christians on board too. Nothing Hollywood puts out these days is just innocent entertainment. It all has a political message. They want your mind. And what was the dumb white boy there for? 'Oh we're all fighters and it's the spirit of fighting that counts even if you're really a sorry stupid loser.'= be a loser and let us have control over you.

Like Rocky, this boxing film isn't about boxing but rather the character development and Mr. Eastwood delivers it masterfully. The plot starts with Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) reluctant on training and managing career of newcomer Maggie (Hilary Swank) because he doesn't train girls and he was already focusing on the career of another boxer, Big Willie (Mike Colter). But due to his past failures, he keeps holding back Willie from the title who eventually leaves Dunn. With the help of his former partner Scrap (Morgan Freeman), He decides to train Maggie until she finds a manager.<br/><br/>As I said before, the character development is the subject of the movie.

Million Dollar Baby was able to capture all of these points and some. You could put Morgan Freeman's career up against anyone's in film history, comparing both acting chops and classic films said person was in; with that said, this is the best role of his career. Not only does he portray a great supporting character with depth, he also narrates the story of the movie as well. The Oscar he received for this role was a no-brainer. Going back to the love story element-- this movie doesn't follow the traditional romantic path, but one of a trainer and trainee. The audience watches this relationship build from one of pity to profound love. This movie will captivate you by asking you to root for the characters in this film, and profoundly effect you as you witness each of them develop-- and by the time the credits roll in you will realize that you have watched what quite possibly is the greatest movie of all time."

","Million Dollar Baby (2004): Dir: Clint Eastwood / Cast: Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, Jay Baruchel, Mike Colter: Disturbing film about chance and risks featuring Clint Eastwood as a boxing trainer who reluctantly trains a female. It isn't so much about boxing as it is about the emotional wounds they fight against. Questionable conclusion where a decision draws to hopeless speculations. Director Eastwood does a splendid job weaving the lifestyles and personal struggles using the sport as a backdrop. He often makes films regarding one's striving for achievement and the cost for such. His previous credits include Absolute Power and Play Misty for Me. Hilary Swank is fantastic as a waitress whose welfare drawn family discourage her. This is her greatest performance since Boys Don't Cry and she is a straight fighter all the way. Eastwood is always able to capitalize on familiarity by allowing viewers a glimpse into the character's mental sense of being. Morgan Freeman plays a former boxer who works for Eastwood in the gym. He narrates the film as an address to someone else. Other characters are either corny or annoying at best, particularly the meddling greedy family pretending to care. Well crafted film that will disturb some while compelling others. The sport of boxing is a metaphor for fighting to forgive ourselves for the past. Score: 7 ½ / 10"

This movie is million miles way better than the new movie Creed (2015)!! Creed (2015) hides from this movie! Clint Eastwood plays Dunn and directs, produces and composes music for this acclaimed, multiaward-winning tale of heart, hope and family. This is the real sports boxing drama portrayed about human young woman's life been a boxer. A lot of people disagree with me for not liking Gran Torino Clint Eastwood's overrated movie and does not accept that I love this movie. Beside Rocky and Southpaw is my third favorite best sports drama boxing movie. I just love this movie to death, I love it so much. This film is touching, powerful, incredible movie with amazing, amazing performances from Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank. Clint Eastwood sure did a great well excellent direction on this movie. This is my favorite best Clint Eastwood movie and no one can tell me not liking it, like Gran Torino that movie is better, in my opinion is not. Million Dollar Baby is the best human boxing drama life portrayed in a film ever! <br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is about an under-appreciated boxing trainer, the mistakes that haunt him from his past, and his quest for atonement by helping an underdog amateur boxer achieve her dream of becoming a professional. This movie isn't just about fighting and boxing matches it is about a bond, friendship and true love for sport. The chemistry between Clint and Hilary was awesome and masterful done, they both make a connection bond between father and daughter. Maggie Fitzgerald never had a father, while Frankie Dunn never had a daughter before. The underdog tale about young girl's life ids astonish telling, but the film isn't only about her. It is a about grief Frankie did a big mistake in the past and he does not want to repeat again. Morgan Freeman did awesome performance as retired boxer Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, Dunn's gym assistant. <br/><br/>Great story with good action and well mix of emotion. One of the best movies but saddest movies I've ever seen I love boxing there's a few boring bits but overall great movie well done. Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman & Hilary Swank provide a storyline much deeper than simply the world of women's boxing. Another Directing delight from Clint Eastwood !! What more can I say? Just amazing. Humor, photography, acting - all exemplary. The music was rather repetitive though. It holds up well over the years. Loved the way the relationships were drawn. I think Million Dollar Baby is the Best Movie in the world I think this Movie is for the older crowd Awesome movie by the Way. Another score for Hilary Swank (best actress for the second time)! Excellent movie all the way around, superb acting from all the cast. If you haven't seen it and think it's just a ""boxing"" movie then you're really missing out. it's much more about the characters and their relationships, past and present. Very powerful movie. Highly recommended! <br/><br/>Hilary Swank did the best job in the world playing Margaret ""Maggie"" Fitzgerald, a determined, aspiring boxer, I seriously love the actress. She was my first true crush love since I saw her in a TV movie Dying to Belong (1997) wen she was so damn sexy and hot and her previous movie The Next Karate Kid (1994). This is dramatic filmmaking at its finest. Eastwood paints a realistic, down-to-earth dramatic picture with this film. The trio of stars (including Eastwood himself) gives the performances of their careers - no one is overacting or winking at the camera. <br/><br/>The most what I love is how we find more about Maggie's life. What I never saw in any movie beside Rocky what can happen to a boxer if he get's permanently damaged. The fights in this movie are realistic in the last fight when Maggie gets a deadly shot by her opponent in her blind side and lands on her head on the corner stool, breaking her neck and than suffers spinal neck injury that leaves her paralyzed for life. That was real, everything is real! I never saw that you can get paralyzed from fighting for life! The last 1/4 of the movie is about euthanasia and human morals. Maggie is bedridden for a long time and eventually has to have her leg amputated due to bed sores turning gangrenous. That scene really remind on my mother when she was lining in the hospital and the doctors amputated her leg. I love how Maggie stick up for her self once in her life when her mother and her sister tried to ripped her off and squeeze her out off her money. All her family was ever caring was just money not their daughter/sister's health and life. This movie is what it is, a perfect 10, because it takes the vision of one of the most imaginative directors on Earth. <br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is a 2004 American sports drama film directed, co-produced and scored by Clint Eastwood, and starring Eastwood, Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman.<br/><br/>10/10 Grade: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval Studio: Warner Bros.

","This film's plot is strong and solid storyline, though, the title is misleading to believe that the main character Maggie won any championship or titles during her short-lived career. Clint Eastwood's directing is always a classic and Oscar winning performance. I disagree with the Catholic priest who the character, Frankie seeks advise and strength. A priest is a man of religion, a man of good moral character, of good faith. However, this movie depicts Catholic priests as a negative, callous individual who uses excessive foul language in the beginning when exiting Church of St. Mark's: ""there are no domo gods you F***** Pagans!!"" A genuine man of religion would not use such vulgar language to any extent and would have more faith and compassion towards Frankie with his estrange relationship with his own daughter.<br/><br/>The ending is extremely sad. I thought that Maggie would win at least one championship or title match in her boxing career. She is a struggling waitress trying to make ends meet with her family. Getting hurt and injured is a high risk in any sport which is very unfortunate for Maggie at the end."

","I'm not the biggest fan of this movie. It's like many other sports films: the underdog tries to make it big. But the beauty of this film is in Clint Eastwood. Like his later role in ""Gran Torino"", he plays an older man set in his ways and somewhat prejudiced who loosens up and becomes a hero of sorts. Morgan Freeman is also great, but when isn't he? Hilary Swank is not one of my favorite actresses, but she played this role well and I cannot see anyone else doing it. Someone mentioned that Sandra Bullock (for example) would have killed this role and therefore the movie. Absolutely right.<br/><br/>There was much to like in this one, like the featherweight who wanted to be the champion... but as well as it held my attention and was well-paced and acted, I wouldn't say it was a masterpiece. Clint Eastwood is a fine director, but for me he didn't get the power out of this one that he did with ""Torino""."
"KCGreene","5","1","4","22 December 2008"," Baffled at the rave reviews of this movie
","I've never been so dumbfounded by the rave response a movie has received than this. Did a high school drama student write this? Oh, it was Clint wasn't it? Yaaawwwwn. Unbelievably under-utilized talent because of an unbelievably amateurish, two-dimensional script. Is there any complexity or depth to any of the characters? No. To the story? No. HIllary Swank's character--the average girl from humble origins with grand ambitions. Despite how boring her character is, we are supposed to love her for her plucky spirit, and of course because of those awful, unloving parents she has. That's about all we can say for her, because that's as developed as this great actress is allowed to get with this horribly empty story and script. Clint is, well, Clint, as usual--the curmudgeonly boxing club owner who's hiding a big heart. Freeman, the wise older black man who has seen it all, and calmly narrates the story, yet whom we are to believe is content with his position, living in an 8x8 room in a stinky boxing gym. Freeman can't hide his intelligence and his greatness in such a shabby role as this--it just doesn't ring true. Swank as well, must've had to dumb herself down. I imagine it was absolutely no challenge at all for any of them to perform these vapid roles, and that Hillary Swank took much more pleasure in being recognized for her much more demanding Boys Don't Cry role. Perhaps Clint forgets that REAL actors require more complex characterizations than Dirty Harry."
"starlit-sky","7","1","4","14 October 2006"," overrated movie which is predictable after the 2nd act.
","I must say that I am really disappointed that this movie got the best picture Oscar. It starts as a promising movie, the opening act is wonderful. Maggie (Hilary Swank) is a young adult woman who is trying to be a professional boxer asking help from an old, experienced boxing coach Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood). Eddie (Morgan Freeman) is Frankie's right-hand and possibly the only one who really understands him. Frankie is haunted by guilt about something happened between him and his daughter in the past and he is reluctant to coach Maggie. But Maggie has been through many hardships and is not a quitter. She is determined to get where she wants and she is willing to do what others are not (actually this is from a sign in the gym they are working out: winners are willing to do what loser are not). Soon enough, she wins Frankie's heart and Frankie finally warms up to the idea of coaching a female boxer. Maggie, in a way, could be thought of as a ""female Rocky"" as she, too, is an underdog, someone who is poor, had many hardships but willing to fight until the end (only, unlike Rocky, it's a she). Then the championship games begin and after the 1st act is over, the movie takes a tumble. From then on, everything is downhill and very predictable. I can honestly say that I knew everything that was going to happen in the last 45 minutes of the movie. I could have walked out the theatre and wouldn't have missed a thing. Because everything that happened in the last act was just predictable. There was no room in the story for any improvement. It's like the plot has been decapacitated. It was very painful to watch. I felt all the buttons that the director was trying to push to activate emotions. They were just too obvious and in our face. Overall, this is not a bad movie but not good enough to win an Oscar."

","It is so sad that movies like this one win so much attention. Why? Is it because Clint Eastwood did the job or is it because of the more common phenomena of the Americans' humble minds? The plot is so simple and everything in this movie is cliché and overkill - exaggerated extremities in all the simple characters. Everything seems so made up and so so so sad and dramatic that it just isn't what it should be: a story about a female boxer and her trainer. Watching the movie I was drown in all the ""strong"" emotions that, in the end, it just didn't feel right. It is not right because you will never encounter these bittersweet black and white feelings in real life but just in a Hollywood movie like this one. It was so extremely serious and dramatic that it even seemed to be a masochistic parody. The closer it came to its end the more often I thought ""Come on, ANOTHER BAD THING?"" until the absolute climax was reached. For me, that was the suicidal part of the story. The first half was quite nice but then it just decrease until an absolute surreal and spoiling overkill end came. What is the value of this movie? It didn't ""move my mind""; and moving a mind is, in my opinion, the crucial emergent element of a good movie. Sorry, but this one is just selling primitive American-style cliché. Exactly 2 points for the two things that this movie could convey: strong emotions and nice fights."
"bulleetz37235","9","1","4","17 September 2005"," One a Million - No make that a trillion.
","This is the best film this side of the year 2000. It is a moving tribute to Clint Eastwood's superior film making abilities and a film that has made an everlasting mark on the film industry. This film sports a beautiful cast of wonderful characters who are genuinely cared for by the audience, and the performances by Hilary Swank (who won the Best Actress Oscar for her role), Clint Eastwood (who shoulda won the Best Actor Oscar, but had to settle for the Best Direction and Picture Oscars instead), and Morgan Freeman (who procured the Best Supporting Actor Oscar) are fantastic, to say the least. So we know it is an Oscar winner, but so what? Well I'll tell you so what. This film is not only deserving of these awards but more praise and recognition than any other film made after the year 2000, and that goes for Gladiator, Training Day, Adaptation and even Clint's earlier film, Mystic River. Not only do the performances gleam, but the story is brilliant, moving and even based on true events. The moods created by Clint's unique direction and the superb acting talents of these main actors, is incomparable to any of the aforementioned films, and the style is not only beautiful but often mesmerising. You want to jump with glee as you see Clint and his boxing prodigy Hilary Swank aspire to great success, but you also feel the horrible snapping of your own nerves as you watch what becomes of them when Hilary's character Margaret Fitzgerald, is left paralysed after a fight. The film will definitely have some in tears, as I had to control the urge to let go and sob my eyes out myself, which I find is hard for a film to do. It is compelling to watch and the overall experience has helped me understand why my most respected director Martin Scorsese missed out on his Oscar. The truth is that Clint out-directed him and made a film that was a lot better to watch, and I think that if there is only one film worth watching this side of the millennium, it has to be Million Dollar Baby."

","Mystic River pulled it off. It had perfect pacing and tension woven into an artfully fluid drama/tragedy. The audience was allowed a sneak into the machinery of Boston Americana and then allowed to go a little deeper into it's underbelly. It was strange and horrible and beautiful too. Million Dollar Baby, conversely, began to feel wincingly contrived as it began to resolve. Have you guys ever read poetry that was TRYING to be poetry...it's painful to read, almost...for all the wrong reasons. Well this movie was a tragedy that was TRYING to be a tragedy. I was never transported in this film. I felt stranded in my seat watching a film about boxing with some flakey comic relief and lots of piteous twists of fate. Each new heaping of plot, toward the end, elicited groans and massaging of my temples...not in empathy, but in dismay. I was barely finished processing one mouthful in one moment when another spoonful comes marching in. It's one thing to be stung by irony in a story and quite another to be buried up to your neck in it.I know, I know...these kinds of things do happen, and they are awful....we've got our Christopher Reeve story...I cannot imagine the struggle that these heroes undergo. But I'm gonna have to insist on some sense of evolution within film making these days.

","Throughout his career Clint Eastwood's roles have walked a fine like between being morally right and being morally wrong. In this movie he once again falls down on the wrong side of that line with a resounding ""thud"". His character's decisions are ones that no human has a right to make. I can say no more about this particular movie, but if his movie career is examined from the very beginning, we see him glory in violence and killing on manufactured and contrived pretexts, and he goes on.

"JamesHitchcock","7","1","4","1 April 2005"," The Triumph of Sentimentality Over Class
","I am intrigued by the title of this film; Clint Eastwood borrowed it from a largely-forgotten comedy from the 1940s (and an even more obscure comedy from the 1930s). This ""Million Dollar Baby"", however, is not a comedy but a serious look at boxing. Maggie Fitzgerald, a young woman from a dysfunctional working-class family in Missouri, nurses an ambition to become a boxer. She asks Frank Dunn, a well-known boxing coach, to train her. Frank is initially reluctant to take her on, because he does not like the idea of women boxing and because he feels that Maggie, in her early thirties, is too old to take up the sport. Maggie is persistent, however, and Frank is eventually won over by her obvious determination. He accepts her as a pupil, and under his guidance she proves an adept learner. Soon Maggie is boxing professionally, and, after winning first few fights by quick knockouts, she wins the right to challenge for the world title against Billie the Blue Bear, a notoriously dirty German fighter with no respect for the Queensberry Rules.<br/><br/>So far, so Rocky. Midway through, however, the film changes tone abruptly. During her fight against Billie, Maggie is felled by an illegal late blow well after the bell. Maggie wakes up in hospital, where she discovers that she is now paralysed. The film changes from a feminist remake of ""Rocky"" to a latter-day version of ""Whose Life Is It Anyway"" as Maggie decides that she does not want to go on living in her crippled state and resolves to put an end to her life.<br/><br/>If Maggie is at the centre of the action in a physical sense, it is Frank who is central to the film in an emotional sense. Frank is an elderly and lonely man, a widower with a single daughter, from whom he is estranged. His religious and spiritual life plays an important role. He is a practising Catholic without being a believing one; although he faithfully attends Mass every day, it is clear from his conversations with his priest that he has severe doubts about many essential elements of Christian doctrine. It becomes clear, especially during the second half of the film, that a strong emotional bond is growing between himself and Maggie. He buys her a dressing-gown to wear in the ring embroidered with the words Mo Cuishle; we learn at the end of the film that this is Irish Gaelic for ""my darling"", but we are never sure whether he sees her as his ""darling"" in the sense of a substitute daughter or of a sweetheart. Perhaps there are elements of both in his feelings for her.<br/><br/>There were a number of things that I did not like about the film. The characterisation of Maggie's greedy and selfish poor-white-trash relatives and that of the evil Billie struck me as stereotypical and one-dimensional. (We are told that Billie is a former prostitute from East Berlin; is this a reference to one of the ""Rocky"" films which also features a Soviet-bloc villain? Or has Clint Eastwood not heard that the Cold War is over?) The two halves of the film do not fit together well, the first being a standard sporting action picture, the second an issue movie about euthanasia. It is, moreover, an issue movie that does not go into the issues involved in any great depth, substituting a treacly sentimentality for any deep moral or ethical analysis. As the film is in many ways a character study of Frank, there is more that I would have liked to have known about him. His priest suggests that his obsessive attendance at Mass is the sign of a man who cannot forgive himself for something. Is this true? What is it in Frank's past that is the source of his guilt feelings? His rift with his daughter, the causes of which are never explained? Or an incident in which Eddie, a fighter trained and managed by him, lost the sight of one eye? <br/><br/>Although my comments about the film have been largely negative, however, I have given it a relatively generous mark. The reason is that it is the sort of film which, although flawed, when it gets things right, does them very well indeed. (""Saving Private Ryan"" is, in my view, another film of the same type). The boxing scenes are very realistic, even if they did not quite have the raw power of those in ""Raging Bull"". More importantly, all three leading acting performances are excellent, from Eastwood as Frank, Morgan Freeman as Eddie, now Frank's assistant, and from Hilary Swank as Maggie. These performances are not, however, enough to lift the film into the same class as Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"", a film which richly deserved its Best Picture Oscar. I felt that ""Million Dollar Baby"" did not deserve to win Best Picture or Best Director ahead of Martin Scorsese's masterpiece ""The Aviator"". Not for the first time, the Academy have preferred sentimentality over class. 7/10"

","Nowhere, in all the debate about Million Dollar Baby, have I seen the moral point raised that bothered me when I saw the film (I had no problem with the ending). When Clint Eastwood tells Hilary Swank to cheat in the fateful fight (ie. to hit up under the fighter's backside), she queries him and he tells her not to let the referee see her do it. So they both know it's wrong, yet she does it and sinks to the level of the other, 'bad' fighter. This enrages the other woman and prompts THAT punch after the round has ended. Yet, later, Clint has the gall to blame Morgan Freeman for what happened, but neither he nor anyone else ever even refers to the heroine's cheating.<br/><br/>This to me is a major missed opportunity by the film to explore the implications of Hilary and Clint's characters' own lapse of morality, and I can't understand why everyone has ignored it. What do others think?<br/><br/>By the way, I think the film was very good but not the untouchable masterpiece some are hyping it as. Martin Scorsese and The Aviator would have got my vote."

The scenes with the priest and with Maggie's family were almost laughable they were so broad and unrealistic. The ending didn't flow with everything that lead up to it, and it simply wasn't effective. We don't really know enough about any of them to care about them in the way the film wants us to. On the plus side: performances were solid, if unspectacular, there were a few good lines, and some of the boxing was exciting. Overall though, it seemed like much ado about nothing.

This somehow goes a distance from what the plot should be.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby do not have the suspense of Mystic River, but magnifies the ugliness of human being.

Morgan Freeman, on the other hand, seems to be suffering from malnutrition in terms of dialogue. He doesn't have much dialogue in the film, and neither did he make any breakthrough performances.

His performance as a former boxer cum Maggie's coach has not been affected by his 'cowboy image' from his previous well-known cowboy shows.

"bgordon1234","Null","1","4","7 February 2005"," not a great film by any means (such hype!!)
","First off, this is a good film, but not a great film. And it does not at all merit the amount of hoopla and attention that it's been getting. I don't know why it has received as much attention as it has. Probably because of its director Clint Eastwood who always garners the spotlight in any project he's involved in.<br/><br/>But this film is rather shallow. It doesn't get deep at all. And many of the scenes are contrived. And if you've ever written a screenplay before, you can see where certain sequences were put in to purposely add tension or conflict but it's contrived and does not feel natural. For example, the minor character, Danger, was obviously an artificial add-on to give the very sparse film a few more interesting characters to fill in the backdrop but he's nothing new or original or even genuine. And he was only necessary to create the subplot which had Morgan Freeman punch the living daylights out of a ""punk"" boxer who if he had been seriously interested in pursuing a career in boxing would not have picked a fight with such a mediocre athlete. That's just one example.<br/><br/>Secondly, any film that has narration to it must be held suspect. And Morgan Freeman's narration added NOTHING to the story. If you were to see this film without any narration whatsoever, you would have come away with the same reaction you did with the narration. It was entirely superfluous and unnecessary and is BAD FILM MAKING. <br/><br/>Thirdly, Hilary Swank's parents were flatly drawn. Her mother expressed no inner conflict about who she was and just wanting the money made her very contemptible and as a result not interesting! You just hate her. But so what?? Then it becomes a sob fest between Clint Eastwood and Swank and that grows tiresome, BORING, and one long weeping Hallmark card. <br/><br/>This is film is good but not great and doesn't at all deserve the encomiums bestowed upon it by film critics who so desperately need to find SOME KIND of film to praise during an otherwise very poor year for film (2004, that is). Always remember folks, conflict is what drives a movie forward. Conflict!!

","This movie was pretty good, but it has a big flaw in it. I haven't watched that much boxing, but I'm pretty sure the rules are different than pro wrestling. You can't sucker punch your opponent after the bell with their backs turn and not face a DQ or suspension. If they really wanted to paralysis Swank's character, why not just make it that she was pushing her self to get through the match. She was sticking in there when anyone else would have given up. After a late round, she walks to her corner, gets dizzy, and then falls on the chair. I wondered how this movie was going to end. Like Rocky 1 or Rocky 2?

","I'm a little torn about this movie. first- i was a bit disappointed as i did buy into the hype surrounding it- after all Eastwood and Freeman together again? Boxing buddies instead of cowboys? sounded and looked like a sure winner. add to that the young female lead, Hillary Swank as a strong independent woman boxer to contrast the two old guys and the appeal just increased.<br/><br/>however- Million Dollar Baby is in no way this years A Beautiful Mind. <br/><br/>not even close.<br/><br/>don't get me wrong- it's a well made drama which uses some time honored recipes of film-making to make it's points but that's about all it is. there is little outstanding here. story, acting, direction- it's all been seen and done before. I'm not saying it was done badly, just previously. additionally- the boxing here is very poorly choreographed, nearly all of the actors come off looking cartoonish as they punch. i've seen many women's pro and amateur boxing matches- and the choreography here does those athletes little justice.<br/><br/>I do however give a nod to Ms. Swank as she pulled off her role as the 30-something trailer park trash-turned boxer very well. she was honest and believable and outshone her two co-stars, who looked like their UNFORGIVEN characters thrust into uncomfortable clothing.<br/><br/>think of Million Dollar Baby as ROCKY meets Brian's Song and you won't be too far off, except here Rocky doesn't win the title and Gayle Sayers becomes just another Joe. <br/><br/>It is a sad story, with very sad characters. but the scenes that should leave you wrenching your heart out leave you looking for the last few doritos in the bottom of the bag. the crumbs you get taste good- but they're just not the real thing. <br/><br/>the script is very well written and i did like the voice-over narration of Freeman, it was a nice touch.<br/><br/>Overall, I say a 7.5 out of 10. definitely worth watching, but not the Oscar-Sweeper everyone is saying it is."

Really, this movie changed my life in some point and made me realize many other things I've almost missed in my life (movies and more).<br/><br/>I was really stunned when I knew that all the narration lines (his voice) were a letter from Scrap (Morgan Freeman) to Eastwood's daughter who never read the weekly letters Frankie (Eastwood) wrote to her because she refused to forgive him for some unspecified past actions.<br/><br/>I love to watch every scene in the movie over and over again. Every aspect of it is amazingly done. Half of the movie is like a victory sort of happy period of every character, the 2nd half is a horrible sad story that bring a lot of tears to your eyes! I couldn't believe how the entire movie was changed. Only a few directors CAN do this. It literally moves you and controls your emotions and leave you speechless, only your tears and your open jaw can tell how you feel.<br/><br/>Jay Baruchel (Danger) seems to have a very small and NOT important character in the movie. After watching them movie many times, you realize that he's actually NOT. He could be someone very important, maybe he's the Million Dollar baby!

","Million Dollar Baby is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding cast. It's a very dramatic movie that tells a very realistic story, there is nothing about it that feels cliché or cheesy, everything that goes right for these characters is because of determination and hard work, and anything that goes wrong, there's literally nothing they can do about it, the character development is superb, they are relatable, they are human. I felt like the movie was, at times, a little overly sentimental, it works for the most part but there are moments were it feels a little forced and that it could have been toned down a little, there should have been more scenes where the characters are genuinely happy in each other's company and there is no real drama, just friendship. The performances are outstanding, a movie like this could never have been good without stellar acting, and the casting here is perfect, Hillary Swank shines in every scene, and an Academy Award was well deserved to both her and Morgan Freeman, who isn't in it as much as Swank or Eastwood, but he steals every scene he has and his narration adds perfectly to the film's tone, and as for Clint Eastwood, this is without a doubt some of his best work as both an actor and a director, his character is flawed, angry, and very real, it seemed to come very naturally to him, all the emotion is evident in both his eyes and speech. Powerful, emotional and superbly acted, Million Dollar Baby is a Best Picture Winner for a reason, and I would recommend it to all moviegoers.<br/><br/>A tough skinned trainer plans to drive a boxer to the top, putting his own skills to the test. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Clint Eastwood Worst Performance: Riki Lindhome"
"gaurav_toyo","9","1","5","29 December 2013"," ""MILLION DOLLAR BABY""-Reviewing an Eastwood classic
","A classic in modern day movie -making, an oddity and rarity but a true depiction of real life avalanche of pain, suffering and being made to feel unwanted as Maggie(Hillary Swank) quotes in the initial part of the movie ""am just a trash girl"". Clint Eastwood reprises his role as the old tough guy which was even more accentuated by his 2008 movie Gran Torino, his ruggedness only a sheath concealing the magnanimous heart that man has. Rejected by his daughter at an early age, how this failed hero in boxing relives his dream through a girl disowned by society and her non-altruistic family especially is a masterpiece to watch. Coming from the lowest echelons of society, with a family to support who don't care a speck about her, her character and passion for this sport powers through, reflecting the urge, the pain, the need for gratification, the need for some self respect which this masochistic world has made her devoid of, let alone bragging rights. Hillary is fantastic in this flick, her portrayal of the quintessential low class girl with a nigga-accent, working in the daytime as a bar waitress and cleaner saving money for training by eating off the scraps left over by customers on their plates and continuing her relentless practice till the night engulfs the center and she is the only one left. Age is not on her side being a thirty-one year old woman, all these years were wasted in order to just survive, and the outward arrogance of the man Eastwood is discourages her ""i don't coach girls"". As the motion picture rolls on, and as Maggie goes from strength to strength, her proximity to her coach(Eastwood) increases. Everything from her itinerary to ringside coaching, emotional support acting as if he were her dad comes from the rugged old guy. There's one moving scene in the movie where Maggie is going to compete for the WBA World Women's Welterweight championship in Vegas, and her coach allows her for the first time to have a say in their mode of travel to which she replies""We'll go by flight, and come back on a drive"" to which the coach smirks ""that's about the most stupid thing I have heard anyone say"". But as fate would have it this would turn out to be a tragic turn of events, where she was winning the bout but was ambush attacked by her opponent fatally after the time out bell had rung. She goes into an almost coma like state, being actually transported back through an ambulance drive(as she had earlier wished from Vegas) with Eastwood by her side. She is transferred to a clinic being alive on a respirator, not able to move her body where it gets bedsore and one of her legs have to be amputated. One night she expresses her will to die to Frankie(Eastwood), to discard this lifeless, limp form as it was pointless for her to live this way after seeing everything, how the crowds cheered her name, how her fame instilled the pride she never had and also she also reminisces that her father too had taken away his own life. Frankie opposes but hours later there's a phone call to him notifying that she had attempted it by cutting her tongue and was almost bleeding to death. Frankie goes to the church he has been attending for the past 23 years without default and admits to the Father, that this girl listens to nothing of his, the only one of his protégés to do so. Even the fame she has achieved is because of herself only. That night he decides even in death he has no control over her and has to do according to her wish. He removes the respirator and injects adrenaline, enough to kill her many times over. Thereafter Frankie is never to be heard of, as narrated by Morgan Freeman who also does a fantastic job as the half blind failed wrestler and Frankie's companion."

Really? But Clint figured the movie couldn't function without him, as he seems to think the audience needs to explicitly hear him receive forgiveness from the deity.<br/><br/>The genre has been done to death, so if one is going to make a boxing movie, the movie needs to be about something other than boxing: ""Raging Bull"" was really about sado-masochism; ""Diggstown"" was really about con artistry; ""Fat City"" was really about the agriculture worker underclass.<br/><br/>And one area that Clint always gets right is his depiction of the blue-collar world and his effective promotion of young, unknown actors up the ranks. He would get this right in the superior ""Gran Torino"". There, he takes chances and succeeds; here, he takes absolutely no chances at all. It is contrived, and radiates this fact in an offensive way. No thanks."

He's starred in some great films but his self directed films don't do very well. The story line in Million Dollar Baby had so many holes in it that it seemed like it was written scene by scene with not even bread crumbs to lead a viewer through the storyline. If not for the very controversial aspect of it (euthanasia, right to die)it would have faded just as quickly as some of his other flops (Bloodwork, True Crime, .

Disgust at having someone pressing my tear glands so unceremoniously.<br/><br/>What Million Dollar Baby fails most miserably at is creating a believable interaction between it's main characters. As all the actors for the main parts have shown they're capable of better, we must blame the director. Especially sad is Eastwood's own performance. Usually very dependable, Eastwood is so weak in this film, it's almost irritating to watch him. Swank and Freeman manage to make the most of their weak roles but to call their appearances ""noteworthy"" would be an exaggeration.<br/><br/>Of course the real baddie in this drama is the story itself, which is chuck-full of crudely-drawn clichés, caricatures and plain stupidity. Even a B-movie deserves better than this drivel.<br/><br/>Eastwood is badly in need of material for a rehabilitation after this latest performance.<br/><br/>By the way, putting this movie on a par with Raging Bull is both ridiculous and an insult to Martin Scorcese.

","Following the template set by Mystic River, Clint Eastwood turns in another overlong, murky, shallow film concocted more for the dulled palates of Academy voters than with any intention of entertaining or stimulating its audience. For the first two thirds, it's just Karate Kid all over again - hopeless young wannabe persuades elderly pro to train them, wax on/wax off, becomes champion fighter. Then we get the euthanasia bit tacked on to the end, without any genuine attempt to tackle the complexity of the issue. Not least of which is the legal position - at the end, would Eastwood's character really have been allowed to just slink away without any repercussions?

The whole euthenasia (sp) scene with Eastwood putting Swank 'down' like her late father did to a dog (circa old yeller) was contrite and completely unrealistic, ie when a patient is hooked up to those machines the whole system goes crazy if they are shut down and the fact that it is 'murder' under our judicial system, save Oregon. The writers want us to believe that all of a sudden Eastwood is going to be living in the boonies somewhere for the rest of his existence when in fact he will be easily found, (he has been visiting her everyday since she was admitted) arrested, put on trial and then thrown in jail. And what's up with the whole last half hour anyway not a mention of what happens to the other boxer, it was a boxing movie right, well what the hell happened to her? Sorry but Hollywood just took a whole slew of 'blockbuster' type scenarios put them all together and viola Oscar.

I'm no racist, but is there really that much demand for a movie about Ray Charles? Next time your friends start that ""Ray Charles was a musical genius"" talk, say, ""Wow, you must be a big fan, how many of his albums do you have?"". The response will sound like this, ""Well, I don't actually have any of his albums, but..."". Again, recently-dead-man-PC-correct hype; but still just hype. The Aviator is at least 20 years too late coming out. I was born in '67 and barely recall hearing of Howard Hughes when he died. Ask anyone under 30 who he was and they may know. Ask them why he's rich and famous and they'll have no clue. Supporting my theory again, Million Dollar Baby is #1 by default, there's nothing better right now to hype.<br/><br/>Let's break it down: It was TOO long and too slow. Why was Clint estranged from his daughter? We don't know, they never bothered to tell us. The truth is Clint should give his Oscar to Dana Reeves, Superman's wife, because this movie is Christopher Reeve's story, just minus the horse accident.

That's life, but it's not a very good movie. <br/><br/>A better movie  A) They tell us more of the girl's terrible upbringing and show her awful family more, and she becomes heavyweight champion (okay, it's called Rocky and we've seen that already). B) She fights to overcome the neck injury and regains limited mobility and (semi) defeats paralysis (I'm sure this has been done too, I just don't know what it was called). C) She really can't get better, but Clint loves her as his surrogate daughter (because they've better explained where is real daughter is) and he cares for her the rest of her life because he finally learned to love somebody (again, probably been done). Any of those beat what we got.<br/><br/>Lastly, if you kill somebody, you don't just go have lemon pie; I'd bet the police might want to see you. And, I'm not Catholic, but a priest who drops the F-bomb at church, I don't think so. So be a ""Hootie"" sheep or see this picture for what it really ain't."

","An overly sappy drama that tries too hard to be a political statement, which is something it isn't at all.

And, the title is not appropriate whatsoever; the film was not even worth the $7 I paid for the ticket.<br/><br/>Did not deserve the Oscars it won, excluding Freeman.<br/><br/>They mine as well give me an Oscar, since they seem to be shoveling them over to Ms. Swank...who, as she reminded us, was ""raised in a trailer.""<br/><br/>Well Hilary, we sure can tell."
"Sabriane","5","1","5","2 March 2005"," How on earth did this win Best Picture?
","Without the hype, Million Dollar Baby would have been a decent if unremarkable little movie. Unfortunately, after all the breathless praise and accolades bestowed on it I can only think of it as yet another overrated Clint Eastwood film and its flaws are made even more glaring.<br/><br/>Good things first: Hilary Swank was absolutely amazing. There's not much depth to her character to be honest; Maggie is defined by her role as a plucky and determined fighter we root for and little else. But Swank gives it all and she's such a believable and unadorned actress that she can't fail melt your heart. As for other leads, Clint Eastwood is solid enough but I can't help thinking that Morgan Freeman's Oscar win is essentially a lifetime achievement award for a performance that doesn't offer you anything you haven't seen from him already. It's not that he's not good - he is - it's just another over-familiar, ""wise observer"" role that has become Freeman's trademark. He and Eastwood have easy chemistry and some nice scenes together, but the humour in the scenes where their characters discuss powder and socks is overwritten and forced.<br/><br/>By the time I actually got to watch the film I of course have heard everything about the ""shocking twist"". By the time Maggie gets down to her big Las Vegas fight I was hoping the twist would come soon already because the first hour of the film didn't offer much beyond a serving of by-the-numbers conventions and clichés that made every plot development and character reaction brain-numbingly predictable. There is some good stuff too: the montage of Maggie dispatching her opponents is fun and there are some nice moments between the leads. But, fifteen minutes in, you already know that -of course- Frankie's best fighter is going to abandon him; that -of course- after the obligatory initial animosity Frankie is going to train Maggie because, don't you know, he's got a heart of pure gold under that hard glowering exterior; that -of course- Maggie will miraculously start to win every fight under the sun. My main problem though is not the clichés themselves - no film can completely escape them - but rather the po-faced, humourless portentousness Eastwood presents them with. It's as if the film tries to lift itself above the hokey melodrama by giving its characters solemn fortune-cookie utterances and drenching itself in as many shades of ugly ""gritty"" green as possible.<br/><br/>Anyways, the twist finally comes and, according to the reviews, here is where the film truly kicks in and you discover why Eastwood was attracted to the story in the first place. Whereas I discovered film kicking into even greater excess of melodrama and shameless emotional manipulation. Of course I was heartbroken for Maggie - but found it incredibly contrived that in a hurry to get to Maggie's suffering the film doesn't deal -at all- with the dirty blow her German opponent lands her and that would surely get her disqualified or cause some outrage. And if Maggie's no-good hillbilly Momma was unlikeable in the first act, here her entire family might as well have worn ""we are evil"" stamp on their foreheads - describing them as caricatures is paying them a compliment. Giving the audience such easy targets for derision is just a cheap move on the part of the filmmakers.<br/><br/>To be honest, I was very surprised by reactions that accused the film of pushing euthanasia agenda; I thought that the whole thing was so situational and so specific to these particular characters it didn't even occur to me to think that Clint was making some broad statement. I'm not sure how I feel about Maggie's wish to die though - it's easy to believe it in the film because she's conveniently shown to have NO life or any interests outside of the gym. But couldn't she just request to take her off the system, without all that improbable melodrama with needles and Frankie sneaking into hospital with no detection whatsoever? Overall, yet another average tear-jerker praised to heavens for unfathomable reason."
"merrywood","9","1","5","10 February 2005"," Eastwood's best entry to date (2004)
","Eastwood says ""it is not a fight picture"" but if this is not a fight picture then what is it? He calls it a ""love story."" What it really is, in pure essence, is a story of the triumph of the human spirit. Boxing, however, in particular a form even more odious to me than male boxing, if that is possible, is the thematic vehicle.<br/><br/>The only major weakness of the film lies in its ""lines of broadcast"" what we called a story riddled with predictability in the old Paramount creative lab where I was fortunate enough to be tortured and harassed by several old pros for some time; writers and masters, they were. The predictability rises to the level of contrivance. That said, though it's also generally a familiar tale it stands as Clint Eastwood's career best picture to 2004 and also his best performance to date. In the subtext of the Eastwood character's mysterious negative relationship with his own daughter (whom we never meet nor understand) as he trains a young woman boxer there lays a profound irony which takes the story into the realm of the classics.<br/><br/>The picture is a hard-sell pitch FOR euthanasia, in which I believe and something that thus far only the more intelligently governed nations can grasp (e.g. The Netherlands). It's also a real put-down on the entire fight game on several levels; the most salient is the retarded character, with the obvious name: Danger Barch. His entire presence and subtext scenario is not accidental.<br/><br/>Not a major aspect but although predictable the script carries very good dialog.<br/><br/>The heartfelt gift of this film, however is a return to the fabulous rolling narrative performed by Morgan Freeman in Shawshank Redemption. Here, he once again asks us to sit quietly with him as he tells his bittersweet human tale.<br/><br/>The feature has from me a qualified recommendation (if you can tolerate depicted boxing violence in the extreme)."
"bobbobwhite","Null","1","5","10 February 2005"," Good but not great
","I liked MDB but not as much as some did. It portrayed the gritty boxing gym scene OK in parts, but had some glaring boxing technical mistakes or oversights that bothered me. Why didn't Eastwood run the film for boxing technical advisors before the final cut? Oh, well. But it did convey the emotion and drama of ""fight night"" pretty well, however Eastwood's very spare acting and direction have gotten quite threadbare for me over the years, and often I wish for a bit more emotional ""ooomph"" in his films. I get kinda weary of the Joe Friday, ""just the facts, maam"", school of acting and direction so typical of Eastwood.<br/><br/>Swank was terrific in her role but too was way too angelic and saintly for real life as a vicious knockout fighter, Freeman didn't ring true for today when he did not take any offense at all when called the N-word over and over by a mentally defective, wannabe fighter, and Eastwood was not terribly convincing as he vastly underplayed his role as a crusty and irritable trainer and manager. But the film did make a creditable attempt to show that sometimes a life just may be worth dying for certain people in certain situations, especially after a tragedy takes 99% of it from them beforehand. Very controversial issue in America's ""just say no to assisted suicide"" position of today.<br/><br/>Not nearly as good a film as Sideways, but worthy."

Her opponent surely must have been disqualified after the referee's warning plus attacking from the rear AFTER the round was clearly over. Who, then, was the winner - the referee? Sorry, but illogical moments like this in many films seem much too emotionally manipulative. Also, constantly we see heroes and villains fighting and running for long periods, followed immediately by dialog scenes with no actor even breathing hard - sprayed by makeup with fake sweat, but clearly having just stepped out of their trailer.

","Hilary Swank plays a female boxer who is doing extremely well in her career. However, halfway through the movie, she has an accident and becomes a paraplegic. The rest of the movie is spent with Hilary Swank's character asking for her mentor (played by Clint Eastwood) to put her out of her misery because she can no longer live her dreams. She argues that because she can no longer live her dreams, because they are dead to her now, that she has no value in life and there is no point in living. This is a complete devaluation of life and a completely emotion based concept that has no founding in reality. It teaches that when events go sour that you should just give up and die because you are worthless. It is a testament to Hollywood's low value of life that they would promote Euthanasia and the other cowardly concepts in this movie. That they slip it subtly in through a candy coated story only makes it that much more sickening. I do not recommend wasting your money to support this movie to anyone who has any objective moral grounding or concept of self worth."

"Magenta_Bob","8","1","6","29 July 2013"," ""I've got nobody but you, Frankie."" ""Well, you've got me.""
","This movie just crushes me. I used to be lukewarm about it and say that it consists of one plain bad half and one great half, but I can't really even do that anymore as I started tearing up during the first half already this time around, even if it might have been in anticipation of what was to come. There's still a lot of stuff in it that I don't like; the writing feels very Academy Awards 101 and/or high school essay (in the same way American History X did), Morgan Freeman as the goodhearted narrator and Clint Eastwood as the grumpy protagonist are as cliché as they come, as is the whole premise of a ""cut man"" who can patch up people but not his own life, and the 10-second boxing matches in general and the East German prostitute opponent in particular are ludicrous. But it's like, when you have hot tears dripping onto your shirt, who cares? In some ways it reminded me of Dancer in the Dark in that you can find a lot of faults with it and question its manipulation but ultimately don't care as it manipulates so well. If Lars von Trier made a boxing movie, this would probably be it. Hilary Swank also fits together with ""golden heart"" protagonists Björk and Nicole Kidman as someone who is perceived by herself and others as trash, and swiftly gets robbed of whatever good that comes her way.<br/><br/>The catalytic event that separates the two halves of the movie is of course Maggie Fitzgerald's accident and subsequent paralysis. It's a pretty weird decision to take a sports movie and turn it into a discussion piece on euthanasia halfway in, but I think it works quite well. First of all, the narration lays the ground for the second half by symbolically talking about wounds that can't be healed, Secondly, the whole subplot with Danger might be a metaphor for lost causes. There's also the thing about the fighter having to fight outside the ring as well. The film explores the aspects and consequences for both the person on the deathbed and the person next to it, maybe not in any particular depth, but as much as is allowed without feeling overly didactic. And the final punch hits harder than any of the ones in the ring."
"rosscbeauregard","7","1","6","5 March 2012"," Noble, yet flawed effort from Clint Eastwood
","From this director I have seen GRAN TORINO and UNFORGIVEN, both of which are exceptional movies, and after both of those tours-de-forces I must admit that my review may be a bit harder than if I had not seen those films. MILLION DOLLAR BABY is indeed quite flawed in many ways. For one thing, I really have no idea why Morgan Freeman is in this, because his character seems to serve no other purpose than being a narrator (which is unfortunately what the man seems to be most famous for these days). However, this is without a doubt a very good, and for one useless supporting character, we have two very well-written main characters.<br/><br/>At this point I would usually write some sort of light summary of the plot, but it is very hard to do this for MILLION DOLLAR BABY without giving away a very interesting plot twist. And it is this twist that will either make or ruin the movie for most people. All that one needs to know is that this is about boxing and the will to be the best. Mostly.<br/><br/>The main problem with this film is that some of the drama feels clichéd and forced, which is interesting because the film is at its best when its doing exactly the opposite: being unpredictable. The result is a film that feels a little uneven. Nonetheless, this is a satisfying watch.<br/><br/>Recommended to people who don't mind depressing dramas."
"ShootingShark","5","1","6","5 February 2008"," Poignant But Lame Hardcase Boxing Trainer Takes On Girl Fighter Tearjerker
","Frankie Dunn is a seen-it-all veteran boxing trainer who reluctantly agrees to coach a young woman, Maggie Fitzgerald, who has some talent but no experience. He carefully brings her along, teaches her how to fight and how to make it, and slowly she works her way up to a shot at the Women's Welterweight Title. Tragedy awaits, however ...<br/><br/>I have never understood the Oscars. The one was a big winner - Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor, which is nice, since it's a good movie and Eastwood's success as an elder statesman filmmaker is hugely deserved. But, and this must be said, this movie's plot is as lame as a three-legged donkey with a really bad case of arthritis. It's as if it was trying to get in everything from The Big Book Of Boxing Movie Clichés - the grizzled old trainer, the gutsy up'n'comer, the washed-up hasbeen, the surrogate father, the one big shot at the title, the dirty fighter, the man haunted by his unspoken past, blood on the canvas, the cruel injustice of the ring. There's even a family of greedy rednecks and a feeble-minded guy the heroes look out for. Jeez, that stuff was already corny back when Wallace Beery made The Champ in 1931 ! It shamelessly steals from a hundred better films; Rocky has more street-cred, Raging Bull more style, Homeboy (a hugely underrated boxing film) more pathos, Triumph Of The Spirit and The Hurricane more intrigue, and its one original twist - a female boxer - comes from Karyn Kusama's indie flick Girlfight, conspicuously made just a few years before. Having said all that though, if you forget about the plot and focus on the characters, it's a beautiful film. As ever, Eastwood develops the people with tenderness and intensity so that every nuance and scene has depth and dramatic bite. It's an unusual three-character setup - two old guys and a young woman - but their friendship, respect and critical bluster towards each other is touching and brilliantly played. Swank is one of the best actresses of her generation and she doesn't do the obvious thing here - make Maggie a hard, defeminised tough guy - instead, she simply plays it straight and convinces both as a fighter and as a woman seeking an escape from the white-trash lifestyle she has come to accept. This is finely judged, and without this performance the character could easily have slipped into a ridiculous caricature. Even better is old pro Freeman, who steals the show with his quiet dignity, rascally moments (the dialogue about socks is priceless) and mellow narration. I like boxing movies - the ring-as-metaphor-for-anything is too rich an idea not to - and this one is good, but only if you're prepared to go with a script which scores a grade A for characterisation and a grade F for plotting. Based on Rope Burns, a book of stories by Jerry Boyd/F.X. Toole, a real trainer and ringside cut-man. Trivia - Lucia Rijker, who plays Billie, the evil fighter, is a real boxing and kickboxing women's champ, and also acted as a technical adviser on the movie."

","Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris' (Morgan Freeman) role as narrator is appropriately done and his soothing almost monotonous voice carries the film well. The character Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is exceptional and I believe a good example of a person in the boxing industry and certainly representative of men's reaction to women in the sport (if indeed if can be called that because it really is licensed mutilation and assault)! Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank) is a star even before she wins in the ring just from her attitude to life and how she handles her ungrateful family. I really enjoyed the film and was taken into its world as if I were a fly on all the respective walls. Another great film from Clint Eastwood and friends and although late I am glad I finally got to see it.<br/><br/>In the Netherlands we don't let people linger on in a state of abject misery and live a life without function or value however to ask another human especially a friend and father figure to end one's life is a tall ask! I believe that three independent Doctors are required to sign for Euthanasia in Nederland so the burden is dramatically reduced on family and friends plus there are checks and balances. <br/><br/>I hope I am never asked to do this as I am currently in Australia and also hope that I do NOT ask anyone else for this last favour, so I'd better be in Holland if the time comes!"

Boxing is a brutal sport and how anyone can get excited about people knocking the crap out of each other and risking serious injury is beyond me.<br/><br/>Then the entire second part of the movie was about the fallen champ becoming a bedridden vegetable.

It is not the acting that spoils the mood, it is the very tedious tempo of the film. Did you notice that sport films are mostly very boring? The acute, high-pitched and up-tempo sport scenes are intermittent with impossibly slow and boring ""real life"" moments, when we see that they are also people, that they have their problems too and so on.

Clint Eastwood has become a master of timing releasing his pictures just in time to be considered for Oscars. <br/><br/>Qudos to the acting & production qualities of this film. The ending would cause me to have 3 hankies except for the fact that the script does not generate enough emotion for me to care about the characters enough. Something is missing in that Hillary Duff's character does not reach me enough in this script to make me care about what happens to her.<br/><br/>The best comparison to make to this film is the classic film ROCKY. In that film, your pulled in because you can relate to the underdog a lot and in his humanity. You really care about Rocky. While Duff's performance is top notch, the script does not rise to the level of ROCKY in that it really does not achieve the same emotional attachment to her. Will the soon to be released Rocky sequel rise above this film? It could & still not get best picture as the original already has won it. Million Dollar Baby has already been forgotten since 2004 by a lot of viewers in the same way that many will never know Cleveland won the 2000 Super Bowl(?)(For the history buff- the St. Louis Rams were originally the Cleveland Rams when they won their first Championship in 1945.) <br/><br/>The films ending comes off as flat and predictable because of the script. This film is above average in camera work, direction, & acting, but the weakness of the script to me is the main thing that stops it from being a great film. You could tell Duff's character was going to have a tragic end almost at the beginning of the film, which is why the viewer can't get emotionally involved."
"Dboss-1","7","1","6","19 March 2005"," Good story telling technique but script is lackluster compared to everything else.
","Million Dollar Baby is a very good film. If I were to make a top ten, it would be on there but not before probably 4-6 films. This is not Clint Eastwood's best directorial job. It is however his best performance as an actor and in my mind, deserved more recognition than just a nomination. Swank and Freeman are both very good but in my opinion they fall short of Eastwood's performance. Most critics and industry people are jaded because they form relationships with these people and root for them and that taints the accuracy of reviews and nomination processes Freeman won this year because he should have won a long time ago for either Driving Miss Daisy or Shawshank Redemption, whereas this year the actual best performance in that category was clearly Thomas Haden Church. Swank won because she was in the best movie at the best release time. If Eternal Sunshine for the Spotless Mind was more popular and was released after Halloween, Kate Winslet would be billed everywhere in every magazine as the next Meryl. I think what makes this film fall short of being an immortal piece of work is the script. It's good, like everything else in the movie (except maybe cinematography, but that's being very picky). However, Haggis' script is not insightful enough. There is too much responsibility on the actor's side to give us insight into the suffering all of them have suffered and are suffering. That is why I feel Eastwood's performance is the best in the entire film. He tells us everything that has gone on in his life with just his look and voice. Freeman and Swank give us some indication but not to the depth. Had Haggis provided more insight into the struggles of Scrap and the drama between Maggie and her family or a deeper relationship exploration between her and Frankie, this would have moved me deeper and placed it among the great American movies."

Sure Clint Eastwood organized the production very well, his acting was okay, and his score didn't sound too bad either (one of those nice chicken-pecking piano tunes), but was the production as a whole better than that of ""The Aviator""? This comment centers on this year's Academy Awards more than it does the film. Honestly and deeply in my soul I ask myself this question once again ""Has the Academy lost its mind?"" My interpretation of what is most likely best picture of the year is the one that succeeds on the widest variety of factors. ""The Aviator"", nominated for eleven awards actually competing against ""Million Dollar Baby"" (7 nominations)? This should be one of those obvious landslides like Titanic was in '97 or ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" should have been in '01. I'm so sick of members of the Academy voting for who they think DESERVES an Oscar over who did the best job. Take Morgan Freeman for example. Poor Scorsese.

","I've loved the majority of Eastwood's films as director in the last decade (and consider LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA to be one of the finest war films ever made), but MILLION DOLLAR BABY is a film that left me cold. On the face of it, there's nothing much to dislike: it's expertly crafted with Eastwood's eye for technical detail and cast members delivering Oscar-winning performances.<br/><br/>But, nonetheless, something didn't gel with me. It may be that the rags-to-riches boxing story is far too familiar, having been done decades ago in the much lower-budgeted ROCKY, a film with a simpler plot and worse actors that was far more powerful, thanks to its raw heartfelt emotion. In contrast, MILLION DOLLAR BABY is ice-cold, and something feels very staged about it.<br/><br/>Swank is believable as the female boxer, but once again I felt no empathy for her character (Swank, like Cate Blanchett, never seems to get the audience on side). Eastwood and Freeman feel tired, both just giving yet another variation on already familiar character types. The pacing is slow and the running time overlong, making the storyline feel stretched out; the last hour or so is particularly painful to watch.<br/><br/>I enjoy movies because they're entertaining and I often prefer escapism over highbrow intellectualism.

","After leaving the theater last night, I didn't know whether I enjoyed the movie, or had a blah feeling about it.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie, on the whole was good. Swank, Eastwood and Freeman all played believable, likable characters. The ""feel"" of the movie wasn't all that different than Mystic River, a lot of washed out colors, and very stark.<br/><br/>But like Mystic River, There were points of the movie that were beyond belief, and made me lose feeling for the movie.<br/><br/>First off, Swank's family is shallow and clichéd. Redneck family, trailer park, teenage sister has a baby, brother just got out of prison, momma is leeching off welfare and when ""Pa"" was alive, he loved his dog. The Rednack Royal Flush. Not only were they clichés, they were totally unlikeable, even as villains. I don't know if this is the overacting, or just the overall shallowness of their character development, but the scenes with them detracted from the film as a whole.<br/><br/>Second is the boxing scenes. Now I won't say it wasn't unexpected that she quickly rose through the ranks, as almost every movie involving sports involves the little guy rising to the top (and usually winning), but the scenes where she is fighting are unbelievable on a few levels. I believe most of which has to do with poor direction and camera placement.<br/><br/>Almost all of the punches thrown look very obviously like staged punches. I didn't wince when punches were landing, because none of the punches looked like they were landing. It all looked more fake than Walker Texas Ranger.<br/><br/>In addition to this, during the boxing scenes in which they showed a significant portion of the crowd, they were usually looking very goofy. I'd sit there and look at how poorly the extras were being directed, and then I'd wonder why I was getting that long of a view at extras with no obvious acting skills. Aside from the Irish folk in her first British fight, the crowd was simply annoying.<br/><br/>And much as been said about the final fight, and how it was unbelievable, and that fight would have been called. No doubt.<br/><br/>My final note will deal with the hospital scenes. The only part about these that bothered me, was the ""Win One For The Gipper""-ish talks between Swank and Eastwood. ""Bawsss, I won't walk again will I?"" blah blah blah. The scene as a whole was dragged on too long, and with all the media it has gotten about the assisted suicide, I wanted to kill myself by how long it dragged on.<br/><br/>So I gave it a 6 out of 10. Get rid of the clichés and unbelievability, and it'd be an 8."

","We went to see this movie with great anticipation because the trailers that I had seen were very upbeat. The movie had a good story going for it until the last scenes. Had they stopped the movie at that point of her tragic injury it would be a 'thumbs up'. However, after her injury until the end of the movie it was a real downer. It amounted to nothing more than emotional voyeurism. There is much tragedy in the world that is real and sad. This movie simply angered me because of the juxtaposition of the comedy and the tragedy. The acting was very good, but the actors deserved a better script. On a scale of 1 to 10, I would give this movie a solid 2."

","I will never understand how this movie could beat out The Aviator, Sideways, or Finding Neverland for Best Picture. And once again Martin Scorsese got snubbed at the Oscar's losing out to Clint Eastwood, who directed this style-less picture. This movie is so cliché and all of the tear-jerker nonsense feels very artificial. The word artificial, I think, sums up this movie very well. Clint Eastwood just isn't a very good director. I will say though, that Morgan Freeman is excellent in this picture. Although, if you want to see a great Freeman film, go and check out the Shawshank Redemption, where he lost out to Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump. Another movie that is totally artificial."

","Clint Eastwood is awesome. From the old spaghetti westerns, to Unforgiven I've enjoyed his work. MDB, on the other hand, is the 109th fight he should have never done. This film relies on stereotyped devices to articulate a fruitless, wayward journey to nowhere. Swank is somewhat endearing as the slightly vacant fighter doggedly pursuing...pursuing a fight. Why, no reason. OK, because she's poor. Clint is an older, softer Josey Wales with just a touch more humor. Poor Josey, matured into old age where he has to hang out with girls and wear his pants just below the breast. Freeman is just driving Miss Daisy (with perhaps a nostalgic urge to get to zihuatanejo). Morgan and Eastwood have their grumpy old men moments that can bring a chuckle. The high jinx of the characters in the gym would make for a great counterpart to the dodge ball crew. The squat, butt back, face forward fighting in the ring looks like 12 year old fruitcakes (not that there is anything wrong with that) slap fighting. I'll concede an exciting moment or two but in the end it collapses into a Van Damme Bloodsport fight scene remake. The reason that the critics are getting so misty is that the good guy loses. Well, that and the fact that it is part of our moral fiber to be nice to old people. $1000K nina gets a 1-2-3 punch with that; old to the point of dead writer, old actor/ director/icon, old buddy. Knockout! I have yet to see The Aviator, but Finding Neverland, Ray, and Sideways tell much more compelling stories. Clint isn't done, but this was not the story or the role. The tube should have been pulled before the opening bell."

","85% of this movie was Brilliant. The ending was the saddest, sickest farce imaginable. Assisted Suicide was not an option for the fighter with ""the most Heart of anyone that Freeman had ever seen"". Only a member of the Academy, or their secretary, could have fallen for this tripe. Ulcers? Not gonna happen, these days. Dopamine murder? After ruining the lives of so many other fighters, he wants to kill the best fighter he has ever trained? Please. The ending was THE reason that this movie was made, in the first place.

","I have really enjoyed a few of the movies that Clint Eastwood has directed, but this was not one of them.<br/><br/>The story overall was quite good, and could have presented the viewer with an interesting and involving story. Instead what I found was characters that did not seem real and a plot progression that didn't feel right. It was the details that didn't work for me. A few words and a few scenes here and there that just yanked me away from the movie, leaving me feeling no attachment at all to the characters.<br/><br/>I think that they went all out in the many comedic scenes, so that once they put those same characters into serious scenes, it felt like an adaptation of a comic book -- not very believable. I kept on thinking of the scenes in the first Spider-Man movie when he went to that fight, not very real, but fun to watch. I enjoyed the comedic and action side of Million Dollary Baby, but it left the dramatic side feeling pretty distant and surreal.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, I found my favourite character in the movie was not either of the two leads, but the secondary character ""Scraps"", who was played by Morgan Freeman.

","The story for Million Dollar Baby is darn near impossible to define in precise terms. What starts out as not only an engaging and exhilarating boxing drama but also an emotionally stirring divulgence into the belief of second chances quickly, and all too suddenly, shifts gears into a pure propagandist piece. Why did things have to go so disturbingly wrong? The first two-thirds of the film showcased some of the most heart-warming, breathtaking, and all-out inspirational boxing sequences this side of Raging Bull. Truly an Oscar tour-de-force from everyone involved. And then they had to go about and kill it, so to speak, with a conclusion that felt as if someone had side-checked the audience into a brick wall.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood, in the role of the hard-shelled  are not all his characters that way  boxing trainer Frankie Dunn, was mainly nominated for his performance due to his marquee name  Giamatti deserved it more  but the character itself is too wild for even the most Hollywood of clichés. It is both an appalling and disturbing sight to see critics and the public alike applaud a performance in which Eastwood comes in at the end of the film through the hospital wing like the ""Angel of Death"" to secretly kill a woman he raised as if she were his own daughter. Perhaps audience members were given the wrong perception on the real daughter that left him. Maybe she was the only one with the true sense about her. If you knew your father would end up doing what he did to Maggie, would you not leave him? Hilary Swank is obviously on tap to receive the Oscar for Best Actress this year at the Academy Awards for her performance as boxer in training Maggie Fitzgerald, but does she truly deserve the honor or rather is there a serious lack of true competition against her? Should she receive kudos for training excruciatingly hard for the role and floating gracefully around the boxing ring like a true woman champion? Sure, she deserves every bit of it. Should she be the one to receive two golden statuettes in such a short period of time while taking lead roles in such trash as The Core and The Gift? Not so sure about that one. Maggie also acts as a rather crude insult toward anyone from the South  in fact her entire family could actually be brought into this discussion while we are at it. In Million Dollar Baby, every individual who happens to be from the southern region of the country is portrayed as either a know-nothing country bumpkin, complete with inbred appearance, or a worthless piece of white trash that will never amount to anything in this world. This is the typical cliché of both Hollywood and the liberal establishment in general. They love it so much it kills them to see over and over again  if only.<br/><br/>Overall, Michael Moore occultists, more accurately those left who have yet to buck up the nerve to take their Kool-Aid following the reelection of Bush-Hitler, can at most find some consolation in the fact that at least some left-wing propagandist piece could walk away with a golden statuette on Oscar night. Already the fringe leftists have a pathetic excuse for their bumbling actions claiming, ""But at least Frankie was not cruel enough to do the deed while she was sleeping. Was it not the most touching moment when they said their good-byes before the end?"" Sure, perhaps someone could try explaining that one to the family of the victim of the next teenage girl that is humanely raped and murdered after her attacker had already threatened to kill her to begin with. Straight out, euthanasia is nothing more then a gussied up word used by liberal elitists to cover-up the act of cold-blooded murder, accepted only by the slack-jawed idiots churned out by donkey universities who can not put two-and-two together. ""But"", they stutter ""should we truly allow those who are confined to wheelchairs, unable to move a single limb, live out the rest of their purposeless lives in utter agony?"" Following that sense of logic, Christopher Reeve, in spite of whatever Brother John Edwards may believe, should have been put of his damn misery years before he actually died. This should not be a complex issue to get through anyone's head, no matter how thick they may be. Your life does not belong solely to you, it belongs to the creator. God created you specifically in his image with a purpose in this life, though we may not know it at the time, and he will take you from this world when he feels it is your determined time. You do not have the privilege of making that decision for him in any event. In spite of what some radical liberals may tell you, man is not higher up on the chain-of-command then God himself. Anything to the contrary is absolute sacrilege. In addition to that, Baby promotes the ideal that if you are able to reach the zenith of your life, the one true shot at the big time, that even if you fail doing so you will have achieved your purpose in this world and you may therefore die with a sense of dignity having nothing left to live for. Perhaps that one could be explained more clearly to Eastwood, whether he actually wins on the big night or not, by taking a quick pot-shot to his head on his way to the limo. After all, does it not make sense for him to practice what he preaches? Million Dollar Baby is positively insulting, bordering on the line of being flat-out slanderous, both to Catholicism and the dignity of humanity in general. There should be no respect left for Clint Eastwood, either in the realm of films or politics, after this travesty."

Another aspect I liked was that in the end the movie shows a particular situation that is very delicate and a source of dialogues on moral and ethical principles.

","Million Dollar Baby stars Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman, and Clint Eastwood and is also directed by Clint Eastwood. The film follows a veteran boxer trainer who reluctantly decides to train an inexperienced female boxer and along the way they begin to develop a surrogate father and daughter relationship. I would describe this movie as the Shawshank Redemption of sports movies and it even has Morgan Freeman as the narrator. Hilary Swank stars as Maggie Fitzgerald a waitress who knows nothing about boxing but decides to pursue it because she finds something that she is passionate about. Million Dollar Baby treats Maggie Fitzgerald as a human being that we can all learn from her and inspire to become like her. She's not doing this for money or fame, but instead does it for her love of boxing and also to help her greedy selfish family. Even though they clearly have no love for her, which increases our love and affection towards Maggie making her a great role model for everyone. The movie also shows us that Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood are the same person. They both are haunted from their past and are also looking for a shot of redemption with Clint Eastwood reluctantly helping Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman deciding to help another aspiring young boxer. In a way it almost seems like Clint Eastwood has a split personality with Morgan Freeman being his logical side. Even though this may be a sports movie and being a shot of redemption for the three main characters it's not your typical sports movie as the last thirty minutes are an emotional roller coaster ride. In conclusion Clint Eastwood directs a knockout film that felt like Clint Eastwood reached out and ripped my heart out from my chest that left me in shock. I'm still in shock that I ask myself do I watch it again, but I don't know if I can because the movie is fantastic, but brutal that I don't know if I can do it. So to wrap this up, Million Dollar Baby is a fantastic film with great performances, dialogue, to just about anything I can think of."

","I really like this Clint Eastwood film. Besides directing, producing, and performing in ""Million Dollar Baby,"" Eastwood also did the music which was simply well-integrated and perfectly composed to match and quietly enhance the plot progression, the mood, and the reaction of the characters. This is a gutsy film, gritty in emotions. It can be a tear-jerker yet not at all sentimental. It tells it like it is - the down to earth hard living of boxing (the theme being a 'crutch'), while the crux of the story concentrates on three main characters (each with haunting past): Eastwood as Frank the weathered boxing trainer, Hilary Swank as Maggie the enthusiastic spark in this whirl of boxing energy, and Morgan Freeman as ""Scrap"" - besides being the voice-over narrator, provided the bridging catalyst as the cool and caring mainstay to both Frank and Maggie. There are sprinkles of wit and humor here and there - that's how life is: making up of laughter and smiles occasionally in the midst of challenges and struggles, joys and disappointments, hesitation and reinforcement of faith, plucking up courage to take that risk, and mishaps nevertheless happen. There is ""whose life is it anyway"" dilemma - the confrontation of death, to be or not to be."

","When one hears that the theme of a movie revolves around a woman trying to become a boxer he may think ""Hmm, that would be good to watch; it is probably another film about a badass girl overturning gender stereotypes"". Well, nothing actually prepares you for what you are about to experience.
""Million Dollar Baby"" is about a woman named Maggie who wants to become a boxer and her relationship with her stone-faced trainer Freddie Dunn. Any other detail concerning the plot is unnecessary and will only prevent the viewer from delving into the world of these two extraordinary characters. And they are really something. Frankie is a living oxymoron, as his formidable, impenetrable form and laconic speech is juxtaposed with a great emotional depth. Maggie is a diamond in the rough who with dignity and passion literally fights her way to the world. I would, however be unjust not to mention Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris, the gentle and unsuccessful boxer and current janitor to the gym Freddie owns, who works as a balancing element to the tension caused to the viewer by the explosive nature of the first two.
The setting, furthermore, embellishes in it's own way the cinematic experience. The scruffy gym, the adrenaline-filled rings and the hospital are colored in dull, cold colors, so as to work as a neutral setting for the colourful emotions depicted in the film-canvass; and the emotions presented are raw and violent in an overwhelming and almost intoxicating way. So much, that we are compelled to watch until the very end of the movie with only a few precious intervals of humor and nonchalance to comfort us.
It is true that ""Million Dollar Baby"" is not an easy to film to watch. With it's intelligent depiction of pain, cruelty and injustice it is a reminder of the dark, and yet, realistic side of life that is often overlooked, as it's a hard pill to swallow. Nevertheless, if you are looking for a gem of modern filmmaking with mind-blowing performances, you are more than welcome to give it try. It will upset you, but it will be etched in your heart for a very long time."
"CubsandCulture","10","0","2","15 February 2019"," Minimalism yields emotions
","This is one of Eastwood's most distinctive looking films. Using very static camerawork as well as a very subdued color palette Eastwood's film is rendered as a dance of light and darkness. The characters always seems to be floating in and out of shadows. It is as if they are on the edge of the abyss. The critical car scene when Maggie discusses her father and dog is especially striking in this regard. It is almost in the light is drawing the story out of her while plunging Frankie into darkness, or maybe it is the other way around. In any case the film is pushed in the quasi-Noir that fits the story perfectly.<br/><br/>This feature greatly enhances the performances by providing a ironic counterpoint to them. Eastwood, Freeman and especially Swank raw naturalism is all the more painful because of the direction. It is also worth noting that Frankie is among the most complex characters Eastwood has played and his steely masculinity is put to good ends here. Swank found her signature character in Maggie and boy is her turn heartbreaking.<br/><br/>The script isn't quite as good as the actual film. Eastwood as director really does enhance the story. The script is a bit too simple in its characterizations. The Blue Bear and Maggie's mother especially suffer from one note portrayals. Nonetheless, it reworks the genre into a power exploration of bodily autonomy and has one of the best uses of voice over I have seen, especially in how it is justified. It is quite literally a solid first draft.<br/><br/>The 3rd act twist and the treatment of the underlying issues will greatly bother some people. I am bothered by the central metaphor that Maggie uses to express her final desire. I can't fault the script for realism on this point; it is how Maggie would think of it. The expression is truthful for *these* characters but social it is a deeply troubling idea. The film is strong enough to treat its ending as ambiguous.<br/><br/>This is quite a film. It is so simple on the first pass. But the more you look at it the more graceful it seems."

","Million Dollar Baby-<br/><br/>Kind of film that makes you stop, put what you're doing down, and really watch what's on screen. I've seen a few films by Clint Eastwood before, but I've never really enjoyed them. His recent middle eastern film wasn't all that (so much so that I can't remember the name) and, to be completely honest, I wasn't a fan of Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Too Long, I thought, Just find whatever you're looking for and move on. But that changed with this film.<br/><br/>The first that really struck me was the lighting. All filmmaking and photography is the capture of light on film (or albeit nowadays a digital sensor), so if you're really going to hook in your audience the first way you can do so is with your lighting. Eastwood really captures the audience's attention with this film by way of the lighting. Especially in the night-time scenes, a clear and deliberate action is made to use light as a means of storytelling.<br/><br/>A specific scene comes to mind when Big Willie arrives at Dunn's home, Eastwood's character. Here a mesmerizing spotlight is used as a storytelling device. The light shines as the moonlight through the window and into the house. It shines upon Dunn's face and illuminates his face completely, casting a shadow on the background and foreshadows the spectacle to come. I could go into further detail but you really need to see it to enjoy it.<br/><br/>5/5 Would watch again."
"jordangarvine","7","0","1","22 October 2018"," A Million Dollar Experience
","Million Dollar Baby tells a story that hits the viewer hard upon first viewing, and while that initial feeling hurts, it's one that I believe everybody should experience because this is a story that's so refreshing to see unfold before your eyes. The writing is superb and masterfully tells the story of these characters, especially Maggie, because you feel like you're legitimately living with her and watching her go along this journey filled with defeat and disappointments before she finally starts achieving everything she's ever wanted. The score also works perfectly in tandem with the writing, and the acting is fantastic from everyone involved with the film, such as actors with smaller roles like Mike Colter, to the star, Hilary Swank. Everybody does a perfect job with their respective roles and really help to build out this world of the underground boxing scene and where these characters come from.<br/><br/>However, this movie does have pacing issues, particularly towards the 3rd act of the film. The reason why pacing issues begin to develop towards the end is because the film is really attempting to draw out and elongate these interactions between two certain characters, which ultimately I feel like did more to hurt the emotional impact of the ending rather than help it.<br/><br/>With that being said, this film is absolutely worth watching for anybody who enjoys a story about triumph, perseverance, boxing, or simply just quality storytelling. Just be wary of the last 25 minutes that end up feeling like 50, but the finale of this movie will leave you in a state of disbelief. I strongly recommend this film."

","Sometimes it's hard, years after a particular Oscar season to look back and assess why a particular film did so well. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is, for me, one such film. Though there are some aspects to admire, much of it feels like a fairly overt attempt to tick off ""Oscar worthy"" boxes. <br/><br/>Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) runs a boxing gym with Eddie Dupree (Morgan Freeman). Reluctantly, Frankie agrees to train and then manage Maggie (Hilary Swank) a tenacious and prodigious boxer. Eventually the pair work their way up to a Las Vegas Title Fight which has fateful consequences for the pair. <br/><br/>Questionable politics aside, Clint Eastwood deserves his legendary status in Hollywood and though ""Million Dollar Baby"" doesn't come close to matching ""Unforgiven"", his talent at framing a shot, and use of lighting is evident. His performance in front of the character her is a little.. one note, and brooding, misanthrope does start to wear then - even when the actions of the conclusion start to weigh heavily on him. His verbal sparring with Morgan Freeman is nice though sometimes crosses the line from funny to bizarre. I wasn't massively impressed with Hilary Swank's performance either, though her commitment to the role was admirable, the rest of the execution felt a bit forced. (I know she won the Oscar, and who am I to criticise, but still, in my opinion). <br/><br/>The Casting Agent did a really good job though, with early performances from Mike Colter, Margo Martindale and the MCU double bill of Anthony Mackie and Michael Pena. The trouble is, apart from Colter's Willie who serves the plot by making Frankie wary of committing to training again, the rest of the gym are just there to fill time, with a unresolved B- Story that doesn't serve the film's narrative in any way. <br/><br/>Did I enjoy ""Million Dollar Baby""? No, how could I? How could anyone given the miserable conclusion? But did I appreciate it - somewhat. I had heard a little of the ending before seeing the film, so it wasn't as much of a bait and switch as it would have been at the time. It has, to be fair, stayed with me for the 24 hours after seeing it, but I'd also don't feel like I'll ever want to sit down and watch it again."

"AnishMisra","9","0","1","27 July 2018"," Million Dollar Baby Review
","Million Dollar baby is a film directed by Clint Eastwood. I wanted to watch the film but circumstances didn't allow me to do so. Finally, Last night I decided to watch it and was blown away.<br/><br/>Plot: Follows Frankie Dunn, an old boxing trainer who decides to train an aspiring female boxer, a thing Frankie has never done in life. <br/><br/>Story and direction: The film is just not about boxing (as I thought it would be). It is about the bonding and emotions formed between characters in the film. This is very well crafted by writer, Paul Haggis and director Eastwood. I was actually quite shocked of the themes the film dealt with. I was just fascinated by each and every scene of the film. The dialogue felt so real and struck a lightning bolt in my heart. I could relate to each and every scene in the film. The cinematography in the film is awesome. The boxing scenes were shot in a beautiful way. What added to the intensity of the boxing is the razor sharp editing. In addition to directing and producing the film, Eastwood also scores the film. Although the score is very minimal (which was apt considering the storyline the film was going for) and employs mostly pianos and guitars, it was very effective. My only flaw of the film was the sudden change of tone. It felt the first half was one film and second was another. If the flow would have been even, thw film would have been a notch higher.<br/><br/>Performances: Clint Eastwood is a multi-talented personality. He acts perfectly. The grumpiness and mellowed version of his character was balanced perfectly by him. Hilary Swank was believable in every scene of the film. The hard work gone through by her is visible clearly. Morgan Freeman, who does serve as narrator too, does a wonderful job in supporting our main characters as well as guiding the audience through this emotional and soulful journey.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: It would be the scene where Maggie faces her first match with Sally as her manager and Frankie and Scrap watch from the other side of the hall. Frankie repeatedly tells Maggie to keep her left up. But when Frankie realises that Sally is making the match go his way for his own benefit; Frankie steps up to help Maggie. This scene showed the bond formed between Frankie and Maggie and how much Frankie cared for Maggie even if Frankie wants to hide it.<br/><br/>Verdict: No wonder this film won big at the Academy Awards the subsequent year. Filled with earnest performances and a heart-filling emotional story and set-up, the film is definitely as must watch for those who feel that emotions surpass everything.<br/><br/>I am going with a 9/10."

"KidWithOpinions","8","0","3","11 July 2018"," Raging Bull will still be the best boxing movie
","I loved Million Dollar Baby, but I think that Ray was way better, but I do not know why because you would expect me to like Million Dollar Baby more than Ray because of the amount of violence in Million Dollar Baby. Well anyway, I would give Million Dollar Baby an A, for the cast's splendid acting, wonderful story, and for Eastwood's superb directing.
This is Clint Eastwood's second time winning Best Picture, now it should have been his third time winning it because he should have won it the year before for Mystic River, but he did not which really pisses me off. I am sad that he ( Clint) did not win Best Actor but that was expected knowing that Jamie Foxx was nominated for it too, so there was no way he ( Clint) could have won it. Eastwood does a fabulous job directing like he always does, but you should not walk into Million Dollar Baby thinking it will be anything like Unforgiven or Mystic River. One thing that I really like about Eastwood's more recent movies, is how they are not all the same. You see him in all the western movies from the 60's, then he wins Best Picture in 92 with Unforgiven which is a western movie, then he does some fewer none movies, then he makes Mystic River which is a full-on drama, very different from Unforgiven. He then wins the next year with Million Dollar Baby a movie nothing like Mystic River, now he is making mostly war movies, but he has kept his movies different in their own unique way and I like that he does that. 
The acting Million Dollar Baby is phenomenal, even if the character is only a minor part, it is amazing. The priest who is only in 2 scenes, he still did a great job. The dick Anthony Mackie plays, I mean he did a good job playing a dick, so good job, I guess? I think the best acting of a minor character would be Danger, the kid who has some mental disadvantage, Jay Baruchel does an amazing job pulling off the part of Danger. Morgan Freeman got his first Oscar which is surprising for an actor as good as himself it surprises me that he has not won any other Oscars. He does a great job in all of his roles, I personally think that he should have won Best Actor for his role as Nelson Mandela in Invictus. Hilary Swank gets her second Oscar so go her, she won her first in Boy's don't Cry, she does a really good job and she deserves the Oscar for Million Dollar Baby.
The movie is an adaptation of the story Ropes Burn by F.X. Toole. I have not read it but from what I have heard it was a good adaptation, Paul Haggis does a good job turning the story into a modern time period. Million Dollar Baby is a very good story about a woman who wants to be a boxer. She does become a boxer, but only after intense persuasion and proof that she is ready to fight. Oh yeah, also the fact that she is a woman in 2004 so people were less respecting of women, especially women who were trying to fill in the shoes of a boxer, a role that is normally done by men. In fact, she is so good at boxing that she knocks all of her opponents out only in the first few seconds which is good but Eastwood's character does not think that is giving her any practice. But because of that she barely receives pain from the other opponents, and that will catch up to her later in her boxing career.
Million Dollar Baby reminds me of Rocky, Rocky 2, Rocky 3, Rocky 4, but it does not remind me of Rocky 5 or Raging Bull. I think you can see why 4 of the Rocky movies remind me of Million Dollar Baby.
To conclude, I would give Million Dollar Baby an A, for the cast's splendid acting, wonderful story, and Eastwood's superb directing."

","Recently I got to like movies not for their particular entertainment value but for something that carries over after watching a movie. A message.<br/><br/>This movie could have had only two lines of dialog and it would be as powerful. When Frankie (Clint Eastwook) finaly told Maggie (Hilary Swank) what the meaning of ""Mo Cuishle"" was I felt like I was hit by his punch.<br/><br/>The narrative and espacially the acting were superb. Hilary Swank definitely deserved the Oscar and while I didn't see ""Ray"" yet (which Jamie Fox won the Oscar for main actor against Eastwood) it at the very least was a close call that Eastwood didn't won the Oscar. This is again a reason why this movie didn't need much dialog. You could read their faces like I rarely, if ever, saw in a movie.<br/><br/>I would give Million Dollar Baby an easy 10/10 if it was only for the ending. I feel like the narrative just indicated sooooo heavily that in the end Frakie would have lost his ""Mo Cuishle"" but be reunited with his daughter. If only the end was that his daughter walkes into the Diner....Man, feels like a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, a movie I could recommend in a blink of an eye."

With Clint Eastwood being one of the best directors of all time (IMO), some of the angles and scenes in this movie were a little less perfect then in others like his later films like American Sniper. For example, during fights, you can tell the director was trying to create tension by switching the angles rapidly, and also trying to put you in her shoes, almost like first person view.

","I've been pretty moved with this movie. You don't even have to like boxe, I don't. If you like clever, beautiful dramas, I recommend it. <br/><br/>First, the acting. It's really pleasant to see how the old trainer (Clint Eastwood) is so confused by Maggie (Hilary Swank) who won't listen to anything he says about getting another coach, going to another club. She just wants him as a coach and no one else. You can feel how Frankie is reluctant to train a girl, but then he starts to like her, and this is made in a very subtle acting. Both Eastwood and Swank are outstanding. <br/><br/>Frankie and Maggie have deep psychology, especially Frankie who is really conflicted, and are well-developed throughout the movie. Maggie is an average waitress who realizes she can actually do something great by motivation. It's really interesting to see average people evolving but not much but pure willingness. She stands up to Frankie, it looks like he doesn't really have a choice, she's so stubborn ! <br/><br/>Photography is beautiful as well, close shots emphasizing drama, not taking risks but mastering the manual in a nutshell. <br/><br/>Now what's wrong. Some really random scenes disturb the narration. They even talk about socks for a WHOLE scene, and it's not presented like it's supposed to be funny, or philosophical or anything, it's just socks, really. <br/><br/>About the weird, retarded boxing guy : this is SO badly written. It looks like he is not finished as a character, that he should be in another movie or something. In 2 hours, scenes about him spawn randomly. This serves no purpose. <br/><br/>Ending's great because it doesn't follow expectations about your average boxing movie. <br/><br/>TLDR; not flawless, but still one of the best dramas, I recommend. If you like uplifting boxing movies, be sure to check out ""Bleed for this"", too."

Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, Frankie's friend and employee—and the film's narrator—encourages and helps her.<br/><br/>Frankie's prize prospect, ""Big"" Willie Little, signs with successful manager Mickey Mack after becoming impatient with Dunn's rejecting offers for a championship bout. With prodding from Scrap and impressed with her persistence, Frankie reluctantly agrees to train Maggie. He warns her that he will teach her only the basics and then find her a manager. Other than Maggie and his employees, the only person Frankie has contact with is a local pastor, with whom he spars verbally at daily Mass.<br/><br/>Before her first fight, Frankie leaves Maggie with a random manager in his gym, much to her dismay; upon being told by Scrap that said manager deliberately put her up against his best girl (coaching the novice to lose) to give her an easy win, Frankie rejoins Maggie in the middle of the bout and coaches her instead to an unforeseen victory. A natural, she fights her way up in the women's amateur boxing division with Frankie's coaching, winning many of her lightweight bouts with first-round knockouts. Earning a reputation for her KOs, Frankie must resort to bribery to get other managers to put their trainee fighters up against her."

","Million dollar baby is directed by Clint Eastwood and stars, Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman and Hilary Swank who all deliver amazing performances. Million dollar baby takes away from the classic, macho, Rocky esque boxing film. By having a female lead there really is a very unique and different vibe to the classics yet it still has the struggles and pains of pushing through to the top. I very much liked this sort of mismatch.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank completely embodies the character of Maggie Fitzgerald, she never just plays as Maggie but instead would just 'be; her. From the very way that she never seemed to fit in and the awkward interactions she has with other characters very much makes her portrayal very relatable and special. <br/><br/>Obviously one of the other most important essence in a good boxing film is the 'mentor/coach character' and Clint Eastwood nails it. I was very impressed as he has managed to pull off such a caring figure without giving off any mixed signals, it would seem that he genuinely cares for her and plays off this father figure so perfectly against the naive nature of Maggie. These two had this unique interactions that is really quite different to, say Rocky. While in Rocky we get a figure who really constantly pushes you, it really isn't quite like this father figure that Eastwood plays in this film. Because of Maggie's naivety Eastwood could really shine in this sense.<br/><br/>This film also tackles the subject of death and whether to let go of the one's you love, releasing them from their pains and sufferings or to 'selfishly' preserve them because of many different reasons. I liked how this was tackled with a sense of seriousness and also in a very 'realistic' way. In fact overall this film was just so real and that's what I like most about it. There was no miraculous recovery or any of such and is in that sense very relatable and understandable. <br/><br/>All in all this is another great, modern entry from Eastwood and probably my first introduction to actress Hilary Swank, who has very much captivated me and earned my cudos in her portrayal of Maggie."

","For much of Million Dollar Baby Eastwood has convinced us this is a sports film, a boxing drama where the protagonist will encounter some challenges but eventually overcome them and emerge the victor both in and out of the ring. Any boxing fan would not be fooled. The bouts are obviously glamourised for the big screen, and the shaky grittiness that the camera affords them does not entirely legitismise the sequences. The is boxing from a video game level; every swing is a massive arc that must be ducked under, every dramatic headshot heightened in slow motion, every fight ending in a KO. Maggie begins to win so often and so easily that we are peering around the corner for her title fight where things will be a little different. <br/><br/>But then the story takes an abrupt turn, and where she was only moments from championship success, that all falls away horribly in an incident that leaves her paralysed and worse. The fighter who had once ruled the ring and world, now with only one leg, a blow of cruel irony. The abject conditions that she is left in (not to mention the attitude and intentions of her family, who are one- dimensional and serve only to exacerbate her demise) forces the proud Maggie to realise that she would rather be dead than so utterly miserable, never to step foot in the ring again.<br/><br/>This is a familiar tune, of course. Eastwood would later make an almost exact carbon copy in Gran Torino - the weathered, jaded old man taking on another beaten down youth and finding the experience life- changing and eye-opening, by excavating the layers of age, masculinity and conservative thoughts. But Eastwood has always managed to approach it a little differently, and go just beyond breaking the initial preconceptions of his grumpy character. Here, everything is mirrored within the past, which Freeman's voice-over additionally adds his own spin on the experiences. The events are marred by a guilt that doesn't surface until very late in the film, but then becomes such a heartbreaking influence.<br/><br/>It is easy to deride what may seem like a piece of propaganda on the issue of assisted suicide. But those who do so are missing the point. The film is not about her rights, but rather about Frankie's choice. The past two he had guarded over have left with scars both physical and emotional, and so he becomes hell bent on not letting a third die. He has taken her all the way to the top, and to let her go would be unthinkable. But the film (and Maggie) begs for him to throw away his redemption so that her suffering may end. To do so in his eyes would be not only a religious sin but also a moral one - failure which would haunt him until the end of his days. What a magnificently agonising conflict this is. It is always a tragedy when a father must bury their children."
"sam_smithreview","7","0","2","9 June 2016"," Clint is surely one of the greatest directors, actors to make movies
","Clint Eastwood, one of the all-time most famous actors -- and directors -- has more than enough money where he could choose to pull the strings on block-buster, mindless action pictures, Ala Jerry Bruckheimer, or comic books. Or, hell, in his twilight years he could just lay back and enjoy his millions. But no. He has chosen instead to make quieter, lower-budget, heart-felt, character driven films like ""The Unforgiven"" ""True Crime"" ""Mystic River"" and now Million Dollar Baby. And the world is a better place for it. Eastwood uses his multiple talents to make films that have something valuable to say. In the emotionally powerful, Million Dollar Baby, he tells an allegorical tale of boxing to subtly express themes of hope, redemption, sacrifice, persistence, and belief in one's self. The movie emphasizes that failure is a more honorable and personally fulfilling trait than never having tried, while also frowning upon laziness and leeching off others. But see the movie and judge for yourself. I personally consider great films as the ones where I leave the theater with a better understanding of human nature, or a desire to improve the world by even a little bit. Eastwood's latest more than succeeds on those counts."

Then I did some research, and found out he did the same thing before — directing and performing in the same movie — in Gran Torino. That's pretty cool!<br/><br/>This movie won the best picture of the year, 2005, as well as best directing in Oscar. So the Eastwood as a director may be doing a good job! And also, as an actor, Eastwood also get dominated as well. That's awesome!<br/><br/>The screenplay writer is Paul Haggis. He writes for both TV series and movies. He is famous for writing for this movie, Million Dollar Baby(2004), and two 007 movies: Casino Royale(2006), Quantum of Solace(2008). And he got dominated!<br/><br/>It won best leading actress performance, by Hillary Swank. But I don't know who she is..<br/><br/>It also won best supporting actor performance. Morgan Freeman took it. And it's the only one he got awards. The other four are only dominated.<br/><br/>Also, the editor got dominated! He's Joel Cox, edited in Prisoners(2013), Gran Torino(2008) and this one Million Dollar Baby(2004).<br/><br/>About the story:<br/><br/>Quote from IMDb, ""A determined woman works with a hardened boxing trainer to become a professional."" That's pretty simple.<br/><br/>So I guess the genre would be only Drama. It's about boxing, so it's also Sport. But before that, we already have Rocky(1976), and The Fighter(2010) etc. What makes this one outstanding? Though I haven't watched the other two..<br/><br/>Last word:<br/><br/>My doubt is, how to watch/analyze the editing of a movie? In the words, what makes them good or bad?<br/><br/>So let's begin.<br/><br/>After I watched it:<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood actually is good at acting, far better than I thought. So I did some more research on him. And he really rocks!<br/><br/>Directed American Sniper (2015), got dominated in best motion picture; Directed Letters from Iwo Jima (2006), got dominated in best motion picture and best directing; Directed and performed in this one, Million Dollar Baby (2005), got dominated in best motion picture, best directing and best performing; Directed in Mystic River (2003), got dominated in best motion picture; Directed and performed in Unforgiven (1993), got dominated in best motion picture and best performance.<br/><br/>God this guy is a rock star!<br/><br/>Second thing, I keep thinking what is film, and how they are supposed to be. Someone told me, that watching a movie is more like experience a different life (yes even it's in that two hours). If it's true, then the only standard to test all the things in a movie is whether it can bring us into that 'life' or say that feeling. Actors and actress' performance, costume, makeup, decoration, photographing and editing, the of course directing.<br/><br/>So, without all the fast-pacing action scenes, mysteries, unnatural elements, I always wondered why drama movies keep attracting audience, and how. Then it turns out that it might be the similar feeling in this genre of movies that brings up our feeling or memory. And that happens to the most important quality of a movie, according to what says above. But of course, it needs a good story and a good director.<br/><br/>This one is really worth recommending to those who love lifes."

"joncheskin","9","0","3","15 October 2015"," A Profound, Mature Boxing Movie
","There are two movies that Million Dollar Baby will immediately draw comparisons to--Raging Bull and Rocky. The reasons are obvious: boxing movies are a well-established genre, and any movie that enters the genre has to go up against the best. The good news is that Million Dollar Baby is not really like either movie, and attains a spot all its own in the genre. It does so by being a movie that locates its boxing plot within a very profound and mature view of the world, a view that sees the world's ugliness very clearly and moves its characters through it very realistically. It is a very truthful movie and a moving experience for the moviegoer.<br/><br/>The plot involves an aging boxing trainer, Frankie, played by Clint Eastwood, who trains champions but has a bad habit of protecting them when their opportunity comes. He is currently training a potential champion, but the prospect leaves his gym when he realizes that Frankie is gun-shy. Frankie is devastated by this, but finds a new prospect in an enthusiastic young woman, Maggie, with knockout power and a completely dysfunctional personal life. The victories begin to mount, and it looks like Frankie's (and Maggie's) chance at redemption is on its way. The rest I can't reveal without tripping the spoiler alert, but I will say that those expecting a girl Rocky are going to be thrown off-balance. <br/><br/>In its outlook, Million Dollar Baby is a complete contrast to Rocky. While Rocky was made by a new, young filmmaker (Stallone) who captures what is ultimately a story of optimism, Million Dollar Baby is a story made by an old filmmaker (Eastwood) with a viewpoint which, if not pessimistic, is very sophisticated in identifying the particular aspects of life that are truly painful and difficult. This may seem like a downer, but the fact is that what you see is real--it is very refreshing to watch a real life and characters who show substantial courage as they make their way through. Frankie faces estrangement from his daughter, Frankie's janitor and resident sage, Scrap (played by Morgan Freeman) faces having gone one fight too many (he was a boxer) and Maggie, with her disaster of a family, faces the challenge of discovering some form of identity. The triumph of these characters is that they live at all, and in some respects they do transcend their circumstances. Unlike Rocky, it is an imperfect transcendence, and in some respects it often goes horribly wrong. But nonetheless, the richness of the conflicts and their resolutions makes this movie what it is. This and they amazing performances by veterans Eastwood, Swank and Freeman, and you really get the feeling of having seen something very deep.<br/><br/>With Million Dollar Baby, you might not by singing ""Gonna Fly Now"" or the ""Eye of the Tiger"" but, as the film says, you had better ""protect yourself at all times,"" because life can be even tougher than a boxing match."

She comes from a rubbish family, and is reduced to stealing leftovers from the cafe where she works just to eat. All the money she does make goes towards her dream... Which is to be a professional fighter. Eastwood is a gruff, dismissive owner of a local gym... Who doesn't believe girls should fight and that at 31, she's too old anyway.

I watched this movie because I love boxing and am inspired to practice the actress. <br/><br/>The film is about the dreams of a girl practicing boxing and suffer much prejudice. Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) owns a boxing gym, his friend and former student Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman) a former boxer who lost an eye during a boxing match who now lives in a room contently in academy gymnasium. And then it kicks in, at your gym, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), who always had some life, but unlike many, knows what he wants and has the determination to attain it. She goes to the gym every day to practice on their own, even though she does not know how to do it right at all. Your willpower somehow impresses Scrap. Eventually, Frankie decides to train her, out of his incredible will power. Maggie trains intensely, because this is your dream, your only pursuit, she wants to get there, and in the end she did not get there ...<br/><br/>Another thing I particularly like about the movie is the true passion of boxing plays by Hilary Swank, the passion of the trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) by Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) who treats her like a daughter and in doing so, he in makes you think, there are many points Which leave you wonder: what price dreams? <br/><br/>I would recommend the movie to anyone who enjoys boxing, and not for those who have so much passion for boxing, because it is also a beautiful story, you may cry through this film, you may cheer. Whatever the case, you will love it."

","Million Dollar Baby is a movie I find works on different levels. On my first viewing, I found the majority of the film great right up until the plot's heartbreaking turn of events, it easily ranked as one of my new favourite films of all time. On second viewing, however, I found substantially even better as I was waiting in dread for the proceeding events; I mean almost literally quivering in fear knowing that dreadful scene in which Maggie falls to the ground and her neck lands on the side on a stool. Thanks to this movie I now fear the very sight of a stool. Million Dollar Baby is one of the most emotionally draining films I've ever witnessed. It's such a powerful experience I can't just immediately watch another film right away and I'll still be thinking about it for days afterward; a film so absorbing you don't want it to end. Yet the last forty minutes after Maggie Fitzgerald's life-threatening injury are so difficult to watch. Morgan's Freeman's monologue in which he tries to justify a reason to pull the plug on Maggie as she got her shot and can leave the world thinking ""I think I did alright"" really made me appreciate being alive.<br/><br/>I don't know if it was the filmmaker's intent but I certainly get the impression Million Dollar Baby has a pro-assisted suicide message which will rub many people the wrong way. I will point out though I'm not against movies containing a message which supports a point of view, regardless of my views on the issue at hand as this (on top of making more people aware of an issue) can create a vocal point of discussion as well as being thought-provoking.<br/><br/>Eastwood has only become better over time, delivering an amazing streak of directorial efforts during throughout the 2000's, with stories of unpretentious human emotion. His direction on Million Dollar Baby (as well as many of his other films) is astounding in how he makes the art of filmmaking look easy. It amazes me the effectiveness of his films despite their simplistic (at least on the surface level) and humble nature. Never has the presence of a fighter training in a darkly lit gym ever looked so immaculate. Likewise, Eastwood can combine serious drama and subtle humor perfectly. I love his smart-alecky sense of humor such as the scenes in which he annoys a priest for his own amusement or my personal favourite moment, Eastwood and Freeman's conversation about socks. Not to mention Morgan Freeman's narration is pure heaven to listen too, never as exposition been pleasurable. If only Morgan Freeman could narrate my life. I know its easy to throw around the ""M"" word, but in this instance, I will use it. Million Dollar Baby is nothing short of a masterpiece."

Her biggest obstacle is to convince Frankie, played by Clint Eastwood, to accept the position to train her to be a prize winning fighter. Frankie doesn't seem interested in this endeavor due to his past mistakes while training Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris played by Morgan Freeman. Eddie ""Scrap"" just happens to be Frankie's only real friend, who lives and works in the ""Hit Pit"", Frankie's rundown old gym in Los Angeles, California. Scrap noticed Maggie's potential and works on getting Frankie to forgive himself and give Maggie a chance.<br/><br/>I was drawn to watch this film because of the appearance that is was an action boxing film but it turned out that it was more dramatic verses action packed. I'm not into watching dramas, however, this film had a good balance of action scenes to keep my interest. The dramatic elements of the film were also interesting and added to the overall theme of getting Frankie to give himself another chance at training as well as letting Maggie have the opportunity to show the world what she is made of.<br/><br/>The storyline continues as Frankie trains Maggie and they develop a strong father-daughter bond. During this time Frankie begins to feel he has made the right choice in training Maggie because she turns out to perform very well. Frankie finds redemption from his inner demons and fears by watching Maggie doing what she loves, this reminds him of a relationship with his own daughter that he neglected to cultivate. Unfortunately as fate would have it, the story takes a dramatic turn for the worst and Frankie is again faced with making a moral decision at Maggie's request. This film's theme is similar to that of ""The Karate Kid"" where and older and wiser father figure takes a young naive apprentice under his wing. In this film, Frankie takes Maggie under his training ""wing"" to develop her natural skills into ones that will allow her to beat the odds and live her dream of being a prize fighter.<br/><br/>The use of the close up accessory lens in the gym office scene with Frankie and Scrap was a good example of how the cinematographer is able to focus in on the foreground on one side and background on the opposite side. This allowed the viewer to see Maggie's determination toward her training in the background while viewing the conversation between Frankie and Scrap in the foreground.<br/><br/>This film shows that in spite of your past failures life can give you opportunities to overcome inner struggles. It also proves that with hard work and determination anything is possible."

","It seems that a US movie qualifies as ""a serious drama"" if it has a difficult topic, follows unhappy characters and lacks a happy ending.

","This movie is magnificent. The actors seemed so comfortable in their roles you'd forget that they are, in fact, acting. Clint Eastwood fills his niche to the brim and does it like no one else.

The film doesn't run like Rocky, you don't know how it's going to end you watch it in the eyes of Eastwood.

","So I've obviously been living under a rock. I had heard of Million Dollar Baby and its acclaim but luckily no one had spoiled the story for me. I went into this film thinking it was a story about a girl with a hard childhood, looking to get out some of their anger and challenge some sexist views along the way.. the ending would surely be some kind of world title. I was surprised.<br/><br/>Firstly, it became obvious in the first third of the film that the story's focus was not on the 'girl' but rather Clint Eastwood's 'Frankie'. Interestingly it wasn't told by Frankie and instead by the unmissable voice of Morgan Freeman as 'Scrap'. I have to admit that made me contemplate whether Frankie would make it to the end of the story but later realized that the character really wasn't articulate enough especially in the realm of feelings. I think that is really central to his character. He has all of this history, complicated relationships and fears, none of which he really has any idea of how to deal with. The story starts with him in this routine or rut - doing whatever possible to avoid his fears and seeking some sort of holy miraculous forgiveness for his past.<br/><br/>Then comes along Hilary Swank's 'Maggie'. Just being female is enough to challenge Frankie's equilibrium. She is unrelenting - calling him boss, asking him to train her and working out at his gym. Slowly, with Scrap's help, Frankie can't help be interested in this girl who, unlike him, is willing to do whatever possible to make her dreams come true. I think he realizes that she is exactly the opposite of him. Maggie faces her fears. She is challenged and has her setbacks and she just learns from them. Frankie respects this about her and wants to help her. His slowly starts to let go of his fears and, at Maggie's insistence, enters her into the title fight.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Frankie's worst fears are realized when Maggie suffers terribly. She becomes a quadriplegic, bed ridden and, due to the lack of movement, develops bedsores resulting in leg amputation. Maggie then asks Frankie to end her life. This is Frankie's crossroads - does he look at Maggie and see someone who has tried, failed and now has to pay the ultimate sacrifice? Or does he see someone who has lived and been brave enough to face life's challenges, fight for their dreams and is ready to leave this earth content? I think in asking for him to take her life, Maggie helped Frankie to get his life back."

","Clearing the best picture award in the 77th academy Award is a film that makes you smile and cry at the same time. The movie's twist ending is what makes it a grand slam and Hilary Swank, finally after a long time pulled out a role that can be said to match the one she performed in the 1999 drama Boys Don't Cry. She also won an Academy Award for best actress twice one for Boys Don't Cry in 1999 and the other for her role here in Million Dollar Baby.<br/><br/>The movie is about a boxing trainer Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood), who helped an underdog amateur boxer Maggie Fitzgerald (Hillary Swank) achieve her dream. Frankie only decided to help Maggie when she persisted to keep training at his gym till Dunn finally deciding to help her to become a professional boxer.<br/><br/>All with the aim that when she is up on her feet he will give her up to another manager, during training Dunn always tells Maggie to defend herself at all times.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman's inclusion in this movie is one that makes you know that a film with this guy as your supporting actor is going to be a hit. Freeman managed to shine behind the huge shadow of Clint Eastwood and he delivered my favorite scene in the movie, where his character Eddie ""Scrap-Iron"" Dupris, an elderly former boxer and Frankie Dunn's (Clint Eastwood) partner, who is blind in one eye went into the ring to take on a younger boxer who had just bullied and knocked the wind out of an autistic young man. Dupris steps in the ring and squares out with the younger boxer who was hesitant ay first to go toe to toe with an old man, but later decided to square it out. After he (the younger boxer) has given the one eyed blind Dupris enough jabs in the face, Dupris landed only one punch and well, the younger boxer learnt a lesson he will never forget.<br/><br/>The movie does have its controversy, as the trailers makes you think this is a movie about a fighter who managed to conquer some fits to become great, when actually it is a tragedy waiting to happen. The movie's ending too is not without its nay-sayers, who feel the ending was just too sad and it mocked and gave the wrong idea for what to do about your disability.<br/><br/>Whether you get all depressed although the movie or you applaud the great movie for its insightful portrayal on female boxing or maybe you are like me who just love a good movie and give it is due credit, one thing is, you have to see Million dollar Baby yourself to come to a better conclusion.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"

","I LOVED IT and I HATED IT! You know those cliché sports movie where there is a struggle and success follows after hard work and determination which leaves you with a good feeling at the end? This movie decided to be the difference and show the main character, Maggie about to achieve success but lose it all! Very moving film though.<br/><br/>Favourite Character was Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) This woman, you can look at her and say she is an annoyance, a pest or just a daydreamer. However I look at her and see determination, dedication, willingness and a woman who knows what she wants! She spent days pestering the trainer to train her but he only trains men, she managed to get him on board and through her efforts and learning, she become a boxer on her way to success. This shows how hard work, dedication and having a dream can bring success<br/><br/>I would recommend it to anyone who has a love for movies and sports buff, even though I'm not a fan of boxing, I really enjoyed this movie. Women will love it as the movie revolves around a woman's desire to succeed regardless of the outside influences and of her background.<br/><br/>The storyline evolved fantastically! Showing the trainer, Frankie with his prized boxer, showing us the methods that he teaches and gives us a glimpse of what is taught in a boxing game - ""Everything in Boxing is backwards."" The scenes of training and hard work followed by Maggie winning games, slowly climbing the ranks was well put together. They added a whole new dimension to the movie when Maggie was knocked out and injured badly. It gave me chills to watch her in the hospital bed and see the struggle after getting so close to glory. Clint Eastwood was amazingly good with his acting, age cannot hold him down. Morgan Freeman was fantastic in his support role and of course, in his narration. It was a different film that I won't ever forget!"
"Steffi_P","9","0","1","4 May 2012"," ""Instead of running from the pain""
","While sports movies have never been a major genre, boxing movies have probably accounted for more than half of all sports movies ever made. It must just be something about the idea of boxing basically being an organised punch-up, or maybe the scope for philosophising about the spectacle of violence, that has rendered it the stuff of drama.<br/><br/>But conversely to the usual male pride arena of the typical boxing picture, Million Dollar Baby sees Clint Eastwood settling into a father-daughter dynamic as an ageing trainer with his protégé Hilary Swank. Eastwood's acting has improved as he's aged. He's become less active, so his whole persona has receded back into his face. All his past roles are written there in that tortured visage, a former tough guy trapped in this old man's body, facing difficulty and failure for the first time. Swank gives a deceptively quiet performance for someone playing a boxer. What she's doing is matching Eastwood's steely, laconic demeanour, albeit with a good deal of youthful optimism. The rapport between the two of them seems completely natural.<br/><br/>All boxing matches look more or less alike, but ways of shooting them have differed from one movie to the next. Martin Scorsese's direction in Raging Bull was the much-lauded camera-in-the-ring approach. Eastwood's camera on the other hand is often prowling around the edge -the manager's position – the ropes half obscuring the screen. Throughout the movie there seems to be an emphasis on low ceilings, dark corners, and long, barren hallways. It's a seedy, gritty world these characters inhabit, a world with few exits.<br/><br/>For all its modernity and plot twists Million Dollar Baby fits a well-worn mould. Most of the great boxing movies are about failure of sorts, and perhaps victory of other sorts. And there's no shame in its sticking to the pattern; it's what makes good boxing movies good. Million Dollar Baby is part of a cinematic tradition, and a worthy heir to its predecessors."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","0","5","3 November 2011"," Good but definitely not without its flaws.
","You really can't say anything bad about this movie how it looks or gets acted out by its actors but the story is not always handled well, which makes ""Million Dollar Baby"" a still good, though flawed movie.<br/><br/>Thing that is very obvious about this movie is that it got made to be dramatic and to emote. This can already be seen in the movie its visual style, which is very dark and depressing but also in the way the story gets handled. It gets build-up in such a way that you simply know that things are bound to go badly after a while. It's all a bit too obvious, which causes the movie to not really feel and flow very naturally. Everyone has a sad past haunting them and it's not like things are getting better for them during the cause of this movie.<br/><br/>It's build-up was really the biggest problem I had with this movie. Not only does it feel forced, it's also quite lacking at times. I'm not just talking about its drama but also its story just in general. Things just happen in this movie, without really a natural flow to it. This can mostly be seen back in its boxing sequences. There is no real good build-up to any of them and I therefore also couldn't really get into them neither, which is something a lot of modern sport movie suffer from by the way. Guess film-makers need to re-watch the Rocky movies a couple of times before they start making their movie.<br/><br/>But it's true that this is of course not just a boxing movie. For me the movie also truly began half way through, after the big twist had happened. Not that it's really a big twist now anymore, I mean, basically everybody already knows what it is but at the time this movie got released it still was a surprise for most people, who were expecting to see a drama/sports movie about boxing. You have to really give the movie credit for keeping the general crowd in the dark for so long and also avoid things getting leaked about its premise prematurely.<br/><br/>It's quite impossible to not talk about it in a review, since it features such an ultimately import part of the movie and its story. I'm therefore also going to talk about it, so people who still have no idea what the 'twist' of this movie is and want to remain spoiler free should stop reading now.<br/><br/>Thing were the movie its controversy came from was that it was handling a very delicate and not much talked about theme of euthanasia, after the main character got seriously injured in a boxing 'accident'. I totally respect the movie for opening the debate about it at the time and for having the guts to do so, after all, not a lot of film-makers would had dared to make such a movie. But again, I also don't think this got handled particularly well. Really, it came quite out of the blue that the Hilary Swank character suddenly wanted to stop living. Before that point she didn't really came across like she was unbearably suffering or totally depressed about her situation. She got paralyzed from the neck down but she was still cracking jokes and showing her fighting spirit. In that regard it feels like she suddenly gave up way too easily and also way too soon. It just didn't feel very naturally or realistic at all.<br/><br/>But that's not the only thing that didn't feel very realistic or naturally. Stuff like the father/daughter surrogate type of relationship between the Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood character, it all was put on a bit too thick for my taste and in my opinion. Same goes for the hillbilly type of family-members of the Hilary Swank character, who couldn't care less about her situation and were only thinking about themselves. It was so over-the-top and silly that it actually came across as unintentionally funny at times for me. <br/><br/>Now, I know like I'm making it sound like I totally hated this movie but that obviously was not the case. It could still respect it and appreciate it. It still was a well put together movie, despite not having the best build-up and handling of its drama. It's still very obvious while watching this movie what a great director Clint Eastwood actually is.<br/><br/>But next to directing, he also played a big role in the movie, which also is something I just can't complain about, even though he was basically growling a lot but that's what he has always been good at. But to me the biggest star of the movie still was Morgan Freeman, who gave the best, most humble and most realistic performance out of the entire movie. It also earned him his first and as of yet still only Oscar. Another Oscar went to Hilary Swank for her performance in this movie, which I can also agree on.<br/><br/>Another thing I also really liked was the little subtle musical score, also composed by Clint Eastwood. Is there anything that this guy can't do? Dying is apparently one of them, since he is still alive and active as ever before in the industry, even though he is well in his 80's by now.<br/><br/>Everything about this movie screams and shouts drama a bit too hard at you, which caused me to be really taken by all of it and did not made this movie the most realistic or genuinely emotional genre movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>7/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"mensmagazine","Null","0","1","19 July 2011"," I think it's Freeman's best performance.
","Narrating the story is Scrap, speaking like he's looking back to a time long ago when everything has passed. His voice seems flat, deadpan, but there is a working of subtle sorrow in it. Scrap is a sad human being, he sees himself as the result of missed opportunities in the past, and so he spends his time helping the others, offering them his wise advice, with a tone of deadpan humor and even cockiness. Scrap knows what should be done, and what will happen regardless, and he is sort of okay with everything, in a sort of passive way. But the man also knows what's right and he has a deep, inner strength which is displayed in one scene in particular where you just have to cheer. It is an intriguing character, and personally I think it's Freeman's best performance.<br/><br/>And Eastwood's best too. He is an elderly man; some might say too elderly to still be working. After all, most people are retired by his age. But if you had to guess when you're watching this film, you would never, ever say the man is seventy-four. You would say something closer to the sixties, because the man has such amazing energy and dedication, and above all, he has talent. It's been forty long years since ""A Fist Full of Dollars"" and film has come a long way, and so has this man. At seventy-four, passed all those years as an action hero, nearing what's could be the end of his career, Eastwood has made his best movie. I really, really hope he has time to make many more.<br/><br/>As for Swank, well, she must have found something big that she shared with her character, because this is not acting, it is existing. Swank is Maggie. That's all there is too it. This could be the movie she will be remembered for."

"FilmFanatic03","5","0","3","27 November 2010"," A contradictory film
","I expected to see an iconic film, an Oscar winning, perfect film. I was half wrong. I'll start with the positive aspects of this film. Hilary Swank was amazing, she defiantly deserved her Oscar as she played a strong, bold, fierce and determined female boxer fighting for her place in the boxing ring despite her gender. The film started of well and gradually grew more interesting as we saw the progression of Hilarys character coming from a hillbilly wanting to win her place in the boxing ring. That was the positive aspect of this film. However, there were aspects of the film which prevented this film from reaching perfection. Clint Eastwood disappointed me a little, his foul mouth was was offencive first of all. But what spooled it for me was the silly ending. Maggie (Hilary Swank) takes to a serious injury during her last fight breaking her spine or collar bone or something like that and she is now paralysed. After a few months she asks Frankie (Clint Eastwood) her trainer, to perform euthanasia so she can be at peace. He initially says no but later on he goes in the middle if the night and fulfils her wish and she dies. The end (with some depressing music) So basically Frankie murdered Maggie and in the film it glorifies euthanasia. Also the last part of the film contradicts what the whole film was about: determination and fighting for your place in the world. So what does she do: gives up. She doesn't practise what she preaches. This really frustrates me and makes me hate this film. So its hard for me to love it completely. I love it for its great acting and emotion, but hated it for its contradictory nature and glorifying a very controversial matter. Thats why i've given it 5 stars, half love it and half hate it."

","""Million Dollar Baby"" hit me like a punch to the solar plexus while I was watching it in the theater. But then afterwards, when I started to think critically about the movie, little nagging details started to really bug me and took away from the film's lingering impact.<br/><br/>Clint Eastwood does fine work as an actor, but my praise of his directing abilities has cooled somewhat over time. There's something overly formal about his films that always remind me I'm watching a movie. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is relentlessly gray and brown, both in actual physical production design and in tone. Though it seems like matter-of-fact filmmaking stripped of any pretense, Eastwood infuses his controversial story with very little ambiguity. He stacks the deck so much in favor of the film's final thesis -- that assisted suicide with dignity is better than living out the rest of one's life in a paralyzed state -- that there's little room for argument. And the goonish caricatures he presents as Hilary Swank's trailer trash family are an embarrassment to his movie.<br/><br/>This film clearly comes from a heartfelt place, but it's not without its flaws.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"
"n-mo","1","0","5","21 August 2010"," I know so many have said this before, but... WHY is there not a ZERO on IMDb??!!
","Between ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""The Sea Inside,"" the 2004 Oscars were really giving the euthanasia theme a run for its money. All the same, it would be wrong to label ""Million Dollar Baby"" as euthanasia propaganda. For one thing, it cannot hold a candle to ""The Sea Inside,"" a film which, as disgusting as it may have been morally, accomplished its mission much more elegantly on both a literal level (characters, plot, cinematography, direction/acting) and a figurative level (politics, left-wing: euthanasia). I don't know why, but Latin filmmakers just seem so much more adept at weaving beautiful productions out of banal leftist tripe than are their Anglo counterparts (see ""Motorcycle Diaries"" versus ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"" for a more explicitly Marxist example).<br/><br/>Having said that, I don't believe that ""Million Dollar Baby"" was even conceived as a ""pro-euthanasia"" film. I know Clint Eastwood has had run-ins with disability organizations and perhaps his sense of humour is sick enough that he thought this a funny way of spitting in their faces. It is not, of course, a comedy on any level, and no one will laugh at any time during this film unless it be out of pity for poor Mr. Eastwood. Probably the only solid point in the movie is its lambasting of generations-removed Irish-Americans' obsession with ""the home country,"" but even that is too heavy-handed to really be all that comic.<br/><br/>Let's start with Maggie. Hilary Swank, who was terrific as the bimbo Kimberly in ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" (the good one; i.e., the movie, not the show), can never be anything but annoying, and therefore ruins any character we are supposed to take seriously. However, the character of Maggie is also annoying AS WRITTEN—now, mind you, this would be fine if this were intentional and comic, but it is not. Eastwood actually seems to expect us to take Maggie seriously. Or does he? Perhaps Eastwood, like me, finds the idea that some sweet-little 32-year-old trailer-park child would become a world-class boxer absolutely ludicrous. Perhaps, then, the more overtly ridiculous scenes with Maggie's family weren't so out of place. Perhaps there is real comedy in the fact that all the critics and Oscar voters actually took this seriously—and perhaps this comedy is what Eastwood wanted all along.<br/><br/>The same could be said of Frankie. Tormented by the mountain of returned unopened letters he sends to his daughter, he babies poor little Maggie as though she were his own Karate Action Barbie doll and, when she's had enough of everything in life, struggles between granting this unrealistic poupée one truly uninspiring request and following the solid advice of an equally unrealistic priest. Once Frankie makes his decision, it is clear that he is unhappy with himself. So the movie actually makes no statement whatsoever about euthanasia or about the Catholic Church; the whole last 45 minutes are just a sort of farcical pornography of controversy. Idiotic critics and audiences just drool over this brand of emotional manipulation, thus explaining the obscene amount of cash raked in as well as the wholly undeserved Oscar.<br/><br/>In all this, then, Eastwood shows himself to be as nihilistic as he did in ""Mystic River,"" only that film actually had me convinced almost up until the ending and at least waited until then to collapse on itself and induce vomit from the viewers. ""Million Dollar Baby"" is unbelievable from the very start. If you haven't yet seen it, may I suggest that you preserve your virgin eyes; there is nothing in here of value to the canon of cinema."

","Crap. Plain and simple, and it doesn't matter how many morons think this is the finest film ever. I will give Eastwood a little credit - just a little - for knowing how to shoot a scene. He really ought to, given his career. But I do not at all understand how he's been elevated to the status of 'brilliant director', especially since his films are plagued by dreadful clichés and just plain idiot story points. You know what this is about. No need to dredge that up again. However, nothing screams more about how inept Eastwood is than the fact that it feels like half this movie is devoted to Swank's bedridden misery. It is so, so overdone that it undercuts the power that might have been there, settling instead to force tears from a sheer and relentless pounding in of the nightmare scenario. On the plus side, Swank is OK. Eastwood does what he always did, which is play nothing. And I believe this movie comes midpoint in Morgan Freeman's career as the weary, wise Black man. Would somebody give this guy a job in a comedy? Please?"

The screenplay also deserves a mention for its character-driven narrative & the exhaustive level of depth provided to its characters makes it all the more commendable. And further refining its quality is the accomplished work in the technical department.<br/><br/>Production design team chips in nicely with well-detailed sets. Cinematography is easily my favourite aspect for the way its camera employs the controlled zooms, close-ups, slow-mo & sharp focus makes the drama all the more immersive, which is then further enhanced by precision lighting. Editing patiently paces the story & the background score, composed by Eastwood himself is perfectly in tune with the story.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Million Dollar Baby packs in a highly impressive cast in Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank & Morgan Freeman with all three delivering strong performances in their given roles. Eastwood is as good in front of the camera as he's behind it. Swank steals the show with her career-best performance while Freeman is pretty grounded in his role yet his input & narration play a vital role in the experience this film provides.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Million Dollar Baby is one of the finest examples of sports drama that may give an impression of travelling the Rocky route for a while but a surprising twist in the middle completely ends up changing the whole equation & from there on, it's an entirely different experience. A profoundly affecting, deeply heartbreaking & thoroughly engaging cinema, Million Dollar Baby is — in pure & simple words — a knockout masterpiece. Highly recommended."

So, we watched it.<br/><br/>It starts great, has some Rocky-like character development and conflict between the trainer and the boxer, and finally it ends in tragedy. <br/><br/>To put it plainly, they took Gia's storyline and moved it from the world of fashion to boxing. It's sad they could not come up with something original, or at least presented a repackaged story well enough that the audience would not care that it was a rehash. <br/><br/>If you like disappointment, this movie is for you."
"pontram","7","0","6","12 April 2009"," Two unsatisfying movies put together
","When I watched the Rocky-Movies as a youngster, I didn't like them. So I was hopeful, as I like boxing a bit, that this movie could entertain me more, although it caught some Oscars. <br/><br/>And it did, for the first time being. Until the big and sad drama begins, there is everything a good boxing film needs, showing the hunger which is necessary for a winner, likable characters, some problems with the family and so on. More interesting for me was that the story turned out to be about the Trainer, not so much about boxing or boxers. Trainer Frankie, played by Eastwood, is shown as a man with heart, the typical American cliché figure that has a rough skin and a soft core, both developed in his former life. Many other clichés are used to lead us into the right mood. The figure of the boy called Danger is somewhere artificial and serves only as an addendum to the picture of the family at Frankie's gym. Frankie's own family is not present, so he has adopted some losers as his family, as he is kind of a looser himself. The winners always leave him, because he is too worrying, he hates risks. His best friend, played superbly by Mr. Freeman (when isn't he superb only by presence ?) with wonderful calmness, behaves like Frankie's wife. Danger is the witless nephew or son, who is tolerated because he is harmless and poor. <br/><br/>But when the good son leaves, there is an occasion for Frankie to acquire a surrogate for his lost daughter, a dream for every father, because she willingly bounds her to his judgment without any questions, and looks up to him from the first moment, like every daddy wants to be adored. And she is also ""a good girl"", she isn't problematic like any other daughter you have to rise.<br/><br/>In some cases this part of the movie is in a way superficial, I wondered if Frankie's top fighter wouldn't have left him, would he have agreed to train Maggie ? And wouldn't have even an about 18 years working waitress have some friends or background ? Never mind, boxing girls must be kinda weird, so the audience is forced to enter Frankie's Island, a small universe among the rumbling environment, where the rules of existence and social live are completely blanked out. The rest of the world is hidden, only recalled when needed for the script. Not to mention the unbelievable speed of Maggie's evolution from a nerd to a top boxer. <br/><br/>This could have been a wonderful fairy tale about a synthetic family and wouldn't have needed any sad hospital drama, after we had romance, humor, and action. I, as an European, would have seen much rather any other conflicts or problems after the inevitable twist. Maybe the twist isn't really inevitable, after leading the girl to the title there are many possibilities to offer an interesting proceeding - even if you hope for an Oscar. You can even let her lose the fight, and not only because of the unfairness of that ""Former bitch from Germany"". I wonder for which reason this in many ways discriminatory denomination was used.<br/><br/>However, after the twist of fate is set, the movie (intentionally ?) retrieves from every potential it had before, and leads directly to a stereotype tragedy. When I and others here talk about clichés, up to this point they were used in an (for me) acceptable number, but from now until the end, the movie itself is a stereotype. <br/><br/>For me it was extremely annoying that they relativize the suffering of a human, lying in the hospital bed completely paralyzed, with the fact that ""she had her chance"". This is a rape of the reality, we all live at the moment and even if one had his/her chance, it would not be important for the current suffering. This semi-philosophical crap is something I've seen too often in US movies, it 's simply a lie to forget about life's inequity. I think its a lack of imagination not even to try to give such victims a reason to live. <br/><br/>I gave 9 Points for the first three quarters, the actors and the mood, minus 4 Points for the rest, plus 1 point for the courage to kill a working movie long before the closing credits. <br/><br/>And: I loved the Swank girl."

","I picked up this movie a few years back, but something held me back from watching it. A bad feeling, a warning, a prickling of the scalp .. not sure, but I waited almost 4 years before I finally took the plastic off the DVD ... and now I wish it was still sitting on the shelf. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this movie had me for the first three quarters. There was a great chemistry built up between Eastwood and Swank, and Freeman gave the observers eye to the whole drama. How often do we see a movie about women's boxing? About a woman's dream of being world boxing champion? That in and of itself is a good subject for a movie, and throw in the interpersonal dramas of Eastwood's character interacting with the driven character of Hilary Swank and there were many good screen moments.<br/><br/>Then we have the title fight. Now don't get me wrong, I don't mind a sad ending to a movie if its the logical conclusion of where the movie has been leading. But this movie went totally off the rails into la-la land sentimentality! The last half hour of this movie I could barely watch, knowing where it was going and powerless to stop it. Like watching that train wreck from a distance ... helpless, hating what you are seeing, but unable to tear your eyes away. <br/><br/>I would give the first 3/4's of this movie a strong 8/10 ... but the last half hour or so (everything post-title fight) a dismal 4/10. <br/><br/>What great potential this movie had to be a classic. Instead, it will be the award winning movie that everyone forgets."
"thomas196x2000","5","0","1","12 March 2009"," An initially great movie that jumps the tracks horribly
","Million Dollar Baby is really two movies--a fantastic female boxer film and a lousy, downbeat, cheap-ending melodrama.<br/><br/>This movie establishes great characters...Eastwood and Freeman as veteran trainers, Swank as Maggie the boxer. Eastwood is pressured to manage Swank, a female fighter who is poor, aggressive, and feels this is her last chance at fighting--and in doing something, anything with her life. Eastwood is initially resistant in the typical, clichéd ""Hollywood Script"" sort of way, but that mechanism aside, their relationship turns into a wonderful, non-sexual love friendship.<br/><br/>The female boxing scenes are gritty and realistic. The Maggie character puts her all into it, as she literally has nothing else in her life. We see her beat everyone so badly that her manager has to pay other managers to get their women to fight her.<br/><br/>Up until this point, this is a fantastic movie.<br/><br/>Then, of course, the accident, and Maggie is paralyzed.<br/><br/>And, with the exception of a great scene of Maggie dealing with her useless family, the rest of the film is just awful. Of course, her medical treatments go nowhere, she is facing huge infections, will likely lose her leg, will never be able to move again. All this, mind you, in a few months of hospital stay, so of course, with all this against her, it's time to introduce the euthanasia angle. After all, as the script asserts, this woman can never get back to the life she was slowly starting to appreciate and love, so it makes sense to kill her, admittedly by her own insistence.<br/><br/>This is a tough boxer mentality? This after a few months in a hospital? No hope, no nothing? Are paralyzed people really worth nothing more in life, so let them all die? As well handled, and certainly well meaning, as the ending was, the movie left a bad taste in my mouth. It has nothing to do with ethics, religion or anything else. To me, this movie is like drinking a nice cold glass of ice water on a hot day and as you near the bottom you see a turd in your glass.<br/><br/>It is beyond me how people can rate this film a ten. How more effective, and life affirming might this be, if Maggie were to regain at least some control of her body, and take Eastwood's place after he retires in coaching young female fighters from her wheelchair, adopting some of his techniques? Realizing that while she will never fight again, she has value, she has something to give, and part of her will live on in other fighters? But no, this film is not life-affirming because that's not good Oscar material. It's not hip. Doesn't matter that the ending is implausible and out of character for everyone involved. The movie is about death as an out, and that is how it ends."
"dane-70","7","0","3","24 January 2009"," Eastwood is Eastwood
","This movie is effectively sentimental and manipulative, technically fine, but to me requires the same benefit-of-the-doubt that is given to a lot of movies in traditional genres: ""this isn't an 'ordinary' boxing movie; it's a movie ABOUT boxing movies."" In this way, all the usual clichés can be excused (as in ""Unforgiven""--not a gratuitously violent movie, but a rumination on the genre itself)--the Morgan Freeman character, the gruff Eastwood character, even the trailer-park family and their Simon Legree Lawyer ('if you don't gimme the deed to yo' ranch, I'm gonna tie ya to a railroad ...'). Almost painful to view was the boxing career of H.S.--the obligatory fighting all odds, a rise to the top, culminating in tragedy, and sure enough--I felt like I was watching a bad horror movie and had to close my eyes as the hideous monster was about to appear (all of this very well done, of course; if you make the initial decision to see an Eastwood movie, you're rarely disappointed). The last third maybe breaks the mold; not many main-line movies pose the question of euthanasia so starkly (although I suppose not many movies show the main boxing character dressed as an Indian in a wrestling ring either); but the first two-thirds of the thing are absolutely predictable, and justifiable not as 'in the genre, but a tribute to the genre' (I don't think Requiem for a Heavyweight or Raging Bull requires this, and Im just not in the mood to talk about 'Yo, Adrian!')."
"OllieSuave-007","6","0","2","18 June 2007"," Kind of Depressing Knock-Out Movie.
","This is an Oscar-winning film about Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), a waitress from a dysfunctional family, deciding to become a boxer. She seeks training from the experienced Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) to coach her and be her manager, with the support of his old partner Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman). What we see is a lower-class woman beating all odds to be a boxing champion, thus earning her a career that would put her in a better place in society. Swank gave a committed and solid performance, knocking out her opponents one after the other. What I like about Morgan Freeman is that he is steady, calm, yet powerful and dramatic is his acting. Clint Eastwood portrayed Dunn as pretty tired-looking and socially retired. He doesn't have much spirit and zest, due to his character being shut out of his daughter's life - very powerful. Eastwood also did a good job directing. Unfortunately, the movie does get pretty sad towards the latter half of the movie and the events only add on to the depressing life of Eastwood's character. My favorite scene in the movie is when Freeman knocks out an opponent of one of his trainees, proving that he still got the zest after all the years.<br/><br/>Overall, a pretty powerful, but depressing film.<br/><br/>Grade C"

","Call me insensitive. But the only things I took away from this film is that it is better to be dead than to have a handicap. The poor are fat, lazy, ungracious, and stupid. And somehow it was better to die, than to use the same tenacity that got her to the top of boxing, to do something with her mind? People who think they will be a drain on society should kill themselves? Just because she was handicapped doesn't mean she is useless! Sick conservative Hollywood garbage! All this film does is foster the belief that people who are not physically whole are better off dead, a hatred of the poor, and that an education shouldn't be an option for the handicapped or the poor. The closing of the American Mind has rarely been so prevalent as in the popularity of this film."

"filmcriticjournalist","8","0","1","4 December 2006"," A retrospective review
","Million Dollar Baby beat off strong competition from The Aviator to claim the Best Picture of the Year award at the Academy Awards and it's not hard to see why.<br/><br/>Back in the director's chair, Clint Eastwood pulls no punches in this adaptation of a short story by former pugilist F.X Toole. As well as calling the shots behind the camera, Clint himself plays a starring role in the film.<br/><br/>Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, a world-weary boxing trainer who is in the wake of a painful estrangement from his daughter. Frankie lives by two rules, number one, ""protect yourself"" and number two, ""I don't train female fighters."" Maggie Fitzgerald, played by Hilary Swank, wants to be a prize-winning boxer and she's willing to do whatever it takes to get there. Frankie soon finds her training uninvited in his gym, demanding that he teach her how to reach the top.<br/><br/>After several refusals to help, it soon becomes clear that Maggie isn't going to leave unless he agrees to take her on. Thus beginning the first of many battles of will that these two fiery characters will face together.<br/><br/>Nominated for seven Academy Awards, viewers who like their films traditionally slow paced will find great reward here. There are no gimmicks on show, just plain old storytelling. This marks a refreshing change from the staccato direction usually on show in the latest Hollywood blockbuster. However, it isn't without its flaws. At times it does become a little emotionally manipulative, occasionally demanding a visceral response from the audience instead of inducing emotion, as its message gets rammed home a little too much as the film reaches its climax.<br/><br/>Overall though, with great performances from the leading actors and reliably fine support from the eminently impressive and Oscar winning Morgan Freeman, Million Dollar Baby is an enjoyable watch.<br/><br/>http://www.filmcritic.zoomshare.com"

","When the Oscars rolled around, I had seen 'The Aviator' and was rooting for Martin Scorsese to finally win an Oscar. Instead, as your probably know, Eastwood won his second directing Oscar and so it took me a while to watch this film. <br/><br/>Not that I ever expected it to be bad. I enjoyed 'Mystic River' and everyone is talking about Clint's new creative surge in his old age. If he keeps on making movies like 'Mystic' and 'Million,' I just might forgive him for 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil' one day. :)<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, you've probably heard some general offhand comments about it. <br/><br/>1) It's very moving. 2) The ending is not what you expect. 3) Eastwood dusts off his acting muscles and turns it up.<br/><br/>Well it is moving. The last part takes a different turn and hits you in the stomach. Some may feel the ending is overly manipulative but I was able to get past it. The movie hinges on Maggie (Swank) and Frank's (Eastwood) interaction. As the movie draws to a close you really get sucked in as the story drives towards the grand finale.<br/><br/>The movie has boxing but is mainly about characters. Three people feeling the sands of time slipping through the hourglass for each of them and handling it in different ways. Some scenes - Frank in church, Dupris' (Freeman) 'people die every day' speech - really stick in your memory and heart. Everything about this film - the actors (Swank especially), the pacing, the script and the dialogue - float like a butterfly yet sting like a bee. This film is a wonderful examination of how glory and failure are often a heartbeat away from each other. Such is sport. Such is life.<br/><br/>And just one small comment. If you're holding back in seeing this film because you've heard some feminist grumblings, then you don't really have anything to fear. I can see why some are a bit annoyed but the movie is strong, respectful and emotionally mature."

","I never saw this movie in the theater or when it came out on video because I heard it wasn't very good, but tonight I was bored and decided since nothing else was on I would give it a shot. Just goes to show that you can't believe everything people say. It was a great movie, one of my favorites that I have seen in a long time. The only problem I had with the movie, was that the ending was a little disappointing. I thought that Maggie and Frankies characters totally defied themselves at the end. Maggie was such a fighter in the movie, it was really hard to just picture her giving up and wanting to die. I thought it was absolutely counter to the line where she said ""she came into this world fighting and would leave fighting"", because she didn't fight at all, she gave up. I thought it also sent a bad message to people with disabilities, not that every movie needs to make some kind of moral crusade, but if we are to believe that Maggie was so strong and such a fighter, then it sends a message that here is the best and toughest and she is giving up. What kind of message does that send to ordinary people with less strength? I don't know if this was some kind of crusade from Clint about the Merits of Euthanasia, but I think it hurt the story and tarnished Maggie just a little bit in the end. I understand that it was adapted from a book, but it would have been much better and more true to Maggies character to just have her die.<br/><br/>Never the less it was still a very moving movie. Hillary Swank is a brilliant actress, and the directing of Clint was very good on this film, very good atmosphere, just a disappointing ending."
"kenjha","7","0","2","28 July 2006"," Thousand Dollar Baby
","Eastwood and Freeman are good as the grumpy and wise, respectively, old men running a boxing gym but the film belongs to Swank, who is terrific as a determined female boxer. The boxing scenes are well staged. However, some of the characters are cartoonish and the plot is implausible. Maggie's family is portrayed as poor white trash without a single redeeming quality. It is hard to believe that Maggie, who is an angel, could have come from such a family. The plot device of Eastwood unable to connect with his daughter while building a relationship with Swank is too obvious. It explores some serious themes but treats them superficially. All in all, it is well-acted by the three stars but it certainly is not worthy of Best Picture or Best Director Oscar."

","A year later and I'm still mad at the Academy because of their decision to give Clint Eastwood another couple of Oscars. Martin Scorsese is a master and 'Sideways' was obviously last year's greatest film (of course, ignored by stupid Oscar voters who cannot recognize subtle work! isn't it time to reduce the actors' branch to the half?!). The Academy's fondness for this overly sentimental, predictably manipulative, cheap tricks film is absolutely not understandable. The film has some beautifully shot, stylish moments, it shows that Clint has become a good craftsman and develops a good use of space but let's face, the film doesn't lacks depth. It's just a sentimental story (with an extremely successful third act, a working second act and an absurd first act). The film's performances simply don't lie on a terrific ground. All the characters are one-sided. Take Maggie - she's the angel who fights to escape the world where she's the poor girl of an unloving mother. To make us feel for her, writer Paul Haggis wrote that awfully unfair scene where her family comes to visit her simply to get her money. Even if that was their goal, the scene wasn't logical at all because they showed it so brutally and after all, I think that Maggie would need them and wouldn't do what she did. And Hilary's performance, though a really very good one, couldn't even be compared to Imelda Staunton in ""Vera Drake"" - a film that dared to show us that its lead character isn't simply a good-hearted woman but a woman who didn't even knew in what trouble she's going. And at the end, there's an aspect of the film I understand. It's the suicide at the very end. I can't understand why all the people who loved the film (and loved it obviously because of its sentimental ending) don't get that. There's a conversation when Maggie tells why she wants to die. And I accept her decision. It's maybe the emotional high point of such an emotionally uneven film, with uneven writing and uneven directing. And at the end, I simply want to tell that I don't understand why people are comparing this to Bergman. Bergman's depth and astonishing visuals came out of the characters and in this film everything's on the surface and absolutely as an end in itself. Some good visual moments, solid editing, great acting but both directing and writing took the wrong direction. If you want to be touched, watch ""Sideways"" - absolutely last year's best film."

","Heard so much in regards to this Oscar-winning movie and it's amazing how generally I had read over here over the comments. It proved why this won the Best Picture Oscar last year.<br/><br/>Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) is a waitress who wants to be a boxer and met Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) and asked him to be her trainer. Narrated from the point-of-view of Eddie Scrap-Iron Dupris (Morgan Freeman), it tells how Maggie is so determined to be a boxer that even Frankie has no choice but to coach her.<br/><br/>The narration somehow added a little 'darkness' into the movie and that is almost like the general feeling of the movie. It may look a little draggy for some, but then looking at how Maggie is so determined to make her mark and not just being a waitress for her entire life, at times we really need to ask ourselves about our purpose of life. Sounds a little cliché, but always worth considering about.<br/><br/>It's a little dark at times, but the plot is enough to make us ask about so many things in life.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank is so into her role as the determined female boxer Maggie that it's hard at times to remember that she is just portraying Maggie. Clint Eastwood as the trainer Frankie, quite good. Morgan Freeman being the narrator, not bad."

","The themes in this movie have been addressed before in various guises, however, this is no reason not to address them again and I'm glad Clint did. Some of the themes I refer to are 'always follow your dream', 'be the best you can be and win against all costs', 'poor uneducated and unloved underdog comes good' and 'man seeks redemption'.<br/><br/>The acting is very good and the banter between Eastwood and Freeman is particularly enjoyable at points especially the bit about the socks. I would agree with some of the other reviewers who felt that parts of the film were manipulative and contrived as the family characters were so unsympathetic and hateful with no redeeming features that it does try to force your hand about how you are supposed to feel.<br/><br/>I also found the fight in which the main character, Maggie, is injured to be particularly annoying as the German fighter's cheating antics would surely have seen her disqualified as it was hardly illegal underground boxing. Also as there is no mention of the fight's aftermath and it would have been nice, but not essential, to know if the German fighter was indeed disqualified or banned from fighting. The fact that there is no closure on this issue made me feel a bit irritated as surely someone as passionate about her boxing as Maggie would have asked Frankie (Eastwood) when she was able.<br/><br/>Criticism aside I really did enjoy this movie and the way the bonecrunching (literally) scene was filmed it left me rubbing my neck and gave me an unforgettable 'inhalation through gritted teeth' moment.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely above average with good cinematography and sound quality. There are some memorable characters such as the 'evil' German boxer and Danger a hopeless gym member who mistakenly believes he is ready for his first fight.<br/><br/>It is really worth seeing if you like sentimental movies with an emotional premise mixed with good acting. Definitely worth an 8 out of 10."

"critical-escapist","9","0","1","23 April 2006"," We all know girls can fight, but Million Dollar Baby gives the one-two punch into that subject.
","One of the best films of recent years, Million Dollar Baby tells a simple story so heartbreaking and inspirational at the same time. Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) who trains boxers has been through tough times in his life and it has influenced him to become the man he is  rough, frustrated, and broken. One day he meets Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), a determined woman in her thirties who wants to make herself a boxer and wants Frankie to train her. At first, Frankie is reluctant to train a girl, but when his old friend Eddie (Morgan Freeman) encourages Frankie to take on Maggie and train her, the two form an inevitable bond and a wonderful friendship.<br/><br/>The best thing about Million Dollar Baby is that it is simply told. Paul Haggis (by recent Crash fame) does a good job with the screenplay without making it sound too phony at times. The dialogue seemed real even with its solid simplicity. The characters are very well developed and I think one of the best things you can do to a character in film is to make the audience feel sympathy for him/her. In this case, the three characters of this film are introduced then we learn a little about them. Maggie is a local waitress who takes home customer leftovers and chew on them as dinner like a dog. Her family doesn't appreciate anything she does Frankie, who attends church for the past few decades goes there and doesn't really know what draws him there. Eddie, an ex-boxer, is blind in one eye and cleans the gym daily and reads newspapers frequently. We feel some sympathy for these characters and that is what makes the film work.<br/><br/>The performances are brilliant. Hilary Swank is amazing here. We see her eyes look at Frankie like a child as she eagerly learns how to box. In the boxing ring, her eyes are shining with determination and great strength, knowing that she has got her chance. Clint Eastwood (who also directed the film) is also good here too, making his character like some tough-guy but hey  we know the guy's got a soft-side too. Morgan Freeman is great, filling in his classic ""supporting role"" style.<br/><br/>The flaw of Million Dollar Baby comes in the last 40 minutes or so. The last 40 minutes seem to go by too slowly. Even though the heartbreaking ending was bound to come, I thought the emotional development in those last scenes seemed slow and sometimes bland. It shows again what we already know and already saw. It was pretty much for me, ""Been there, done that."" The last few seconds were quite powerful, but what came before that was too slow for me to handle."

It definitely makes sense to give this movie four Academy Awards! Now, a lot of you people probably think that this movie is all about boxing; well it ain't! You see this movie has a lot to do with relationship between a young woman named Margaret ""Maggie"" Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) and an older man named Franklin ""Frankie"" Dunn (Clint Eastwood). At the very beginning of the movie (believe it or not) there's a boxing match taking place and you see Frankie standing near his boxer's corner and the boxer just happens to be a guy. About a day later he sees a young woman (Maggie is who he sees) punching a punching bag and Frankie is known to be an old grouch. So, he walks down to see her and growls, ""I don't train girls!"" after she repeatedly asked him to be her trainer for boxing. About a day or two later he finally said, ""Okay."" As everyone should know, Morgan Freeman was in this movie playing a former boxer named Scrap, now the caretaker of the gym where people practice punching punching bags and boxing. He wasn't a trainer but he knew a lot about boxing just like Frankie. He also helped Maggie when she needed help. After much training and many fights Maggie had saved enough money to buy her ""trailer trash"" family a new house. The thing is instead of thanking her, the family was mad because the mom didn't think she would receive her welfare payments if they were going to live in this new house. So Maggie gave up on her family and continued to box and got better and better until the World Title fight, when a very unfortunate thing happened (I won't tell you). You and you only will find out the ending to this remarkable, extremely well acted, and fantastic movie. Movie directed by Clint Eastwood."

","This is a moving yet frustrating film about the short career of a female boxer trained by an old embittered manager/trainer who still feels responsible for his former-protégé-now-business-partner's loss of an eye many years before. The three main characters are played, respectively, by Hillary Swank, Clint Eastwood and Morgan Freeman -- all powerhouse actors. The problem is that none of them has much to work with: the plot feels more like an outline than a finished story. Perhaps Eastwood, who also directed, was trying to convey the idea that in the ethically dubious world of professional boxing people just don't know each other very well, or want to. However, that shallowness of character makes it awfully hard for us, as viewers, to identify with the potentially very dramatic events that occur. Hillary Swank again puts in a stellar performance as the androgynous woman who remains persistently feminine despite outward appearances, just as she did in ""Boys Don't Cry."" And one wonders throughout, as so often (""Levity"" in particular comes to mind) why Morgan Freeman doesn't get top billing when he is the top character and top performer in every respect."

","I am still in mourning about the fact that this movie won best picture. There was very little special about the movie as a whole, the first half was like every other boxing movie, the grizzled old trainer, the downtrodden young hopefuls, the grungy low-rent gym, YAWN. At the end, the medical errors were so ridiculous, I just couldn't believe that this movie was made. It is IMPOSSIBLE to talk while on a ventilator, first of all. I know that it would have spoiled to flow of the screenplay, but you can't just suspend rules of physics to cater to your script. Second, when someone is on life-support, there are monitors at the nursing station, and someone would have come running immediately when the machine was turned off, barring gross negligence on the part of the medical staff. It would be impossible for someone to turn off life support and let someone die and just walk out unnoticed like he did. Even with out these things, I found nothing to recommend this movie, and certainly did not agree with its best picture nomination or award."

","Million Dollar Baby is a pretty straight forward, simple story that people interested in films have likely seen a number of times before. It is, if you will, an old school Hollywood movie. No fancy computer generated effects, no loud music, no fast cuts. More concentrated on the story and acting, it's goals are certainly admirable. <br/><br/>The first half, let's call it heaven, is near overblown in how conveniently everything just falls to the right place, yes, even the very early goings where Clint does his typical 'no, i'm not interested' routine. The second half, call it hell, not entirely surprisingly, is where you really get the almighty Academy's attention. A lot of pain, suffering, crying and ill-turned relations are involved. Even Clint does a crying scene, which sort of surprised me despite the subject matter, after all, wasn't he the guy who during the filming of The Bridges of Madison County said 'they don't wanna see me cry' to his co-star Meryl Streep. All and all, it didn't raise as much emotions in me as it probably was meant to. I wasn't gripping my pillow weeping, or eating the fifth bucket of ice cream by the end of it. Later on during the day i was mumbling a theory while preparing salad, saying to myself, 'what if the story was purposely told in an overblown fashion, because it is after all coming from an individual's memory of the events...usually memory tends to make things just that little bit grander.'<br/><br/>It's the acting that raises the level of this film. Without the great work of Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, and especially Morgan Freeman who has only been better than here once during his career, in a movie called Shawshank Redemption, this film would have been just as average as the average guy on the morning bus. Mr. Freeman certainly surpasses the pointless character from his previous collaboration with Eastwood, Unforgiven. Hilary Swank is a very able actor as well, and i wish her a great career. Thanks to the good acting, Million Dollar Baby manages to lift itself barely out from the Swamp of the Abandoned Blue Jeans, where everything looks alike. Maggie's family was just extreme stereotypia, and the most annoying part in the entire run.<br/><br/>From the technical aspects Million Dollar Baby does not bring anything new or exciting to the table. Clint uses shadows a lot to create atmosphere, but at times (in the gym where first Dupris then Dunn step out of the shadows exactly the same corny way to teach all sorts of wise lines to Maggie) it gets borderline silly.<br/><br/>rating: 5/10 - OK"

","Veteran Hollywood actor & director Clint Eastwood triumphs with this wonderfully made dramatic masterpiece. Superbly cast with Hilary Swank(Boys Don't Cry) & Morgan Freeman(The Shawshank Redemption) who live & breathe Oscar-winning performances every role they step into on a movie set. A winning role for Eastwood as well, befitting his age & acting prowess. A great uplifting story coupled with learned script writing, superior direction, & an in shape Swank who trained for months to get in fine shape for the role of a boxer.<br/><br/>""Million Dollar Baby"" is the story of the professional & personal relationships between female boxer wannabe & waitress Maggie Fitzgerald, trainer Frankie Dunn, & retired boxer & friend Eddie ""Scrap Iron"" Dupris. It is how they come together & relate to one another that makes film work so well. Aging & standoffish cut man & boxing trainer Dunn(Eastwood) owns & runs a local gym with the help of sentimental & wise ex-boxer & friend Dupris(Freeman). Their lives change greatly when hardworking & idealistic female boxer Fitzgerald(Swank) comes into the male dominated gym to seek a trainer. Working as a waitress by day & female boxing hopeful at night, Fitzgerald works at her craft while others poke fun. Fitzgerald realizes that if with hard work & the right manager, she could fight as a pro even at thirty-something. Dunn tolerates her existence but refuses to train her. With persistence & Dupris' influence, Dunn decides to take Fitzgerald on as a pupil. Slowly but steadily, Dunn trains Fitzgerald in the sweet science of boxing. Dunn warns Fitzgerald of possibility of getting hurt or not making it professionally. Ever determined, Fitzgerald pushes on with Dunn with training. After a year of training, Fitzgerald begs Dunn to manage her in the pros. Dunn declines & gets Fitzgerald a manager instead. At Fitzgerald's first fight, both Dunn & Dupris attend. After Fitzgerald takes a beating in the first few rounds & her manager loses patience, Dunn steps in to take over as manager. Dunn gives her a few tips & Fitzgerald goes on to score a knockout. This is just the beginning of Fitzgerald's knockout streak. Bout after bout, Fitzgerald knocks out all of her opponents, to Dunn's ire. With all her victories, Dunn has trouble finding fighters for Fitzgerald to pummel. So, Dunn & Fitzgerald travel abroad to find bouts. With success in the ring came financial gains for Fitzgerald. With her new found wealth, Fitzgerald buys a new home for an ungrateful & trashy mother & siblings in her home town. Although disappointed with her family's reaction, Fitzgerald presses on with her boxing career with Dunn. Dunn negotiates with manager of Billie ""Blue Bear""(real life women's European champ Lucia Rijker), a vicious & dirty female World Champion for a championship bout. Both sides agree & head out to Las Vegas for the big fight. During the fight, Fitzgerald handles herself fairly well despite Billie ""Blue Bear's"" dirty fight tactics. Dunn coaches Fitzgerald well & tends adequately to her cut left eye. Fitzgerald begins to win the fight when she makes a grave mistake...she turns her back on her opponent at the end of the round. The mean spirited Billie ""Blue Bear"" punches Fitzgerald on the side of her head causing Fitzgerald to fall into the stool in her corner. Rushed to the hospital, Fitzgerald suffers paralysis & has a tracheotomy to help her breathe. Dunn is tragically distraught over Fitzgerald's condition, blaming Dupris and/or himself. Dunn does everything humanly possible to help his fallen fighter including moving her back to Florida & tending to her daily. Fitzgerald suffers another blow in her family's scheme to extort money from her during a long awaited visit. Furious, Fitzgerald tells off her family & lawyer & never wants to see them again. Bad luck continues for Fitzgerald when a blood clot forces her leg to be amputated. Weak & wanting relief from her life of misery, Fitzgerald asks Dunn to end her suffering. Dunn answers no but is torn between what he believes is morally wrong & fulfilling Fitzgerald's wish to be free from her pain. With pain & love in his broken heart, Dunn grants Fitzgerald's wish & ends her life. Fitzgerald passed on in her early thirties, leaving her mark on Dunn & Dupris forever.<br/><br/>""Million Dollar Baby"" deserves all the Oscar nominations & accolades the film received & then some. Superb combo of Eastwood & Swank, Eastwood & Freeman, Freeman & Swank, & the three actors together. A very inspiring & heart wrenching story that will snatch a tear from every eye. I highly recommend this film to anyone who just likes to watch a great movie. A 10 out of ten with two thumbs way up!!!"

","The movie is good on a idiot level and like so many films has nuclear overtones. I think the only reason so many play with nuclear is so they don't have pay others out of the industry. Taxman Revolver Your first round is not my first round and Mr Danger is a relative who works for Insider. He is the son of an relative who is involved with an off the wall Mother Mary Beatles song. Because of that he has a James Bond side kick in a circus show playing with nuclear pretending to be his for real father. Bond has played with me so many times often I think involving no one else in different shows and I've played with so many other shows that sometimes I forget. And if you want Clint you can stop cutting the heads of parking meters pretending to be Concord or Wilson California street signs, the Idaho St Maries Sunny Road and Garden Way street sign here are wood. I got my phone area code 208 teeth worked on recently, they saved a tooth and you know they are slightly bucked. They are going to get cleaned in March with no bleach. You know what I'd do first thing if you gave me $510,000 for five or ten years like I asked? I'd cancel my BP pill health insurance and buy some other insurance. I can't say it does though I think what I pay to them is an possible inspiration for overpriced oil barrel production prices. I remember that outdated oil boiler 31. It's not my fault or others fault that I have retired insurance when so many others don't. The thing is though if I ever really got really sick even with insurance I don't think I could afford the bill. It's kind of hard to mother Honeysuckle street with Hilary in her movie ending condition. It's sort of like don't involve anyone other than the people involved then make it difficult for those involved. I simply wish I had a easy running fool birthday million for me in my own bank account to make it possibly easier for everyone else and me. I do have a Bose Boss and I do own that Dolly song. I'm asking for money for the last time here. (Actually here was at the Clint site) Clint here is my best compliment for somebody somewhere else. You've often acted well to be my friend and I'm not questioning your motives about our friendship and it took me the longest time to figure out why Mr Heston blew up the planet. If I had a Moses wife who back stabbed me in the back pretending to be a monster Russian nuclear bomb I'd might get upset too. I have a home window that sort of looks similar to his space capsule. So your advice not to argue is good and easier for me and everyone. It's time for my occasional single nightcap shot of whiskey. The problem with movies is they are always so nutty if they don't get what they wanted to rhyme they go mental. Who needs a fair weather friend like that? Entertaining yes, friendly making friends for real no and it doesn't ever pay. Don't give me that nuclear don't pick up the pay check jive.

","This film challenged one of the biggest Hollywood clichés: That if you're talented, determined and hard working enough blah blah blah you'll become a millionaire within a record amount of time and then live happily ever after.<br/><br/>So sometimes s**t happens and people just have bad luck despite all of the above. Point taken.<br/><br/>But in busting one Hollywood cliché the film simply propagated another one: That you can't be happy without being rich and famous.<br/><br/>Life is not as black and white as that. Sure, poverty sucks, but it's not like the ONLY two options in life are either being dirty rich or filthy poor (or whichever way around).<br/><br/>Maggie's desperate all-or-nothing philosophy really irritated me. This film seems to hint that violence is the only way out of poverty. But violence is NOT a way out of poverty, EDUCATION is. Had she been as dogged about learning a trade as she had been about becoming a champion, she would have earned a qualification several times over by the end of the film and been able to lead quite a comfortable middle class life. Boxing may have been her vocation but it's not a secret that to earn a decent living from this sport you run a high risk of becoming a brain damaged wreck."

","I think MILLION DOLLAR BABY is a good movie --- not great --- but good. There were many moments of the film that were outlandish - especially some of the boxing sequences. Some of them were as unrealistic as you'd find in a ROCKY sequel.<br/><br/>However, Swank and Freeman gave excellent performance and some of the dialogue was quite good. Eastwood, on the other hand, come across too bland at times. The last church scene, IMO, was were he was at his best. As for his directing, Eastwood did a good solid job.<br/><br/>The film does suffer from inconsistent pacing and some emotionally manipulative sequences.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd give the film a 7/10."

","I think Clint is a fine actor and director and certainly Hilary Swank is a good actress. Of course I love everything Morgan Freeman has ever been in, he's the always great. But I can't understand why people thought this movie was so great. Sure we feel sorry for Frankie and Maggie but the story is a story we've all seen before. Poor girl finds grumpy old man and they both learn to love each other. So what. I also thought that the ending was totally made up. I work in the medical profession and I can tell you it would never happen like it was portrayed. A competent adult, especially one who can speak as clearly as she could with a tracheostomy tube in, would be allowed to make her own medical decisions. So though the performances were good the movie itself was just like the rest okay."
"ilikepuppies","6","0","2","23 January 2006"," Casting choices.
","I am always captivated by how many different approaches to acting there are, sometimes within the same film even. Here we have three completely separate approaches, and the casting agent deserves a nice portion of the credit for why this film works.<br/><br/>--Hillary. Everything she has done to date is founded on collaboration with other actors. She works, fighting to create a give-and-take style chemistry between herself and her costars. Constant eye contact. Seemingly no peripheral vision.<br/><br/>--Clint. His acting is of and for the camera. One can easily see his awareness of the camera at all times. Scarce eye contact. He is after all the cinema's consummate tough guy, and his catalog of genre films has demanded this of him. Be aloof and emotionally out of grasp. Mug for the camera.<br/><br/>--Morgan. This guy works in one direction: inwards. Watch him forcing his character to think--to react to others' lines as if he has never heard them and needs time to digest the words before answering. Always thinking, introspective. That's what makes him Hollywood's reigning narrator.<br/><br/>So we have three wildly varying approaches all cast to fit their characters snugly. Someone had some real casting insight I think.<br/><br/>The movie is a bit of a mess as a whole (especially the overly-cliché-ed script), but in the end it is the rich stew of acting that carries the day and pulls tears from us despite other flaws."

I adore Hilary Swank but it was so try-hard it was embarrassing. I cry at anything - but this was just ridiculous. The writer and director thought of 20 things to pull at an average persons heartstrings and put all of them in the film...the uncaring mother, the losing of her legs..and Clint is obviously so worried about ageing that they never bothered to film him without a shadow covering 3/4 of his face. I hated this film with a passion and was so disappointed with the public for loving it - it starts well but disintegrates quickly into a bad TV movie.<br/><br/>""They took my legs Boss.....""

","******SPOILERS************<br/><br/>I just saw Million Dollar Baby for the first time. What I don't understand is why they had Frankie had to turn off the respirator. He said, ""I will turn off your air machine and you will go to sleep. I'll give you an injection and you will STAY asleep."" If this had been a real life situation, turning off the respirator would have sounded an alarm in the nurse's station and brought the nurses running in to re-connect it before Frankie could have administered the adrenalin to Maggie- and he would have been hauled off by the police. It was not necessary to turn off the respirator. Turning it off would only make her start gasping for breath in time, alert the nurses and make her death more painful. The adrenalin would have killed her by itself in a few minutes and he would have had time to escape. Surely they have medical advisers. How could they make such a mistake? <br/><br/>I don't know much about boxing, but in real life, during a world championship bout, considering the obvious and deliberately illegal tactics used by Blue Bear during the first round, it have resulted in her disqualification. Also, Blue Bear's punch after the bell was so late and so violent it would have resulted in an immediate disqualification. Would the referee turn his back on the two fighters unless they were both in their respective corners? However, even if he didn't see the late (and ultimately fatal) punch, the officials and judges would have notified the referee. How could they declare Maggie the loser and BB the winner? <br/><br/>What was with the priest? I'm not Catholic, but I don't think priests would drop the ""F bomb""- and be so rude and negative with Frankie. This was the only one in the movie and completely unrealistic and unnecessary.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie. I think the performances by Swank, Eastwood and Freeman were great, and I don't begrudge them (Swank and Freeman) their Oscars -especially in light of the other performances that year, but due to the major flaws related above, it should NOT have won best picture."

","i don't see what everyone is all up in arms over this movie about. true the actors do fine jobs in their given rolls but the movie seems like a cross pollination of rocky and Of Mice And Men. The hints that are dropped throughout the movie of what is coming at the end seem pretty clear and so the end doesn't come as much of a surprise. Clint Eastwood is great as Burgess Meredith and Morgan Freeman plays the same roll he plays in every movie, that of the aged, wise, and world weary man with hints of narration. If Freeman wasn't so good at playing the roll it would be unforgivable but try seeing if his roll from Glory, or Se7en, or Shawshank, or Unforgiven, or Kiss The Girls, is any different.....<br/><br/>What really leaves a foul taste in the mouth and holds this movie back is the utter lack of reconciliation. The only bit of it comes between Freeman and a cocky young boxer. I'm shallow i like vengeance in film and too many characters do to many evil or annoying things without some sort of closure. The dirty boxer, the ex-con punk kid, the lazy mother, et cetera.<br/><br/>I thought it was a good movie but certainly nothing to salivate over, and multiple viewings i doubt would add much. 7 out of 10"
"Tecun_Uman","6","0","1","10 January 2006"," Pretty good, but far from great
","I'm not sure if this film's critical success stems more from a decline in film-making in general or Hollywood's love of Clint Eastwood. Heck, I love Eastwood. I also love Hillary Swank and Morgan Freeman, they are huge talents. However, this was a formulaic movie, very predictable in parts. You can almost see the numbers as Eastwood paints them in. This does not diminish from the fact that you have solid actors working hard. However, some of the supporting cast strains credibility, no more so than the family of Maggie's, who plays bad as one-dimensional as you can. And some of the boxing material is also a stretch. A fairly unknown female boxer a year into her career is fighting for a million dollar purse? Don't think so. Perhaps my review would be more positive if this film was not so highly rated, but it is, and I am not sure why."

If you want to be incredibly sad and hurt, this is the movie for you though. It is a tear jerker for sure but where's the creativity? Sure it's interesting but movies are supposed to innovative and creative as well as entertaining. This movie just goes for gritty drama and relies way to much on it's actors to make it. A movie must have more than a line up of great actors to make it great. While the premise touches the heart and then rips depression into your heart, it doesn't have the qualities to be the best of all time. It's just missing that certain creativity to stand out. Unlike Pulp Fiction or Taxi Drive or the Godfather or A Clockwork Orange, this movie will be forgotten with the rest of the Oscar winning dramas.

","Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is a ""cut man"" who manages a gym with the help of his friend, Scrap (Morgan Freeman), a former fighter who now is blind in one eye and lives in the gym in addition to working as the janitor. Scrap narrates the story of Frankie and Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) and as the movie begins, Maggie approaches Frankie after a fight, hoping that he'll agree to become her manager. Frankie refuses because she is a girl and too old to begin fighting. None of this matters to Maggie, though, who is determined to rise above her trailer-trash background and become a champion. Without any prior training, she joins Frankie's gym and practices their every day.<br/><br/>As the story moves on, Scrap takes sympathy on Maggie and teaches her a few tricks about how to hit a punching bag. She displays some talent and Frankie reluctantly decides to become her manager. The two form a bond as Maggie begins winning fights and it becomes clear that their relationship moves well beyond the ring and into the realm of a surrogate family. Frankie starts to occupy the place of her dead father and Maggie fills in for Frankie's estranged daughter.<br/><br/>This is, more or less, how the first half of the film plays out. There are some major flaws with the film so far, most notably Eastwood's performance. Trying to present Frankie as a tough guy, he hoarsens his voice and furrows his brow only to deliver one of the most one-note performances in his entire career. Even more infuriating, though, is the lack of understanding Eastwood displays for Frankie. I find it interesting when a character who attends Mass daily is unable to cross himself correctly before his nightly prayers. Another irritating element of Frankie's character is the story of his daughter. We are kept in the dark about why his daughter refuses to speak with him, no doubt because the filmmakers want us to draw our own conclusion. The backstory is far too important to Frankie for us to be kept from us. Suppose he abused her as a child or was an illegitimate father who didn't know she existed until late in life. These different scenarios have massive repercussions on him and his relationship with Maggie.<br/><br/>But it isn't just Eastwood's acting that fails to deliver. Morgan Freeman is also awful. His line readings are so difficult to understand that I spent most of my time trying to determine whether he is acting or impersonating a vacuum cleaner. On the rare occasion when Scrap's narration is actually decipherable, it comes off as pointlessly poetic--suggesting that screenwriter Paul Haggis, adapting from F.X. Toole's ""Rope Burns,"" is unaware of the fact that Scrap is an uneducated man living in a gym. The pair of bad performances just adds to the preposterous string of victories Maggie racks up. Really, why should I believe that a woman that has received only a couple months worth of training is going to slaughter better trained, younger athletes?<br/><br/>Yet, despite these flaws, Hilary Swank's sincere turn almost makes the first hour worth viewing. Swank does a magnificent job of conveying a determined fighter, who has no disillusionments about how miserable her life will be if she doesn't succeed as a boxer. In fact, there are two scenes that are especially effective. The first is when Scrap teaches Maggie how to work a punching bag, the second is on her birthday when Frankie starts to train her. Not only does Swank deliver a fine performance, but also numerous technical aspects of the production are impressive. Tom Stern's cinematography uses shadows to great effect and Henry Bumstead's production design delivers an elegant setting.<br/><br/>The film quickly moves from being flawed to being reprehensible. How so many people can look at what happens during the second half and think of it as being truthful is beyond me. When the half-blind, sixty-something Scrap walks into a ring and knocks out a vibrant, twenty-something boxer, the scene belongs in a ""Three Stooges"" movie. Even more irritating is a sequence when Maggie and Frankie visit her family. Her mother and sister are the epitome of backwoods hillbillies. Maggie's attempts at giving her mom a nice house are met with hostility, because it will make it impossible for her mom to cheat the welfare system. Stereotyping of this type is both wrong and unnecessary. The audience is already sympathetic to Maggie, so we don't need to be manipulated any further by her uncaring family. If the Fitzgerald's were black, I can only imagine the outrage that would ensue over the depiction of this family. Fortunately for all involved, everybody likes to take a swipe at ""white trash.""<br/><br/>Of course there's another plot twist that received much controversy when Michael Medved and Rush Limbaugh revealed it in order to further their own agendas. Numerous people castrated them for revealing the specifics of the plot, but since the twist happens with 40 minutes left in the film, it is only fair to tell people the general path the film takes. I won't reveal the exact nature of the twist, but ""Million Dollar Baby"" is not a female-""Rocky."" Instead, it turns into a euthanasia drama. Fair enough, since it's an important topic and many movies incorporate it into the plot. Yet the exact nature of how it is explored is poorly plotted and unbearably divorced from reality. I feel an obligation not to reveal any spoilers from this section of the film, which limits my ability to fully explain my objections to it. Nonetheless, I can safely relay that Eastwood's direction and Haggis' script do not even attempt to present realistic medical procedures. Not only that, but upon reflection, the decisions made by the characters are not consistent with the rest of their behavior. After years of being one of America's top auteurs, perhaps it is time for Eastwood to hang up his gloves."

","Sweet film, but completely obvious and overwrought at every turn. From the deliberate plot points to the music designed to cue your emotions, it's a film that doesn't ask much from its audience and delivers just as much in return.<br/><br/>It's not that it's a bad film, but it's such a lightweight melodrama. I suppose I expected more from an Oscar winner but who are we kidding; we are a long way away from the days of a film like Midnight Cowboy winning.<br/><br/>Speaking of the Oscars: <br/><br/>Direction: Eastwood's directing masterpiece is Unforgiven, hands down. MDB doesn't come close to delivering what Unforgiven has for the audience, and with a genre film - great.<br/><br/>Best Supporting Actor: What can you say about Freeman, he's always solid but how is this performance different than, say, The Shawshank Redemption? Furthermore, he's also much better in Unforgiven.<br/><br/>Best Supporting Actress: I've never been a fan of Swank's work. She looks and acts like Matt Damon, another actor I don't like. It's not that their bad actors, but it's so apparent in their mannerism that they believe their own hype. Because of that, they end up giving measured performances. They both have no emotional cores. Although, I will say that this was the best of Swank's performances so far; still not Oscar worthy though."

Or, as in the case of Million Dollar Baby, as a #$#** coward that would rather die than face a difficult challenge. Guess what Hollywood? We're just the same as everyone else.

The movie would have been so much better if rather than talking Frankie (Clint Eastwood) into euthanasia (another name for murder/suicide), it had shown Maggie as struggling but ready to take on the next challenge and fight the next fight. The ending alone knocked this movie down several points in my vote.<br/><br/>Okay, off my soapbox. Up to that point it was a fairly good movie and I liked the acting. Other than what I've already mentioned (and a minor point I'll mention in a minute), Hillary Swank did another quality acting job, as she usually does. Clint Eastwood was Clint Eastwood, just as John Wayne's characters were always John Wayne. If you like the one basic character he always seems to portray (and I do usually) you'll like him here. My complaints are all in the writing department, not acting. Did anyone else get tired of Hillary calling Clint ""boss"" throughout the movie in that southernish accent. She sounded like a prison inmate when she did that. But as I said, a minor complaint.<br/><br/>Bottom line, enjoy most of the movie, skip the stereotypical demeaning ending."

","This movie is an overlong unbelievable tear jerker. I went to see it at someone else's request and expected a Rocky equivalent. That was a great movie. This was a mess.<br/><br/>Hollywood likes to parade old actors who have accepted their senior status. They should do the same for actresses, but that is another point. I am not a Clint Eastwood fan, but he is good in this film. And the girl is too.<br/><br/>The thing should have ended with the heroine getting her lights punched out and then trying to figure out what to do with the rest of her life if they wanted realism. But no,they went for the tear ducts. <br/><br/>To write and produce a movie that is truly tragic, a Rocky who gets creamed and drops like a, well, rock in a lake is much more difficult and much more real.

"CyMaddux","6","0","2","9 November 2005"," One dollar ending
","This movie is great, if not spectacular in the first half, only to be very slow and predictable in the second-half. I think where this movie makes it points (and thus the high rating) is from the acting performances by Eastwood and Swank who are solid. Swank does an excellent job in her portrayal of a boxer in her early 30s, who Eastwood takes on as a student. I have to mention what I didn't like about the movie, enough people told you about the good points by now.<br/><br/>First off, there is no development of the characters Danger and Swaraylle (whatever the heck his name is, the black dude that freeman knocks out) they don't really serve a purpose other than comedic relief. The whole fight with Billie the Bear at the end is reeeediculous. OK, obviously they know she's a dirty fighter, they would have studied her at length before the fight.. So why the heck does Maggie turn her back on her, and even worse, WHERE IS THE REF?? At the very least, Billie The Bear would have been disqualified and fined, if not suspended by the WBF boxing commission. And the ending is too similar to what happened when Frankie was ""sub"" manager for Scrap. They needed to come up with something else, its too darn predictable. The last hour of the movie is just unduely depressing.. They needed to take a different turn on the ending. Anyway, its right there with Butterfly Effect- great first half, lousy ending 5/10"
"broekens","6","0","4","31 October 2005"," Nothing special, and highly predictable apart from the way the twist at the end is filled in
","Honestly, I don't know why this movie gets a 8.4 rating, and I can't explain it with the vote demographics (all groups show the same average!). In this comment I try to explain why I think the movie is definitely not an 8+, by showing that it is predictable and has a shallow story.<br/><br/>First, some good things: its about a girl who want's to fight, instead of a man. This is nice as it puts some counterweight to the large number of male oriented fighting movies. They did try to put some story behind the characters, although in my view in a very shallow way that certainly doesn't deserve the label ""subject matter is too deep"", as seen in another comment. The filming is well done, and the fights are realistic. So, no I'm not all negative.<br/><br/>However, the story is highly predictable. You know Clint is going to train Hilary. You know Morgan will start the process. You know they are going to have a bond, and that this is because he wants to take care of his ""surrogate"" lost daughter, and she needs a father figure. Come on, this is so obvious throughout the whole movie. Further, the movie gives you the feeling that something is going to go wrong, you just don't know when or how. So even the twist is, in a sense, predictable. Also, the characters are not ""deep"". They are simple, and behave according to their expected stereotypes. Let me describe the characters in several words: 1. ""Mistreated, unwanted hill-billy girl who lost her dad looks for father figure to take her seriously in her attempt to realize her dream."" 2. ""Failed boxer with 'I've been there' attitude and good hart hangs around training school and uses his gained world-understanding to help trainees"" 3. ""Honest, but fighting-mistakes-he-made-in-the-past, trainer has great talent and needs motivated student to get to the top. Oh yes, he happens to be a unwanted dad, too.""<br/><br/>The only problem is that the motivated student is a girl and trainer plays it roughs, ""don't train girls, go home, your old"".<br/><br/>The complete movie is build around this, and ones you understand the characters, you can predict the movie. Let me give some examples: 1. Morgan helps Hilary to get started. Why? That's his role as all-knowing failed boxer with a good hart who is the local school helper. 2. Clint doesn't want to help Hilary in the beginning, but finally will do so. Why? He's a ""boy's trainer"", a real cowboy. But he has a good hart and since he is missing his own daughter, Hilary has natural appeal. It starts with a present, the boxing-ball. 3. Hilary, unwanted as she is, buys a house!! for her parents (what an original present, why do these people always buy houses for there parents), and gets a very negative reaction from here family. Yes, once unwanted always unwanted. Now both Hilary and Clint are loners that have really found each other. 4. Of-course Hilary tastes success. If you work hard you can make it in the US, at least that's what people like to believe. She gets her ""one minute of fame"", and Clint with her. However, it's not a Sylvester Stallone movie and Hilary ain't Rocky! So, she has to loose, and when you loose, it has to be very dramatic. So she breaks her neck and we know the rest.<br/><br/>To conclude, the movie is very predictable once you have understood the characters. Now, let me give you some examples of very shallow ways of trying to enrich a flat storyline: 1. Boxes full of returned letters from a mysterious daughter. 2. A negative reaction when you buy a *house* for your family. 3. The not-so-intelligent ""goof"" trainee gets beaten up by some other trainee. This is to make use feel bad about the other, and to give... 4. Morgan the opportunity to show his hart. He defends his favorite trainee. And, even though this beaten up is not a nice thing to do, it does seem to wake up the guy (""maybe I should stop boxing""). However, Morgan even dozes him again ""everybody looses a fight sometimes"". Could someone explain me why we need this whole sub-story in the movie? 5. Some vague boxing story behind the characters of Clint and Morgan, that aims at explaining (1) their special relation, (2) Clint's hesitation to push trainees to the title fights (3) Morgan's relaxed attitude. 6. The former trainee of Clint. Yeah, he has to go away in a shitty way (he dumps Clint). Clint has to have time for his new trainee.<br/><br/>I could go on, but I won't. I think my point is made. So could someone perhaps explain me why this movie won 4 Oscars? And please, don't tell me it is because Clint euthanizes Hilary at the end. I agree this is courageous step taken by Clint as a director, but hardly a reason for the movie to get a 8+ score. Further, what exactly is the point of this euthanization? It is done when Hilary practically commits suicide, and when she (apart from being paralyzed and feeling miserable) also lost her leg; oh yes, that was another shallow way of making us feel even more sorry for her, so that even the most conservative persons would accept euthanization. Anyway, I think my point is clear. It's a 6 at best."
"intrex","8","0","5","28 October 2005"," Informercial on Assisted Suicide
","I finally saw it last night, and to tell the truth, I was quite disappointed. I only vaguely knew that it was about a female boxer; nothing more. The first third was great, the dialogue was hilarious, though not very informative, so I could sense that something else was coming. What I didn't count on was an hour-long infomercial on assisted suicide.<br/><br/>Could Clint Eastwood have made this story any more unassailable? His motivation to make this out to be as ""justified"" a suicide as possible is clear from the many ""justifying"" points in the movie: 1) Hillary Swank's character is almost one-dimensional; she has absolutely nothing outside of boxing, so no big loss to anyone else, right? No great loss even to herself, once she's a quad.<br/><br/>2) Her character is quite saint-like, she is dedicated, motivated, able to stick up for herself, giving to her family when they don't deserve it, etc. If anybody deserves to to have a say over her life, it's her, right? 3) Clint's character is unusual in that he is a boxing trainer with an affinity for Yeats, Catholic apologetics and the Gaelic language, hardly a normal combination. The idea here is that his intelligence will win out over his emotion, just like all assisted-suicide should, right? We would never want to let someone kill themselves out of emotion.<br/><br/>4) Clint only show the worst parts of being a quadriplegic. This is not to say that it is a desirable position to be in, but to make it as bad as possible justifies the ending.<br/><br/>What I resent most about this movie is Clint using his media power to shove a point of view on society that shows no inherent regard for life itself. In fact, it elevates self over society, even while decreasing our meaning and purpose in a society already bereft of those values. Did Christopher Reeves' life have no meaning? Did he live in vain? Clint seems to think so.<br/><br/>A truly inspirational story would have had the trainer motivate the boxer to live on and make the most of her situation; Clint had no desire to inspire, he merely advertised his self-actuating point of view. Surely, such a driven character as Hillary Swank's would have been more of a fighter? To be honest, in the same position as the trainer, I probably would have done the same thing. As the boxer though, I don't think I would have wanted to die. My mind is the most valuable thing I have, and it retains value even as a quad. That's why Clint picked a one-dimensional boxer with nothing else to lose, to try and make you feel better about it.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, the two characters build up a strong father-daughter relationship, which is highlighted by his telling her the meaning of the gaelic boxing title that he had given her, moments before he kills her. 'Mo cosúlacht' means my darling, my blood, but it is also supposed to make us think that he has the right to do what she asks, being her ""father"". This is akin to the Pro-Choice justification used by women that their control over their bodies is more important than that of the life that they carry (and were responsible for causing). Even the title itself makes me think that Clint believes he has the right to kill his own ""baby"".<br/><br/>7/10 stars for the first half of the movie, 2/10 for the last half, and those primarily for Clint at least showing some anguish over the decision."
"judymc-1","5","0","5","23 October 2005"," I have one word for this movie - SLOW!
","Clint Eastwood is one of my all time favorites and he was great in this too, except at the end of the movie. The plot is also plausible, except for the last 1/2 hour or so. There were some really funny spots, and some really sad ones. I enjoyed the dynamics among the characters, especially when the extended family is introduced. Clint is his usual rough/soft character in this and in the end the soft wins out. Morgan Freeman is absolutely awesome in this, as he is in everything I've ever seen him in. He and Clint are like 2 old shoes together and really play off each other. However, I have one word to sum it all up - SLOW, SLOW, SLOW!!!"
"frlgearhart","5","0","2","21 October 2005"," Great character study, but...
","This movie is possibly Clint Eastwood's finest character study. As a character study, it focuses on three main characters, all of which are brilliantly drawn. I won't add ink on this subject, since it's already been dealt with by numerous others. Even minor characters, with one exception, are generally drawn with deftness. Only one minor character, a Catholic priest, ends up being a punching bag for the director, and thereby hints at the main flaw of the movie as art.<br/><br/>The movie tries to be something it ultimately isn't. It tries to be a morality play. It succeeds in this fairly well up until the last, controversial, scene, albeit at a level that was already well covered in the Rocky films. That is, it portrays the kind of spirit required to succeed in boxing and generally lets the viewer draw inferences about how that applies in life in general. It quotes an aphorism of the author of the original story, F.X. Toole, that has a significance for viewers that goes beyond where the movie reaches. The greatest tragedy of the film is that the director didn't see its widest application. If he had, this movie would not have become a poster child for a particular movement (but I don't want to divulge the ending, so I will continue to speak in oblique terms, get me?).<br/><br/>Here's the rub. The quote is this: ""Instead of running from pain, which is the natural thing in life, in boxing you step into it, get me?"" The pain portrayed at the end of the movie is precisely the pain that people in this movement run away from. It is precisely the pain that two of the characters in the movie ultimately run away from. The secret of growing in the spiritual life is to step into it."
"Stephen-34","2","0","4","17 October 2005"," So lost in agenda, they missed the point
","It is a greater disappointment to believe in the ones you love whenever they clearly strive to fail you on purpose.<br/><br/>Eastwood and Freeman have so often revealed magic that I had come to trust them for artistic integrity. Million Dollar Baby destroyed that belief. This film is little more than a wobbly-wheeled vehicle for a man intent on portraying a disconsolate, washed-up, never-quite-made-it human being, (Heartbreak Ridge, The Unforgiven, Space Cowboys) intent on having us feel sorry for him despite the fact he never took the risk to claim his own slice of life, and it fails both as story and as art.<br/><br/>I am disappointed by the clear failure to work the parallel between the ring and the altar. The story's narrator openly defines the relationship between a boxer and her trainer, and we have numerous examples of that relationship at work. We are presented with Frankie's own journey toward spiritual discipline (a journey we all share) and we anticipate the priest's role as an opportunity to develop the parallel. But the writer (?) producer (?) director (?) let it fall flat upon the screen as an empty suit and I for one was disappointed. This was not a story element overlooked, but clearly inserted into the story and then abandoned (because it might add a glimmer of light into the gloom?).<br/><br/>Then, we are given Maggie's unyielding trust in Frankie though never where it originated nor what of anything between them nourishes it; and through to the end, we wait for the reveal that never comes. Instead, we are asked to watch Frankie trash her gift as an ode to his own tragic life. The film offers us not so much the art of story telling as of despair.<br/><br/>That crumbling sound you hear is another bit of Eastwood's audience falling away."
"SJ_1","5","0","4","16 October 2005"," Painfully average?
","When ""Million Dollar Baby"" came out, I didn't care about seeing it. There are many films I don't bother seeing at the cinema, and this was one of them, it just didn't interest me. The hype starts growing, critics are hailing it as a masterpiece, and before long it's picked up 4 Oscars including best picture. So when it comes out on DVD, I decide to rent it, after all, I have nothing to lose.<br/><br/>This is not a terrible film. Unfortunately, it isn't an excellent film either, and would be summed up best by the words 'painfully average'. There is nothing special about it. The story is nothing special, it's the simple sports underdog story we've seen so many times before, it didn't have anything that really pushed it towards anything more than average. I don't understand the big deal with the acting performances in this film, they're nothing special, and the script is average as well.<br/><br/>Every single character is just a walking cliché; Danger could well be one of the most pointless characters ever. We get it, this guy is all about heart but he can't fight to save his life. There was no need for any of his appearances on screen; it was a pointless character trying to put across some sort of message.<br/><br/>The main thing that made me dislike the film was the final 30-40 minutes, in which Eastwood tries to change the direction the film is going, but fails in my opinion. While it sounds as if I hated the film from start to finish, I didn't, it had good pacing and was quite interesting to watch, despite its flaws, up until this point. The final half hour is extremely long-winded, taking ages to reach its obvious conclusion, and failing to generate any sort of reaction with its supposedly tragic ending. It was this section that I really disliked, it went straight for the heartstrings, yet wasn't tragic enough to pull them.<br/><br/>Discussion over the success of ""Million Dollar Baby"" will continue until long into the future, but in my opinion it was a failure, which plodded along without ever reaching the level of brilliance, ending with a conclusion which missed the mark."
"shanfloyd","8","0","1","11 October 2005"," A bit overrated, still the genius of the actors made it good enough to call it great.
","I've now seen two recent boxing films in two days. And I'm astonished (and glad too) to find out how much ""Million Dollar Baby"" differs from ""Cinderella Man"". The latter one is a highly passionate presentation of a heroic, though predictable, true story. Million Dollar Baby is not stylish or passionate, its simplicity in direction or cinematography is a necessary marker of the harsh reality it depicts, unlike the fairy-tale truth of Cinderella Man. One can easily divide the film in two parts, and the first one is truly about boxing.<br/><br/>Cinderella Man is primarily a story of a man's struggle through life, only his profession is boxing. But the first part of MDB is about boxing and its technical details. In this case, according to the opinions of the viewers who know about boxing, Eastwood made some serious mistakes (some of them are listed in the 'Goofs' section). But the last half of the film shows us that boxing and technical details are not the point of this film too. How Eastwood and the screenwriters bring about the shocking plot twist and the brilliant ending is truly the best part of the film.<br/><br/>Now speaking of the actors, what can I say, it is one of the few films where all of the main cast members are at their best. I'm sure soon Hilary Swank will be type-casted in such roles, she's so good at them. Morgan Freeman is always a pleasure to watch. Here his character's cold chemistry with Frankie Dunn is quite enjoyable. For Eastwood, I don't know what to say, but I'm sure there are few performances that supply constant inspiration to all the people involved with cinema industry, it's one of them.<br/><br/>But as a director, Eastwood falters from his last year classic standard of ""Mystic River"". Maybe because as I've said earlier that this film is about harsh reality, not passion or style, Eastwood's direction is surprisingly bland, without any moment to praise whole-heartedly. Especially the boxing matches are utterly below average display. It's funny he got the Academy Award for direction, not acting."

I read comments, here, comparing this movie to the best boxing movies. How? The action was Rocky-like (fake and exaggerated).

"jon-foss","8","0","1","24 July 2005"," Okay, NEW take on the boxing ""errors""
","Okay, after I saw this movie last night I thought it was an awesome movie, but as an avid sports fan was very disappointed in the boxing errors (as were many others on this board). The errors I speak of are- people getting punched when they are down, after the fight, etc. (basically all the cheap crap that went on, that would never happen in real boxing without the boxer being disqualified). However, after thinking about this movie over the past 24 hr.s there is one scapegoat. I was thinking back, and realized that this entire movie was through the eyes of Eastwood's daughter (who is reading the letter). The unrealistic things that happened during the boxing matches could have just been her interpretation of what she was reading. For example, Freeman's character said, ""she was known as the cheapest fighter in the ring. Eastwood's daughter may not know a lot about boxing and may have taken that as throwing people down, punching people when they are down, etc. This could also explain Swank's ""over the top"" family that other posters were complaining about- saying that Eastwood shouldn't have been so over-dramatic with how redneck they were. All of this may have also been exaggerated by Eastwood's daughter's interpretation of what Freeman wrote in the letter. If you've read this post, what do you think? Any possible truth to this? If not, then the movie is just a bad boxing movie, and the makers should have done a better job of their homework on the boxing rules."

","The story of a white trash early 30s woman (Swank) determined to be a good boxer and the veteran coach (Eastwood) who reluctantly takes her on board. The tale is narrated by Eastwood's gym buddy Freeman.<br/><br/>Solid direction from Clint, and a surprisingly good acting performance from him too. Swank does nothing wrong, and Freeman brings his usual trademark quiet dignity to his role. The story is simple. Swank surprises everyone with her boxing talent, Eastwood develops paternal feelings towards her and the two of them strike a father-daughter relationship. Swank's lack of a father figure in her life, and her clearly trashy family makes her relationship with Eastwood whose own daughter is estranged from him all the more relevant.<br/><br/>Alas in time Swank gets bested by a top hardcore boxer, and she has to contend with her shattered dreams. Taking a philosophical angle, she contents herself with the thought that despite her career ending defeat and serious injuries she lived a lot more and made more of an impact in her world than she would have if she never got into boxing. Better to live a couple of years with intense passion than a lifetime as trash.<br/><br/>Freeman won his long overdue Oscar, but this again highlights that Oscars are not about the best performances or best pictures. He is as usual good in his role, but he has given more impacting performances in more demanding roles in the past. Somewhat ironic then that he should win his first Oscar for this one.<br/><br/>There is the obligatory sideline goings on at the gym, which feel a bit contrived. However Eastwood's direction is very good, and the three principal leads know what they are doing.<br/><br/>My issue with the film's best picture win is less a criticism of the quality of the film than the politicking going on at the Oscars. Simple effective films like this have won in the past (like Ordinary People deservedly in 1980, Terms of Endearment undeservingly a couple of years later). But the best picture winner must feel like the best picture of the year. That Million Dollar Baby ain't. Eastwood has obviously built up a web of alliances in Hollywood, and is one of it's most influential figures.<br/><br/>I suppose the fact that this film won Best Picture shouldn't be particularly surprising. Almost everyone knows that the Oscars are not about the best. It's about what looks good, what reflects the style and power play of Hollywood the best."

","(Spoilers Galore):<br/><br/>Here it is in a nutshell, so don't read if you haven't seen the movie or if you don't want the whole thing revealed to you: Clint Eastwood is a crusty old fight manager whose latest client decides to bail out on him, so when a feisty and determined girly boxer named Maggie (Hillary Swank) shows up at his gym and begs him to train her, he eventually agrees after first putting her off. The girl becomes a really good fighter, knocking all the competition out in the first round, but ultimately meets her match in a dirty-fighting opponent who breaks her neck in the ring and sentences her to a fate at the hospital, where she loses her will to live.<br/><br/>Here we have another one of those non-deserving Best Picture Winners. Let's not get carried away here -- the film is ""pretty good"" at best, and certainly watchable, but this is nothing more than a retread of so many other boxing and heart-tugging tearjerkers that I'm surprised so many embraced it. All I can guess is that a lot of people never saw the ROCKY films, LOVE STORY or TERMS OF ENDEARMENT. This is a familiar old tale: ""Struggling boxer wants to be managed by the best, and an aging old trainer wants one more shot so he hesitantly accepts the challenge. And then, toss in a heaping helping of sudden tragedy from other tearjerkers which causes everyone to pull out their handkerchiefs and Kleenex"". The End.<br/><br/>The assets of the film come from the performances of Eastwood, Swank, and also the dependable Morgan Freeman, along with heart and soul and a collection of characters that really relate to one another well. Clint's trainer in particular is given a complex nature, as he goes to church every day to talk to his priest and is haunted by the mistakes he feels he's made during his years. But Swank's Maggie turns out to be a real phony in the end, as she decides that life without one of her limbs is no longer worth living. I don't have a problem with that decision in and of itself, but up to this point we've been hit over the head again and again that Maggie is one tough cookie who never says ""no"" and doesn't stop fighting. I didn't buy for a minute that she'd give up the real fight of her life when the going really got tough."

However it seems that the movies he directs are always very dark and un-redemptive. Unforgiven was also dark, but it had the backdrop of the old west and somehow that's more palatable to me. There are many things that are hard to swallow in this movie when you think them over. But I think the main thing that disagreed with me is how the movie starts out so inspiring and then takes a dark turn. With an outcome that is unnecessary.

He is afraid to take and fail again, but nevertheless, he is forced into it. He tries hard to be what he was not before.

","This is one of the best boxing movies so far. Aside from the thrill of the battle in the ring, it also entails a drama in the later part of the movie. It is a good combination and the good part is unlike rest of the boxing or fight movies, (except for raging bull which is a lifestory of a boxer), our hero doesn't win the final fight and reach the happy ending. This adds reality with a little bit of surprise. However, the boxing scenes of the movie is a little far from realistic. The punches are very accurate and strong. It reminds us the series ""Rocky"". The one-round knockouts are seriously far from reality (Hillary Swan does not really look like Mike Tyson, does she?). But as it gets closer to a real boxing bout, where punches are hardly on target, and where it takes rounds (most of the time it goes to decision, since these boxers are light weight) to win the match, it will get boring so this is the usual drawback of all the boxing movies, and must be accepted. Another thing is, after the injury, as we know she will never get up and fight again, and the story will end sad, some viewers may find the last 40 minutes slow and boring. Also our hero is presented as a very nice positive person. Life as everybody else is unfair to her. Her mother nearly hates her, all she thinks is her money even after the injury, thats a little too much. The ""bad woman boxer"" is also way out of boundaries of boxing and reality. Punching while the opponent is down? hitting clearly with an elbow? the last match was more like a UFC bout. No refs will allow that much, nobody with that consistent behavior may hold a title. If Clint Eastwood had watched more box matches before shooting the movie it could have been better. Against all these, this movie made its place in my memory."

","Well, I saw it. Despite hearing Swank's delivery of ""Don't you say that if it ain't true"" dozens of times and knowing the would-be general setting of boxing wouldn't be my cup o' tea I saw the film and liked it more than disliked. There are already some 650 comments here so I shan't discuss the whole. Nevertheless, some points follow (mainly for those who have already seen the film).<br/><br/>A critic called the cinematography ""hopefully the closest thing he'll ever get to glaucoma"". That's a zinger right there, though I know not the effects of said condition. Now, during the (visually) darker moments it does look a bit peculiar to say the least, but overall I liked the look.<br/><br/>Haggis has written some quality dialogue (though not always present) so I'll see ""Crash"" now, too. The Scrap voice-over is mostly well-used, disappear though it does suddenly (rightfully so, perhaps). However, I don't like the way the ""bad guys"" (the family included) have been written, and ""it"" would have made much more of an impact had it not been ""executed"" by this idiot filled with pure evil. Accidents happen.<br/><br/>The story is eventually a very ordinary one. Think about it. There's the first part - nothing special there - and there's the second part, the ""after"" part, which is a tad too sentimental - necessary though that may be (why am I complaining?) - and for some reason too much for the tender (go figure). I actually prefer the ""before"" part. ""Mar adentro"", also from last year, deals with this particular matter in a much better way than the final third here. But maybe I shouldn't even compare the two; the films have less in common than is thought, actually.<br/><br/>The film is a good one, I'll give you that, but it isn't a masterpiece. The harsh division into two separate pieces shouldn't perhaps have been the thing to do so the whole suffers, and the script is far from great. And I didn't cry."

They explained it by saying she won all her matches in the first round. Has there ever existed such a boxer? Not even Rocky was that good! The disappointment for me, however, doesn't come from the lack of boxing footage, but from the lack of story explanation. What happened between Eastwood's character and his wife? They divorced, separated or what? Why does his daughter hate him so? Why does Hollywood feel the need to continue to mock anyone of religious faith, including having the (Episcopal?) priest using bad language and calling Eastwood's character a liar for saying he was writing his daughter, when the audience is shown he was writing her and that his letters were returned.<br/><br/>Why does he decide to murder her (assist her suicide) and take off? Where on earth was the hospital staff and why did no one hear the noise of the monitors while he was killing her? Supposedly a clue is dropped that he went to the diner that served lemon pie without it coming from the can, but why? Because he went against what the priest told him to do and felt that was the closest to heaven he could get after '2' unforgivable sins? A lot of questions, but not many answers. But then I guess that's what film making is about these days. Pathos above moral values. Emotions rather than any logical sequence or rhyme or reason.<br/><br/>When Clint Eastwood was asked about why the assisted suicide scene in an interview, he stated that the movie wasn't making an argument for it. But it sure wasn't making one against it. It even seemed that Morgan Freeman's character looked at that decision as a good one as he wrote the letter to Eastwood's daughter.<br/><br/>In a year full of weak movie entries (the fact that idiot Michael Moore even tried to get consideration for best picture showed that HE knew it was a weak field), this film was a cut above the other mediocrity, but it's lack of moral values and degradation of life and the importance of what God thinks brings this down to one of the most mediocre movies to receive as many Oscar nominations as it did that I can remember.<br/><br/>See it by all means, but be prepared for disappointment if you are a person of faith or care about life."

","I can't see what is so good about Million Dollar Baby. It is an average film; that is all. The biggest problem I have with it is that the storyline seems to attempt to be true-to-life but if you examine it, it is so utter preposterous: a woman in the first flushes of middle age (Hilary Swank) decides to start boxing and convinces a reluctant veteran (Clint Eastwood) to train her; then within a year or two she is a boxing world champion defeating the stereotypical evil European opponent. (Frankly, when I see an American film that contains a ""foreign baddie"" (and sadly, so many do), it's a pretty clear indicator as to what kind of audience they are targeting.) Give me a break. I can't see how anyone can take seriously such an absurd tale.<br/><br/>Are you detecting shades of Rocky here? Yes, so was I. So not only is the storyline preposterous, it is unoriginal as well. The only thing that saves the film is the emotionally stirring scenes near the end as the boxer deals with tragic events that afflict her life. They are excellently acted and brought a lump to my throat. However, not even that can offset the ever-predicable and toe-curling subplots about the loud-mouth bully being put in his place and the no-hoper who just never gives up. You don't need me to elaborate on those subplots any more - you've seen them in a thousand other films. Aren't audiences getting tired of this by now? Where's the originality? Where's the realism?"

There was nothing either in the performances or the direction which would make me really emotionally invested in the movie. Clint Eastwood is utterly unconvincing in his part, Hilary Swank has nothing to play (though she is very convincing as a boxer), but any actress willing to play without a make-up could be equally good in the part, I guess. Only Morgan Freeman sparks up some interest with his performance, but he has very little screen time. As for Clint Eastwood's direction: it seems his only specific approach to direction was to make the characters move in the dark for the most part of the movie. Not enough, Clint!

He is the one that taught her how to box, even though Dunn directly told him not to encourage her. He is half blind, and makes fun of himself for it, and is probably the wisest one in this movie, who's counsel will get you thinking. He is a character that demands respect in a quiet way, but when he is angered he is ferocious, the one scene in the movie that shows it anyway.<br/><br/>About the movie, it isn't a ""boxing story,"" or anything of that sort. It is a movie about a father/daughter type relationship. It is a story about devotion, unconditional love, and strength.

Morgan Freeman's performance was the usual narrative state he's best known for. Hillary Swank plays a female boxer determined to achieve her dream of being a boxer. So she asks Clint Eastwood's character to train her, at first he's hesitant. I didn't like Maggie's trailer trash family, either.<br/><br/>It was good in the beginning when he was training her and bonding with her like she was his daughter, then once she finally achieved her dream, the boxer sucker punches Maggie and she becomes paralyzed. Then she protests by biting off her tongue. Plus, this movie sparked a lot of controversy about euthanasia, and the right to die. The best example of this was the Terri Schaivo case. Million Dollar Baby should not have won the Oscar. The Aviator should've won instead. Clint Eastwood as good of an actor he is, he could've done better. This whole movie could've been better. See one of his other movies instead. Stay completely away from Million Dollar Baby. It will just be a big disappointment."

","Million Dollar Baby is not a boxing movie. It is a character study. Now Rocky was a boxing movie. A poor young kid with ""heart"" gets a shot at the title, becomes a contender and triumphs over all the odds. Rocky's journey to triumph was the whole point of the exercise and that is what makes the film a boxing movie. Baby on the other hand, while steeped in boxing and its milieu, doesn't care about winning or being a contender. What it cares about are the people who live with the sport and how this world affects them, their attitudes and their actions.<br/><br/>Frankie Dunn is a boxing promoter. He's a tough old geezer and one of the best in his field. His one flaw is a serious drawback in his line of work. He doesn't like to see his fighters get hurt. Frankie's life is an endless cycle of developing young fighters only to be abandoned when he refuses to take them to the next level out of fear for their safety. One day Maggie Fitzgerald wanders into his gym. She's a youngish woman who wants to be a boxer. No, she wants to be a winner and she is more than willing to do whatever it takes to become one. Despite his years, his experience and his distaste for training a ""girly"" Frankie is no match for Maggie's tenacity and soon finds himself with a determined protégé who begins her swift rise to the top. This is only part of the story however. Events occur that test these two in ways far crueler than the force of a heavyweight's punch.<br/><br/>It has to be said that neither Hilary Swank nor Morgan Freeman are overly believable in their roles. Of the three leads only Eastwood looks likes he could spend his days in a dingy old gym. The spindly Swank is unconvincing as a power puncher and Freeman comes across like a slumming PhD. This is an instance, however, where suspension of disbelief pays off in the long run. A little loss of feasibility buys you two great performances. Maggie is a woman whose tough exterior hides a tougher interior wrapped around a will of iron. This is both her triumph and her tragedy. Swank captures these qualities in a natural, loose jointed performance that manages to make this rough customer appealing. Morgan Freeman is an actor who can steal a scene with just a look or turn of phrase. Here he's called upon to act as narrator and observer of human tragedy. He does so with dry objectivity leavened with a hint of bemused sorrow. As Frankie Eastwood is excellent as a man whose job and background conspire against his compassionate nature. The rasp of his voice sounds like a soul tearing itself apart.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is not an easy movie to like. It takes two people who are the sum of their experiences and needs and rubs them together under horrendously stressful situations. It is like a case study, showing a little human truth as the film makers see it. If you approach it on those terms you will find Baby a worthwhile investment. You will, however, find yourself admiring the accomplishment more than loving the experience."

I'm sorry, but I, unlike most of America do not go to a movie only to leave it crying and feeling suicidal. I have no moral objections to the movie, and what happened, it was just way too depressing. It doesn't matter to me if other people liked this movie, they can have their own opinion, but I don't like any movie that makes me cry for half the movie and half the night after it.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my second annoyance. The Oscars...now, there was some great acting in this movie, and the people that were in it should've won for best acting, but what is the Oscar obsession with nominating the most depressing movies imaginable for the Oscars?

Why was the priest such an unwelcoming grouch? Since Maggie was labeled trash by the voice over, did the movie justify her death? Why at age 30 did she begin to box?

Her mother commits the ultimate sin for a Hollywood movie -she's overweight. I don't understand how Maggie could have lost her million dollar fight. Surely her opponent would have been disqualified? But of course that wouldn't fit in well with the sympathy we're supposed to feel for her. Also, i was at the movie with a couple of people who are physiotherapists and have experience of quadriplegia and they found the hospital scenes unbelievable. The movie seems to be full of scenes and depictions which serve the sole purpose of being plot devices and which have no grounding in reality. For me this detracted from the movie as a whole.

","Throughout most of his career Clint Eastwood has assumed the role of a protecting angel, sometimes deadly, often sullen or glaring, always with a swollen, golden Irish heart not far from the surface. The Leone westerns (in one of which Lee Van Cleef even describes him as a ""guardian angel""), The Gauntlet,(shielding Sondra Locke), Heartbreak Hill and In The Line Of Fire all reinforce this subtle theme. In the same way as much of Scorsese's work deals with men who live with obsession, Eastwood's films often focus on men who feel obligated to protect others, and live with the pain of the consequences when they sometimes fail.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Baby is the story of an ingenue female boxer from the poorest levels of American society, and the relationship she develops with her trainer (Eastwood). No need to recapitulate the story, however in true Anthony Robbins/Frank Capra style she is carried to the heights of fame with, it seems, little else apart from determination and self-belief only to be tragically struck down at the height of her fame. Despite his initial grumpy reluctance to get involved, Eastwood takes her on and the dynamic eventually deepens to the point where Maggie (Hilary Swank) becomes the substitute daughter that Frankie (Eastwood) has lost. This is confirmed by the final revelation of Maggie's Gaelic boxing nickname ""My darling, my blood"", and the ultimate act of love that climaxes the film. Having failed once more to protect, the Eastwood character almost mythically retreats into a shadowy limbo, a Hadean nocturnal world of country inns and small diners that suggest the final resting place for all unsuccessful guardian angels.<br/><br/>I am inclined to think that the Academy voted Million Dollar Baby as best potential motion picture, as the finished version contains only about a frustrating thirty percent of what might have been achieved with further development of ideas. While Hilary Swank charms always with her wide-eyed vulnerability, the initial relationship is trite, as is the persisting underlying American self-delusion that all things are possible if one only believes in oneself. Even the comic-cuts character of 'Danger' fails to recognise his own limitations and returns to the gym at the end of the film for more ritualised humiliation. Plot and characterisation all show signs of unsteadiness - there is no exploration of the relationship between Eastwood and his daughter, for example, the 'success montage' is jerky and out of kilter with the rest of the film's pace, and the boxer's psychology is insufficiently examined. By the second half, the film's 'fighting Irish' undertones, Catholic confessions and soundtrack began to remind me of John Ford on a particularly maudlin day and struck this reviewer as outdated and contrivedly mawkish.<br/><br/>I have long been an admirer of Clint Eastwood's films and have watched them develop in depth and richness. Were it not for the existing hype, MDB could be enjoyed as a downbeat Rocky fable, even a female version of Every Which Way But Loose. However on this occasion it's hard to escape the feeling that 'Baby' is a lightweight story punching above its weight and ultimately failing to go the distance"

","Ever since Titanic won the Best Picture Oscar (and to top that, 11 Oscars), the Oscars have gradually been digging their own grave. A year later we had to witness ""Shakespeare in Love"" take home the gold over ""Saving Private Ryan"". Then in 2002 we saw ""Chicago"" beat films such as Gangs of New York, The Pianist, Catch Me If You Can, and not to forget Road to Perdition for Best Picture. And now the Oscars have finally put the final nail in the coffin with awarding Million Dollar Baby their ""Best Picture of the Year"" of 2004.<br/><br/>I have seen all the ""Oscar"" nominee films, and I can clearly say that their were a number of films better in direction, cinematography, acting ability and writing. I place the following films better than MDB, such as THE AVIATOR, SIDEWAYS and what I regard as the Best Picture of 2004, ""ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND"". I firmly place Million Dollar Baby at 4th. And for Eternal Sunshine not even to be nominated for Picture, Direction (Gondry) and Actor (Jim Carrey) is an absolute disgrace, and the Academy knows it.<br/><br/>Let's face the fact. Scorsese was robbed of his Oscar by Eastwood. Eternal Sunshine was completely ignored, and the Academy instead focused it's attention on Million Dollar Baby. The reason? Eternal Sunshine had Jim Carey in it (which the Academy hates), and Million Dollar Baby was by Eastwood, and that's the only reason it won. Otherwise, ETERNAL SUNSHINE was (by far) the Best Picture of 2004.<br/><br/>As for the Academy, who knows what they'll come up with next? I suspect next year's ""Best"" Picture will be won by the producers of Gigli, directed by James Cameron, whilst the Acting awards will be won by Jennifer Lopez and Chris Rock respectively. Supporting awards will be given out to Lindsay Lohan and Ashton Kutcher, whilst Clint Eastwood will probably be named Best Director. For what? Who knows."

Good luck, been there, seen that.<br/><br/>Where to start? First, that annoying voice over which pretty much tells the whole story and reveals what everyone is thinking. The people who wrote this script need to take Screen writing 101.<br/><br/>The next problem I have with this film is the one dimensional characterisation. Morgan Freeman puts in his usual turn as the dignified black man (too bad that his character is redundant to the story). And since when has it been OK to stereotype poor white people from the South. Maggie's family is portrayed as evil welfare cheating trailer trash. The other hillbilly character is the dumb young male boxer with delusions of grandeur. Maggie's final opponent is a vicious Amazon who'd give the Iron Sheik a run for his money - at one point, I expected her to hit Maggie across the back with a folding chair when the referee wasn't looking.<br/><br/>The film fails most miserably where it tries raise questions over life and death and what it means to be alive. Such questions should be examined openly and honestly, or not at all. Unfortunately, MDB only ever deals with these issues superficially. The scenes between Frankie and the priest didn't really ring true and those long ponderous discussions between Frankie and Eddie got pretty tiresome after a while. The fact that Maggie's injury was caused by foul play is just a little too neat for my liking.<br/><br/>The one positive in this film is the luminous Hilary Swank who brings a vibrancy and life to her character. There is a vulnerability about her which makes you want to take her in your arms and protect her - that is until she shows off her massive biceps and starts knocking the snot out of other women."

Second, she would be declared champion if her opponent cheats like that. But third, my main complaint, is that the last part of the movie is too... distinct from the rest. It's a bit too radical of a departure from everything up to that. I know it's the same characters, and we needed the setup of the relationship between the characters to make the ending work, but it just felt, well, too jarring, I guess.

Here, Clint leaves Hilary's with her breathing tube removed from her trachea, which would make her death ""suspicious"", which means there would be some sort of coroner's inquest and autopsy which would show the high count of adrenaline in her system, thereby ruling her death as a ""probable homicide"". After the nurses and night staff were questioned, it wouldn't be long until they were onto Clint; most likely uncovering means, motive and opportunity (Morgan Freeman would be a poor alibi indeed).

Frankie Dunn is overprotective of himself and his fighters, and his fighters believe the protectiveness is more than a professional liability, it's a belief culture. Eddie Dupris is the loyal friend, ex-near champion boxer who lost an eye in Frankie's care. Maggie Fitzgerald is the female boxer, trying to escape her past and redefine her job, who finds boxing as a way to express and measure herself.

In the end Maggie has to face something nothing has prepared her for...<br/><br/>As far as the story and the message, Million Dollar Baby was very different from what I was expecting.

The movie could be divided into two; the first half with the fights and training and the second half with the emotionally effective drama.<br/><br/>The first little detail that caught my eye was the amazing collision of light and shadow. Randomly lit dim rooms make a really interesting atmosphere. Eastwood has kept this same style through the whole movie. I hope the movies he will make in the future will be as much of a treat to the eye as this one. Eastwood has also directed the actors wonderfully.<br/><br/>Hilary Swank, the winner of the Oscar for actress in the leading role, is amazing. Her determined and energetic attitude really impressed me. Clint Eastwood offers his best performance since Unforgiven (1992). He creates a magnificent and emotionally moving atmosphere for the important drama parts near the end. Morgan Freeman is also really good. He got the Oscar for best actor in the supporting role. I agree with the academy's choice. He is the narrator of the movie and he really does it wonderfully (quite like in The Shawshank Redemption).<br/><br/>I think that the only problem with the movie is the striking plot twist.

The last third, when the melodrama hits, it hits like a tornado that sucks all the air out of the room and neglects to fill the vacuum. This movie was saved by the acting, but it was fairly chock full of clichés, and the fact that she walked into the gym supposedly after winning a fight throwing punches that off-kilter gave it a believability gap that took a while to get over. If they had started the film without her having stated she had won a fight, the story wouldn't have changed much (well, the clichés would have been a tad more obvious) and my believability would not have been so challenged for the first half hour.<br/><br/>The last third of the film, where the well-known controversy exists, is incredibly long and tedious even in comparison to other melodramas. Without the ending, I would have given it an eight or nine for the lively Swank performance that, like Sylvester Stallone in the first Rocky film, took an old fashioned formula and made something really great out of it. The ending, however, dragged that all the way down to a six. I don't think I could watch it again without turning it off after that key defining event, but if I did, I'd end up watching a much more enjoyable movie.

The movie is OK but not amazing except near the end. I have two problems with it, though. One is minor and one is major. The minor one is that the foreshadowing was really obvious. I knew Maggie would break her neck when the comment was made early in the film about how far a neck can go. I also knew she was going to get killed once she became a quadriplegic because of the earlier story about her father and the dog. I'm not usually very good at knowing what will happen in a movie, and when I do know what to expect I take that as a sign of a bad movie.<br/><br/>My more serious issue, though, is with the euthanasia. I'll agree that being a quadriplegic is real bad, but I'm also sure that most quadriplegics want to die and somehow get through it. Frankie didn't really try very hard to dissuade Maggie from her idea of being killed. He didn't get counseling for her and didn't really do much else other than talk to the priest about his own issues. Frankie gave Maggie the easy way out and should not be considered heroic. The message of the film is that euthanasia is a convenient way to handle medical problems. This is not a good message."

This whole movie was driven by characters only, the plot was really a big letdown. The first half I'll agree was a little slow but then it really began to develop when Swank's character is winning fights, forming a tighter relationship with Clint Eastwood as a trainer, but then it's at this title fight, where the movie just drops off a cliff and hits rock bottom. Swank goes up against a dirty fighter who will throw any punch for victory, so the fight lingers on until when another round ends with the bell, Clint Eastwood places a stool on its side waiting for her to return to the corner when this other fighter hits her in the back and she lands on the side of the stool with her neck paralyzing her from the neck down. This is where the movie just collapsed, then she becomes bed bound, her family comes and demands money and she tells them off, so she loses her family, she has to get her leg cut off because of skin blisters from her lack of movement and flexibility, then she tries to kill herself by biting off her tongue and then after all that Clint Eastwood just comes and finally performs a mercy kill on her. The momentum of the movie just took such a sudden stop in pace and then became the most depressing thing ever, the development of characters just went from bad to worse, (the same could be said for mystic river) the plot could have been worked out so much better, i thought that at the title fight that Swank would either lose or just get like a broken shoulder or something, i didn't expect her to get crippled for life and then have her whole world just collapse on her and result in the most horrific and miserable last weeks of her life. I think if she had like broken her shoulder or something and then still persisted to fight, Clint Eastwood would become more and more reluctant to let her fight, develop the relationship a little more, and then have swank get another shot at a title fight and then have the life altering injury and let it play out like it did. All in all, i felt that this movie was not best picture material, it was just one of those films that was so depressing people just thought it was good, really its just typical Clint Eastwood behind the lends of camera, he creates the most cutthroat ""right for the eyes"" scenario that provides the most depressing scene someone can think of, next movie to come out by him would probably be about a cripple being raped and robbed..., i don't look forward to anymore of Eastwood's films"

How many times do we have to see black men cast as wizened old figures who help white male central characters work through some kind of a personal crisis before we get offended? And in this case the character is a JANITOR, no less, who just seems to float around strategically, pushing a mop or cleaning a toilet, so he can interject some pear of wisdom at exactly the needed moment!! And what about the stereotyping of Hilary Swank's poor rural white family as stupid, lazy, welfare-cheating hillbillies (her character's term!)? The parallel father-daughter story lines (one real, one displaced) were about as subtle as a brick. I saw the narration as letter to the estranged daughter coming a mile away. Finally, I kept wondering why, with all the money Hilary Swank's character was apparently making herself and Clint Eastwood's character, no one's life seemed to be much changed. The gym remained a dump and nobody as much as bought a new shirt, blouse, or pair of pants (much less a car or anything). The only expenditure that was discussed was that of a house for someone else. Oh yes, and nobody seemed to have a sex life, either. These were cardboard cutout characters, for the most part. Only the good acting saved this movie from its very mediocre script."

The cinematography was perfect, but Morgan Freeman has been way better in other roles (Driving Miss Daisy, Glory and Shawshank). His quiet, expressionless janitor role won him an Oscar for obvious political reasons (he never won before). I think I'm just bitter that Million Dollar won the top awards such as best actress, director and picture. Sorry but how hard can it be to direct two other people and a few extras compared to Scorsese's work in the Aviator? Also Kate Winslet's performance in ETERNAL SUNSHINE was much more Oscar-worthy than the boyish-playing Hillary Swank which seems to be the only thing she's good at.. (Boys Don't Cry). WOW, she gained muscle, give her the Oscar!!! Million Dollar Baby is a great film but in all fairness, Eastwood's Mystic River was way better and I'm just bummed that Million Dollar has gotten more of the credit."
"HardKnockLife210","6","0","1","4 March 2005"," Gritty Realism with Heart
","Million Dollar Baby, is the newest, as of March 4, 2005, Best Picture winner at the Academy Awards. I am fairly pleased with its victory (I would've been thrilled if Sideways had won), although I am surprised that The Aviator didn't take the award (I'm glad it didn't). Anyways, it is film directed by Clint Eastwood, who is quickly establishing himself as a great director.<br/><br/>It is a film in the fashion of Eastwood's own Mystic River in that it explores a darker and grimmer side of human life. What made the film for me was Eastwood himself. Sure, in the trailer, he seems to be a caricature of the tough-guy boxing coach, but you must see the movie to see how Eastwood's acting skills help develop the character of Frankie Dunn. Eastwood's direction is gritty, realistic, and completely unashamed of the message he portrays through the lives of the characters on screen. Further, Eastwood's music (where's the nomination, Academy?) beautifully and heartbreakingly sets the tone.<br/><br/>The story is that of Maggie Fitzgerald (played INCREDIBLY by Hilary Swank with honesty and heart), an older (at least in the boxing world) woman who will only let herself be trained by one man, Frankie Dunn. Frankie's friend and the training center's janitor is Eddie Dupris, who is played by Morgan Freeman and who voices over much of the film (a la The Shawshank Redemption). These three actors so beautifully portray their characters that it approaches the indescribable.<br/><br/>One of the film's interesting points (although it is a slight downfall), is its use of somewhat one-dimensional characters. By this I mean, that the main characters rarely, if ever, show an evil side, while the enemies of these characters rarely, if ever, seem to contain even a bit of good. This is interesting to me because Eastwood is realistic, at least in the sense that he's not afraid to explore tragedy and evil, but he still uses some one-sided characters, seemingly to contrast the multi-dimensional (although they are ever-heroic), heartful characters.<br/><br/>The beauty of life, the wondrous escape of death, and shattered hopes are topics that Eastwood is so unafraid to portray, and this is somewhat refreshing to the viewer. Not everything has a simple solution, and Eastwood wants to show us that too, by ultimately offering the viewer a very troubling resolution.<br/><br/>Final Grade: A."
"Nezz","Null","0","3","3 March 2005"," A million dollar movie from a million dollar director.
","It's tough to talk about this movie without giving away some things that would ruin it, but one thing is for certain, it's NOT absolutely NOT what you're seeing advertised by Warner Bros. in the theaters. No, it's not a story about boxing, it's not an action film with Clint Eastwood, and it's not a thriller.<br/><br/>It has elements of all of the above, but this film that is directed and stars Clint Eastwood is perhaps his most emotional, most mature, most heart-felt film of his career. Just before I went to go see the movie last week, I was on the phone with Roger Ebert who predicts that it will sweep the Oscar nominations and could possibly be the only film with double-digit nominations this year. He may be right. If that's not enough of an endorsement for you, the perhaps this delicate explanation of the film will suffice.<br/><br/>Swank is enthusiastic, overzealous and passionate in this role. She chomps into the part like a champion, and she does more than sweat to make this part believable every step of the way.<br/><br/>Eastwood tries to avoid her interest in boxing, and her yearning for him to manage her, so he shuffles her off to Eddie, who gives her tips about how to train.<br/><br/>Not wanting to give anything at all away, some things happen that make everyone's life change drastically, and the film takes a totally unexpected direction from the first third of the movie.<br/><br/>That being said, the third act of the film is perhaps the weakest because it lacks the dramatic punch of some of the earlier scenes. It's still dramatic, it's still tender and surprising, but for some reason it's the least satisfying in the film. It gets slow, schmaltzy and somewhat cliché, but hey, it's a movie.<br/><br/>Eastwood no longer needs to prove himself as a director, and after last year's ""Mystic River"" (which won Sean Penn and Tim Robbins a best actor and supporting actor nod) he has proved he can direct well. Rarely does a director like to act in his own movies, though, so seeing him do both is an exception.<br/><br/>7/10."
"CUDIU","7","0","3","2 March 2005"," Well acted, finely directed. But...
","This movie starts just as if it were a new sequel of the Karate Kid saga (has this something to do with Swank acting in Karate Kid IV?)... how many times have we seen the lonely and tough hero desperately trying to work her/his way out of the mud thanks to sport competition? How many wise life-beaten trainers have we already seen? And of course all of them have to have their hidden past, which they try uselessly to forget and redeem. Which past is always condensed in one single epiphany, in perfect Hollywood style. Here poor Clint-Frankie is haunted by that last fight of his friend's: Clint was incapable of forcing him to give up. His friend Freeman-Scrap lost an eye for that.<br/><br/>Nevertheless Scrap's presence is a clear break of the scheme ""old trainer and young guy manage to overcome difficulties and win the championship"". Scrap is a sort of wise double of Frankie, himself having something to regret in his past (he has something of a personal redemption when he knocks down a young smart ass at the gym).<br/><br/>And, naturally, the movie eventually comes out of the cliché when we see that there is no final win. A more tragic ending could not have been devised. Giving no happy ending is supremely honest and makes the movie absolutely bearable. But maybe nobody deserved such a tragic finale. What of poor Frankie Dunn? He does not manage to reestablish any kind of contact with his daughter, loses his adoptive one, and is even obliged to kill her! Even his religious ethics is thus ruined. I do not feel better because of this terrible ending. Did we need it other than for weeping a bit before the credits? Or for giving our vote, if we are incidentally members of the Academy? Luckily, some gags are sprinkled over the story, which make the whole thing better. The character of Danger is very funny and a definite relief for the audience.<br/><br/>Well, anyway the movie is splendidly directed and acted. This is the very best about it. Mighty performances by Eastwood (both as actor and director), Freeman and Swank. Technically Million Dollar Baby is almost perfect (take production designing for example). Another thing I liked is the chilling portrait of Maggie's family, unfortunately much too credible.<br/><br/>Moreover Million Dollar Baby is obviously remarkable, and it would be so even if it had been a total failure, for being the first great film about a woman boxer. As a she-Rocky, Maggie is no stereotype. The fight and training scenes anyway are not convincing, Swank moves in a strange way, even if she seems to punch real hard.<br/><br/>All in all the movie is good. Technically it is excellent. It is even honest in that it tries occasionally to escape easy solutions. But it definitely lacks originality.<br/><br/>No doubt, The Aviator was better."

","My son and daughter-in-law dragged me to see Million Dollar Baby. My son works in the film industry and is hard to impress, so whenever he is excited about a movie, I expect great things from it. Maybe it was the genre. I think men beating each other up is just senseless, so maybe women beating each other up was just too much for me. The movie felt very ""Movie of the Week"" to me. From the time the Blue Bear came on the screen, I knew that she was going to kill Maggie. I didn't know how or when it would happen, and the thematic element of her paralysis was a surprise, but I wasn't surprised by the solution. I have a couple of friends who have had to make that decision for loved ones. Maybe that's why the action Frankie took didn't shock me. I cry at MacDonald's commercials, but I was only really choked up the first time Maggie went in the ring with her Mo Cuchla (sp?) robe. I should have been a puddle. I adore Morgan Freeman and he was lovely to watch as always. Hilary Swank was brilliant, and so was Clint Eastwood. The cinematography was beautiful, yet, I was strangely unmoved by the film. I'm not sure what went wrong. Maybe it was the hype. Maybe it was the feeling I had from the beginning that Maggie was looking for her own death. Tragic things happen to wonderful people every day, but she chose her tragedy. Maybe it was her stock hillbilly family, one dimensional and stupid. I really wanted to respect this movie as much as I respect Boys Don't Cry, but sadly, I couldn't. I plan to see it again. Maybe when I'm not wondering how she'll die, I'll be able to appreciate the story more."

","I made a conscious effort to watch MDB (Million Dollar Baby) the day before the Oscars to have a film to root for (so I wouldn't have to root for Sideways ... terribly overrated). Well, the fact is that MDB is a weak script, very clichéd, and predictable (I won't give away the ""twist"" but it's not as daring as you might imagine).<br/><br/>While I think highly of Clint Eastwood as a director and his previous films (as a director), he needs to remove himself of the Woody Allen megalomaniac desire to be an actor. His acting was stiff and gruff (just like him) without any depth. People say that about Tom Cruise, but Clint Eastwood is just the same version but different vintage.<br/><br/>The weak script didn't prevent Hillary or Morgan from turning two brilliant performances. Hillary earned our empathy and our hearts while Morgan gave us a look into the darker side of a man.<br/><br/>This isn't a boxing movie; it's a character study.

It's uplifting and satisfying in every sense of the word. If Clint had stopped there I would also have been writing a review that drips with honey, as so many of my peers have done.<br/><br/>But he doesn't stop there. He glues a lengthy stretch of additional celluloid onto a great fight film to promote his personal belief in euthanasia. He sells, and sells hard, the idea that killing Maggie is a good, kind, and loving act. After all, who wants to live as a paraplegic? <br/><br/>I wonder what the late Christopher Reeves would have said about this had he seen the film? I rather think the good Mr. Reeves would have spit in Clint's eye.<br/><br/>When it comes out on DVD be sure and show this film to every crippled person you know. In particular the paraplegics who ""fight the good fight"" every day. It will cheer them right up.<br/><br/>If it were only a boxing film I would rate it 10 stars, it's terrific.

When a character-driven story has to go to such lengths to generate an emotional reaction in the audience, that emotion is unearned.

","I came into this movie with high expectations. I had the choice of either seeing Sideways and this, and I chose this, because I was seeing it with my father, and he preferred to see this. From what I hear of Sideways, this was a bad choice. Million Dollar Baby was one of the greatest letdowns in a movie I have ever seen. I have a couple of beefs with this movie; Firstly, useless scenes that do not advance the characters or the movie, or the movie itself. For instance, the scene in which **SPOILERS** Danger gets beaten up and then Morgan Freeman drops the guy who did it to Danger. It had no point, and served no purpose of any major consequence to the movie. Also, the majority of scenes between Clint Eastwood and the priest. It told us more about the priest's character than Clint's. At this point I just want to say Hilary Swank's acting was great, and in all honesty, she was the highlight of the movie. Clint Eastwood was... Well... Clint Eastwood. He's been playing the same character with different jobs and names for the past 20 or so years, just like Woody Allen. Not saying I don't like Woody, (which I do, big fan), but it's hard to believe he (Clint) was nominated for a best actor award for essentially playing himself. None of the other actors really shone in it, but that was mostly due to a flimsy plot, with holes aplenty. In short, it was overall an enjoyable film, and I was at no point wishing I was somewhere else (besides in a theater playing Sideways), but there were a lot of problems with a movie that in no way deserved a Best Movie Oscar. See it when it comes on TV late night sometime. 6/10"
"dorayme","Null","0","2","28 February 2005"," A brilliant but flawed film, simply fell to melodrama in the last third
","I go to movies to collect gems, films to be viewed and enjoyed repeatedly over a lifetime. This is as good a personal standard for rating films as any. I am a big fan of Eastwood. I have seen his Unforgiven (not exactly a cheery movie) 11 times and enjoy it every time). Up to the fateful moment in Million Dollar Baby, I was thinking, what luck, this is really brilliant in so many ways, here another magnificent film, with all the elements of drama and humour, remarkable photography and on and on. My cup of tea! And then, 2/3 through and suddenly, there being no real hint of what was to follow (though it is remarkable how easy in hindsight some folks will now imagine them!) wham bam and the film became a self indulgent melodrama.<br/><br/>Would I willingly see my worst nightmare over and over again? Is there a real justification for this turn of events? Beyond ""it was in the short story on which the film was based"" or ""life is tragic sometimes"" or some other evasion (I can hardly explain here the extent to which much of what passes as film criticism is misguided)? A movie is a place to get lost in another world, it is not a place I go to feel depressed because someone decided to take some depressing and melodramatic route for no really good reason. It is not that I demand a happy ending, it is that I don't think the bleakest of endings was justified in this particular film. <br/><br/>First it was not made clear if the hero won or lost the actual fight. It looked from later remarks she lost or at least did not win. This is the first nonsense that began the terrible slide. The fouling boxer had been repeatedly warned, it was after the bell went and so on. Eastwood then goes to mawkish melodrama, even the issue of euthanasia gets into the act... Why the hell? A camera over a person who has lost all? To linger over this? A short story is very different from a feature length film. What works in the one does not necessarily work in the other. It needs a big justification (rarely satisfied) to go over 1.5 hrs. The film simply took an arbitrarily unnecessary direction from the millions of possibilities available after that foul attack. The issues of redemption, triumph, ambition, struggle, outsider, luck, talent, fate all could have been better and more satisfyingly handled in other ways in the last third.<br/><br/>OK, to be brief, what do I want? I want that she wins the fight and this be made clear, as was realistic, maybe loses a leg in the ensuing trauma, but recovers from the coma and there be a sense of triumph to compensate for the loss of her youthful athleticism and the ""only thing she ever felt good about, boxing"". She from a trailer park had done something really big and lived to enjoy it. Why not, why tell the bleaker and hopeless story of her not getting any satisfaction from her magnificent effort and spirit? Oh, she did get that feeling? If you believe that, you would believe almost anything. Imagine the bitter pill of paralysis not overwhelming such a feeling. Eastwood owed it to the human spirit to give her better. I am sorry, I can't help feeling he killed her off so awfully to self-indulge and give vent to an one man's guilt and despair and sense of bleakness...<br/><br/>Unless there is some compelling reason otherwise (and do not suppose that the actual film is the compelling reason), some hope, some satisfaction, not just a withering trailing off into despair and failure. Don't know about you folks, but I was bitterly disappointed at the thought of a gem slipping from my grasp (Unforgiven is not exactly a happy ending, but it was not a downer.) How could I sit and enjoy Million Dollar Baby thoroughly right through over and over? I won't be able to. I beg Eastwood to rewrite and shorten the last third for me (and to do a bit more editing before while at it).

","""Million Dollar Baby"" is ""Rocky"" knockoff that can't quite get it right. In this case, the problem isn't (as usual) that there is no real characterization (""Rocky""'s greatest strength), but that the film is simply too long. I don't mean no film should be two and a half hours--but ""Million Dollar Baby"" feels stretched to that length.<br/><br/>Where a simple Cinderella story may be overdone, following it up with a moral-ethical tragedy and a tragic loss of the only thing that makes life worth living may be stretching the bounds of film storytelling. Just when everything seems heading to a conclusion in her title fight, Maggie Doyle loses everything she's fought for and not only do we have to see that, but we have to see her want to fight her way out of life and Frankie Dunn's struggle with whether to help her as she asks. Along the way, we also have to deal with the subplots of Danger Barch, a developmentally disabled kid who spends his time ""training"" at Frankie's gym, and Frankie's strained relationship with his daughter. All of these plots are simply too much for a film and when coupled with Eastwood's penchant for long silent shots in the darkness to present emotion turns this film into something that is simply too long and dull.<br/><br/>The acting is why this film has garnered so much Oscar attention and I expect will win best picture, director, actress, and supporting actor. Clint Eastwood, a master of choosing roles to hide his complete lack of talent, tries to carry too much on his back and his performance pales by comparison to the ""Rocky"" performance of the wonderfully talented and charismatic Burgess Meredith to the point that perhaps his career-best performance seems an utter disappointment. Meanwhile, the always-excellent Hilary Swank performs admirably in a rather bland role--a fighter who never quits but also never seems to feel much of anything else. Probably the best of the performances really comes from Morgan Freeman, as the virtuosic actor performs perfectly again, stealing the spotlight from Eastwood and Swank while hardly doing a thing.<br/><br/>Eastwood's direction does present a beautifully chilling, dark visual and a stark sound quality that really is quite clever and excellent. He doesn't seem to want to force anything on us with his camera, but he's definitely creating a vision and this direction truly is excellent and worthy of its Oscar contention (though I would not say worthy of its probable win).<br/><br/>All in all, ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a sentimental cry-fest with wonderful acting and beautiful direction that is simply overly boring and long. If you want to cry and you don't get bored easily, it's worth a watch. But it's not what you want if you're looking for any real action and that's what holds it back from being the masterpiece so many have claimed it to be, in my opinion. It's probably a love or hate affair for the most part, but I appreciated some elements enough that I can't hate it despite its glaring flaws."

Suicide is a frequent and temporary state of mind for most of us at times. And the loss of the leg while dramatic and painful, whoopee, she had already lost her whole body. But she still had a great mind and spirit. I thought the going to college idea was what Maggie would want to do. Maggie, the original, the boxer, would have gone on to further greatness in her own way. Quadreplegia may be rotten, but dead is dead! Having lost a few loved ones to natural and self inflicted causes, I can say unequivocally there is a big difference. The suicide didn't fit Maggie's earlier ""never say die"" attitude.

Well, of course, the young spunky gal proves herself and they go on together to fight a championship bout... but then things take a darker turn. A very powerful movie... with great performances by Eastwood, Swank and, as usual, Morgan Freeman. Some of the other performances are a little off-putting. The redneck parents of Swank's character are played a little too broad (especially the clichéd ex-con husband covered in tattoos). The slow-witted kid who hangs around the gym serves no purpose. And the priest that Eastwood talks to after mass every day... well, he's kind of a jerk, isn't he? He started out as an interesting character... but when called upon for compassion or insight towards the end he doesn't seem to have much to offer.

","When I first heard the title of this film, ""Million Dollar Baby,"" I supposed it was a teen-age film. It's not. We knew, without question, that Hillary Swank would convince Clint Eastwood to manage her boxing career and we saw that her first fights were won almost instantly. At this point it was clear that there'd either be a sharp reversal of her good fortune, or in teen-age movie fashion this film would have everything fall into place and nothing significant would occur.<br/><br/>But, as she rapidly rose to the champion position she was mistreated by an opponent and everything changed. Eastwood, Swank and Freeman did an excellent acting job but the script was far too positive the first half of the film and far too negative the second half. Her decline was so lengthy and gory that the movie becomes boring and demands a conclusion. Eastwood should have shortened it by cutting Swank's house-buying scene and all the scenes that included her relatives. Also, although the make-up was excellent, both during the fights and during Swanks hospitalization, all of these gory scenes should have been reduced in length.<br/><br/>This film is worth watching but who's going to watch it again?"
"SillyPuddy","Null","0","2","12 February 2005"," Disappointing, Disturbing, and Frustrating
","Its hard to put in words how agitated this film made me feel. Up until the title fight, the film had so much momentum and promise. Then it cheated and succumbed to a tired, worn out movie cliché where the hero turns his/her back in the ring and the angry antagonist retaliates after the bell rings. Frankie has his head in the clouds and doesn't seem to be paying attention to what unfolds. Hello! The Blue Bear is only the dirtiest fighter on the planet. He never really tells Maggie about the danger she is in being in the ring with such a monster. You'd think he would be a bit on edge. After all his preaching to Maggie about always protecting herself, the scene just doesn't ring true. A cheap shot indeed! I thought Freeman was the best part of the movie and the glue that held it together. The writing was first rate and so was the acting. The ending was a pleasant surprise and a nice payoff. Still doesn't make up for the cheat though. After that, it became one of the hardest films I've ever had to watch. Almost unbearable."

Some of the dialogue is painfully unfunny when it tries to be. The voice-over is overused and tells the viewer what to think. The story of overcoming personal difficulties to become a boxing champ is almost identical to that of the Rocky films, there's even a Rocky style montage sequence. Worst of all was the ending, which was completely unnecessary and badly done.<br/><br/>The rest of Million Dollar Baby was pretty good however.

","Million Dollar Baby had some strong emotional moments but it was still too Hollywood for my tastes.

The fact that Swank's character did, made her performance the best thing about the movie for me.<br/><br/>Believability issues I had a problem with: <br/><br/>Could we really expect anyone to be able to entertain themselves by punching a bag repeatedly for 12 or more hours a day as Swank's character does for the first half of the movie? And where would she find the energy to do this as well as take a long run along the beach every morning and hold a job as a waitress, all the time living on food scraps from the tables? <br/><br/>Could we really expect anyone to repeatedly send numerous (thick) letters to someone who never responds as Frank does to his estranged daughter?<br/><br/>Could we really expect Frank's priest not to inform the cops after he does what he does?

","The plot, in case you don't know or are too lazy to read the summary above, is about Maggie (Swank), a thirty-something waitress from a ""white trash"" background who strives against all odds to become a boxer. Her trainer is Frankie Dunn (Eastwood), a cranky old man with a guilty conscience and an unwillingness to take risks. Frankie is initially unwilling to train Maggie, but after she persists, he gives in, and the boxing movie commences, from the training sequences to the matches.<br/><br/>Eastwood is a great director and the three leads (Eastwood, Swank, and Freeman) are wonderful. That cannot be disputed, at least not with a logical argument. Million Dollar Baby is wonderfully filmed (particularly the boxing scenes), and there were a few times when I honestly couldn't take my eyes off the screen. However, it is, in my opinion, not one of the best of 2004, let alone of the best of all time.<br/><br/>The main problem, I guess (at least from my jaded point of view), is that the characters never seem real. ""Real characters"" are necessary for a movie that strives for an emotional impact via the road of gritty realism, and rarely during Million Dollar Baby did I ever feel that Frankie and Maggie were anything more than movie characters (<---something that I can't say about the characters in Sideways, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, or Eastwood's Mystic River). Eastwood and Freeman give great performances, and Swank truly is Oscar-worthy, but their characters' back-stories and lines of dialogue are so obviously doctored, calculated to create maximum tragic potential. If it wasn't handled so well by Eastwood, I probably wouldn't have taken it seriously at all.<br/><br/>This is a movie that goes for the heart rather than the head. Romantic simplicity takes the place of realism, so if you're less hardened than I, you'll probably find it more affecting. Though it's not particularly clever (even with its special twist, which is not as daring or original as you've undoubtedly heard), but its so well acted and directed that its impossible not to feel happy for Maggie when she succeeds or sorry for Maggie when...well, see the movie.<br/><br/>SPOILERS...MY TAKE ON THE TWIST BELOW...SPOILERS. SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS The twist is...........Maggie gets cheapshotted in a fight and ends up paralyzed. The last half hour of the movie is Eastwood and Swank dealing with her paralysis. Yes, this is daring in that it doesn't go for a typical Hollywood happy ending, but may I remind you that there is still such a thing as a Hollywood sad ending. Instead of being a clichéd underdog triumph story, Million Dollar Baby is a traditional tearjerker in the vein of Love Story or Terms of Endearment.<br/><br/>Final take: See it. Its a good movie with some Oscar worthy acting, but it definitely doesn't deserve a Best Picture statue. 8 out of 10."

Evidently not content to run the emotional gamut from ""Make my day"" to ""Go ahead, make my day,"" director-producer-star Clint Eastwood also insisted on writing the sappy Mahleresque soundtrack, which swells with shrink-wrapped emotion even as it sends classical music fans into the lobby for more Jujubes. I fully expected a live tuxedoed violinist to appear, spotlighted, on one of the auditorium balconies to accompany the score as our paraplegic amputee of a heroine lapses into her final coma.

"bzb2001","7","0","2","4 February 2005"," I enjoyed Clint Eastwood's fable, but had some reservations
","Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"" is a film not so much about boxing but one about a boxer. Hilary Swank plays Maggie, an inept fighter with a lot of heart and ambition, but her gender leaves her at a training disadvantage. This fact is most true with Frankie, played with a crusty soulful mourn by director Clint Eastwood. He will not train a girl, never has and never will. The movie never makes it completely clear why Maggie has chosen Frankie, but that seems beside the point.<br/><br/>There is a lot of boxing in ""Million Dollar Baby."" More so than in ""Girlfight,"" ""Raging Bull,"" or possibly even the ""Rocky"" films. I have never been a boxing fan and did not start while viewing this film. Though the sport disinterests me, the rise of Maggie's abilities struck as impressive. She comes from a small town but travels to Frankie's gym to strike it big.<br/><br/>Frankie, an ex-fighter much closer to the end of his training career than the beginning, cannot bring himself to take a stab at a high-profile duel even with his most talented fighter. When he leaves Frankie for greener pastures, Frankie decides then to take on the girl who cannot hit the punching bag correctly and doesn't have enough money to spend on a speed bag.<br/><br/>The film's narration is threaded by the great, vital voice of Morgan Freeman, who helps out and lives in Frankie's gym. It is he, an ex-boxer as well, who first sees Maggie's raw talent and heart. That is the stem to this flower, how it blooms is up to the viewer to experience on their own unmolested by the words on this page.<br/><br/>. The almost unanimous love ""Million Dollar Baby"" has appreciated from critics leaves me wondering a few things. Paul Haggis' script follows many of the same routes accessed by films of the past. Frankie and Maggie's relationship follows a well documented formula; Freeman's narration is well sounding but its service as a crutch to move the story along is apparent early on; the film's final third, which houses its most brilliant scenes, ignores the stories it nourished before. Freeman all but disappears and an odd sub-plot involving a scrawny boxer in Frankie's gym is underdeveloped and is never as satisfying as the filmmakers wish.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, especially noting Hilary Swank who has reprised her role as an actress who shines after appearing from nowhere. She gained this accolade after winning an Oscar for her heart-breaking role in ""Boys Don't Cry."" Clint Eastwood has improved with age and abandons much of his stoic image that has aided him in the past. Morgan Freeman is fine, but his role isn't as fleshed out as I would like and we have seen him much better in the past, including his previous pairing with Eastwood in ""Unforgiven.""<br/><br/>I seem apologetic to inform the reader that I liked Eastwood's film but did not love it. After all of the awards and critical acclaim, I cannot honestly jump up and down for ""M$B,"" as some have lovingly nicknamed it. My happiest moment was falling back in love with Hilary Swank, taking on another role not for the standard pretty Hollywood actress. Let us pray she never becomes one. *** out of ****"

","The first part of the movie seems like a corny rehash of cliché stuff about boxing. The Clint Eastwood character is a burned-out relic of a manager, and the Hilary Swank character is a 31-year-old boxing buff who has one last chance to make it. So she wins him over blah blah blah.<br/><br/>If that were all there was to the movie, it would be a small-screen time-waster, and you had to wonder what all the buzz was about -- there _is_ buzz, Academy Awards for lots of categories -- because it was basically Eastwood being dark and contained and Swank being goshwow and bubbly. But then over it all was Morgan Freeman, as a Watson-type viewpoint character, doing a voice-over with that incredible rasping voice. He can say more with a moment of silence than some actors can do with a page of Shakespeare.<br/><br/>There's also (to me) the cognitive dissonance of watching pretty girls beat the crap out of eat other for money. I didn't even know women did prize-fighting.<br/><br/>I don't want to reveal the movie's ""surprise"" ending, though it's not so much a surprise as a paradigm shift. A fair comparison would be last year's _Seabiscuit_: a sports movie that seems to follow the classic mold, and then turns modern-to-postmodern on you. I found it pretty satisfying, and through the movie's final twists and turns, you feel the tight control Eastwood had, as director-producer and extremely restrained actor. (He also wrote the score, which is good.)<br/><br/>Maybe it's not a feel-good movie. Maybe it depends on what makes you feel good."

"JimD73","9","0","2","2 February 2005"," MDB is a great movie, but is it Oscar worthy? Maybe. *Some Spoilers*
","Million Dollar Baby (2004) I realized after the Academy Awards were announced that I hadn't seen a single one of the Best Picture noms. Granted, Ray and The Aviator were the only ones that ever played at my theatre and I almost say both of them, but never did. When Million Dollar Baby came out in a late release here, I said ""Why the hell not."" I didn't go all January, this and Hide & Seek on the weekend would help make up for it. This was probably the one I would have liked to see the most afterall, besides maybe Sideways. Why? It has the same director as my personal choice for last year, Mystic River. Not to mention it is on a million critic's lists. So is this really the contender for the Oscar, or is it just Rocky with Swank instead of Stallone? Note that there are some mild spoilers in the Plot and Entertainment sections, but nothing I would fret about.<br/><br/>Plot: 22/25: Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) is a boxing trainer who has taught many boxers how to get to the top, only to be thrown aside once they get a shot at the title. He does his work at the gym belonging to his old friend, half-blind ex-boxer Eddie 'Scrap-Iron' Dupris (Freeman). When trashy Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank) asks for him to train her, he initially says no because he doesn't train girls. When she starts training at Eddie's gym constantly, he eventually caves and says he'll train her, but won't manage her. Skip along a little, Frankie, of course, becomes her trainer/manager. She has become an excellent fighter, knocking out most competitors in the first round. But when she gets her shot at the title, something happens that shifts the entire mood of the movie.<br/><br/>Essentially, this is two different movies in one. The first half is the very entertaining and surprisingly funny training part, while the second half, which I will not reveal at all, is the half that is nominated for the Academy Award. There are some problems, though. The plot seems a little stretched, having many worthless scenes that don't accomplish anything but make the film 2 hours and 17 minutes. There is also a big loose end involving Frankie's daughter that is never even close to tied up. In all, the plot is good. If you don't like one half, you'll probably like the other.<br/><br/>Boxing Action: 21/25: While there aren't any fights that quite match Rocky vs. Apollo Creed in the first Rocky, we do get treated to many more than Rocky ever gave us. Granted, most are very short, as Maggie has, like I said before, a tendency towards finishing in one round. All the fights are entertaining, often funny, so if you want a boxing movie, while this isn't really about the boxing, I still recommend it for you.<br/><br/>Acting: 25/25: The acting for this has been getting a lot of accolades, so I had high expectations, especially since the three leads all had Oscar noms. Eastwood (Dirty Harry) and Freeman (The Shawshank Redemption) are both very good in their roles, though, to be honest, it wasn't too much of stretch for them. The roles they played were similar to others they've had. Swank (Boy's Don't Cry), on the other hand, is extremely good here, and out of the noms for Best Actress, I am rooting for her to take the gold for a second time. The rest of the cast is well suited, and as I have no complaints, I'll give it a perfect score here.<br/><br/>Entertainment: 20/25: As I stated before, this movie changes halfway. The first half is very entertaining to just about anyone, for the most part, but the second half drags a little bit, with some scenes that seem unnecessary, as I stated in the Plot section. The whole boxing theme may throw off some more mainstream moviegoers and actually divert more serious moviegoers from seeing it.<br/><br/>Total: 88%: Million Dollar Baby is a great movie. Is it Oscar worthy? Maybe. Is it better than Rocky? Hard to say. Is it an easy recommendation? Yes. This a movie I can recommend to anyone who likes boxing, anyone who likes dramas, and almost everyone else too. It carries on here and there, running about 20 minutes longer than it should have and carries a couple loose ends, but it ultimately leaves you thinking about it the day after."
"schappe1","Null","0","3","31 January 2005"," Issues and SPOILERS
","I'm not sure why everyone is so worried about a spoiler for this picture. I've heard it compared to ""The Crying Game"" and ""The Sixth Sense"" in terms of the necessity of keeping a secret. Actually the sudden shift in this story is not that kind of shocker. It's just a dramatic turning point that would have the same effect even if someone knew it was going to happen. It's more like the knowledge that Hillary Swank was a woman playing a man in ""Boy's Don't Cry"". It's just part of the story. If it had happened earlier, everybody would be talking about it as that was what the movie was about.<br/><br/>I bring it up here because I've read that the National Spinal Cord Injury Association has claimed that Clint Eastwood made this film as a ""vendetta against disabled people"" in response to a 1997 lawsuit by a woman who sued him 8 years ago for the lack of handicapped access in a rest room of a building he owned. This is obviously ridiculous, as Eastwood didn't write this story and he doesn't make movies as vendetta against law suit claimants. It always distresses me when advocacy groups that have a legitimate cause invent controversies to call attention to themselves when there are real problems that need such light shed on them and innocent people get condemned by their actions.<br/><br/>In this film the deterioration of Swank's paralyzed character seems accelerated for dramatic effect, (it took Chris Reeve nearly a decade to die of the same thing), and to justify Eastwood's actions. I find judging people in such circumstances difficult. It's like announcing what you would do if the last lifeboat on the Titanic had one seat left. You just don't know because you've not been in that situation. It certainly seems to me that wanting to continue under such circumstances is, in the end, a private decision, rather than a public one.<br/><br/>I think a greater, unspoken issue with the film is the need to have a white protagonist in a sport dominated by blacks and Hispanics. Of course, the action we see could certainly have taken place but some of the scenes where Swank, as a sort of female Marciano, batters black and Hispanic rivals brought back ugly memories of sitting in a theater with a bunch of raucous white males rooting for Rocky to beat ""Clubber"" Lang, something their real hero, Gerry Cooney, could not do to Larry Holmes, (in a closed circuit broadcast I attended shortly before that). It's not as blatant an attempt to pander to the larger white audience as that but it brought back those memories. Just as Rocky III was made ""OK"" because Apollo Creed had befriended Rocky, the fact that Swank is white and most of these opponents, (and the cocky jerk in the gym), are black is supposed to be leavened by the presence of Morgan Freeman as the hero's and heroine's friend.<br/><br/>Like other things in the movie, it's contrivance. All of the protagonists in this film are totally sympathetic. Various elements are injected into the story to make us feel for them. Eastwood's daughter doesn't like him for reasons which are not made clear. Swank's family seems to have arrived on a sight-seeing trip from ""Boys Don't Cry"", (which, aside from Swank's amazing performance is probably the most singularly unpleasant film ever made). Freeman, for the umpteenth time since ""Glory"", is the moral center of everyone's universe. They are agreeable people played by some of our finest actors but if this film were a fight, it would be considered ""fixed"".<br/><br/>Still, it's well done for what it is. Several members of the audience in the theater I was in broke out crying, so it had its intended effect. Tear-jerkers, which is what this film becomes, are not my favorite genre. If they don't work, they seem appalling maudlin and silly. If they do, they take me places I don't necessarily want to go.<br/><br/>My vote for the best film of the year goes to ""The Aviator"". The best fight film ever is still ""The Set Up"". And as for female boxing movies, I'll still take ""Girlfight"", a much less pretentious film that is simply a character study of a troubled young girl who finds herself in the boxing ring."

","Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank are both excellent (and deserving of their Oscar nominations) in Million Dollar Baby, a great sports movie that will be mentioned for decades to come when sportswriters make their annual lists of the best movies to see. Eastwood plays Frankie Dunn, a boxing trainer who doesn't like taking chances until he hooks up with Maggie Fitzgerald (Swank) an untrained waitress with a killer punch. Morgan Freeman, to a certain extent, reprises his role in The Shawshank Redemption by narrating the movie in a letter written to Dunn's daughter. Freeman is such a natural at this, however, that it enhances this film just as much as it did Shawshank. I guess once a decade isn't overkill. Eastwood directs a movie that looks to be going in a much different direction that it ends up going in, as excruciating decisions are left to be made by Frankie after an injury leaves Maggie paralyzed. Where I thought we were about to see Rocky VI, Million Dollar Baby becomes a throat-catcher in its third act, as we see classic tough-guy Eastwood ripped to shreds by his surrogate daughter. This scenario has been played before, but Eastwood and Swank put a whole new touch to it, and it turns Million Dollar Baby into one of the best of 2004."

Frankie (Clint Eastwood) is having bad troubled relations with his daughter who never opens any of the letters he sends. AND YET the cause of the bad relationship is never explained. IT JUST IS. I thought that they might go into his psyche as to why he feels the way he does but the movie never really develops this.<br/><br/>Second.

WTF. In real life, she would have been disqualified because the bell ALREADY RANG before the punch was thrown. Maggie would be declared the champ, even though, she could never defend it. But instead she loses.<br/><br/>Third. Maggie decides she wants to die by way of Euthanasia. It is to be a ""peaceful death"". Okay, so first Frankie takes off her mask. She can't even breath without it, wouldn't it cause her to sputter, choke and die first. But instead she is happy. So he then pulls the plug, which would have caused all her body organs to die. And then, sticks the needle in her arm killing her. Seems like they should've got it the other way around. They should have stuck the needle in her and let her die, before unplugging the machine and pulling off the mask.<br/><br/>Oh and Morgan Freeman is a dummy in this movie. He doesn't do much in the way of plot. He explains to the audience in these fancy montages that Maggie just keeps getting better. It would be nice to actually SEE her getting better instead of this quick change from waitress to champion.<br/><br/>And then we're supposed to cry when she dies.

","Eastwood had me hooked until the spinal cord injury. After that, I really did not care about any of the characters, because the movie had turned into a melodramatic cartoon, not a real-life study. Great art always has this quality: you forget you are watching art because you are so absorbed in the experience. And the experience of great art keeps you absorbed, because it rings true - it feels like something real and deep unfolding.<br/><br/>Like ""Green Fried Tomatoes"" this drama-turned-tear-jerker throws in gratuitous illness or death which comes off feeling false. What's the point at the end, anyhow? As far as I can see, the issue of the morality of euthanasia is secondary. From a dramatic point of view, we want to see how people grow and relate, why they care about each other, and how they resolve their difficulties. Eastwood's character is the old ""tough guy with a heart of gold"". If someone's been hurt that long, or has such a struggle with his faith, what exactly do we learn from watching him extinguish his little spark of budding love? I do not find his inner darkness compelling at all - there has not been enough love and light shed on it to even care, much less see what's hiding in the corners.<br/><br/>The woman fighter also rings false. Someone that cute and peppy has no friends? No life? No hospital visitors after thousands are chanting her name? Even if she were an obsessed boxer, anyone that isolated would be a lot weirder, not nearly so attractive a personality. (This is not a criticism of Swank, who is absolutely superb, but of the whole story setup) And quadriplegia? There are 10,000 spinal injuries in the US every year. Half are quads. Most are from MVA's and gunshots. Only 9% are from sports, and 2/3 of those are diving injuries. The rest are mostly from skiing and football/rugby. The likelihood of our heroine getting a C1 on C2 from a car crash is about 500 times higher than from getting the injury in the ring. It just rings false and contrived, like an astronaut being hit on the launch pad by a meteorite.<br/><br/>In sum, this strikes me as an interesting character study, that ends by drowning everyone we care about in the bathtub. If I want to be depressed and learn that life stinks, cheaters and crooks win, nice guys lose, you lose or kill everything you love, and faith is no help, I'll go back and re-read Tess of the D'Urbervilles.

I guess the only complaint I would have about this movie is the slow start to it, but I guess this kind of movie needs a slow start. Once the movie started to pick up, it just got incredible! I love movies that in which you never know where exactly it is going. I would definitely agree with those who have told me that this movie looks like you know what it's going to turn into, a movie about a someone coaching a real contender to being the champ, but completely turns out differently. I don't want to ruin the ending to anyone who hasn't seen this movie and is planning to see but, but I'm going to forewarn... BE PREPARED! If you are a classic Clint Eastwood fan, GO SEE THIS MOVIE! If you're not... SEE IT ANYWAY!"

","I was close to giving up going to the movies this year, because I was so tired of being disappointed, bored, and disgusted by the poor films that the movie-going public is asked to accept as entertainment these days. ""Million Dollar Baby"" reminded me of how movies could be much more than just special effects, and cobbled-together screenplays that we've all seen before. Hillary Swank, Morgan Freeman, and Clint Eastwood are tremendously affecting; the movie is about a lot more than just boxing - I think it was an excellent film. Go see it now - it's a movie made the way movies should be made - with brains, heart, and class."

","this is by far the best movie that i have ever seen it leaves you at the edge of the seat. the ending leaves you in awe because it is something that Clint Eastwood always does in his movies. This is the first movie i saw in 2005 and i don't think that any other movie will be better that this movie is. i love the movie because it is about female boxing and that i one thing that i have always wanted to do. I love how Clint Eastwood directed the movie. Million Dollar Baby really lives up to the name i would give it a million thumbs up. I think that this movie should sweep all the awards and i think that everyone should see this movie it will keep you thinking."

","After reading a few reviews on both sides, I decided to go because the award nominations have been numerous and The Aviator is another erroneous overrated Scorcese biopic starring DiCaprio (and Gangs of NY was overrated as well). But anyway, I really enjoyed this film. You ultimately believed the stories and characters, the mood and pace were genuine, and there were 3 or 4 scenes that were really top-notch. And the studio mostly kept their hands off the movie, including the finish.<br/><br/>Despite the genuine heart and reality of the movie, it did have it's flaws. The lighting was unrealistic and frustrating to a point. The dialog was cheap and easy. The characters were never introduced beyond superficial archetypes. They should have had more ""everyday"" situations to show we weren't in some fantasy-land - which appeared to be both in the 1960's South as well as modern L.A. - and fewer scenes of Bad-Guy Set-up.<br/><br/>The fairly crowded house for an Art-House theater on a Wednesday night clapped, cried overtly, and mostly stayed talking until the credits were finished. I'd take Finding Neverland as best picture, but Million Dollar Baby is quite close. Bravo to Eastwood for his current directing skills and for his entire varied career."
"coatguy","Null","0","1","19 January 2005"," outstanding movie..great acting and cinematography
","I'm looking for answer to the following questions??? Did she win the final fight when the champ could not get up for the count?? or did the champ get up and then hit her after the bell rang which caused her to hit her head on the chair which should have disqualified her and given the fight to Swank??? I saw the championship belt on a shelf in Clint's office when they panned the empty room at the end of the film. Did any one else see it?? Also did any one see Clint's face in the window of the diner at the very last scene of the movie??? Appreciate any help to these questions? In any case it was an exceptional movie...I thought his use of close-up images (where a single face envelopes the whole screen) was great..It made me feel like I was right next to the person talking. The lack of brightness thought-out the movie lent a great feeling of shabbiness to the film which I thought fit in with the grubbiness the director was creating..."
