","If you want a good movie about Henry VIII and Anne Bolyen, rent Anne of the Thousand Days. That was a film that used history to tell a story about real people who had a love to change a nation. <br/><br/>In this version of the eponymous Phillipa Gregory novel, historical inaccuracies abound. Approximately fifteen years are compressed into two hours with no indication time has gone by except for various babies. None of the characters ever change or grow any older. The characters in this movie are completely one-sided. Anne is ambitious. Henry is a womanizer. Mary is simple. No one has any complexities. The sisterly rivalry plays out like an underdeveloped soap opera. <br/><br/>On the other hand, the film is engaging and the costumes lovely. Same with the gorgeous palace settings. <br/><br/>Eye candy it is. Truthful or realistic it isn't."
"venessalewis","3","172","219","29 February 2008"," Outrageously Inaccurate
","The ""Other Boleyn Girl"" hit theaters today, and of course, I was in for the first showing. I've been anticipating this movie for over 2 years now, ever since I first heard it was in production. <br/><br/>Why can't directors seem to get it right when it comes to this time period?I understand completely the Hollywood concept of ""dramatic"" flair for the big screen. But there is a difference between ""dramatic flair"" and complete revisionist history. This movie makes the HBO series, ""The Tudors"" seem like a BBC documentary as far as factual information is concerned.<br/><br/>Now, the director is not all to blame. Phillippa Gregory does a damn good job of distorting the truth in this alternate interpretation of the story of Anne Boleyn. Her portrayal of Anne as ruthlessly ambitious and downright devilish is at odds with the softer portrayals favored by Jean Plaidy and other authors of this period. Anne's own diaries would suggest her true personality to be more of the unwilling victim and royal pawn in the schemes cooked up by her ambitious male relatives. Only when she discovered that her path in life would be to submit or face death or exile does she succumb to Henry's advances. <br/><br/>The opening scenes of the movie concern how Anne and Henry met. Well, there is debate on this, the movie selects Hever. I'll allow that. But this first it was most certainly not in front of the whole court and followed by a hunt in which Henry takes a tumble, to be nursed back to health by Mary, Anne's OLDER sister (the movie and book portrays her as the younger sister-this is false). Anne's ambitions are apparent from this very day, she indeed seems to find her father and uncle's schemes appealing and agrees to ""hunt"" his majesty. Hardly the case in reality. Anne was in love with and betrothed to Henry Percy at the time of her first meeting with Henry. The movie has it backwards. She does not ""settle"" for Percy only after Mary has ""stolen"" Henry. Another extremely annoying point of order here.Cardinal Wolsey is completely absent from this film. This is such a blaring error as to render the movie completely abominable. Wolsey is such a force in the entire drama, from the arrangement of the marriage AND the divorce, to all matters of state and religion in betweento leave him out is both amateur and foolish, not to mention a missed opportunity for much needed plot thickening.<br/><br/>Running through the laundry list of other inaccuracies.Anne was not EXILED to France because she fumbled her attempt to seduce Henry. This is utterly ridiculous. It is well known that both Anne and Mary practically grew up in the French court from the time they were 12 to their late teens. Only then did the sisters join the English court, much less begin their dramas with the king. And she was not brought back to entertain Henry whilst Mary lay in with his child. AgainAnne most strongly wanted to marry her first love, Henry Percy, Duke of Northumberland. But once Henry had set his eyes upon her and chose to make her his own, then and only then were her uncle and father's schemes put into motion. Their original intentions were to milk the long-going affair of her sister Mary for all it was worth.<br/><br/>Now, as for the ""incest"" theory. Gregory is taking a huge risk here by suggesting that the allegation levied upon Anne and her brother George was indeed founded in truth, borne out of Anne's desperation to get with child after her miscarriage. I do believe Anne was desperate to get pregnant quickly, and she was very close to her brotherbut this is a huge leap, and one true historians would never make. It also suggest that something other than Henry's brute desires were at play here when he charged them with treason, which is not the case. He simply wanted to be rid of Anne, to beget a male heir off of his next mistress.<br/><br/>And good graciouswhat of the rape scene? Not only is this disturbing, but so far fetched. Although Anne resisted for years, when she finally gave in to Henry, she did believe herself to be in love with himor at the very least, resigned to accept her fate. And Henry was completely besotted with her.why else would he break from Rome, Catholicism and risk his kingdom for anything less? No, he would not have raped Anne for their first sexual encounter. He was a brute, but he was most concerned of his image of the romantic courtier when it came to women's affections.<br/><br/>Finally, a note on the characters. Portman does an acceptable job portraying the character from the bookeven though this character is not the true Anne Boleyn. Johannson makes a lovely Maryand probably quite close to the real woman. As for Banaa sore disappointment. Bad casting, bad acting. Is this the same Bana of the acclaimed Munich and Troy? Where was the range? He comes across as flat and not well studied. Jonathon Rhys Meyers of the HBO Tudors blows him out of the water on all levels.sensuality, intensity and evil as Henry the 8th.<br/><br/>Why can't I just watch these movies and leave feeling entertained? I don't quite knowI care too much about 15th century England for some reason. It became hardwired in me after watching Anne of the Thousand Days as a young girl. No Tudor movie since then has gotten close in accuracy or sheer entertainment since then. Burton and Bujold are classic and untouchable. But after watching this hack job, I have to say I am looking forward to the new season of the Tudors on HBO."
"divadrummer","7","112","145","16 March 2008"," Sometimes the Truth is Stranger Than Fiction
","A quick glimpse at the Tudor family line on Wikipedia will yield hundreds of years of made-for-movie material, but none quite as compelling as the story of Anne Boleyn. Pair a classic story with airy language, beautiful sets and costumes, and some A-list names and you have Oscar magic in the making. Right? Well, not always. We've seen it before and we're not necessarily impressed with royalty anymore. The Other Boleyn Girl offers new perspectives and dramatic angles on the saga of wives that is Henry VIII's legacy, but nearly drowns in melodrama.<br/><br/>And it's not entirely the movie's fault. Boleyn Girl follows the story of both Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary (Scarlett Johansson) Boleyn and their relationship with the English court. King Henry VIII (Eric Bana) has trouble producing a male heir, so the Boleyn family offers their daughter Anne to bed. When Henry has a hunting accident due to Anne's carelessness, he is nursed and subsequently charmed by innocent Mary. But Mary is already married, so the King promotes her husband and sends the couple to court where he can meet with Mary whenever he pleases. Mary falls in love with Henry and becomes his mistress. Anne, the elder sister, is scorned by what she believes is her sister's ultimate betrayal, and plots revenge. The two continue on in these roles for some time, swapping places in bed with Henry and spurting out babies while their relatives egg them on. This isn't quite how things went down in reality, but the changes are minor and seem necessary to condense the timeline and create at least one sympathetic character.<br/><br/>The Other Boleyn Girl fares best when it's exploring the relationship between Anne and Mary. This isn't the first story of sister rivalry, but the dynamic between Anne and Mary is extraordinarily well-played. Their previous roles and their public images make Portman and Johansson perfect fits. We believe Portman to be intelligent and coy, and Johansson to be naive and desired. More - we believe these roles might be easily reversed. As sisters, their relationship is deeply disturbing: they love each other, they hate each other, they're unable to escape the expectations placed upon them by their family. As an older sister (with an admittedly not-as-screwed-up relationship), I found this portrayal very realistic - rich with emotion and complex meaning.<br/><br/>I wish I could say the rest of the movie was as artful. There's constant allusion and foreshadowing to the Boleyn demise through use of visual and editing metaphors. If some details were twisted, other details might have been cut out - too many tear-filled scenes means that this eventually feels like a soap opera. At one point in the movie, Anne is sent off to France and comes back wearing a very distracting ""B"" charm, which she sports until the end of the movie. When I finally finished inventing what else ""B"" might stand for (besides Boleyn, there are plenty of other fits), I wondered about Anne's character. She's now praised as being changed and thus back in play, but I don't see it - she was smart and ambitious before, and only gained a bit of wit during her trip to France - certainly not the drastic change everyone seemed to be making it out to be. There are some very poorly done scenes where supporting cast spell out the politics of the situation for you. This is a little condescending and probably unnecessary, if not repetitive. The costumes are beautiful, but the matching dresses become unbelievable and even plain in places. PETA must have a field day with this movie and its use of fur and meat. You won't get to see Scarlett Johansson naked in this movie, in case you were wondering - just lots of fuzzy sex montages, weirdly full of backlit hair and fur. Katherine of Aragon (Henry VIII's first wife) is given some of the most powerful lines in the movie, but they're delivered with such woodenness that my disappointment must be made known.<br/><br/>The Other Boleyn Girl could be so much more. As a hyper-dramatic costume flick, it does stand out. There's more than meets your eye, and the costarring performances are not to be missed. There's a lot of material to cover in this story, but a simplified script would have helped keep this film farther away from melodrama. Especially with a true story as wild as this, there's not a lot that needs to be changed or added to grip the viewer. Any embellishments verge on destroying believability and creating situations we can't relate to."
"YoSafBridge","5","18","22","3 March 2008"," Mary is forever doomed to be ""The Other Boelyn Girl""
","All and all, not a particularly enjoyable film.<br/><br/>This movie sacrifices all that was interesting about the novel in the first place just to squeeze in all the historical aspects. All of the page turning scenes in the book that would have been interesting to see translated to screen (Anne's bloodstained dress, the deformed child, the courtship between Mary and William) were cut.<br/><br/>Fortuanatly, I expected that. With such a long book, I had to expect most of my favourite scenes were going to get the axe.<br/><br/>What I didn't expect was for the narration to change from that of Mary (aka. ""The Other Boelyn Girl"" for which the book was named) to yet another story about Anne Boelyn. The film started off well, if rather slow, with the story being told from Mary, but it quickly changes gears as the audience is suddenly following Anne's courtship of Henry and Anne's trials, emotions and desperation. Mary is quickly delegated to little more then a secondary role, with many key moments happening while she isn't on screen.<br/><br/>The story of Anne was told well, she was portrayed brilliantly by Portman, and had several fun and emotional moments. But that's just the problem, I've seen that all before. There have been dozens of films, series, and books written from Anne's point of view. If I wanted to see a story about Anne, I would have watched Anne of the Thousand Days or maybe ""The Tudors"" HBO series. What made this story special was it told the story behind Anne and Henry (and it was mostly fictional which added to the drama). <br/><br/>Unfortunately the movie ignored this, and thus failed to create the same reaction I had towards the book. <br/><br/>Another problem is that of characterisation, I expected that the movie would make the two sisters friends as it creates more drama towards the end as opposed to them being not particularly close like in the book. Same with the enormous changes they made in the personalities of the parents (and honestly, almost every character)I expected it. Many of the characters in the movie were actually more two-dimensional then the callous characters from the book. It wasn't as though this movie was badly acted or written...it was just bad.<br/><br/>The person I was most disappointed about was George (one of my favourites in the book) who was given a woefully small role, although the actor who portrayed him did it brilliantly. Also, The character of William Stafford seemed to be added in as an afterthought which confused the audience who hadn't read the book (the two main questions I heard were ""Is that the guy she married in the beginning"" or ""What happened to the guy she married in the beginning"") and left those of us who had read the book wondering why he was portrayed as such a pansy?<br/><br/>And the editing, where to begin. Horrible, the particularly poignant scenes (few and far between as they were) were not given enough time to sink in before the audience was whisked off to another scene. Even having read the source material I was lost, so I can only imagine how it must have been from those new to the story. <br/><br/>The only bright side of this tedious film were the beautiful costumes, but even the bright colours and swirly dresses couldn't distract anyone with more then a 10 second attention span and despite them the movie soon became unbearably boring.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie probably shouldn't have been made in the first place. It was apparent there was too much story to tell in two hours, it had mini-series written all over it. But seeing as it had to be made for the film industry to cash in the the books success, it could have been done a lot better."
"gazebo","7","38","51","1 March 2008"," Beautifully filmed historical film that is not historical at all!
","I went to watch this movie knowing that even though the historical figures are real, the story is basically fiction, only Philippa Gregory's version of the tragedy of Anne Boleyn. Watching this film with this attitude really helped me enjoy it rather than be upset that all the historic characters' personalities were so distorted that they were almost unrecognizable. I suggest anyone else going to see this movie adopt this attitude too.<br/><br/>Sitting back, I proceeded to enjoy the scenery, the costumes, the beautiful actresses portraying the Boleyn girls and the over the top acting.<br/><br/>It was a fun movie and it moved along quickly. Scarlet Johansson and Natalie Portman were excellent as the Boleyn sisters. Eric Bana played a very conflicted Henry VIII who is continually frustrated by not getting a male heir. Eric Bana was not very good in this movie, I'm not sure what it was, maybe it was the way how the character was written or that he was just not comfortable in the role. He was extremely miscast as King Henry.<br/><br/>The one to watch in this film is Natalie Portman who seems to have a grand time playing the evil, scheming Anne Boleyn.<br/><br/>I am pleased to see that all the women in this film, like Lady Boleyn, Anne Boleyn, Mary Boleyn and Queen Catherine of Aragon were portrayed as having strong characters and not easily pushed around. Even Mary Boleyn, who seemingly always acquiesce to the wishes of her father and uncle, decided in the end to run off and marry someone who truly loves her.<br/><br/>It's a very entertaining film. Just remember that it's only someone's version of the Tudor history, not the real history, and you won't run into trouble!"
"rebwt","6","82","119","6 March 2008"," Don't go expecting accuracy!
","Overall, the movie is entertaining. I thought the acting was good, particularly Scarlett Johansson's. The cinematography and editing leave much to be desired, and the entire movie seems rushed. If you have any knowledge of Tudor history,you will recognize the many inaccuracies, but those did not bother me as much as did the fact that important characters were omitted, undeveloped, or even seemingly forgotten (as in the case of Mary's husband, William Carey).<br/><br/>There ARE very affecting characters and scenes, but I left the theatre wishing for MORE. The fascinating lives of these people simply cannot be dealt with in a movie that lasts less than two hours."
"lavatch","Null","119","178","1 March 2008"," A Film Worth Seeing for the Issues of Gender
","The Other Boleyn Girl is a compelling film due to the exceptional performances and the splendid costumes. Additionally, there is simply a terrific story told about the relationship of Henry VIII and the two Boleyn sisters, Anne and Mary.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman (Anne) and Scarlett Johansson (Mary) are outstanding as characters engaged in both sibling rivalry and sisterly bonding. In the central relationship of the sisters, the film develops the social roles and imposed limitations on women in Tudor England.<br/><br/>One of the film's most moving character portrayals is the mother of the two Boleyn Sisters. In the heartbreaking performance of Kristin Scott Thomas, Elizabeth Boleyn can only watch helplessly as her daughters become pawns of the greedy men (Thomas Boleyn and the Duke of Norfolk), who use the young women much like pimps in order to line their pockets and further their own advancement at court. Another sterling aspect of the film is the portrayal of Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torent), another victim of the men due to the obsessive pursuit of Henry VIII to beget a male heir, leading to his momentous divorce from Katherine and England's break with the church of Rome.<br/><br/>While commentators may point out the omissions of many of the details from the novel by Philippa Gregory, the film is still true to the spirit of the book. It is also a faithful representation of the role of women in Tudor age. The film effectively presents the gender issues from the perspective of many of the remarkable women of the age along with the reminder of the greatest legacy of Anne Boleyn, which was the indirect result of her relationship of Henry VIII. That legacy was the future ruler of England...and also a woman: Elizabeth I."
"stancym-1","1","25","33","24 May 2009"," Why did they bother with a bit of accuracy at the end?
","OK, I will admit that since I am descended from Mary Boleyn,I do have a bit of family honor at stake here....<br/><br/>I knew the film was going to take liberties with historical truth, but REALLY. The Other Boleyn Girl is almost PURE FICTION from beginning to end. Why did they bother to tack on SOME accurate historical outcomes (in written sentence form) of the characters at the end, just before the credits rolled? <br/><br/>Just to name a couple of examples: Mary Boleyn was married to William Carey as depicted, and Henry took her as his mistress with Carey's approval as he was richly rewarded. Maybe emotionally conflicted approval, I don't know. I rather doubt it. Anyway, in the film Mary marries a commoner at the end. The film never explains what happened to Carey, it would seem to suggest she is committing bigamy! <br/><br/>In the closing ""write-over"", we read that Mary lived happily ever after with the lower class guy; in fact, her family coldly rejected her because she brought down their status. She suffered emotionally and financially due to the marriage, but was still glad she finally married for love. <br/><br/>Other things that are totally false: Anne and Mary did not hang out all the time as is suggested in the film; I understand that serves the plot well so maybe I will let that one go. Can't let this one go: Henry raping Anne before she surrendered to him. That is ridiculous. And Anne convincing her brother to have incest with her so as to produce an heir? That is even more ridiculous. She would never have broken the incest taboo; also, if Henry was really shunning her bed by that time, as Anne suggests in the film, then if she turned up pregnant she would be accused of adultery and sent to the Tower! <br/><br/>Speaking of being sent to the Tower, in real life Anne conducted herself with great dignity and restraint before and at her execution, likely she was trying to protect her daughter Elizabeth and better secure her daughter's future relationship with Henry. She was innocent of adultery but kept her mouth shut when she knew her fate was sealed. This is not at all how Anne is portrayed in the film. <br/><br/>Cardinal Wolsey is left out of the movie entirely, and he played a MAJOR role in the whole drama of the divorce from Catherine of Aragon and Henry's desire for Anne Boleyn. <br/><br/>I just don't see why this same type of movie could not have been made with FICTIONAL kings and queens and other characters--no authentic names. Then it would not be a particularly good movie but it would be less aggravating. Of course, it could not then claim to be based on Gregory's book about Mary Boleyn. I don't plan to read that; there are too many accurate books about Henry VIII that are no doubt more interesting, and I can read about poor Mary Boleyn in those."
"blackburnj-1","7","72","109","8 March 2008"," Satisfying and entertaining, but it promised so much more
","The Tudors are very chic at the moment. If it isn't ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"" (awful) or the television series, ""The Tudors"" (soft-pornographic trash), then it is ""The Other Boleyn Girl"", the latest film written by the Oscar nominated screenwriter, Peter Morgan. After his work on the Golden Globe winning TV film ""Longford"" and the Oscar winning (for its lead actors) ""The Queen"" and ""The Last King of Scotland"", his scripts must be in demand by actors across the globe. Little wonder then that this film attracts a stellar cast, including Eric Bana, Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman. So, why is it that this film, which is filled with great talent and potential, delivers only satisfaction? This was originally slated for release late last year, right in the middle of the awards season. Yet, for some reason, it was moved back. Why this was done is not widely known, but, as the IMDb had the film listed as completed last autumn, I should think that the decision was taken that this film would draw more attention outside of the congested awards season. Watching the film, you are aware of the ambition and lavish costumes that would draw the gaze of Oscar. But the film lacks punch, depth and the power to grip you the whole way through.<br/><br/>That's not to say that it isn't entertaining. Far from it, the film is, for an hour and a quarter, perfectly pleasant, with intrigue, scheming and romance aplenty. A lot of the credit must go to the performances, which range from accomplished to fantastically enjoyable to watch. Natalie Portman is impressive as Anne Boleyn. She ranges from scheming and nasty to genuinely sympathetic. It is her most notable work to date. Scarlett Johansson is fine, but everybody is still waiting for her to realise the potential she showed when she announced herself on the scene in ""Lost in Translation"" and ""The Girl with the Pearl Earring"". The supporting cast are a joy to watch. Eric Bana is excellent as Henry VIII, but it is the schemers in the background who provide the best entertainment. David Morrissey is having a lot of fun, whilst Mark Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas are great as the Boleyn parents.<br/><br/>It is a perfectly bearable watch, but unfulfilling. There's an awful lot crammed into the hour and fifty minutes. As year after year of history is skipped through, the film's focus continually shifts, failing to allow certain characters from gaining appropriate intensity. Henry VIII is not as proactive as he might, or should, be. He is more driven then driving, whilst his first wife, Catherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent), is given very little time on screen, thus sidelining a character which should be a figure of great interest. But your expectations are dashed mainly because the film reaches its climax with half-an-hour to go, with an emotional pinnacle being reached and never again surpassed. A rape scene, which seems to be the start of the culmination, with so many points of interest going on in it, proves to be the end of it. The last thirty minutes, whilst quite stylish, are drawn out and slow, and end with a final scene that can only be described as cheesy.<br/><br/>It's a shame that this film is nothing more than admirable in places. But it is a good film for this time of year (that springtime lull between the quality of Winter and the bombast entertainment of Summer). It is an entertaining and satisfying way to pass an afternoon, but it won't live long in the memory."

At any rate, whatever they tried to do with this freakosaurus of a ""historical"" movie, they completely and unforgivably failed at. I know this bit of history well, and have seen most treatments of it in movies and TV shows; even the irreverent and sensationalist Tudors TV show is a masterstroke of brilliance compared to the pondscum that is The Other Boleyn Girl.<br/><br/>This movie keeps developing into ever-greater extremes of absurdity, piling one thoroughly unbelievable scene upon the other. It takes rumors, it takes subsequent history, it takes impossible dialogue and it even takes *rape* and *incest*, and drops it all on the shoulders of Anne Boleyn. This is not only the worst and the least historical account of these events I have yet seen, but also the most offensive and malicious. It is complete, irredeemable nonsense.<br/><br/>Why and how the classy actors could possibly stand for this, I will honestly never know. They must have cringed so loudly inside that the sound technicians must have deleted the creaking. There is only one word that accurately describes this movie: Ridiculous.<br/><br/>Just one final complaint - an insult, really: How can this compost pile have garnered an IMDb rating of nearly 7?

"haleyshopefarm-1","2","44","71","4 March 2008"," Inaccurate historical detail
","This story is not close to being correct. First off, Anne was the younger sister (born in 1510). Mary was the mistress to King Francis of France she returned to England with Mary, Queen of France after the death of the French King Louis She became Henry's lover. She became pregnant and was married off to William Carey. The King NEVER acknowledged her child as his. Anne was STILL in France with Queen Claude. She was never banished to France. She returned to England when Henry changed allegiances from France to Spain. When Anne returned she fell in love with Harry Percy (who was NOT betrothed to anyone) It was a love match. The King saw Anne and became besotted. He had Cardinal Wolsey separate them and then Percy was married off to Mary Talbot. Henry adored Anne. He was never anything but generous to her and she hated him only a little less than she hated The Cardinal Wolsey. She blamed them for separating her from her love, Harry Percy. The King pursued her and she refused him, this went on for 6 years. she finally fell in love with him. They married (after he split from Rome) and were happy. Elizabeth was born, and Henry changed the Act of Succession to make Elizabeth his heir. It wasn't until the second death of a stillborn son that Henry had had enough. The saucy temperament and sharp tongue he loved in the beginning began to wear on him in the end. One of the greatest historical quotes is from Anne in the Tower ""when I no longer hated him, he began to hate me""<br/><br/>This is a great story if told correctly. This movie was awful. Anne was not guilty of adultery and the scene with her brother never happened.In fact it was the situation with Mark Smeaton a court musician that caused Anne's downfall. She was accused with him (he was tortured to admit guilt) and with all of Henry's friends from the time he had first met Anne, her brother was thrown in to make sure there was no sympathy for the Queen. Interestingly, even though most of the people hated Anne for what had happened to Katherine, Henry's actions made the people sympathetic to Anne as they did not believe her guilty of what she was accused. Jane Seymour was no longer a secret. I am amazed that such an inaccurate movie would be made and the worst part of this is that in a time when women had little to no power, a young girl changed the face of the world.<br/><br/>By refusing the greatest man in the land..The King. Her end was tragic and not her fault. It was the doing a spoiled and old man who was always looking for the greener grass. The movie was shot horribly and the costumes were seen too often. Katherine of Aragon was not an ugly woman but one worn down by lost children and a philandering husband.<br/><br/>The best movie on this subject was Anne of The Thousand Days. The Tudors on Showtime is good but also rife with historical inaccuracies. Mary was not the saint she was made out to be but a whore who gave everyone everything and asked for nothing. She did live a quite life after the death of her sister.<br/><br/>And her children were honored by Elizabeth I"

","Depressingly inaccurate and misrepresented. The book 'The Other Boleyn Girl' had a few inaccuracies of it's own, but made a good effort to truly flesh out character's lives and personalities. The movie had more historically inaccurate facts than it did true, and didn't seem to follow the book at all. Leaving out baby Catherine, showing William Stafford as a smiling fool, screwing up Henry Percy's story completely, and forgetting to mention Catherine entirely after her trial was over was a poor effort.<br/><br/>One of the things that annoyed me most was when Henry raped Anne. There is no historical evidence whatsoever to show that he would have done this, and every suggestion to the contrary. He either loved her with a passion or ignored her entirely. With Henry, there was rarely any middle ground. The other incredibly annoying scene was at George's execution where the crowd shouted and jeered as he had to be dragged to the block. In actual reality, he stood calmly before the crowd, and announced his innocence and respect for the queen. The producer's effort in 'spicing things up' by making things appear worse then they actually were was degrading to the fine lives of these characters, most of who died with dignity."

","Mary was of course Anne's older sister,not younger,and she and her siblings were pimped by their social climbing father the appalling Thomas Boleyn(even the name ""Boleyn"" was an affectation borrowed from the French Court,their real names was ""Bullen"").The overall feeling is that if Henry had a taste for bestiality Boleyn would have pimped one of his wolfhounds. ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is trash,basically.Only Miss S.Johansson escapes unscathed as ""The King's Great Matter"" is presented as a bodice - ripper that almost plays like a badly - written satire about the Tudor Court. Eric Bana is lousy as Henry the Eighth,portraying England's last all - powerful king as a spoiled 14 year old.Here was a sophisticated,learned man seen as a bearded Zac Effron. There were no feminists in Tudor England,whatever thoughts Lady Boleyn,who had allegedly been Henry's mistress as a young woman, might have had about the King's conduct about her children she kept to herself in order to survive. Mary Boleyn bore the King's Bastard and kept her head when many about her were losing theirs - a not inconsiderable achievement.

","When I first saw the trailer for The Other Boleyn Girl, I have to admit, it looked good, but like it wasn't accurate. I am a huge history buff, especially in the time of England's dark ages, I am fairly familiar with the Boleyn sisters and their affections for King Henry, Anne being the second wife to be executed for committing adultery and not birthing a son heir to the thrown, her life was absolutely horrific if you think about how hard it was to be a woman in this era. I was a little scared that they wouldn't portray her well in this film, but my mom and I saw The Other Boleyn Girl today and even though I'm not fully satisfied with the portrayal of Anne, the movie is still very good. The story has a Hollywood layer to give the story a little more ""oomph"" sort of speak, like most other pictures, but The Other Boleyn Girl is still a very decent movie.<br/><br/>The Boleyn has quite a family, a mother, father, a son, and two daughters. After failing at several attempts for Queen Catherine to have a son heir to King Henry's thrown, he wishes for a mistress. Sir Thomas Boleyn offers his daughter, Anne, but when King Henry sees Thomas's other daughter, Mary, he is smitten with her and wants her as his mistress. She gives birth to a son, but they are not married and she is looked down upon. Anne is given a second chance to come back after a marriage that was not granted and then annulled, but King Henry then falls for her and wishes her to give herself to him, but she puts up a fight and tells him not until she assumes the crown and to be his wife. But she fails to give him a son, her life depends on it as well sadly.<br/><br/>The true story of Anne Boleyn is very sad, but extremely interesting, I wouldn't recommend the book, just go for a regular history book when it comes to this story. But for the movie, The Other Boleyn Girl, I liked it, it had good acting, beautiful costumes and sets, and a very good story. If you are looking for a history lesson, this is not the film for you, but if you are looking for a good movie, then watch it. Just like the film ""Elizabeth"", they make the story a little more juicy, it's for the sake of some audience members who don't understand why England has the system it does, but it still makes for good drama.<br/><br/>7/10"
"CihanVercan","5","32","52","11 September 2008"," Not a good historical film, but a considerable drama with indefensible historical laxity.
","Don't trust either good or bad critics upon ""The Other Boleyn Girl"". It's a serious thing to castigate such a bold work. First of all, this movie is a mediocre adaptation of a heart-breaking novel of late epochs of the English kingdom and the royal family. This work of art(both novel and the movie) has a courage to reveal the unknown reasons of English kingdom becoming less potent with the Renaissance revolution from Italy, and losing the support of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church, accordingly becoming adversaries with Italy.<br/><br/>The Renaissance revolution is strongly flowing all over the movie just effectively with the Love. Yes, Renaissance invented the Love; but not lonely. There supposed to be growing artists, poets, sculptors, etc. Where are they? Even, we see the palace of the kingdom, the courtroom, the royal family's bedrooms all like a dungeon. Love wouldn't be existed, unless there is Art. Regrettably neither director nor the screenwriter is aware of the Renaissance flow of the actual novel. Hence the spirit of the movie is lost; and they still try to make us believe that the king of England is cruel and he has set apart the lovers. On the contrary, in fact English kingdom always had let literature, theater and love grow.<br/><br/>Beside this failure, this fiasco of the plot; the cinematography and the costume design are stunning. The music score is outstanding, yet we feel that the whole movie is in a mournful silence.<br/><br/>After all, we have a touching story with a great deal of melodrama in a sensational way. It seems like it took much effort to get together this powerful cast of actors and their cordial acting. Give it a try; at least it's worth seeing."

","The Other Boleyn Girl **SPOILER** Throughout the film there were a few sniggers at some of the incredibly bad scripting (Obviously geared towards the American market- as there were regular bits were the evil Uncle would describe exactly what was going on or would happen in the future and the historical inaccuracies were pretty major). Some of it was cringeworthy in just how bad it was (especially the final scene with the slow fade to black- a picture of a red headed girl and a subtitle explaining how 'Elizabeth would go on to rule England for 40 years ' (or whatever- I didn't read it properly as I was in such a rush to leave).<br/><br/>I suppose the actors did what they could with a terrible script and worse directing (scarlett Johansen wasn't as bad as reviews had led me to believe and Natalie Portman was perhaps quite good, though to be honest no-one came out of it well. Eric Bana didn't really have a lot to work with either- pity because I had a high regard for him after the castle and the nugget). The cinematography was also terrible with the majority of the scenes being very poorly focused- It wasn't soft focus or pull focus, it was just rubbish and very poorly done. In fact it was on a par with the script as one of the worst things about the movie.<br/><br/>Some of the comments I heard when exiting the theatre mirrored my thoughts but used a few more expletives...<br/><br/>Unfortunately I would neither recommend it to a friend or my most feared enemy.<br/><br/>I am sorry to say that the only thing I can say in it's defence was that 'the costumes were quite well done' but even they were not exceptional...<br/><br/>I was happy when it was over (but would have been happier if I'd seen the scriptwriter and the director get executed rather than the boleyn family).<br/><br/>Did I mention how rubbish the cinematography and the script were? <br/><br/>Can I mention it again?"

"guylover_caroline","2","14","22","17 June 2008"," The Writers Need to go back to British History Class
","The Other Boleyn Girl probably marks the debut of an adaptation of the most intriguing tale of English Royal history. However, very poorly does the film actually describe the events. I must say that probably the only accurate part of this movie is the inevitable ending--which I won't give away because there may be a few who don't actually know what happens.<br/><br/>I am quite the Anne Boleyn fanatic. She is one of my favorite historical figures due to her intelligence, wit and ambition. But this film completely let me down. Obviously Ms. Gregory and the people working on the film are partial to Mary Boleyn, for they idolize her throughout and scorn Anne. What for? Mary Boleyn was a naive and vain young woman who only wished for the king's attention for as long as any ordinary mistress could have it. She was unintelligent. Anne, however, used strategy to get what she wanted. She did not wish for love (perhaps not a noble thing, but at least she was honest about it); she wished for power. And she got it. Because of her refusals, she became Queen of England. It was only her growing ego and ambition that destroyed her--quite the theme; however the writers ignored it and decided to go with the cliché ""love conquers all."" Of course that is a noble truth, but Anne's downfall is much more interesting. I recommend reading her biography and the (somewhat fictional) diary by Carolyn Meyer.<br/><br/>The one thing I despised about this movie was how terribly inaccurate it was. Not only was it shown that one sister was favored over another by the writers, but also the historical portion was completely wrong. For one, Anne Boleyn was not the elder, more social and beautiful of the two. On the contrary, Mary was older by two or three years, and she was welcomed in by society because of her beauty and popularity. Anne was younger, darker, and she had two imperfections: A mole on her neck (believed to be Devil markings) and a sixth finger on her right hand. When she went to France she learned how to cover these imperfections and make herself seem flawless. Her wit was always present. And although I adore Eric Bana, he was a poor choice to play Henry VIII, one of the most morbidly obese men in all of history.<br/><br/>Also, it is quite evident throughout that Anne was vying for Henry's affections all along; however, Mary was the one who wanted to be his mistress. Anne was busy with a poet and musician in court until Henry began to take interest in her. <br/><br/>Perhaps because I am partial to Anne I found this movie so horrible. But I understand that she was a flawed human being who fell because of her ego. Still, the movie represented almost all of the characters horribly exaggerated. Anne was too bad, Mary was too good, Henry was too brutal, etc. I believe the only accurate characters in the film were the girls' mother, father, and uncle. their parts were true to history and made for an interesting relationship to follow. <br/><br/>I suppose I don't see the necessity of changing fact to fiction. The true story is already interesting enough. Even if the writers etc. have differing opinions there are many ways to illustrate a character as good or evil without altering history. People need to learn that history itself is a story that needs to be told ACCURATELY. It makes more sense, it's more believable, and it's much more entertaining for people like me who obsess over such inconsistencies. <br/><br/>Historical Accuracy aside, the movie was way too melodramatic for my tastes. there were no redeeming qualities other than the fact that Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johanssen really understood their characters. Kudos for playing not just an historical figure, but also for playing another person's opinion of an historical figure. It is not always easy. the action was very repetitive, and most of it not very good. I'm sorry, but I'd have to say no on this one. Even if you don't care about historical authenticity, the movie itself isn't great.<br/><br/>If you do care about the facts?? Run away. Fast."

"bethreidy-1","3","6","8","13 June 2008"," Disappointed in the first 5 minutes
","All I can say is very disappointing especially if you read the novel.<br/><br/>First, I think this a case of not, Truth is stranger than fiction, but I think far more interesting. I don't really understand why they chose to change history where they did. For example, I believe Henry attended Mary's wedding and that was were he became ""enchanted"" with her or at least met her. Well what is more dramatic that deciding to begin an affair with a woman you met at her wedding to another man? They forgot the ""sweats"" and obviously Mary's husbands death. They completely downplayed Katherine of Aragon and the turmoil of the divorce on the country.<br/><br/>Second, the story was suppose to be from Mary's point of view, but somehow became more about Anne than Mary. I also think this may be where you can allow for more historical discrepancy, based on this being from a lesser know point of view. Perhaps Anne wasn't really so ambition on her own, but maybe from Mary's point of view she was. Anne did after all take ""charge"" of her son.<br/><br/>I think the time table of this movie was terrible. They should have found a period of the book and concentrated on that and really built the characters and the story (if that had happened can you say sequel). Funny to think I thought the 'Tudors' series was even going to far with the timeline they crammed into Season 1 let alone to have about 10 to 15 years of history stuffed into 2 hours.<br/><br/>The main things I really enjoyed from the book, which is the character development of Mary as she matures from a girl to a woman and a mother and how her priorities changed were completely missing. This may or may not be historically accurate, but I thought her struggles with liking Queen Katherine and being loyal to her family were interesting. As well as her struggle and desire to be with her children. And finally falling in love with someone considered lesser in status and deciding love was worth being disowned.<br/><br/>I could go on with how the differences between the novel and the movie, but the biggest disappointment was this was suppose to be Mary's story told from her point of view and that didn't happen at all. And I think they cast from the 'Tudors' is far better suited for each character than those chosen for this movie, with potentially the exception of Mary, because they put no real focus on her in the series.<br/><br/>PS.. within the first 15 minutes of the watching the DVD, I began reading reviews on this site and found them more interesting than the actual movie."

Natalie Portman comes up short as Ann Boleyn. The actress who portrays her on ""The Tudors"", Natalie Dormer, is much better. There really isn't anything bewitching or captivating about Natalie Portman's portrayal of Ann Boleyn, unlike Ms. Dormer's performance, which is everything Natalie Portman's portrayal is not. Dormer exudes the aura of a temptress with sex appeal galore. Portman simply does not. I think Johansson would have been the better choice for Ann.<br/><br/>Eric Bana is so-so as Henry VIII. Rhys Meyers portrayal is much more entertaining on the ""The Tudors"". To be fair, Bana didn't have much more to work with than did Johansson. The main character in this movie is Portman's Ann Boleyn, who seems to miss the mark.<br/><br/>The supporting cast was good but overall you should save your hard earned money & wait for this to appear on cable."

","As previously commented, the book ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" was not particularly accurate from a historical perspective, but at least the characters were developed. The best part of this movie was the costumes. Some of the acting was OK, but the script or the editing of the movie (or both) was awful! The movie neither followed generally accepted historical fact nor the points and time line proposed by Gregory as fact. It skipped around leaving out important points, which made it impossible to follow the story. I went with a friend, and part way through(after Mary is receiving a marriage proposal), I asked my friend ""Did I miss something or did they neglect to mention that Mary's husband died?"" Now, I will admit that I might have dozed off or been daydreaming, but my friend confirmed that the movie had left out that little bit of information. Furhter, I could swear that I'd previously seen scenes in previews that did not appear in the movie. Unless you just like looking at lavish costumes, stay home and read something instead. It would be a shame for people to think that this is a historically accurate movie. Better yet, save your money until you can afford to take a trip to Hampton Court (the ads for which say ""Henry loved it so much, he took his honeymoon there. Again and again and again. He did confiscate it from Woolsey, so I guess it was true.) You will learn more."

The rape scene was the worst! When baby Henry was born and he did not go to see him was the second worst! I just wish they could have been more accurate with the facts of history but maybe this is just too big a topic/story for a short movie. Much better as a miniseries. I also think it just all felt rushed. It would have been nice to see some more pleasant interaction between Anne and the king. King Henry had a smoldering quality, but the chemistry was lacking with Anne. He really seemed to have more affection for Mary - why was a mystery. Just did not like the movie at all."

","This movie was awful as it didn't follow the book at all! This movie was entirely about Anne and barely about Mary like the book is written. Not to mention, to anyone who didn't read the book, when did William Carrey die in the movie? They never told you that Mary's first husband died when she later married Stafford. And by the way the I loved the introduction of Stafford as yearning for Mary. I mean out of nowhere the character shows up and says 'Hey baby I got some pocket change and a I have a mobile home in a trailer park how about you look me up when things blow over'. I mean what a bunch of nonsense.<br/><br/>Again if you didn't read the book you wouldn't know who the heck Stafford was. Mary and Anne's brother George who is so critical in the story looks like a chump and his character is never formed at all. Roles are so reversed, twisted, and hidden that the film lacks any depth. Philippa Gregory must be pretty upset with this movie as it is a hack job. Little snippets of scenes that try to piece together over 20 years of history in two hours makes for a very unbelievable film. This should have been a six part BBC series. If you read and loved the book as I, then don't go to see this movie thinking that is what it's about because you will be greatly disappointed."

Arthur died six months later and Catherine then married Henry. Twenty-four years later, Henry secretly married Anne Boleyn(Natalie Portman), Henry had already had an affair with Anne Boleyn's sister(Scarlette Johansson) and the marriage did not last long. Henry annulled his marriage to Catherine on the basis that she had been previously married to his brother Arthur, and that the marriage was therefore invalid. Pope Clement VII refuse sanction Henry's marriage to Anne and excommunicated the English king in 1534, then Thomas Cranmer(Wallis) sanctioned Henry's marriage. But his concern to produce a male heir brought out the worst in him and Anne was discarded. She was accused of adultery with her brother George(Sturgess) and four commoners. Thomas Howard(David Morrissey) acquiesced at the execution of his niece, Anne Boleyn, but subsequently lost Henry's favour and was condemned to death. Anne was beheaded in May 1536. Eleven days later, Henry married Jane Seymour(Galloway),but even the birth of Edward was overshadowed by tragedy. Jane Seymour died twelve days after giving birth to a son, later Edward VI.<br/><br/>This is a good costume-drama inspired on real events. The film relies heavily on the relationship between the Boleyn sisters , well acted by Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson. Nice drama with top notch performances, trio starring does triumphant characterizations. Splendid support cast , such as Mark Rylance as the ambitious father Thomas Boleyn, Kristin Scott Thomas as Lady Elizabeth and David Morrissey as intriguing Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfork. Lush and elegant gowns by the expert Sandy Powell. Sensational production design shot on location with breathtaking outdoors and impressive palaces.

Her performance was unbelievable! Of course, Nat and Scarlett Johansson are two of the most resplendently beautiful women in Hollywood today, but they are both much more than pretty faces with terrific figures. Although they are both becoming outstanding actors, I realize it's their looks that will put most guys in the seats. These two beauties will not disappoint.

The budget was clearly blown on making the costumes and hiring the actors, because the entire film takes place in a dingy mansion. Scenes set outside are few and far between. Even the key execution scene, which would have seen hundreds of spectators, has about half a dozen bored-looking extras standing around instead.<br/><br/>Johansson is vacuous and Portman made me cringe at times. Eric Bana is probably the worst actor yet to play Henry VIII (and he knows it), but at least he has little to do. The best actor in the film, Eddie Redmayne (of PILLARS OF THE EARTH) is wasted as a pageboy. I find Philippa Gregory a dry, unengaging author anyway, but I'd hoped this would be a decent adaptation.

"jonathanruano","3","5","7","19 February 2009"," The Other Boleyn Girl: A Rulebook for Serious Films
","""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is one of those films that is so boring that you start picking out the logical errors with the plot. To begin with, Henry VIII's private life has been the subject of countless films. Unless a movie can provide a fresh take on this familiar subject matter, then there is no point in making it. <br/><br/>Yet aside from this criticism, ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" also suffers from the fatal flaw of being stupid. The beginning of the film sees Henry VIII (Eric Bana) impregnate Mary Boleyn (Scarlett Johannson) with a son. You would think that Henry VIII would then divorce Catherine of Aragon and marry Mary, thereby legitimizing his son's eventual succession to the throne. Yet for reasons that are not at all clear, Henry VIII acts like the cad who who breaks off all contact with a girl he had just impregnated rather than a monarch who is desperate for a male heir. So even within its own logic, this film breaks down.<br/><br/>If this is not bad enough, we have an even more illogical episode to follow that one. After spending a pleasant holiday in France, Anne Boleyn comes back to England with a mission to seduce the king. But her plan is to treat Henry VIII like dirt and be snobbish and obnoxious to everyone else. Of course, I do not hold any of these things against Anne necessarily because it is nice to see the titled aristocracy getting taken down a couple of pegs. Yet what does not make sense is that Henry VIII would marry her afterwards, especially considering that there is no chemistry between them whatsoever. I also do not understand why Anne Boleyn was devastated when the king lost all interest in her. She did become queen after all and it was not as if she was in love with Henry. With this many illogical scenes, Anne's deep seated anguish comes across as forced rather than sincere. The film makers asked Natalie Portman to cry a river and she cried a river for them. <br/><br/>At the end of watching ""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" I came to the realization that this movie should have been made into a soft-core sex comedy of the 1970s variety. The execution scenes can be cut, extended sex scenes with Scarlett Johannson can be inserted, and the dialogue can be lighter and feature more sly wit and humour. That way, this film will not have to live up to its unrealistic pretensions to greatness and can be a rousing entertainment."

I must say memorizing all six names for that test came in handy and helped me draw some connections.<br/><br/>This movie was almost perfectly casted. Natalie Portman did a stunning job as Anne Boleyn and I hope to see she gets recognized for this role. Scarlett Johansson did a great job as well and really gives you a different perspective on Anne Boleyn while this movie portrays Mary as more of the innocent younger sister. While Natalie plays Anne to seem cruel and evil, in a way that I would have maybe never pictured Anne. Jim Sturgess, a rising star since Across the Universe, nailed his role. He is one to watch in the future as he shows undeniable talent. His chemistry between his character George Boleyn and sister Anne was amazingly good and believable. Seeing his character, George being dragged to be executed tore at my heart and made me cry as well as Anne's. I don't think that I have ever fallen in love with characters in a movie more till I saw this movie. Eric Bana also did a great job, however I think he could have captured the character of Henry VIII a little better. In all the history books, he seemed like such a ladies man and yet so incredibly evil. Which in some sense he captured but I still think he could have done better. The love scenes were done very tastefully showed the passion and didn't really show anything offensive.<br/><br/>Over all I think this movie was very good. I highly recommend it to anyone. Some say that it was a poorly penned script but I think that it was beautifully written capturing the heart of each character. Some say that it sped to quickly through some parts, I somewhat agree, but come on you can't keep the audience watching forever. The actors and actresses were almost perfectly cast, each excelled in their role. Overall a great movie."

","After reading the book I could not wait for the DVD, but what a let down. Had they read the book before making the film or checked the history, I guess not. The story seems to be about Anne Boleyn not Mary. Mary's first born was a girl called Catherine and her second child was a boy called Harry both thought to be King Henry's, even though her first husband was mentioned nothing was mentioned about the death of her first husband William Carey, years later she married her second husband Lord Stafford. When Elizabeth was born she was raised in Hatfield along with Mary her half sister, Mary Boleyn did not take Elizabeth as betrayed at the end of the film but Anne did try adopt Mary Boleyn's son Harry."

","I went into 'The Other Boleyn Girl' aware of its poor reviews, but still hoping for something special. Unfortunately the film failed on most accounts. Firstly the actual story itself, is simply put, poor. Many audience members will undoubtedly believe this to be the true story of the Boleyn girls, yet the film (as well as the novel upon which the film is based) is rife with historical inaccuracies and often complete fabrications. The real Anne Boleyn-unlike the scheming, manipulative character we see in the film- was in fact a pious Christian, devoted to her faith and known for giving charitably. Mary did indeed have a brief affair with Henry VIII, but she also had an affair with the King of France-far from the sexually inexperienced girl that is presented in the film. Nevermind the fact that Mary Boleyn was in fact the older sister of Anne, not the younger sister. The pacing of the film is poor-at points where more detail should be devoted, we are rushed through, whereas at other points the film drags. The audience learn little of wider political and societal movements at the time, and Jane Seymour is only mentioned in passing-now perhaps this focus on the Boleyn Sisters is intentional, the directors attempt to show womens limited power in this time only succeeds in suggesting that their only source of power was through their sexual attractiveness (perhaps arguably, having some historical grounding). As for Henry VIII, the audience is given the impression that hi major preoccupation is bedding young attractive women-we gain no impression of his ruler-ship or leadership abilities. The acting is solid, and Portman and Johansson do well with their English accents, however you know a film has failed when you spend most of its duration admiring the costumes (which are beautiful) rather than paying attention to the film. Ultimately the film could not sustain my attention, and I left the cinema feeling rather disappointed and cheated."

","WARNING-potential SPOILER ALERT: Although I am a huge fan of Phillipa Gregory's work, I was extremely disappointed that she allowed the screenplay to be as awful as it was. I understand the historical inaccuracies (they are needed sometimes to make the story flow better) but some of them are grossly and unwisely used. Why is the King surprised to find Mary married when HE was the one that arranged the marriage to William Carey. Also Anne was not exiled to France because of showing off for the king, that was a random addition to the story line. The addition of the rape scene between Henry and Anne was by far the most horrifying of them all. The part wasn't even in Gregory's book!<br/><br/>As far as casting goes, where to begin. The ONLY two roles cast correctly were Norfolk and Lady Elizabeth Boleyn both played spot on to the historical depiction of those people. Why did NATALIE PORTMAN play the legendary Anne Boleyn as a petty, grinning idiot. As far as grace goes, i guess some things cannot be taught. Anne Boleyn was graceful and intriguing, neither of which came out in Portman's portrayal. THOMAS BOLEYN'S casting was nothing short of a joke. Here is a person who was a savvy, manipulative business man willing to prostitute his daughters out for his own gain. Instead the audience has to watch a man who seems scared of his own shadow. Eric Bana could have made the role of the King very enjoyable if the writing of his role would have had any kind of substance. WILLIAM STAFFORD historically was a tall, handsome, strapping, and assertive man so why was the role given to a scrawny 12 year old look-alike? Costumes were another downfall. In the DVD extras, it was mentioned that the production ""searched high and low for Tudor costumes but another production (Showtime's The Tudors) had used them all up."" So the production was not intending to use original costumes based on the feel of the screenplay that was written. It seems an easy way out to use someone else's time and effort. Instead, the audience has to watch the characters prance around in the same dress just in different colors. The costumes looked very cheaply designed and made and it is evident on screen.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie seemed to lack in so many areas and one has to wonder if so much money was spent to attain the three leads and had little money left to allocate elsewhere. If you love the Tudor era, I suggest you do not see this movie, it will just make you want to throw something at your TV."

Anne secretly marries nobleman Henry Percy and tells her brother George (Jim Sturgess). George tells Mary who then tells her parents fearing a scandal over Percy who is engaged to another arranged by the king. Anne is exiled to the French court. She would return to take the king from Mary. She would give birth to future queen Elizabeth. Mary is widowed and remarries William Stafford (Eddie Redmayne). Ambitious courtesan Jane Parker (Juno Temple) marries George and would cause a great royal scandal.<br/><br/>Anne seems to be written as the flamboyant sister while Mary is the shy one. Portman is older than Johansson and that does fit the Boleyn sisters. However, I think Johansson and Portman are more fit in personality to switch their roles. It's pushing through a lot of plot and the material may be better for a TV series. The actors are capable and the story is fascinating. The execution is a little flat but still very watchable as a vast costume soap opera."

","'The Other Boleyn Girl' is an awkward and historically inaccurate piece of drama that has little factual content. In this sense, it is very closely linked to the book of the same title. While both Portman and Johansson can do good English accents, it is clear from their performances that they are not comfortable in their roles as British historical figures, which can only be expected when the cast of the main characters is not even English! The movie itself is well edited and directed, and at times can be quite entertaining. Unfortunately this is not enough to save the film, and although some find it to be a new and interesting take on Tudor history, this is NOT a film that should be referred to in history class.

","I would not study history of England based on ""The other Boleyn girl"" (2008) but I enjoyed it and found it quite entertaining. Boleyn girls, two sisters, Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary (Scarlett Johansson,) were gorgeous and Henry VIII (Eric Bana) long before he looked like on his famous portraits by Hans Holbein, Jr, the object of both sisters' desires was very appealing. Kristin Scott Thomas played Lady Boleyn, Anne's and Mary Boleyn's mother. Scott Thomas has so much class and dignity about her, and I like her in every movie I've seen her.<br/><br/>I actually did not know that Mary Boleyn, the older Anne's sister (in the movie she was younger), had been Henry VIII's mistress and might have (or not) had a son with him. According to the movie and the novel by Philippa Gregory it was based on, Mary had a son with Henry who then fell in love with sharp-witted, alluring, and unavailable Anne who firmly refused to become the king's mistress. So great was his desire for her, it led to Henry's annulment of the 20+ years marriage with the queen Katharine of Aragon and split with Catholic Church thus starting the Church of England. Katharine of Aragon comes as a decent and intelligent woman played by Ana Torrent. Now, that's the most pleasant surprise of the movie. Eight-year-old Ana Torrent gave an unforgettable performance as ""Ana"" in the film El espíritu de la colmena (The Spirit of the Beehive) by Víctor Erice. She was memorable in the relatively small role in Justin Chadwick's historical drama comparing to Portman or Johansson.<br/><br/>Anne Boleyn was a remarkable and bright woman, (bitch as she was, quick-tempered and spirited) and it is clear that her daughter Elizabeth, the future greatest Monarch in the England's history, Good Queen Beth inherited strength, iron will, brilliance, and brain from her mother. The fact that Elizabeth did not want to get married only speaks in her behalf - she was smart enough not to let any man to tell her what to do and to dominate her. Her mother Anne was not that lucky. The second part of the movie, the fall of Anne Boleyn, ""Anne of Thousand Days"" was rushed, sensational, and much weaker than the promising beginning. Since those historic figures had been dead for almost 500 years, it is easy to come up with any shocking accusation toward them - they won't defend themselves. Anyway, the costumes and the sets were the feast for eyes, I was not bored and after the movie was over, I spent some time researching on the web the key players of the real life drama that was set in the beginning of 1500s, changed the future of Europe, and included love, lust, ambitions that would destroy the family ties, rise to power, and deadly fall from it."
"mahounowatarigarasu","3","6","10","7 March 2008"," Not recommended, Historically and literately inaccurate
","It's not surprising that those who hate it know quite a bit about the period, or loved the book word for word. In both these areas the film misses. It is barely like the book at all, and of course GROSSLY inaccurate when concerning history. If one of these had been done right the movie might not have been so bad. <br/><br/>Lets start with the choice of actors. I won't even focus on my original issue that none of the leads are British... that's a bit picky I know. I will though ask this one question.. Couldn't you have gotten a lead actor with RED HAIR? Henry being famously red headed... I know it seems nitpicky... but movies that don't care about some obvious small mistakes, tend to also do BIG mistakes... Eric Bana is a good actor. He is, and he's very attractive. I give him that, he's strong and handsome. But as Henry... he falls a little flat. Though that I can blame more on the screenplay and direction. Natalie Portman is good, her accent is good. She plays her Anne Boleyn is strong and a presence on screen. Scarlett Johannsen though.... yeah, I gotta say she doesn't have much acting ability. Most of time on screen is spend staring and looking sad. Granted like Eric Bana, part of this is the screenplay. She's not given much to do... My shining light in this movie is David Morrissey, who is fantastic as the Duke of Norfolk, their Uncle. He's mean, creepy, conniving... Perfect. Kristin Scott Thomas is also good, I couldn't help but feel they made her so likable to make this movie into a feminist stronghold. All the women were poor victims of the men. Sure in history this was mostly true, but in the movie its done in overkill. And the rest of the actors... George was BARELY in it to even be noticed, which is atrocious since he's so important. And William Stafford... I won't get too much into that but the actor playing him was so badly miscast as to be laughable. Granted he's barely on screen 5 minutes so who cares? Then the other issue is the accuracy of the movie. Okay, this is based off a historical fiction novel, so you go in not expecting historical accuracy, which you do NOT get of course. But you don't even get literary accuracy. This bares so little in common with the book as to be laughable, one gets the idea they just named it the Other Boleyn Girl to make money off the tremendous sales for the book. They cut so much out, and change characters personalities and relationships that it makes no sense. One thing I enjoyed in the book was the relationship between Mary and Queen Catherine. It was touching to see a girl who truly loved her Queen ending up betraying her, but ultimately being forgiven. Even naming her daughter after her. In the movie though that is ALL gone, hell they even skip the birth of Mary's daughter. The portrayal of Catherine in the movie is terrible as well, they turn her into a weak women who's victimized by her husband. In the book at least you see a strong woman, who doesn't let people get to her and who truly loves her husband. And you see that in the beginning at least Henry cared about her as well. Its great, and the movie could have done with some of that. Not to mention the movie acting like Mary Boleyn was the FIRST girl Henry had as a mistress... that's as silly as it gets. She wasn't THAT important... Another glaring issue with the movie the lack of Cardinal Wolsey. Really what else do I need to say there? To leave out such an important character... And here's a quirky little issue with the movie... they forgot to kill Mary's first husband, William Carey!! He's in the beginning, and then he's gone. No mention, nothing. Oh well. SMALL forgetful error that...<br/><br/>And acting and accuracy issues aside, the movie didn't make sense for new viewers. They jumped time without letting you know. You're just supposed to assume time had gone by even though everyone looked the same. You see Mary ride off to the country, and two minutes later she's riding back and so much time as gone by... Anne gets exiled to France and comes back minutes later and its been months supposedly... She's been in France for a few months and suddenly she's completely changed and knows everything?? It made no sense. Add that to the fact that the director tried SO hard to make this movie dramatic.... There's a scene where Anne is coming back from France... it reminded me of Pirates of the Caribbean. Or that they kept using dramatic music, or outside shots of clouds moving quickly, or those camera shots from behind things making it look like someones watching secretly. <br/><br/>All in all this was a Hollywood movie gone wrong. Its tough to make a movie based off a fiction book thats based off a period of history. In the end you have to choose which direction you go, you either follow the book or the history. This did neither, and the nail in the coffin was that the movie wasn't even made well enough to make that all not matter. Sure Braveheart was TERRIBLE when it came to history, but you liked watching it. This one ain't so lucky. All it did was make me want to watch the BBC TV version of the Other Boleyn Girl. Supposedly that follows a bit closer."

","I haven't read the book or studied the history surrounding the events in any detail, so I'm not really concerned with those aspects (which seem to have been the major gripe with the movie judging from the comments). The problem I found with this ""bodice ripper"" is it's just a bit dull. Although the costumes are quite pretty, the only way the film maker seems to convey excitement is by cutting to scenes of people riding horses... hard... with dramatic music. There are no set pieces in the movie. It's just a soap opera really. I started to feel like the castle had four or five rooms in it.<br/><br/>I'm usually fond of Natalie Portman. She was terrible in this movie, incapable of extracting sympathy or condemnation from the audience. Totally miscast and out of her depth. I was quite surprised anyone bothered casting Eric Bana in the movie - they could have got by with a much cheaper option since his role is very small. Scarlet wasn't bad. Kristin Scott Thomas actually stole the show.<br/><br/>The script was odd. I kept getting that sense of anachronism - like when Anne says ""You'll have to show me how you did that sometime"". This is acceptable if you're making a movie set during a historical period with a different slant (see A Knight's Tale or Marie Antoinette). It's a bit jarring if you're playing it straight.<br/><br/>It's quite a short movie, and that's a good thing. If it hadn't been, it would have been far more ponderous with its curious lack of passion. What a strangely wasted opportunity. Oh well. I guess I've seen worse. Although some of the worst movies I've seen have at least been memorable."

Sensing the king's growing discontent and fading love for his honorable wife, a key adviser decides it is time for the king to have a mistress. He calls on the family of his sister (Kristin Scott-Thomas) and her social climbing husband, Sir Thomas Boleyn. After all, they have two lovely daughters to offer. One, Anne (Natalie Portman) is beautiful and very clever while Mary (Scarlett Johannsen) is also fair, kind, and sweet but not as quick-witted. Oh, wait, Mary has newly been married to a country landowner so that leaves Anne. The father invites the king to his country estate so that the royal can get acquainted with his older daughter. However, on a foxhunt, Henry is injured when Anne, on horseback, leads the company into dangerous terrain that only she knows well. The king ends up bedridden and Mary is designated to be his nurse, as she is patient and adept at caregiving. Suddenly, Henry prefers Mary and, as he is the king, he moves the entire Boleyn household to court and makes the wedded Mary his mistress. Anne, greatly miffed and rejected, brews up some trouble for the sister she once loved well. But, is Henry through with Anne and devoted only to Mary? We shall see! This is an interesting period piece with a story that, somewhat familiar, deserves to be told again. Most folks have heard that Anne eventually married the king, gave birth to Elizabeth, and subsequently lost her head over some sort of controversy. But, here is a portrait, little known, of her much kinder sister who was also involved with the king, due to her father's insane scheming. As the principal players, you could hardly find a better looking trio than Portman, Johannsen, and Bana and they perform quite well. All of the secondary actors are superb, too, with Scott-Thomas spouting the best lines of the film, absolutely, in great style. Noteworthy indeed are the costumes, for they are sumptuous and worth the ticket price alone. There is also some nice scenery and excellent production values, while the script is interesting and makes history come alive. Most importantly, the film clearly shows that while feminism is a ""recent"" phenomenon, women have had important roles in the world's turning since time began. If you are a fan of romance and adore period pieces, this one is definitely for you. Yet, even those who usually can't be bothered will, I predict, take a shine to this one, where the drama is heavy and the stars so wonderfully winsome."

","I went into this movie having an urge to read the Gregory book and wanted to see what the big deal was. I love Tudor history so it was a must to see...as I thought to believe I was immediately disappointed and lost the urge to read the book. Mary Boleyn was not a virginal naive girl when she married Carey. my god she was already the whore of France by then and married Carey after the affair with Henry since he was the one who had her betrothed to Carey. Johannson did an okay job, not too thrilling.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman's portrayal of Anne Boleyn who was one of the most intriguing and controversial women ever was lacking. I mean the whole role fell flat. She wasn't very seductive or dominant in Anne's shoes. She seemed very submissive to Norfolk and Wiltshire more so than other portrayals.<br/><br/>This movie played more like a soap opera than a Tudor period piece. It was missing a lot of important pieces in the romance of Anne and Henry. And to even suggest that Elizabeth I Gloriana was even the product of rape is horrifying. And even the suggestion that Henry would even rape Anne. the shame. Henry was obsessed with Anne (which it was easy to arrest her for witchcraft and treason). when she finally submitted to him in late 1532 it was purely consensual.<br/><br/>Wolsey, who played a major part in the King's Great Matter was missing and he was truly missed. More, Suffolk, Katherine of Aragon and Jane Seymour were either small parts or reduced to scenery.<br/><br/>It seems to me that the only historically accurate moment in the movie was Anne's execution. Everything else was just shameful. Gregory the author should not be considered an historian as she claims she is. The people who made this film are not at fault for bad source material. but honestly they should have researched."
"mit_the_tenshi","6","3","4","12 June 2008"," Does not measure up to the book and not meant to be accurate
","I've browsed through the comments briefly and then wrote this review, so hopefully I cover a few grounds. Anyways, I thought that the book and movie were meant to be historical FICTION, which means that there are going to be plenty of inaccuracies about the history (although switching around ages of Mary and Anne was a pretty big inaccuracy), but neither one is meant to be accurate, or at least, that's what I thought when I read the book and then watched the movie. Now that I've got that off my head, onwards to the meat of the review. I read the book first, and adored it! I wasn't looking for accuracy, I was looking for what the back of the book cover stated clearly - a situation in which two sisters vie for the attention of a king, each holding a different reason in their heart. Both the movie and the book did a decent job of showing the sibling rivalry, but its the rushed manner and the lack of plot in the movie that disappoints me. Gregory, while being inaccurate, certainly created a captivating tale of two sisters, one young and in love, and the other older and sly, both chasing after the same man. I adored the book plot, and was disappointed to discover that many things changed between the book and the movie. For instance, Anne does not chase after King Henry at first because Mary is the one that catches his eye, and she instead assists Mary and then falls in love with Henry Percy. Also, Mary starts out as a lady in waiting to the queen, and is highly favored by the queen, whereas in the movie, they completely bypass this and instead, make the queen ridicule Mary the first time they meet. In addition, they do not show either Mary or Anne being exiled to Hever, and instead, exile Anne to France, where she actually came from at the beginning of the book. Their mother is much more ambitious in the book than in the movie, so seeing her sympathy and tears in the movie surprised me. Portman and Johannsen did a wonderful job of portraying two sisters, and the actor playing George was quite good too. I adored the woman playing Catherine of Aragon, because she had both a regal manner and the pride of a queen. However, Bana, who played King Henry, made me want to cry because of his sulking, constantly angry portrayal of King Henry. Is it too difficult to be jolly or smile? And that harsh-sexual scene between him and Anne just took me aback, because at that moment, he's supposed to be deeply in love with Anne, almost bewitched by her, in a sense. It's after many squabbles and her inability to produce an heir that he starts turning against her. I'll stop here for now, because there are so many dissatisfactions I had. I, for one, was pained to see a wonderfully written book torn apart and compacted in this unfavorable fashion. However, it may seem like a good standalone film for those who have not read the book or do not expect an accurate historical account from this movie. Many of the actors and actresses have done a wonderful job, the costumes are amazing, and the emotions are expressed beautifully. However, the movie lacks in both plot depth and scripts, and does not follow the book as well as I hoped it would."
"beaver-gurl","5","4","6","15 April 2008"," Somewhere on the List
","I actually did look forward to this film. I practically dragged my sister to the cinema so we could see the adaptation of Philippa Gregory's bestseller. Given, I was half expecting distortion, but this is movie's alteration is in a class of its own. The already twisted history of Philippa Gregory was transformed to something else entirely, a movie that only feints historical reference. But you don't really come to the movies to be given a history lecture now do you? No. You come to be entertained. Was I entertained? Far from.<br/><br/>Firstly, I believe credit was not given to where credit was due. To present Eric Bana and Scarlet Johansson as the main attractions of this film is falsification to the maximum extent. I can honestly say that Johansson looked uncomfortable in the role. She looked awkward in unauthentic. She made me feel as if I was watching an amateur video, and not in the good way. She seemed all too scripted for me, as if there were no internalization to her character or even a thought on how she should portray her character in an honest way, but at the same time in a refined way. Granted that she has been in the industry for a long time, I do believe that she has much more to learn and hopefully, this movie would be a stepping stone for a better performance in her next film, Mary Queen of Scots. I would hate to see that destroyed by overacting and awkward expression.<br/><br/>Eric Bana. What can I say. I expected more from you. I pity the people who see him first on this film. Please do watch his other works, he does better there. I promise. Troy! Munich! Please don't judge the man too harshly. He does have talent, just not exhibited well in this particular film. Aside from the grunting noises and pensieve faces, this movie did nothing for showcasing the talent that we know is in Bana somewhere down there.<br/><br/>Now, on to the pleasant surprises. Yes people, I did like some parts of it.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman. I expected to see her sink like a rock in this film. I did. Coming into the theater, all i could remember of her was the atrocious Star Wars Prequels. That still gives me nightmares. But this film, in the role of the ambitious Anne Boleyn, she reminded me of that girl I saw in Paris Je t'aime. Now that is the Natalie Portman worth seeing. In the first few scenes of the movie, I was thinking, 'why did I watch this instead of Horton Hears A Who?', but as the film progressed, so did she. I must say, when it came down to it, she did a spectacular job. She gave a convincing performance of a scorned girl, pining for revenge, bent on keeping her power and her head. Portman commands the screen and shows us that she is not only a bankable investment for any producer, but also a talented one at that.<br/><br/>Jim Strurgess give a blossoming and dynamic performance as the enigmatic George Boleyn. His star is rising. Mark my words. His performance as the double-dealing, conniving, yet also emphatic noble in a court designed for corruption gave me hope that you can be in a big, blockbuster movie yet still maintain the integrity of good acting. But then again, what else would you expect from good old Jude? And of course, I would love to shed a light on the unsung heroes of The Other Boleyn Girl! Kristen Scott Thomas, Ana Torent and Eddie Redmayne! I must say that their presence made such an impression of me, despite the fact that they had such little screen time! Why was that? I shall never know.<br/><br/>Ana Torent gave a regal performance, no less than can be expected from a woman who plays Catherine of Aragon. Her final scene in the film left me with my jaw hanging open and the word 'WHOA' coming out of my mouth. She was sublimely amazing and gave me the lift that I needed to reassure myself that my money was not wasted on this film.<br/><br/>The same goes for Eddie Redmayne. For anyone who's seen him in Savage Grace and Like Minds, you know that the man has talent. Why that talent was not given more a role when William Stafford was such an interesting character in the book (showing that court life can produce some decent ones and that you can be a commoner but still happy - the moral haven for Mary's sullied life), again, I shall never know. But rest assured, that one long scene he did (perhaps five minutes or so), was worth it for him, but know that the young actor has more in him than that.<br/><br/>Kristen Scott Thomas was definitely worthy of praise. Though her role was more tame and motherly than that of Lady Boleyn in the book, she made me think that the movie version was better. And that is saying something, especially in this adaptation.<br/><br/>With regards to the rest of the film, all I can say is, it was a mediocre historical film. It did not knock Anne of A Thousand Days as the best film on the subject of Anne Boleyn, but it was certainly not a total flop for reasons mentioned above.<br/><br/>So if you are looking for a good watch on the Tudor intrigue, this wouldn't be the first on my list, nor the second, nor the third, but it is somewhere there. Hey. Be thankful that it is no Virgin Territory with Mischa Barton. Thank God for that."

","As a fan of the book and a fan of Tudor history this movie seemed like something very different. I know that that book took many liberties with the history but the basics where close and the end product was VERY entertaining. This take on the book is very choppy and awkward and for any fan of the book a big disappointment. You have some amazing actors and they try their best but they don't have the good writing to work with and it seems like they never seem real in their characters (but Bana was a good king). And two things drove me crazy! One...they say ""sister"" 500 times in the movie...Two..the loose strings. I won't give much away but if you have read the book...or studied English history...this movie will seem like the OTHER 'Other Boleyn Girl'. If you want to see a great movie about Anne Boleyn go see 'Anne of the Thousand Days'."

But during the movie all I'd do is glance over at him and he start going, ""Watchwatchwatch."" He was completely engrossed in the movie and couldn't take his eyes off of it. In the end, I had to ask, ""Well, what did you think?"" And he replied, ""That was amazing. Maybe it was just History class that used to suck in school. Was that how it all really happened?"" Haha. If he had the time, I'd suggest that he read Mary, Bloody Mary. All in all, this movie was one of the greatest historical films. Not boring in the slightest. Very edgy. Loved it."

","I have been studying Anne Boleyn for years now, I will be writing my Grad thesis on her in the fall and this was the WORST movie I have ever seen! I have read much on Anne, Henry VIII, and The Other Boleyn Girl, now I was not expecting much when I went to see the movie, but it was even worse than I could have ever imagined! It stopped being historically accurate after about the first five minutes, and it only loosely followed the book. There is no way that Henry would have fallen for Anne had he met her previously, and they met at court, NOT at the Boleyn's place of residence. Anne was not sent to France as a form of exile, both her and Mary spent their early youth at the French court. In fact both Boleyn girls served Henry VIII's sister Mary when she was Queen of France. There were many important details that were left out, and relationships that were formulated that never happened. There was always an intense jealously between Anne and her sister Mary. In the movie they are portrayed as being close sisters. Save your movie and wait until it is on the $1 rental list at Blockbuster!"
"c_nevardtolley","1","6","11","9 October 2008"," So Very Disappointed
","I have just finished watching this movie and I finished the book yesterday, so while I have the book fresh in my mind I shall say this. The Other Boleyn Girl (movie) is the worst book-movie adaptation I have ever seen. For one King Henry VIII does not RAPE Anne Boleyn, Mary Boleyn bears TWO children to King Henry, Catherine and Henry, William Stafford is not in the book until towards the end when he whisks Mary away to Rochford, where they have their own children, the country Anne refers when she sends Mary away should have been Hever NOT Rochford, and also Anne is exiled twice and she goes to Hever NOT France!!!!!<br/><br/>This movie was appalling on all counts and I would never watch it again having read the book and also many more on the Boleyn family and the Tudor Court. Never have I been so disappointed in a movie. Although I will give Scarlett Johansson a 10/10 for her acting. Other than that this movie is BOLOKS!!!!!!!!!"
"bloody_vampiru_dracul","8","6","11","2 March 2008"," An enjoyable film with a few flaws
","MANY SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW (although, uh, I hope you know the historical spoilers already) I went into The Other Boleyn Girl without having read the book, so I have very little knowledge of any differences between the two. (A friend, who had read it, said the major difference is Mary's attitude toward Anne -- I read the last few pages of the book after seeing the film and even then it's plain to see that the Mary in the book is less affectionate and less forgiving, while in the film she is much kinder and softer and eventually ""makes peace"" with Anne.) I'd love to say that I left The Other Boleyn Girl absolutely pleased, but there were a few flaws in the film that I couldn't overlook.<br/><br/>The editing wasn't TERRIBLE, but it left me a bit disappointed. There were many time jumps in the film - understandable, since it begins with Mary's wedding to a merchant and ends with Anne beheaded and Mary taking Elisabeth out of court. However, the time jumps were not treated very well in most cases -- they would just JUMP without any sort of transition. One example would be Mary Boleyn being forced to leave court because of Anne's wishes, and then the very next scene is Anne giving birth. It's obvious that there is a time jump, but it didn't work very well without some sort of transition.<br/><br/>The ending seemed very rushed to me. It went too quickly. There was no tension in the scene of Anne's trial, no dramatic build up -- as the scene that (I would expect) most viewers to be familiar with (that is, Anne's death) it would've helped to build up to the moment instead of just rushing through the trial, Mary's begging of the king to save Anne, and then the execution.<br/><br/>The subtitles describing what happened to several of the key players was interesting, but I felt poorly worded. The last bit about Elizabeth had me and a friend cracking up, because it was just terribly cheesy. Yes, I think they should've mentioned that Elizabeth ended up being one of the greatest rulers in English history, but the way it was worded was just... very bad. (I also felt they should've mentioned something about Henry and Jane Seymour, as well as the rest of the wives he took and their fates. Or at very least that he remarried several times.) There are good points, of course.<br/><br/>The costumes are absolutely luscious -- I found myself watching the way that the colors of Anne's dresses began to change throughout the film. (I'm a costume person, so I don't expect other people to really care, but...) Anne begins in happy blues and greens, transforms into the Queen and takes on her sister's colors of yellow and red, dons Queen Catherine's colors of dark Spanish black, and ends in a royal blue befitting of the role.<br/><br/>The acting is more than satisfactory. While it took a few minutes to get used to Natalie Portman speaking with a British accent, she pulls it off well and it seems natural once you get into it. Natalie Portman was one of the best actresses in this film, and although it's a much, much different portrayal of Anne Boleyn than most films, she pulls it off spectacularily. She's ambitious but aware that it's all falling apart due to her own actions. Her death scene was very tragic (although a bit inaccurate, as she would've placed her head on a block.... but this film is not for people looking for historical accuracy) and although it differed very very much so than in the book, the last moments of Mary and Anne looking at each other was memorable.<br/><br/>Eric Bana and Scarlet Johannson are wonderful as well. I can't think of anybody that was bad in the film, actually, except the actress for Jane Parker/Seymour was a bit annoying.<br/><br/>All in all, it's an enjoyable movie. I wouldn't consider it a good film for history buffs that can't get over inaccuracies, or for people who find themselves incapable of loving a film different than the book, but I can imagine that even the typical teenager will enjoy the dramatic passions and love affairs of the film."
"ccthemovieman-1","4","7","14","8 September 2008"," Catty, Soapy & Sexist
","If there is one thing I can't stand, it's catty women. Anyone who's hung around an office filled with women long enough knows what I mean. I am also not a fan of sexism, which is usually directed toward women. In this movie, though, it's against men where every male is pictured as a low-life. Just about everyone here has poor intentions and few morals, except perhaps the Boleyn girls mother ""Lady Elizabeth Boleyn"" (Kristen Scott-Thomas), but she's no angel, either.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Boleyn sisters - ""Anne"" (Natalie Portman) and ""Mary"" (Scarlet Johansson) - and others provide much of the cattiness. The whole idea is for some people to gain favors and be in good stead with King Henry VIII and the best way, of course, is to have sex with him.<br/><br/>Frankly, I don't find Natalie Portman the least bit sexy and Scarlett Johansson, the other suitor for the king, is overrated beauty-wise, too. The third part of the sexual triangle is the king, ""Henry Tudor,"" played by Eric Bana. Whether he's attractive or not, I'll leave up to the female audience.<br/><br/>All I know is that the film is a ""chick flick"" and it's a pretty film to look at, with good production values. I appreciated the visuals but the story is mainly for soap opera fans, those who like to watch other shed tears, in addition to their own.<br/><br/>From what the British reviewers say here, it's not too accurate, either. Knowing the world of films, that's not surprising."
"tedg","Null","5","9","28 September 2008"," Closed World
","I'm an easier audience than most. Cheap effects, poor production skills by modern standards and cheap theatrics are all ignored when there is even the dullest of hooks. I grab and am willingly pulled through. Hey, I even liked ""Miss Congeniality."" I even cried at the disgustingly manipulative ""Little Miss Sunshine.""<br/><br/>So I could have cruised through this, hanging on the one device it has: our surrogate viewer in Mary. It could have worked too, if Scarlett was a deeper actress and was able to convey that all the lushness we see is because her eye is in a decorated mind. It could have worked if it wasn't such a closed world.<br/><br/>The ""closed world"" deal means this: everything we see is ""explained"" or tightly bound up in the story? Henry is king? Well then his kingliness is bound up exclusively in dressing, having fun and worrying about babies. There's no tie to anything outside what is carefully strung together with visible ribbons. No character, no urge, no happening crosses the shell that contains what we see. This is underscored by the way the cinematographer handles the visuals. Yes, he gives us more lushness in framing and positions than usual. <br/><br/>But in keeping with the costumes, these are all from a well known vocabulary, just more elaborate. And the physical framing is closed world. Its stagy. There's nothing that bleeds off the frame to imply that there is anything at all in the universe but what you see.<br/><br/>This is why people call this soap opera-ish. It isn't because of the emotional dynamics themselves, which are strong enough to matter in a worthwhile container. Its this notion from the TeeVee that there are only a few people in the world and the story is just a matter of who sleeps with who.<br/><br/>But there's a larger opportunity missed here. There really are only two choices you have when combining great societal movements with personal emotions in this way. Either you can posit a world of great souls who somehow pull the world into a future, shaping by the power of being they have. Then we study that power.<br/><br/>Or you go the way that things seem to the audience: things happen that are uncontrollable triggering incidental forces on the people who are in the way: political leaders and interesting people notwithstanding. Its something friendly to the noir tradition that we know a lot about now. They did neither here, and since they didn't give us a known cosmos, that stifling of the closed world is accentuated.<br/><br/>Too bad. This was an interesting time, leading up to and preparing the way for the literary enlightenment that still glows, now in film. The times literally resulted in a storied way from what emerged from then through Shakespeare and Harriot, through settling the new world with idealists rather than simple catholic thugs.... on through to the creation of the rich vehicles for thought we have now: like the stuff a available to grab for this film and this comment. <br/><br/>Henry was a responsible monarch, less driven by personal desire to see a spawn rule, but more concerned about shaping the future. That meant severing ties with the Catholics, a tie denoted by his marriage. She had to go for reasons outside her womb. The entanglements of religion, wealth, power had to be reshaped. We know he was most thoughtful in this, that he recognized a dying feudal system and the rise of urbanism. We know that his daughter  far less intelligent  followed through with his plan and got all the credit.<br/><br/>None of this open world stuff is visible here. The women don't even seem desirable, and that blows the whole soap opera deal.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."
"prahachic","2","5","9","7 March 2008"," Very Disappionted
","I was looking very forward to this film but the utter disregard for historical accurateness totally ruined the hole film for me. In history these events took place in a period of 10 years but the movie makes it seem they took place in two years. You can't separate a kingdom from the most powerful church in the world in a just a couple of months neither can you disregard a queen in that time! Also the attraction Henry had to Anne was that of intellectual and utter amazement at her stubbornness toward himself as the king, when Anne finally gave herself to him she did it when she knew she would be queen and not him raping her out of anger. That was probably the part that made me angry more than any of the historical atrocities.<br/><br/>The actors did very good but for someone like me who knows right from wrong when it comes to the Tudor dynasty a movie like this is what makes people ignorant!"
"janecreates-1","1","6","12","12 July 2008"," badly shot fluff with great acting from the ladies
","Its obvious that this was shot by someone who is used to TV - the camera work is very average when compared to other films made about this period in history. It's also not made terribly clear that this is a complete work of fiction and not historical fact, which leads to confusion. 'Anne of a thousand days' was a far better film on all counts - makes me cry every time! Not so with this offering, although I thought Nathalie Portman did her best, as did Scarlett Johannson, the costumes did not fit them properly, and although colourful were clumsily put together. They did not look their best, as the lighting was so unexciting. Both struggled to really take off in dramatic terms because they were hampered by poor production ( did they run out of money half way though?.. I'm sure, in one scene, I saw a set of ready made curtains I've seen in a well known furnishing store!). The script is also weak in places and lacks tempo. Very much a 'b' movie.shame - I normally love a big period drama! I went home and got out Cate Blanchetts Elizabeth to remind me what great production is and can do for a good actor."

"Robert_duder","9","4","7","18 March 2008"," Brilliantly performances in a riveting story whether fiction or otherwise
","It seems like as of late if you decide to make a historical film or period piece you better have time traveled back and triple checked your facts. It seems to me that so many reviewers and movie goers are forgetting the key element to the movies...to have fun...to be entertained. Sure some films can do other things for us but this is still the key to Hollywood. I know little to nothing about the true history of Anne Boleyn, although after seeing the film it did encourage me to read into it which makes the film worthwhile in the first place. The story that they create is captivating and truly riveting. I found myself just enthralled by the story and the characters. It's not fast moving or full of action and yet I just couldn't stop watching and I wanted to know where everything was going. Director Justin Chadwick seems to be relatively new to the big screen direction process and yet he knew exactly how to deliver the story and what was or was not important. Granted he had the incredible opportunity of 2 HUGE Hollywood starlets but even still he had a story to tell and get the most out of it and he succeeds in a big way. You aren't overwhelmed by the time of the film, completely drowned with beautiful flourishing dresses and castles a la Marie Antoinette (see my review but not the movie) but rather gives you a little of that and a lot of story and character.<br/><br/>There are some truly fantastic performances in this film. Natalie Portman gives an Oscar worth performance as the twisted and disturbed Anne Boleyn. Her character goes through something of a transformation and yet you see her twisted personality shine through a little right from the beginning. Her character and her performance is the best I've seen this year!! Scarlett Johansson proves she is more than her looks with her very impressive performance as the more tender hearted and eventually scorned sister Mary Boleyn. Her performance is not on par with Portman's but she does very well nonetheless. The two of them have great chemistry together and do an amazing job carrying the film. Eric Bana...how can the guy who brought The Hulk be rewarded by being in a film with Portman and Johansson? And they are both his love interests? I am kidding of course. Bana is actually very good as the torn and decent but love struck King Henry. He's also rugged and sexy for the women and probably nothing like the real King Henry but has electric chemistry with Johansson and his obvious infatuation with Portman's Anne Boleyn is perfect. Jim Sturgess makes a small appearance as Portman and Johansson's brother, Kristin Scott Thomas and Mark Rylance are excellent as the Boleyn parents, and David Morrissey is brilliant as the evil Duke of Norfolk who wants nothing more than to further his family name.<br/><br/>I am a history fan and a student of history and I don't give a lick how much this film is historically accurate. Some of it is likely lifted from history and some of it is added for dramatic element and to ENTERTAIN!! I have no doubt, as I mentioned, that King Henry Tudor was rugged and built like a Greek god nor that the Boleyn girls looked hot and sexy like the cover of a magazine or that The Duke of Norfolk had evil villain music playing behind him at all times. The movie was meant to entertain and it does that with a twisted tale of romance and deception to the highest ranks that nearly brings down an empire. If anything it will inspire you to read more of the true story which is even better. For a period time piece such as this you will want to check it out because the performances alone are stunning, especially Portman and the story will keep you riveted right to your seat. It's not often you get truly great stories like this early in the year so definitely check it out because I loved it!! 9/10"
"meadowlark1759","4","4","7","2 March 2008"," Tudor soap opera
","Well, I had high hopes for this movie. Sigh. I have NOT read the novel (and am unlikely to, if it is half as bad as the movie). The acting was decent but the script left a LOT to be desired. They tried to fit way too much into a two hour movie. As a result, some major players were left out. Cardinal Wolsey, a MAJOR player in the real story of Anne and Henry, is mentioned once in passing; the main villain in the movie is the Duke of Norfolk.<br/><br/>The settings were another problem. Why, oh why, do directors now use cathedrals as settings for palaces ?! It was done in Elizabeth The Golden Age, and again in this movie. Do Tudor manor halls or palaces no longer allow filming? Even Hever Castle was not used ! Oh, and apparently the landscape of Kent has changed drastically since the 16th century, because in the movie, the King travels through either Yorkshire or the Scottish moors to get to Hever. It sure in heck isn't the Kent landscape I remember when I traveled to that castle!<br/><br/>The costumes are appalling. Horrid patterns and very fake looking jewels. At one point, the Boleyn girls wear a matching fabric with a very modern looking round scale-like design; Mary's is a gold color, and I swear she reminded me of a goldfish in it !<br/><br/>The whole movie is melodramatic and soap-opera-ish. The director took a cue from ""Barry Lyndon"" and used mostly natural lighting in interior scenes. That is admirable, to an extent, but somehow in this movie it comes off as just too dark rather than atmospheric. The editing is choppy as well.<br/><br/>If you want to see a GOOD movie about Anne Boleyn, check out ""Anne of the Thousand Days"" (which has recently been released on DVD, by the way)."
"zgowans","5","4","7","29 February 2008"," Does what it was intended to do
","All in all the movie was OK. The only thing that was wrong with it was that it moved too quickly, a common downfall of a novel done as a movie. The acting wasn't bad and the costumes were beautifully done. Believe it or not, while his accent may have been a bit off, Eric Bana does a great job of playing King Henry and Anna Torrent does an even better job of playing Catherine of Aragon. Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman also do a good job fulfilling their roles as well, not to mention they make great eye candy for all those guys who'll end up taking their girlfriends to see it.<br/><br/>To those who are saying that it butchered history and was an awful reflection of what really happened...of course! What historic movie in the Drama or Romance genre is accurate!? Bottom line, the movie did what it was supposed to which is provide dramatic entertainment."
"Ozzy2000","1","5","10","10 March 2008"," A very poor film
","The acting in this film was very poor to the point that it was boring. Eric Bana's portrayal of King Henry was totally inappropriate as his accent, his language and delivery was too heavy toned and desperate for the period and for some one of regal status at this point of history. It is the use of dramatic license that is used to imbue some sort of passion in what was a very dry and stoic King Henry the eighth. <br/><br/>There are many British actors who were far more appropriate for the role than an Australian ""Actor"". The recent production ""The Tudors"" proves my point extremely well. <br/><br/>Another silly film that is historically non factual."

","After Reading the well written book by Phillipa Gregory, I was anxious to see the film, hoping upon hope that Hollywood would, at the very LEAST, make it worth watching. They failed, other than at costume design.<br/><br/>Being a bit of a Henry VIII history buff, I devour as much as I can of the actual history. This film leads you to believe that Mary, Ann and Henry VIII were young people in their 20's. Nothing is further from the truth. Henry VIII, was in his late 30's to early 40's, while Mary and Ann Boleyn were merely in their mid-teens at the time that Mary became Henry's mistress. Of course, there's no way Hollywood could show this discrepancy and OBVIOUSLY politically incorrect (yet TRUE) version of history. The sad fact is that young women and girls were thrown at the king (and men in general) and were mere chattel to be used to further their family's prestige and wealth.<br/><br/>The film runs through the story like a runaway freight train, heedless of what was really going on.<br/><br/>My suggestion is skip the movie and read a good book instead."
"yellowraver05","10","8","19","29 February 2008"," Good for its Genre of Soap Opera Epics.
","I just got back from a 12:00 screening. Of course it was just me my two friends and like five other people (it was the first showing after all) and all I can say is that I was pleasantly surprised. Ignore the reviews. This movie is ten times better than Memoirs of a Geisha and granted its a soap opera of a movie, its really a good one.<br/><br/>Natatlie and Scarlett are surprisingly good. I mean a lot of the reviews were on the fence about both of them, but they pull it off, or they pull what they can with the accents. Portman is devilishly good as Anne. Yes this isn't a good representation about Anne (I prefer Anne of the Thousand Days, which historians and movie critics believe is probably the closest portrayal of the doomed Queen of a Thousand Days) but Peter Morgan did an excellent job in not fully adapting the book. The book made her out to be this delusional bitch who you really hate, but in the film he makes her a two dimensional character, which you hate one minute, and really, really love her the next. I am not going to give anything away, but what she goes through from both her Parents, her uncle, her sister, and of course henry and the court, its only fair in saying that the girl had the right to go a little crazy.<br/><br/>Scarlett is Mary, and she is sweet, loving, and of course a two dimensional character like Portman's Anne. Its so strange because in the book, she is the main character while Anne gets the supporting role, but in this film both Girls share the title of Other Boleyn Girl equally until the third act which is the final act, where it is clear Mary will forever be known as the ""other."" Bana is pretty bland in some parts. He is given nothing to do but yell, laugh, seduce, yell some more, and of course go a little mad. Female audience's as well as Bana lovers on these forums, he does show a lot of skin, more than the ladies Jim Sturgess who plays the elder brother George Boleyn, Ana Torrent who plays Katherine of Aragon, and Kristin Scott Thomas who plays Elizabeth Boleyn the mother of Anne and Mary are all equally good in their supporting roles, especially Ms. Thomas who I am so happy is getting work. She is still beautiful and when I was watching her I could not stop thinking that she is Katherine Clifton from the English Patient. Sturgess is also a promising talent. He and the girls had great chemistry.<br/><br/>the overall direction is way much better than The Golden Age. Yes okay the plot borderlines Age's soap opera, but Chadwick made Boleyn Girl a good soap opera. It is not over the top in technicals, its subtle textures, and gorgeous costumes from Sandy Powell are all excellent. The score is also subtle and haunting, nothing like the huge epic blasting in Golden Age.<br/><br/>Overall I give it an 10 out 10. Its enjoyable, and the performances fit the roles. Portman and Scarjo have a lot of chemistry. It was nice to see them act alongside each other. I think if it had been released for Awards considerations I think costumes, score, and art direction would have been nominated, along with maybe cinematography (the countryside shots, as well as palace balls and banquets and Anne's coronation are beyond gorgeous to look at!) This film isn't supposed to be taken seriously. I mean look at the material it is based on. The film was made to be enjoyable whether you agree with the story or not. We all know that it is not real, but that is the point of making movies to tell stories we hadn't heard before. This film isn't a history lesson. Its more of a character study between two sisters who were forced by their family to be rivals."
"Luluhalabaloo","3","3","5","19 January 2009"," A TV movie at best
","I had high expectations for this film, loving everything about that time frame. But when it first began, I thought that this looked like a made for TV movie and checked the listing again. <br/><br/>I found the film very claustrophobic, dark, dull and frankly, boring. The costumes were awful - silly really. The girls looked like twins with only the colour of the dresses telling them apart. The dresses were dull, no great patterns, jewelry, or anything remarkable. Even the hair just look flat ironed and boring. True to the time? I don't know - I cannot imagine that they really did not have more variety. <br/><br/>Makeup? Hello! Where was the makeup artist? Even the Egyptians wore makeup. And I could not look at those weird hats after a while. Really? Everyone wore them? Without much variety again? It seemed like all the costumes were recycled over and over again. <br/><br/>The movie felt filmed on sets for almost everything. There was never a sense of space to me, just one set to another, and some really strange shots as if there was a limited space so we needed a body part up close like an elbow then another character in the distance to indicate space. This seemed like a very under-budget way of directing to me. <br/><br/>The acting though I enjoyed, and even if the story wasn't entirely factual, it was fun, and seemed to ring true as to the nature of Anne Boleyn. <br/><br/>Ultimately, this seemed like a TV movie fitted to the big screen (as opposed to the usual vice versa). So much room for so much gorgeousness, wasted in tight shots and dinginess."
"robert-temple-1","4","3","5","27 July 2008"," Shameless exploitation film, inferior re-tread with bad direction
","The BBC made a TV series of this in 2003 and then decided to flog that horse again, so this was the result, an inferior feature film, very badly directed indeed by Justin Chadwick. The casting is terrible. The history is nonsense. (Anne Boleyn was the younger sister, not the older one as misrepresented in the novel, etc., etc.) Despite the terrible flaws in this misconceived monster of a project, some sterling performances do stand out. The most impressive is Ana Torent, the Spanish actress who has been a favourite of true cineastes since she played a 12-year-old in 'El Nido' (1980). She nearly steals the film, and if it were not for Scarlett Johansson being so good, she would have. Johansson has a natural dignity and an innate sensitivity to period (as she showed in 'Girl with a Pearl Earring'), so she and Ana Torent were perfectly capable of directing themselves and pulling off magnificent performances. Natalie Portman was a casting disaster. In the first part of the film, obviously wholly lacking in any meaningful direction, she tries to portray the flighty young Anne but does so as a 2008 girl, complete with the same knowing looks and arrogant insouciance you would expect to find in that wonderful satire 'Clueless' (1995), rather than in a period drama. In the latter part of the film, where at last she has a definable character and situation which she can at last figure out, she delivers some very powerful dramatic acting indeed, but always with too modern a touch. She was simply not made for the 16th century, sorry. Australian Eric Bana is totally and even more disastrously miscast as King Henry VIII. Since everyone knows that Henry was gingery in appearance and inclined to corpulence, why do we see this ludicrous version of him as a kind of brooding macho chap who has just stepped in from the set of 'Star Trek'? For more than half of the film, everybody addresses the king as 'Your Grace', whereas for the whole of English history, no such form of address was ever used for a king, but was only used for bishops, dukes, and duchesses. More than halfway through, unable to re-shoot their earlier scenes, they suddenly realize their mistake and start calling him 'Your Majesty', but it is too late. David Morissey is way, way over the top in his portrayal of the Duke of Norfolk. There was clearly no directorial control with this production at all. Was Chadwick sitting gagged and bound in a corner, one wonders? Even that old pro Kristin Scott-Thomas wobbles in her early scenes, unsure of what everybody is meant to be doing. Mark Rylance looks like he needs to run and do diarrhoea in every scene. Eddie Redmayne does very well, which I am glad to see, as he never went to drama school and defied parental advice to be a banker, so he pulled it off before his father's three years of support was up, well done Eddie. Juno Temple does as well as she could in an undefined part with no help. Why do they keep doing this to history? Why don't they just tell the TRUE stories and be accurate once in a while? Truth is more interesting than all this nonsensical, exploitative fantasy. The producers, director, script writer, head of the BBC, and the whole sorry lot responsible for this abomination should be taken out and shot. No, correction, - beheaded! Must get it right!"
"EUyeshima","5","3","5","11 June 2008"," Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselvesand Their Greedy Families in 16th-Century Tudor England
","When they were publicizing the theatrical release of this film during a fluffy interview with Matt Lauer on ""The Today Show"", Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman came across as two attractive, sensible young women who admired each other to no end. Ironically, that bonding is exactly what works against the movie, specifically the lack of a sharp edge in their characters' intractable relationship which dilutes how far sibling rivalry can go in shaping fates and destroying lives. Granted there's a palpably pulpish tone to this fanciful 2008 historical fiction based on Phillipa Gregory's 2002 novel, but the royal intrigue in the House of Tudor is overwhelmed by melodramatic flourishes and transparent character development. First-time feature director Justin Chadwick (BBC's ""Bleak House"") has made a handsome film with an attractive trio of stars, but he places most of his focus on the soap opera elements of the book's adaptation by Peter Morgan, a specialist in merging fiction with truth (""The Queen"", ""The Last King of Scotland""), and lays waste to what could have been a more fully rounded historical drama.<br/><br/>The overstuffed story begins with a cursory portrayal of the Boleyn sisters, headstrong Anne and diffident Mary. Even though Mary is married to wealthy courtier William Carey, the sisters soon find themselves in a competition for the affections of King Henry VIII, thanks to the machinations of their weak-willed father Thomas and their Machiavellian uncle, the Duke of Norfolk. Henry is initially drawn toward Mary's gentle nature, siring an illegitimate son as he is still married to the barren Catherine of Aragon. However, Mary's difficult pregnancy and mandatory bedrest opens an opportunity for Anne, who uses all her cunning wiles to land the King. At the expense of Mary's happiness, Anne succeeds but not before the creation of the Church of England and her own ascension to England's Queen. Meanwhile, Henry evolves from gregarious womanizer to haunted despot, and everyone already knows what becomes of Anne at the end. The film's perspective alternates between the sisters, thus reducing Henry to a convenient plot device. Thanks to the film's broad brush strokes, the challenge for the viewer is to monitor the imbalance between the sisters. For instance, Mary is rather bland in her virtue but her story is affecting, while Anne is comparatively intriguing in her blind ambition but her fate feels less than tragic.<br/><br/>I still think Johansson is the more natural temptress on screen, but she actually plays Mary and manages to elicit sympathy to her character with surprising ease. However, Portman gets the lion's share of meaty scenes and runs with them, especially a couple of effective face-offs with Henry. As expected, both are alluring in period costume even as their accents waver a bit. As Henry, Eric Bana seems to have been hired for his brooding persona and beefcake appeal, while the character's lightning-fast transitions make Henry an elliptical figure at best in Morgan's truncated script. Kristin Scott Thomas again brings her innate chilliness to the abbreviated role of Boleyn's mother, while there are mildly interesting turns by Jim Sturgess (""Across the Universe"") as devoted brother George, Mark Rylance as Thomas, and David Morrissey (Sharon Stone's befuddled paramour in the execrable ""Basic Instinct II"") as the Duke of Norfolk. Spanish actress Ana Torrent brings conviction to her few scenes as Catherine of Aragon. Sandy Powell, no stranger to the period (""Shakespeare in Love""), designed the exquisite costumes, while John Paul Kelly's sumptuous production design feels authentic. Kieran McGuigan's richly colorful cinematography is undermined by his recurring tendency to use a side-swipe effect to transition shots. Production details aside, the film remains stubbornly hollow at its core.<br/><br/>Starting with Chadwick's zealous albeit sometimes overly technical commentary track, the 2008 DVD has a robust set of extras. Thumbnail sketches of the film's historical figures are provided in brief video snippets with insight provided by scholars and various members of the cast. Two featurettes are also included - a ten-minute short, ""To Be a Lady"", which discusses the severely limited role of women in the 16th century, a theme addressed pretty well in the film; and another ten-minute short, ""Translating History to Screen"", which prominently features Gregory and focuses on how a voluminous bodice-ripper of a book had to be pared down to a running time of 115 minutes. Separately, there are twelve scenes presented, mostly expanded versions of the ones that ended up in the film and none I would consider indispensable to the final cut. Rounding out the extras is a brief reel of a test used to calibrate the HD cameras used during the shoot, as well as eight previews of other films."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","3","5","8 May 2008"," Soap opera in glamorous style
","I'm not sure how purists for historical facts view this movie, but they may wish to be aware that the motivation for making it may well be to find something to put two of the hottest young actresses together. The script handles the intriguing story at high places with astonishing simplicity  king falling for the modest, innocent one (albeit a married woman) while spurning the spirited, flirting other, who later makes a comeback with a new strategy that worked  playing hard to get.<br/><br/>Everybody from script writer, director to actors are playing safe, coming up with a movie that is mildly entertaining but with little emotional depth. Eric Bana, trying to portray a somewhat different Henry the VIII, comes up with a half-baked humanized monarch that is neither interesting nor convincing. The two Boleyn girls obediently deliver what they are supposed to deliver in their respective characters, and not much more. I'm much more impressed instead with the two strong women. Always dependable Kristin Scott Thomas is awesome, and I particularly like the scene when she blandly answers the King who asks for her daughter with a question, ""Which one?""  and she said it twice, staring at him, unblinking. Equally awesome is Ana Torrent as Queen Katherine, with icy dignity. It's also a pleasure watching Jim Sturgess playing the girls' brother while remembering him in ""Across the universe"" as Jude (i.e. The Beatles' ""Hey Jude"").<br/><br/>Coming out of the movie, all I'm left with is a mental exercise of visualizing how the movie would be like with the title roles switched. It could be fun and you can do it with at least a couple of dozen other movies. The one that comes to mind immediately is ""3:10 to Yuma"" with Russell Crowe and Christian Bale."
"bek_leigh87","5","3","5","24 March 2008"," Disappointed...the book was excellent
","I made sure I read the novel before I saw the movie and I am very glad I did! The film did not cover most of which was in the novel and was nowhere near as intriguing or exciting. I was so disappointed, the costumes were beautiful but it was such a shame as this could have been a truly wonderful movie if someone had bothered to write a decent script! Scarlett Johanssen and Natalie Portman gave an adequate performance but it wasn't amazing and unfortunately, Eric Bana did not have much of a speaking role at all. Certain important parts were left out, for example, the birth of Mary's firstborn, Catherine, and then some things were just plain made up like the rape scene and the beginning which made no sense at all! I really hope in years to come, a brilliant director gives this another shot and creates a movie that reflects the greatness of the novel."
"rikslo78","6","3","5","20 March 2008"," better than expected,
","I heard some truly awful reviews of this film, which i now feel were unfounded. Yes so the accents are a bit dodgy, yes Eric bana is as wooden as Pinocchio, but there was a lot that was good about the film. I felt Katherine of Aragon really stole the show, she was the one honest character in the whole film! Natalie Portman was excellent as the conniving Anne, Scarlett Johansson well cast as the naive, confused Mary, and excellent support from David Morrisey as the mischievous Norfolk. It really summed up life in the 16th century. Women were just pawns in a mans world, even though Anne challenges this fact. It was a tad slow in the middle, and large plot lines like Henry's split from Rome were missed out, but the acting was solid for the most part. One word of caution though, the film was very adult for a 12a. Do not take any under 12s to this film, not unless you want to explain rape and incest to them. I thought the story went a little too far in that regard. Its no Elizbeth, but worth a watch!"
"imxo","5","3","5","14 March 2008"," Excruciatingly Dull Costume Drama. And did I say dull?
","Bana, Johannson, Portman: what a waste of acting talent there is in this dullfest called ""The Other Anne Boleyn."" The cinematography was muted, washed out, and dull. The music was, if anything, even duller. The dialog seemed straight out of a high school drama class.<br/><br/>How dull was it? I fell asleep twice, only to be woken up by a poke on the arm. Man, was it boring.<br/><br/>As far as I am concerned, the only positive aspect of the movie comes from stimulating my interest in finding out more about the Boleyn girls. I should have stayed home and read the Wikipedia entries instead of actually going to see a dramatization of their lives in this film."
"richard_sleboe","6","3","5","12 March 2008"," Maid in England
","I don't like period pieces. The only reason I went to see this was Natalie Portman. What puzzled me was that the theater was packed with young women, nicely dressed and giggling. In that respect, you might say the audience was a mirror image of the on-screen action. I guess the girls were there for Natalie too. Or maybe it's the fancy dresses. I have it on authority that girls like fancy dresses. Surely they couldn't have been there for the movie as such. Or could they? It turned out not to be such a dusty duck after all. I guess marrying for wealth and power never goes out of style. Think Moscow. Think Dubai. Hell, think Park Avenue. The way the story is told makes it easily digestible for a 21st century audience too; the scene in which Anne ogles Henry like he's just another juicy hunk feels thoroughly modern. Says producer Scott Rudin: ""If you're going to spend two or three years of your life working on something, you've got to be making the kind of movie that discusses and influences the culture and is engaged in the world you're living in."" Despite its merits, ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is not one of those movies. Unlike ""There Will Be Blood"" and ""No Country for Old Men"", both of which are recent Rudin productions as well. Forgive me for thinking that the best thing about ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" was the tiny black dress Natalie Portman wore when she went to promote the movie on Letterman."
"sbao77","4","3","5","10 March 2008"," uninspired petty drama...
","The story of this movie surrounds the petty infighting between the two Boleyn sisters vying for the king's affection. The king is portrayed as simply a womanizer who does nothing all day but to please the next lady in his court. The father was a unprincipled merchant who wants to achieve power by selling out his children and the uncle is a calculating duke using the Boleyn children to gain power. The only characters of some decency were the Queen, Lady Elizabeth Boleyn (the mother) and Mary Boleyn. However, their performances were so low key and unemphasized that throughout the entire movie, the overpowering feeling is that everyone is petty, calculating and had very little to do but indulge in personal drama. The plot and the characters made this into a big-screen daytime soap opera. Maybe that was the goal of the story but if you hate pettiness in people, this movie will bore and irritate you at the same time. I really disliked it except for some fancy costumes."
"wilippa","8","3","5","10 March 2008"," Gripping Drama but ambitious and inaccurate.
","I always thought it was overly-ambitious to try to turn Philippa Gregory's novel The Other Boleyn Girl into a film. It turns out, I was almost right. The novel took liberties with history and the film takes liberties with the novel - and with history - but they do say that you should never let the truth get in the way of a good story. And it is a good story; albeit hastily told. The breakneck pace of the plot leaves some holes (what happened to Mary's first husband?, for instance) that will confuse anyone who hasn't read the book and some of the story's more touching aspects have been entirely ignored. It seems that detail and subtlety have been martyred to the expediencies of fitting a decade of history into two hours of cinema. That said, the film is a feast of sumptuous period drama, charting the changing affections of a fickle absolute monarch and the shifting relationship between his erstwhile mistress and her determined sister. Natalie Portman convinces ably as the callous and self-serving Anne, willing to sacrifice everything, including her sister's happiness, for her own position; but her ambition makes it hard to care much for her, even as she weeps on the scaffold. You can't help but think she brought it upon herself. Moreover, she is somewhat eclipsed by Scarlett Johannson's moving and very human performance as Mary. Her pain at her sister's betrayal and her subsequent determination to stand by Anne make her the indisputable heroine of the story. Eric Bana plays a conflicted Henry well, a man who barely has the time to fall out of love with one sister before the other is thrust in front of him. His fear of leaving his realm heirless and his reluctance to put aside his blameless first wife give depth to what would otherwise be a lustful and petulant man. The supporting cast all hold their own in roles that give them little scope to fulfil their potential. It seems a shame to give an actress like Kristin Scott Thomas so little screen time. Lovers of history and fans of the novel will both be aggrieved by the inaccuracies, and perhaps we should not be too hasty to dismiss such protests as pedantry. I, for one, eagerly await the day that a period drama can be both accurate and gripping. For now, this film competently achieves the latter."
"lisa-1006","Null","3","5","29 February 2008"," Question for ""Old Fashioned and Heavy""
","I haven't seen the film yet but I'm a huge English history buff and have followed the story of King Henry since I watched the PBS series about his life and six wives as a young girl. That being said, I have to ask - is there some OTHER reason why Henry broke with the Catholic church and founded the Church of England beyond freeing him up to divorce Katheryn of Aregon and marry Anne Boleyn? If there is, please do tell. After more than 30 years of reading (non-fiction) and following this story, I have heard of no other.<br/><br/>Also, why do you say that this is a film for an older era? The history surrounding King Henry's monarchy are more compelling and captivating than any fiction and led to extraordinary changes in the history of the country that echo into the modern era. It is a timeless and fascinating story of ambition, fear, greed, and yes, love. While this film may not accurately depict the complete story, it is still entertainment and may well lead to stimulating a new generation to learn more.<br/><br/>Just my thoughts."
"blake102479","1","4","8","26 March 2008"," Completely Different then the Book
","The book and the movie should never have been connected. The only things they have in common are the title and the names of the characters. If you've read the book you are going to be very disappointed and if you read the book after watching the movie you will be amazed by how the two are completely different. They tried to fit too much history in to, too small amount of time. Several key elements are left out, characters are portrayed in a completely different light from the book. I believe that even some of the names of places were incorrect. The acting was not that great either, but then again an actor can only do so much with what they are given. The only good thing that I can say about the movie is that the costumes were beautiful as were the sets."

","I had read the book and now I had just seen the film with my mother. I thought both book and film are excellent. I did get confuse of the genre though, I mean is it an historical romance? or an historical drama? But I know the film is an historical romance because about the two sisters, Mary and Anne Boleyn pitting against each other for King Henry's affection. After Henry (Troy's Eric Bana) tires of his queen, Katherine of Aragon, he initially takes Mary as his mistress who bears him a bastard son. But Anne manipulates herself into the bedroom of the king forcing him finally to marry her on the promise that she will bear him a male heir to the throne. Mary is thus reduced to ""The Other Boleyn Girl"".<br/><br/>You know throughout the film I couldn't believe that Mary & Anne were very close to each other. But after Mary attended his majesty's wounds after an hunting accident. And at the palace Henry & Mary play ""that's-not-belly-button-that's-not-my-finger;"" then Mary bear him a bastard son. She also ""squealed"" on Anne of her secret marriage to Henry Percy. Now Anne hates Mary, but of course Mary was there for Anne as a queen 'til the end after all that happen during her reign and...well let's not go there.

"dbogosian-1","8","4","8","10 March 2008"," Solid effort, well worth seeing
","A few things up front: I never read the book, I love period movies, and I've always been interested in the Tudors. In light of that...<br/><br/>""The Other Boleyn Girl"" excels in many, many ways. The look and feel of the film are superb (I guess credit the art direction). There is always a brooding, mysterious, dark element in every visual. I think there were only two instances where we saw full golden sunlight, and those were two scenes, one at the very beginning and one at the very end, where children are shown running through a tall grass field.<br/><br/>The costumes are fabulous. The colors seemed a bit strong and almost gaudy for that era, but the clothes (men's and women's) are to die for.<br/><br/>Acting was very strong throughout. Scarlet as Mary Boleyn was fantastic, at first disliking the court and only going in order to help her sister's cause; then gradually warming up to Henry and eventually coming to love him; then her hardened, steely self towards the end as she sees her family come to disaster and herself as the only cool-headed person left who can do some good.<br/><br/>Portman's portrayal of Anne was terrific. She too went through a series of changes and made them all credible. Her gradual unraveling towards the end was particularly powerful and remained convincing.<br/><br/>Bana's Henry was, contrary to other reviewers' opinions, very engaging and quite central to the film. He was able to capture both the tenderness and poetic side of Henry along with his manic and despotic side.<br/><br/>Supporting roles were also well done: Queen Catherine, the Duke of Norfolk, Anne and Mary's brother, all had important contributions. Anne and Mary's parents, the Boleyns, were fascinating: the grasping of the father for advancement and riches, but always with some nagging doubts showing in his eyes; and the resigned strength of the mother who was powerless to interfere and could only watch her family's destruction.<br/><br/>Now, on the other hand, the script does suffer from numerous shortcomings. The language throughout is very much today's language, and one is often struck by phrases and sentiments which surely no one in that era could have conceived or framed in those words. There are a number of loose ends which the plot never ties up: what happens to Mary's son or her husband, for instance? And if Norfolk in the end betrays his family, why are we not given any insight to his moral wrestlings with this betrayal (after seeing him plot and scheme to advance the family interests all through the movie)? Music was generally weak; not at all period-appropriate, occasionally trying to be but generally not.<br/><br/>The most profound aspect of the movie is that it made one think about the role of women, how the only avenue for an ambitious woman to reach power and authority was to seduce a powerful man, and Henry was about as powerful as they got. To think that a miscarriage meant the difference between her being beheaded or being the most powerful woman in the realm is pretty amazing. <br/><br/>This is also a strong cautionary tale, as Anne seeks the security that comes from being married to the king, although the only way to do that is to convince him to annul his previous marriage which in turn makes all his future marriages just as easily revocable. The relationship between sisters is another dominant theme, part rivalry, part mutual support, and in the end unflagging devotion.<br/><br/>All in all, it is probably not the definitive portrayal of these characters, but it does capture one's imagination. Whether historically informed or not, the movie conveys a powerful sense of the turmoil and intrigue of the Tudor court."
"phantomtristan","4","4","8","3 March 2008"," A tale of two sisters
","Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, Eric Bana, a bestselling novel, and an Oscar-nominated screenwriterall these elements should form a brilliant, talented collaboration, but unfortunately the novel is hacked into an incongruent muddle of scenes which are further ruined by the atrocious editing.<br/><br/>It is based on Philippa Gregory's bestselling novel The Other Boleyn Girl, and tells the story of two sisters, Mary (played by Scarlett Johansson) and Anne Boleyn (played by Natalie Portman), who bother vie for King Henry VIII's (played by Eric Bana) affection (if only they knew he was not the one-girl-type). It is a time in England when girls were as their mother lady Elizabeth Boleyn (played by Kirstin Scott Thomas) put it ""Traded like cattle for the advancement and pleasure of men."" The girl's father (played by Mark Rylance) wants to catch the eye of the King to secure wealth and status by ""pimping"" his daughter Anne to be the King's mistress. King Henry passes over Anne in favor of the quiet submitting daughter Mary, but once she is pregnant with his illegitimate child, he quickly turns back to Anne who has returned to the court scene with a newfound sensual, seductive confidence. As Henry falls hard for Anne, Mary is quickly swept aside so the stage is set for the inevitable conclusion.<br/><br/>I did read the book and loved it. However I generally enjoy film adaptations no matter how far they stray from the book. Film and book are two completely different types of storytelling, so with that said the reason I did not like this film was not its major detractions from the book, but the incredible dull, emotionless production.<br/><br/>The acting from Natalie Portman, Eric Bana, and Kirstin Scott-Thomas was top-notch, especially Portman's (I am convinced had this been a better production and release date she would probably be garnering nominations). The rest of the cast could not hold up. Scarlet Johansson's acting was cringe-worthy as she never removed the same complacent, angelic expression from her face (she didn't even cry when her sister's head was chopped off!) and spoke in the same tone the entire film.<br/><br/>The production itself was not bad, the sets, costumes, etc. were all quite exquisite. The problem with this film was it had so many good aspects it could not make use of them. The editing, I must point out, was the downfall of this great story. All the scenes were so disjointed and quick that you never had time to get pulled into the story. Helping it along was the frustrating script which had lines spoken so impassively and for the sole purpose to inform the audience what was going on that it was devoid of any eloquence or originality. I felt there were whole sections left out that I knew because I had read the book, but someone new to it would be thoroughly lost.<br/><br/>This is such an unfortunate botching of an intriguing tale, and once again feels like the producers did not know what to do with all the talent they had. It not only is a horrible adaptation, but a very poorly done film that moved through its' material so quickly it lost its' emotional depth on the way. At the end you are left still waiting for it to start, and are so detached you do not even care about the characters whose lives were so horribly ruined. The only reason I would recommend anyone to see this film is to see Natalie Portman's performance which is utterly fascinating to watch as she plays this illustrious historical figure."
"ayudell","8","4","8","2 March 2008"," Great film with the right level of expectations...
","I walked into the theater to see The Other Boleyn Girl with extremely low expectations. I am not a Scarlett Johansson fan, and Natalie Portman has had her fair share of roles where she's left us wanting more. I assumed Eric Bana would be the bright spot in this nearly two hour long chick flick.<br/><br/>After leaving the film, I found out my initial assumptions could not have been any more the polar opposite of the film itself. Both the female leads (and in fact almost all the female characters) were played remarkably, and I felt that Natalie Portman specifically really outdid herself with portraying the emotional distress of her character. Eric Bana, conversely, was not cast properly for this role. Perhaps after his portrayal as Hector in ""Troy"" there was an assumption he could play royalty, which may indeed be true, but not not in this movie. And lastly, this is most definitely NOT a chick flick.<br/><br/>The film did step fairly closely to the realm of clichés, but the dialog and acting was credible enough to outweigh this. The costumes were not too elaborate as to take away from the film, and neither was the background music or camera work (both of which I found to be excellent).<br/><br/>Those who go in to see this movie as a film version of the television show ""The Tudors,"" be warned. This is not a chick-flick television show dragged out into 2 hours on screen, and has a few fairly suspenseful (and to some) frightening moments. Those who intend to see an accurate historical piece should also be warned; though the historical content of the movie to some extent seemed accurate, this film was not written by a ""History Channel"" employee. If you go in to the theater to see a well-acted and scripted drama, which will open your eyes (if you had no previous knowledge) to the story of the Boleyn sisters, then you will be very satisfied, and will most likely leave ranting and raving about this film.<br/><br/>8/10"

Anne was portrayed in the book as the most selfish, craziest girl in the world, making the reader have no sympathy for her whatsoever. In the movie, they tried to show the viewers a more vulnerable side to Anne. Natalie Portman was devilishly good in this movie and you could really feel the pain she was in near the end.<br/><br/>Eric Bana (incredibly charismatic) and Scarlett Johansson played their roles well as well, but Johansson never truly shone for me.

"Turfseer","5","2","3","28 November 2009"," The Other Boleyn can't hold a candle to 'Anne of the Thousand Days'
","For those who give high ratings to 'The Other Boleyn Girl', I can only suggest that you either rent or buy the superb 1969 film, 'Anne of the Thousand Days'. Both films basically deal with the same subject but there's really no comparison. Where 'Anne' is a complex historical recreation and magisterial drama, 'The Other Boleyn' is a ponderous soap opera, where numerous film-goers today have been taken in by the film's lavish production values (shot in High Definition), along with the three big name Hollywood stars who can't hold a candle to predecessors such as Richard Burton and Genevieve Bujold who really make you feel like you're watching flesh and blood human beings who lived in the 16th century.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book which the movie was based on but I question why it was necessary to tell Anne Boleyn's story through the eyes of her older sister Mary (inaccurately depicted as the younger sister here in this film). Mary's part in 'Anne of the Thousand Days' is wisely depicted as brief and her bitterness toward her father for 'pimping her out' to King Henry VIII is much more believable than Scarlett Johansson's Mary who continues to hold a soft spot for the King despite being unceremoniously dumped by him and bearing a child who was dubbed a bastard. Mary is basically depicted as a saint who we're supposed to identify with because she has a 'good heart'. Unfortunately, most saints make for boring drama and Johansson's Mary is no exception. Johansson did well in Woody Allen's well-scripted 'Vicky Christina Barcelona' but she is completely out of her element in the 16th century. Instead of a world weary traveler in the Tudor court, Johansson's Mary is more like an Amish-like simpleton whose grim and ponderous expressions suggest that she is an actor of extremely limited range. Mary has little to do in 'The Other Boleyn Girl'. Her two big scenes (the love scene with King Henry and the birth of her son) are devoid of substantial dramatic conflict.<br/><br/>What's worse is the suggestion that Anne and Mary were competitors for Henry's approval. In 'Anne of the Thousand Days', there was no competition between the two sisters. Mary's story was over when Anne comes on the scene. Genevieve Bujold defiantly states that she will never let the King do what he did to her sister and it takes a very long time in that film before Anne changes her mind. In The Other Boleyn Girl, Natalie Portman's Anne is a cold and calculating schemer from the beginning, inexplicably accusing her sister from taking the King from her. Later, she blames Mary for being responsible for the breakup of her secret union with Henry Percy. Ann's Uncle, the Duke of Northrop, orders that the two lovers separate. In 'Anne of the Thousand Days', the breakup is a matter of state policy. The head of the Catholic Church, Cardinal Wolsey, threatens Ann's lover and they're forced to part due to the King's designs on Anne. In 'The Other Boleyn Girl', Anne's undoing is attributed to what appears to be something like a bi-polar episode. After Henry rejects her because she can't bear a male heir, she becomes unhinged and ends up slapping him. In 'Anne of the Thousand Days', Anne is both the victim of Henry's cruelty and her own ambition to see her daughter declared the first in succession to the English throne.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Peter Morgan's view of Henry VIII is way off the mark. Thanks to Morgan's superficial portrait, Eric Bana, turns Henry into a GQ model rather than the petty but complex Henry of history. For those who are offended that I dare suggest that Bana isn't right for the part, I strongly urge you to watch Richard Burton in 'Anne of the Thousand Days'; afterward, come back and tell me with a straight face that you think Bana was right for this part. What's missing in 'The Other Boleyn Girl' is how Henry relates to members of his Court. Who are his friends and confidants? And of course there's the whole political intrigue of the court which is glossed over in 'The Other Boleyn Girl'. The key players, Cardinal Wolsey and the King's adviser, the deadly Thomas Cromwell, are missing. In 'Anne of the Thousand Days', there are a myriad of characters interacting with the King and as a result of these interactions, a full portrait of Henry's personality comes through. Here, Bana's Henry is dull and witless. What's more, Morgan's view of Henry and Anne's relationship has no real grace or drama. The best Morgan can come up with is a crude rape scene which reduces Henry to a comic book villain.<br/><br/>'The Other Boleyn Girl' is not without a few good points. Ana Torrent is brilliant as Katherine of Aragon, depicting the quiet dignity of a woman terribly wronged. David Morrissey is credible as the steely social-climbing uncle who holds the strings in the family. Kristin Scott Thomas as the Boleyn mother acquits herself well but she's a bit too much of a feminist icon for 16 century England. Mark Rylance was much too ineffectual as Sir Thomas Boleyn but he looks very good as a 16th century nobleman.<br/><br/>Production-wise, 'The Other Boleyn' is filmed in sumptuous high definition and the scenes in the English countryside are a pleasure to watch. The camera work is for the most part pretty good with first-time director Justin Chardwick shooting scenes from a multiplicity of angles.<br/><br/>In the end, 'The Other Boleyn Girl' is not the other Boleyn's Girl story. If you want the 'real McCoy', then you must see Richard Burton and Genevieve Bujold together. They are master craftsmen and you will be truly moved by their performances. The remake connects the dots but can never hold a candle to the 1969 production. Sometimes it's best to leave things well enough alone!"

","I give all credit to Scarlett and Natalie. What a great combination they made, two of the best of their generation. It doesn't seem like a very common thing to let two actresses of their age carry a film, so I also offer a solute to the director for the cast. I also happen to like Kristin Scott-Thomas, though I'm not so impressed with the roles she gets to do. I think she was marvelous as the mother. I'm not so certain about Eric Bana as Henry VIII. Henry was an imposing figure in his era, and I'm not sure Bana has the charisma to pull it off (I liked him better as Hector, though even there I didn't get the heroic stature that I thought a semi-mythical figure ought to have). I wonder how Stellan Skarsgard might have been as Henry. Ah well.<br/><br/>Truth is that now that I've seen this movie, I think I do want to see Anne of a Thousand Days. My reading of Anne's history is that she wasn't sent to France for misbehavior, she went there because she wanted to and stayed longer. So maybe I'll have to go back and look at the story again. If history had gone the way this movie did, I'd have been tempted to think the royal French court deliberately taught Anne so that she'd sow dissension at home since the English and French courts had a long history of jousting for preeminence in the European power scene. If Anne had to ""take it in the neck"" from such power politics, I'm sure France wouldn't mind that at all, would think it served her father right for his own use of girls to ""advance"" his family.<br/><br/>Anyway, I got it for Scarlett, who has the same effect on me she had on Henry. And she showed me once again how amazing she is, even fully clothed!"
"youroxgirl","2","2","3","22 June 2008"," Rubbish
","This film was terrible. Not only did it not stick to historical facts (which would be understandable since Gregory didn't either), but it also completely changed the plot of the novel. First off, the first twenty minutes or so of Mary getting married, etc were never even in the novel, and basically wasted space in the movie. There was just so much wrong with this movie, I cannot even go into it all. I even like all three of the main leads. What annoyed me the most though, was the choppiness of the film. It never took the time to properly explain anything so that if someone who nothing of the Tudor Era walked in to see it, they'd be left dumbfounded the entire 115 minutes. Ex: If you hadn't read the book, you think ""what the heck happened to Mary's first husband?"" Also, they never shell out the characters properly. Mary, the MAIN CHARACTER, is barely in the movie at all! And you never really understand the relationship with Stafford or any of it! Hm, the one thing that irritated me the most: Henry raping Anne? WHAT?!"

","The historical inaccuracies are mind-boggling. It feels like they sat down said 'Alright, we know that Henry will bang both of them and that Anne will have Elizabeth. That's all we need. Let's make the rest of it as sexy as possible.' The ironic thing being that with a PG-13 rating, you can't really be sexy. Especially not when you make Scarlett Johansson incredibly unattractive and knock down Portman's looks a few knots as well. They advertised it as this massively erotic soap opera and it was just a melodramatic, unappealing mess that couldn't have been further from sensual. The technical achievements are pretty solid; the cinematography, costume design and score are certainly among the best of the year so far but none of that makes the film worth watching. I would say that Natalie Portman's good performance makes the film slightly worth sitting through, but the positive aspect in that is completely cancelled out by the atrocity that is whatever Scarlett Johansson did. Calling that a performance would be an insult to performers. It was terrible."
"zellex","3","2","3","13 April 2008"," Faithful to neither history or the book
","Historical novels often take liberties with history; its expected. And screenplays often take liberties with novels; also expected. And historical screenplays based on historical novels? Hmmm.<br/><br/>Predictably, then, this movie takes huge liberties with historical fact and Phillipa Gregory's historical fiction, and that is not a good thing.<br/><br/>Firstly, events taking place over a number of years are condensed. Mary's rise to Anne's fall appears to be over a maximum of about three years in the film. Events that did not occur were created to ""add drama"" but they have a bad effect on the narrative (eg. Mary pleading with the king to spare Anne and the King's last minute note warning Mary not to do so again just before Anne was executed). And key real (or at lease reported) events were cut, despite the inherent dramatic effect (eg. Anne's use of the young Elizabeth to appeal to Henry, Henry deserting Anne during a tournament without a goodbye).<br/><br/>Secondly, despite the cumbersome, heavy-handed exposition by just about every character, the movie fails to convey the harsh realities of court life in the Tudor period, where one's progress up the ladder or descent to the scaffold could be the result of either or both intricate plots by rival courtiers or simply the king's mood.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the overall characterisation is pitiful. Oh, Anne has one or two moments, but what about the other characters? Mary is portrayed as weak and, despite the movie's name, seems to be only a foil for Anne. Where was Mary's triumphant courtship with Henry, where was the proof that she was a worthy rival of Anne's (eg. the ship named in her honour) and Mary's romance with Stafford was so lacklustre as to be unbelievable. Queen Katherine is left on the sidelines for most of the movie (except for her magnificent display of queenly outrage before the court when her marriage is called into question). The young men in the movie were almost indistinguishable - Stafford, Carey and George Boelyn all had so little screen time and looked so much alike, the director could have saved money by having one actor play all three parts.<br/><br/>And lastly, a little bit of costume research would not have gone astray."

","I expected a lot from this film, good director, brilliant cast and a big budget. I was highly disappointed. I read the book not long before I saw the film, If I hadn't read the book I probably would have liked the film a lot more. The Cast was outstanding, they really carried the film, Natalie Portman was extremely compelling as Anne Bolyen, Scarlett Johanson was wonderful too but she was overshadowed by Natalie Portman's Performance. Jim Sturgess was equally convincing as the brother. But Here I say what happened to George Boleyn's homosexuality? What happened to William Carey? Henry Percy said nothing in this film, he was a hopeless romantic that made many a women fall in love with him. Mary Boleyn had two children, a daughter and then a son. So all up It was a very average film. I would recommend the book more then I would recommend the film. 5 stars."

","Light on accuracy, light on characterisation and light on point  this film is essentially a vaguely pretty piece of flimsy material. Taking a famed piece of history and weaving some interesting supposition around it is a good start, casting some fine (and fine looking) actors is a great second step. Leaving them with nothing to work with and having the most interesting character (Henry) as little more than an extended cameo is disappointing and silly.<br/><br/>Johansson does her best with a tediously feeble Mary Boleyn, whose niceness quickly becomes insipid and annoying. Equally, Portman attempts to make Anne likable, when the script essentially has her as a spiteful bitch. Almost all the other characters are bland caricatures, with the exception of Bana's Henry, who would have been a great role if he'd had a few more scenes  powerful, conflicted and believable. Alas, this is a movie of poor decisions and the end product goes little better than Anne's marriage."

Natalie Portman was fantastic as Ann Boleyn, many scenes we can feel her feelings. Eric Bana however is terrible, a robot with few expressions. But Eddie Redmayne in his small paper was realy nice. Scarlet Johansson is only a pretty face.

","Reviewed June 2010<br/><br/>Though it features fantastic production values and decent acting, it falls quite short of an epic classic it could have been. <br/><br/>It is based on real events during the initial phase of Henry VIII's infamous six wives saga. This is a story of ambition, power, ego, jealousy and lust and the makers should have gone all out with an R rated content to induce the grit, drama and madness of the period; Instead it wimps out as an uninvolving paperback thriller. Main problem here is that it does not linger on any important moment as it jumps all over the place in a hurry that leaves us no character to care for. <br/><br/>Having said that, it should be appreciated for it's lavish sets and costumes, beautiful locales and all this richness captured in the best camera available today. Natalie Portman delivered a fantastic performance as the wily ambitious Anne Boleyn, a commoner who changed the face of England by making the already married King Henry part with the Roman Church to make way for her. Eric Bana looked apt as King Henry VIII and was especially good with his cold stares and authoritative one line repertoires. <br/><br/>Finally it is still an entertaining movie but if you know a bit about the history of this story you cannot ignore the potential that was not utilized."
"filipemanuelneto","3","1","1","2 August 2016"," It would be a better movie if it were historically accurate.
","This film is based on the love affairs between the English King Henry VIII and his two courtesans, Mary and Anne Boleyn, the second of which would become queen, though for a short period. Directed by Justin Chadwick, was written by Peter Morgan and has the participation of Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson and Eric Bana.<br/><br/>This film has its origin not on historical facts but on a historical novel by Philippa Gregory, slightly inspired by historical facts. So, this movie does not portray what really happened. An historical novel is not a history book and, unfortunately for the movie, this novel is bad, openly subverts the facts and omits some historical personalities that were crucial for this events. Basically, she almost rewrote history and Justin Chadwick obediently swallowed all the straw the book had without bothering to examine their veracity.<br/><br/>In fact, while this film portrays Mary Boleyn as a very serious girl, the truth is that she had a very bad reputation and maybe have had lots of lovers, in the French and English courts. As the Boleyn family machinations seem to be true, probably didn't have involved Anne because she fell in love with Henry Percy, heir to the duchy of Northumberland. Who probably also fell in love was the king, but we know that Anne rejected his advances. Thinking about it, we can almost hear Anne saying ""no, no way. Only after the wedding, I am a family girl"".<br/><br/>Returning to the film, and knowing now that the script is bad because it had a poor start (everything that is born crooked, later or never straightens), we can say that Eric Bana disappointed in the role of the English king: besides he not seem very inspired or comfortable with his character, Bana starred in a stupid violation scene. Henry VIII was a famous gentleman, a seducer, he didn't need to humiliate himself violating a girl, no matter what. Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson look good in the roles of the Boleyn girls and, judging by the portraits, they must be very similar to what the real girls were.<br/><br/>The most interesting thins in this film are the sets, the costumes and the visual effects. The scenarios are many, usually English cathedrals and palaces from that time. The costumes have been carefully designed to portray the historical period faithfully, radically contrasting with the script."

Although Natalie Portman played a decent Anne, she was played much better by Geneviève Bujold, Natalie Dormer, and Merle Oberon. The danger in a movie like this is that young people will think that Henry VIII actually raped Anne. There are no historical documents that reflect that. In addition, Mary was banished from Court and never to return after she married a commoner without permission. The one thing it did portray fairly accurately was the role of Anne's father.

","The Other Boleyn Girl is a drama film is a romanticized account of the lives of 16th-century aristocrats Mary Boleyn, one-time mistress of King Henry VIII, and her sister, Queen Anne, who became the monarch's ill- fated second wife, though much history is distorted.It features Natalie Portman,Scarlett Johansson,Eric Bana,Jim Sturgess and Kristin Scott Thomas.Mark Rylance,Ana Torrent,David Morrissey,Eddie Redmayne,Benedict Cumberbatch and Andrew Garfield co-stars.The screenplay by Peter Morgan was adapted from the novel of the same title by Philippa Gregory and it was directed by Justin Chadwick. <br/><br/>This period drama follows the fierce competition between sisters Mary and Anne Boleyn to win the affections of Tudor king Henry VIII. Both are under pressure from their father and uncle to help maintain the family's rich legacy and ensure their further prosperity by winning the affections of none other than the king of England. But life in the royal court is far different than it was in the countryside where these two sisters were raised, and before long their bid to earn the love of the king has transformed two once-happy sisters into bitter rivals. At first, it appears that Mary has triumphed in winning the king's favor by becoming his mistress and bearing him an illegitimate child. Despite her early success, however, Mary has underestimated just how clever and cunning her sibling can truly be. Not only does the relentless Anne manage to edge aside her sister in the eyes of King Henry, but she also succeeds in averting his gaze from his wife, Queen Catherine of Aragon, as well. Mary is driven by genuine affection for King Henry, while her sister Anne has only kept up the charade in a desperate bid to become the queen of England. Now, the growing chasm between two sisters is mirrored on a larger scale as England becomes divided more than ever before. As the consequences of their actions threaten to alter the course of an entire nation, these two sisters will ultimately discover that the only place they will find true strength and loyalty is in family.<br/><br/>A tale of two sisters competing for the same king, the film uses historical facts as window dressing for this work of fiction that is entertaining, if not wholly believable. Though it features some extravagant and entertaining moments, it feels more like a soap opera than historical drama.But nevertheless,it features an attractive cast and a familiar plot with some icky twists. Kieran McGuigan's cinematography is breathtaking and is as crucial to setting the film's tone as the dialogue.Also,the performances are really good."

"MBunge","6","1","1","16 June 2011"," A fine example of a movie that's good, not great.
","This soapy melodrama won't make anyone forget A Man for All Seasons or Anne of The Thousand Days, but it's well made, quite watchable and brings a new perspective to the story of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn.<br/><br/>That story should be familiar to most people. The king of England and his Spanish queen Katherine could not have a son. Tormented by his lack of a heir and what that would mean to the future of his kingdom, Henry fell under the spell of a young woman named Anne Boleyn. Unlike his other extramarital conquests, Anne refused Henry's affections until he was so consumed with lust for her that Henry cast off the Catholic Church and founded his own Church of England so he could divorce Katherine and marry Anne. But while her brains and her ambition made her queen of England, Anne's body betrayed her. She could not give Henry a son and learned that once Henry VIII got in the habit of replacing wives, it was hard for him to stop.<br/><br/>What this film brings to the tale is the fact that Anne wasn't the only Boleyn girl that caught Henry's eye. She had a sister named Mary and this movie supposes that it is she who first enchanted and bedded the king, even giving him a bastard son, before Anne was finally able to sink her claws into Henry.<br/><br/>The Other Boleyn Girl also emphasizes some of the brutal, practical realities of King Henry's English society, a world where grasping men sacrifice their wives and their children in their schemes for power and fortune. It is also a world where women, even the most capable or powerful, live with a pervasive oppression. They had no standing or rights that couldn't be taken away from them by their father or their husband.<br/><br/>The best things about this movie are, quite appropriately, Natalie Portman as Anne and Scarlett Johansson as her sister Mary. Portman handles her more flamboyant role with aplomb, combining fury, cunning and fragility in equal measures. Johansson gives a dignity and purity to the simpler, more ordinary and yet stronger Boleyn sister. David Morrissey is almost as good as the cold and calculating Duke of Norfolk, who is the first one to propose tempting Henry with Anne. Mark Rylance is also wonderful at portraying the pitiful weakness of Anne and Mary's father, while Kristin Scott Thomas as their mother and Ana Torrent as Queen Katherine are perfect as strong women bound down by the social order of their day. Eric Bana does everything he can with a poorly written Henry VIII. It's like these filmmakers never knew what to make of the English king, so the character just sort of alternates between being consumed by lust, vexed by fears for the future, yearning for normality and driven by unyielding pride. Bana pulls it all off well, but it doesn't add up to a complete and believable person.<br/><br/>Now, the film does take more than a few historical liberties and the direction of Justin Chadwick is never comfortable with the pomp and pageantry of a royal court. The story might also have benefited from being more focused and a little less ambitious, which is more of a backhanded compliment than a criticism. Dispensing with the melodramatic soap opera and concentrating on the gender and social mores that pushed women like Anne and Mary to do and consent to terrible things might have produced a much sharper and more provocative movie.<br/><br/>But you can't fault a good film for not being great. I like The Other Boleyn Girl and recommend it as a period piece that brings just enough modern sensibility to one of the great stories in history, breathing a little new life into the old yarn."

Although all the leading characters are actual historic figures, the film - like the book - is a work of fiction, so separating the real from the reel is a tricky task.<br/><br/>The three central characters - all quintessential members of the English nobility - are in fact played by non-British actors who nevertheless affect convincing English accents: Eric Bana as the king and Natalie Portman as the famous Boleyn and Scarlett Johansson as the other Boleyn. Some of the support roles are particularly well-played by the likes of Kristin Scott Thomas and Ana Torrent. This stellar cast - plus wonderful costumes and a slew of splendid English locations - makes this an immensely watchable film in which, in spite of the title, Portman has the meatiest role.

Even so, The Other Boleyn Girl doesn't end up being a bad movie. It's a gorgeous looking production, and it has a few exceptionally dramatic scenes, but the whole thing just doesn't amount to very much.<br/><br/>Personally I've never been fond of Natalie Portman. She strikes me as more of a 'girl' than a 'woman' in all her roles, and not simply because she is small. She plays more of a woman here, though I think she is more interested in looking pretty rather than powerful. Eric Bana is much better as King Henry. He is not just a pretty face.<br/><br/>The Other Bolelyn Girl, is pure melodrama, which is all it intends to be I guess. The whole thing just feels too loose, and unorganized, sometimes that can happen when adapting a book. It is best looked at as a smart chick flick."

Blonde and soft-spoken Scarlett Johansen plays blue-eyed Mary Boleyn, a sweet, submissive young girl who falls sincerely for the king and is unable to endure the cruelty of the court.<br/><br/>I was blown away by Natalie Portman in this movie. I have enjoyed her work in films like GARDEN STATE, but I thought of her as a sort of light, non-threatening girl next door type. It's amazing to see her give a performance worthy of Bette Davis at her greatest! Natalie makes Anne Bolyen into the darkest, most desperate, most desirable screen siren I have ever seen. Her emotions are so electric they sizzle and crackle in every scene! ""I cannot sleep . . . if I cannot sleep I cannot think . . . it becomes ever harder to arouse him and the measures I take always disgust him more each time!"" <br/><br/>Scarlett Johansen is radiant as Mary, who is so meek and gentle that it's easy to underestimate her character at first. But by the end of the film it's clear that Mary is not only a survivor, she is a strong woman capable of compassion even for the sister who has wronged her so many times.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have about this film is that Eric Bana gives a somewhat lifeless and timid performance as the robust, charismatic Henry VIII. I have enormous respect for Eric Bana. I thought he was brilliant in BLACK HAWK DOWN, even with a very small part. And I thought his performance in TROY saved the picture. But although he can be brilliant as a decent, honorable man of principle, he really doesn't seem to be ready to tap in the truly nasty side of human nature. The real Henry was a liar, a manipulator, a bully, and at times almost a psychotic personality. None of that comes across here. Henry seems like a shallow cad, not a terrifying monster. Given Eric Bana's talent, I suspect the real problem is that the film makers feared a strong King Henry would overshadow the conflict between the two stunning leading ladies. It's a regrettable mistake, but THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is still a strong, sexy, captivating film."

","Rooted in the tradition of the BBC historical piece with a thick glossy Hollywood layer on top, the movie tells the rise and fall of Anne Boleyn through the complicated relationship with her younger sister Mary who first won the favours of king Henry VIII - that's why Anne refers to herself at one point as ""the other Boleyn girl"" even if in the end it will be her name to survive. The point of view of sister rivalry in the wake of court life and family ambition looks promising for the first part of the film, making sense of the elaborated costumes and sets in what is largely uncharted or minor territories in historical terms. Portman and Johansson as young superstars are in fact a good choice to level the field for the match between the Boleyn sisters.<br/><br/>However at some point the fiction needs to cross history and since there witty remarks leave place for solemn declarations, gloomy palace halls and a pompous dramatic musical score, and the film sinks down inexorably by effect of its own weight all the way to the end. The last minutes of the movie are in fact intolerable, ending with historical footnotes (what happened to the King, to the Duke of Norfolk, etc.), a link to the opening sequence to show ""the circle of life"" and a dedication to Anne's only daughter, most recent darling of historical flicks, Elizabeth.<br/><br/>And yet in all of this the historical simplification is such that the audience will likely get the idea that the only reason for Henry VIII to break from Catholic Church and create the Church of England has been to marry Anne Boleyn... Beautiful for the eyes and even well-acted, it's essentially a movie from an older era."

A short 1 1/2 hour movie does not do justice to the complexity of all these characters and the times in which they lived. We're talking about a story that spans at least 14 years (don't forget that Catherine Carey, Mary's daughter to Henry, was Anne Boleyn's lady-in-waiting while she was in the Tower).<br/><br/>Yes, I read all 3 of Philippa Gregory's books on Henry and his wives, and I can't believe she would have signed-off on this useless piece of celluloid.

","This movie was so well done and so amazingly cast it left me in total shock and awe! I have read so many terrible reviews about the film, supposedly because the story doesn't follow the book or it wasn't historically accurate. However, it was amazing to me just how accurate it was to actual history. If you look up Anne Boleyn's story you'll find that pretty much everything that she did or went through in the movie really did happen to her during her short life. For example, she really was King Henry's second wife, she really was sent away to live in France for a time, she was not able to bear a son, she was accused of incest and adultery and she was in fact tried for treason and later executed for these supposed crimes. However, they did add some things that weren't historically accurate but that's true of every movie. I still found the movie to be very entertaining even with the added plot. At first I wasn't quite sure if Mary Boleyn even existed because I couldn't find any information on her but from what I've read from other reviews it appears as though she did. That probably would have been too hard to get around if she didn't. In any case it makes the story more real when the people, places and events are all true. It was sad to see how one man took all of the innocence and life from two sisters who once shared such a close, intimate bond. All of the pressure put on them by society and even their own family ultimately cost one sister her life and almost took the other's too. Back then women were treated like cattle or manufacturing machines who, if they didn't produce a male heir, were immediately disposed of just as quickly. It didn't matter if you found favor with the King because eventually you would be replaced by another pretty face eager to do the job. All I can say is props to the women living in the 14th century! Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson were brilliant as the Boleyn sisters. Despite all their plotting and deviousness I was still glad to see that they remained close and were able to forgive each other, right down to the very end. And I loved what Mary said to the King when she was pleading for her sister's life, maybe because I have a little sister of my own. She said, ""Because she is my sister, and therefore one half of me."" So true! Eric Bana fit his role as the King perfectly. He was all of the things that King Henry VIII really was- a chauvinistic, nymphomaniac, sexist pig. He broke so many hearts and took so many lives along the way and all to his own advancement. Men! All in all, this really is a great movie with phenomenal performances. It keeps you guessing 'til the very end!"

","'The Other Boleyn Girl' takes the crossroads of Britain history as background and depicts the tragedy of a family trying to get involved in the court of Henry VIII. As the male members of the Boleyn family are stimulated by a greed for power, the Boleyn women are propelled towards notoriety and damnation. There is a huge amount of literature  novels, plays, films, etc.  inspired from this period of Britain's history marked by love, revenge, passion, and blood. Some of them depicted Henry VIII as a womanizer, some as a pitiful creature lacking self-confidence; some as a reputation-driven King afraid of being overshadowed by the accomplishments of his father... 'The Other Boleyn Girl', however, apparently focuses more on the tragedy of the Boleyn family rather than Henry himself. The film is powerful with Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson, two talented and beautiful actresses. Although the film is a fest to the eyes with costumes and art direction, it fails to entertain the audience with a quality plot. Yet if you find this period of British history appealing, or if you are curious about what might have come out of the duo  Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson , we recommend you to watch 'The Other Boleyn Girl'.<br/><br/>6 out of 10"

","I was bored. The movie is boring. The cast was boring. Natalie Portman while unbelievably beautiful parading about in the pretty frocks did not fit this role at all. She is simply not a seductress. She's got this Bambi innocence about her. While it's not a very popular thing to say, I find her to be a weak actress. She seems forced. When I see her in movies I see her as an actress and not as the intended character. Maybe I am prejudiced because I have seen how great the actress who portrays Anne on ""the Tudors"" is in this role. I think Natalie Portman is OK at playing one dimensional characters, but honestly she should not be cast in 3D roles. She just doesn't deliver. Also Scarlett Johanson, who is manifestly a beautiful and provocative woman in a very visceral way was not very well cast here. In fact, I think she would have played the role of Anne here more convincingly than Natalie. I will not even begin on the actor who played the King. He is not even worth mentioning. But even the picture-perfect cinematography and beautiful young actresses all dolled-up in the fantastic costumes cannot make up for the very poor acting and the lack of a good dialogue. This movie was bland and awkward."

"kennedybaird","2","3","6","23 March 2008"," Disappointment - Bad screenplay - Bad cinematography
","Ignoring whether or not the book / movie is historically incorrect and basing this comment around whether the movie is in fact about the book.<br/><br/>The movie does little justice to the exceptional writing of Philippa Gregory. The book is huge, going into extreme detail, developing characters & personalities, displaying the life of the court around Henry VIII. Natalie Portman does not play the Anne in the book, she acts as the faux Anne from the script writers vision. Mary is done much the same, unfortunately. She is also supposed to be the slower one, always looking to others for answers whereas in the movie she is the one that is providing help and solace.<br/><br/>The characters ages are incredibly mixed. The book spans almost fourteen years (as Mary & Henry's initial child, Catherine becomes one of Anne's ladies in waiting). The characters start with Henry being portrayed as quite young, in comparison to his old wife Queen Katherine which is the basis for the rift, and Henry's eyes searching for another mistress (when he chooses Mary). Mary is in her younger teens, between 12-16 with Anne slightly older than her. Near the end of the book, Henry is described as getting older, suffers from a leg injury, gains weight and starts to bald. Anne & Mary are into their thirties.<br/><br/>The movie's introduction is incredibly inaccurate (to the book). Anne is supposed to be in France, at the court of the French Queen. Mary is at the court of Henry when she catches his eyes, beds him, and carries his child. Also of note, Mary falls in love with Henry. When Anne returns, Henry is still bedding with Mary but he becomes infatuated with her, only continuing to bed Mary out of habit.<br/><br/>The movie also fails to explain why later on Mary goes to Rochford with Stafford, they do not even explain what happened to her previous husband, Carey.<br/><br/>The camera I found agitating, there always seemed to be something in the way and the ""soft focus"" type image was over done, and frustrated me.<br/><br/>Overall, quite a disappointment. If they had made the film over 2 hours at least, pushing three, I think they could have easily done the book more justice.<br/><br/>One positive aspect, the costumes were done quite excellently."
"baronintree","1","4","10","2 March 2008"," Avoid at all costs
","After watching the movie, I had to look up the Boleyn family on wikipedia as well as Phillipa Gregory's book on Amazon to get any semblance of historical truth on what actually happened during Ann Boleyn's life.<br/><br/>While movies definitely should not be viewed as telling history, this movie bears so little resemblance to historical truth that all the characters should be renamed so that no one would mistake the movie as having any correlation to Ann Boleyn and her sister. If you would like to know the truth about her and her sister, I recommend you look up Ann Boleyn and then Mary Boleyn on wikipedia at the very least.<br/><br/>Historical facts aside, I found the camera-work oppressively pretentious with too many dark forebodings of the ending. I am sure that even England gets some share of temperate weather...but in the movie you'd think that pre-Renaissance England was marked with years on end of dark and gloomy days to punish all the English for Henry's treatment of his wives.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is wasted on a one-sided character. It's good to see Kristin Scott Thomas as Lady Boleyn and she, along with Katherine of Aragon, are the only characters of intelligence. Eric Bana has little to do but glare (it's a little like him replaying his Hulk role but in historical costumes). And Scarlett Johannson makes good seem insipid.<br/><br/>It was a waste of money to make this movie, so don't waste your own money by paying to see it in a theater. I would go so far as to say don't even waste your time watching this movie...unless you are a costume designer. The historical costumes are actually quite fabulous."
"fantomefan","5","4","10","1 March 2008"," NOT faithful to the book!
","Did they even READ the book? If you are a fan of the novel, do not see this movie; you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>Obviously, any film adaptation of a novel needs to condense events, and I completely understand that. Some people have criticized the historical inaccuracy of this film, but like the book, it's a work of fiction, so the creators are within their rights--no one is going to see this expecting a documentary. My complaint with this film is how utterly it strayed from the novel. For example, the first 20 minutes or so of the film depict a totally different story than the novel does. The new scenes were not (in my humble opinion) less complex than the novel's opening, so I really have no idea why they chose to drastically change a New York Times' bestseller. Also, a number of crucial details were omitted, such as what happens to William Carey. (Really? They couldn't have spared one line to mention it?) <br/><br/>I did enjoy George Boleyn's performance, as well as Mark Rylance's. Natalie Portman's final scene is stunning and emotional. It is the only part of the movie I would watch again.<br/><br/>If I had not read the book, this may have been a decent movie. However, having read the novel multiple times since it came out (as well as the recent sequel), this was a tremendous letdown. I had been greatly looking forward to this movie for almost a year. I took an hour-long bus ride in the snow to see this movie on its opening day with a fellow fan of the novel (it should have been a 20-minute ride, but the snow/traffic was that bad.) After all that, I hope you can see how disappointed we both felt.<br/><br/>Philippa Gregory is a spell-binding author: read the book, skip the movie."

I've read the book as well as watched the HBO Series the Tudors, that covers the same story, and I have to say I'll be impatiently anticipating my Boleyn fix from the second season of the TV series rather than the DVD version of the movie. The acting was TERRIBLE. The drama that this story could entail is obvious, but the actors and actresses fall far short of expectations. The scenes seemed sedated and enacted with about a quarter of the passion such a dramatic story deserves.<br/><br/>Don't even get me started on how cowardly the directors/writers of the movie are because they didn't play out the controversial scenes, instead, taking the weenie/noble approach that didn't happen in the book or history.<br/><br/>As a committed student of history I was extremely excited for the release of the movie and was sorely disappointed. For as much as I love the plot, I can't even recommend this movie based on my personal love of the period. Instead, if you want a juicy well-done version of the same story, invest the time in the HBO Series the Tudors: the acting, costumes, and story will certainly be much more worth your time and money than this sub-standard movie."
"janos451","7","3","7","1 March 2008"," A Pretty Tudor Thriller
","First, an easy quiz (which you're going to get wrong): How many wives did King Henry VIII have? Answer at the end of this article, but why not try to figure it out before looking? Oh, too late, you already did...<br/><br/>And now, a question: Did Henry VIII always look like Charles Laughton, with the heft and bulges of the most memorable actor in the role of the monarch? The truth is that both the king and Laughton looked a lot better when they were young. <br/><br/>Instead of a fat, dissolute Henry, there was back in the early 16th century a trimmer, more handsome king, who soon ate and married too much. That Henry, not the famous picture of him by Holbein, must have looked like Eric Bana. <br/><br/>And so, in Philippa Gregory's Hollywood-compliant but terrifically entertaining ""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" it is Bana - from the non-green scenes of the 2003 ""Hulk"" - who rules, while the real-life plain-to-ugly Boleyn girls are brought to you by Natalie Portman (Anne) and Scarlett Johansson (Mary). <br/><br/>It is to their credit and, especially, that of director Justin Chadwick that you buy all these prettifications, all or most of author Gregory's romantic liberties with the story, and enjoy the movie thoroughly. <br/><br/>Chadwick is new to feature films, but he has solid credits in TV, especially with the recent magnificent BBC ""Bleak House,"" as fine a realization of Dickens as you'll find anywhere. <br/><br/>And, speaking of the BBC, if you want to see a less ""pretty,"" more substantial version of Gregory's novel, dig up the 2003 TV version of ""The Other Boleyn Girl,"" with Jodhi May and Natascha McElhone; those two run rings around the smirking Portman and the too-angelic Johansson. The exalted Peter Morgan wrote the screenplay - as well as for the superior ""The Queen"" and ""The Last King of Scotland"" - and an in-depth research project is just waiting for the right scholar to compare Morgan's ""Boleyn"" script with Philippa Lowthorpe's for the TV version.<br/><br/>So, with novelist, script writer, director, and a darn fine yarn to begin with, the new film has much going for it. The supposedly well-known story of Henry's marriage to Anne and dalliance with Mary is told well, bringing into focus a great many sub-stories of background machinations by a power-hungry family using the two sisters as bait. <br/><br/>If at first you must overcome the challenge of seeing Anne Boleyn behind Portman's glitz and 21st-century 'tude, by the time the character reaches the catastrophic comeuppance for her (and her family's) scheming, Portman comes close to the touchstone established by Jodhi May. <br/><br/>Quiz answer: Two. Surely you think six, but that's not right. Four of Henry's marriages were annulled, which means officially they never existed. Although Gregory's book doesn't deal with this tricky question, you can take the information to the bank."

","Regardless of historical accuracy, of faithfulness to the novel the Other Boleyn Girl is a bad film. The screenplay is a succession of scenes with very little purpose until the second half of the film. Even then it fails to create a sense of intimacy with the characters, a series of monsters in their own right for which the viewer does not care. Even the good sister is depicted as too stupid and obedient to be worth any sympathy. After all her sister has done to her she still loves her; whatever monstrosity her daddy or uncle asks her to perform she does it with a nod and smile. So she can't be the right point of view to tell the story and she is not. The main problem of this bad screenplay is indeed that it is not told from any body's point of view. The POV is outside. So is the spectator. Outside the theater quick. Fresh air. Relief. Now when it comes to directing, the director manages to make three of the most handsome actors and actresses in Hollywood today look plain, vulgar and tired. Almost every shot has the wrong POV. The camera moves are repetitive. Filming through a grid, a fence, whatever he can find is a repetitive pattern of photography. Horrible color timing. One scene is green, the other is dark, the other red, without any apparent logic. Lighting is crude, plain, TV-like most of the time, and all of a sudden falsely sophisticated for a minute without a reason. The castles feel empty and dead. You feel it's a movie set all the time. Costumes: ugly, taking all the appeal away from the actresses. A Majority of BBC TV period dramas look better than this film. Deserved to flop at the box despite its ultra glamorous cast and a very interesting story to begin with. A complete waste."

The movie didn't focus on how Anne was actually in love with H. Percy (as in the book) and the book did not focus on George and Anne's almost relationship.

What happens next is the movie.<br/><br/>I'm going to plead bias in the viewing of the film. For me this is one of the films where Natalie Portman has been terribly miscast and so it became a challenge to get through. While I don't hate Portman as an actress I do find that she is often miscast to the detriment of the film she is in. Eric Bana, another one of my lesser favorite actors, as Henry actually gives a performance but he also leaves no impression what so ever. I kept wondering where the king was.<br/><br/>The film itself isn't bad. It does seem to have the feel of a larger scale TV movie and does seem to be ""modern"" in feel, the result is that a good portion of the film seems like dress up time in the English manor house. Part of this is the result of the miscasting of Portman who never seems to belong in the place on screen. I kept waiting for her to walk off the set and into a Porche and drive off.

The movie jumped across time many times, and it didn't even really seem like anyone had changed. Unless you had read the book, I don't think you really could have gotten the full picture. One thing that bothered me was the fact that they never mentioned anything about Mary's first husband (Carey) dying. This could have been done without the whole falling back in love storyline. They simply showed her marrying him, leaving to be Henry's mistress, and marrying Stafford. How could she marry Stafford without Carey dying or a divorce? For what it was, the acting was pretty good. Portman's angst at the end was very well acted. The few times Catherine (Torrent) was a part of a scene, she was incredible.

The development of important characters was limited and made these important historical figures seem flat. I do think the casting was done well and that the performances of the two leading women exceeded my expectations. They played their parts well and I can't imagine any other actresses in those roles.

"EnglishMuffin","7","2","4","9 March 2008"," Critics and history fanatics need to get off their high horse...
","Although I wasn't completely captivated by the film, I think it is fair to say that the Phillippa Gregory deserves some credit for bringing the attention off of Elizabeth I for once, and focusing on another monarch for a change. In this case, it wasn't even about the monarch because even though Henry VIII was always present, he was fairly insignificant. Yes, this movie favors women and is very one sided in that sense, but that is the perspective that it chooses to show, and viewers should accept that. I feel that many people are way too critical of this film. It is the authors and/or filmmakers privilege to make the film from what ever perspective they choose and with whatever historical inaccuracies they want. I am seeing that many are criticizing the factual errors and I think that they need to realize that this is historical *FICTION*, it is NOT the authors or directors obligation to educate the audiences. Besides, many of the historical facts surrounding the plot of the film are unclear to historians themselves, so why shouldn't Gregory fill in the blanks whichever way she chooses? For example, even historians don't know who the older Boleyn was, (Mary or Anne), even though there is some evidence to Anne's seniority, which is why the author chose to present it that way. <br/><br/>I will have to admit that much of my motivation to see the film stemmed from reading bad reviews because generally I thought the film would receive a positive response. I did have some complaints... As I stated earlier, I didn't necessarily like the fact that the King's role was insignificant, but I was even more disheartened by Eric Bana's lacking performance. Do not misunderstand, I am a huge fan of Eric Bana, and I feel that he has much potential as an actor; he is the type of actor who forces compassion from the viewer when you watch him on screen. However this time around, I had no such feelings, in fact, I couldn't wait for a scene with him to be over. Ultimately, I feel that if someone else were cast in his place, I would've had a different outlook on the King's role and presence.<br/><br/>During the film, I started to form an opinion on the acting of all the women in the film and I am certainly glad that I didn't set it in stone. Starting with the less obvious characters, I think that Kristin Scott Thomas was a perfect choice for Lady Boleyn, definitely worthy of recognition. I disagree with those that felt that Natalie Portman was the star actress because I think that Scarlett Johansson is the real star of this film. I feel that Portman had a good performance, her acting is not believable in the beginning, but I am certainly convinced towards the end. With that, however, she was still replaceable; Scarlett Johansson on the other hand, is not. She embodies the role of Mary Boleyn and I cannot imagine any other actress in that role. Another actor that is starting to shine, Jim Sturgess is really starting to show his talent, although he still has a long way to go to even be considered in the same caliber that British actors are held to. <br/><br/>Overall, I felt that the film is worthy of more positive recognition and viewers should be more open to overlooking the ""questionable"" ways filmmakers choose to interpret history especially if the genre is historical fiction."

","Historically speaking, Anne Boleyn was the second wife of England's King Henry VIII. She was instrumental in England's political and religious upheaval that saw England ultimately break away from the Catholic Church. When Henry's first wife was unable to produce a male heir, he began to look elsewhere. His advances toward Anne were not returned, as she did not want to chance pregnancy. Any child born before the King could annul his first marriage to Catherine of Aragon would be a bastard child and therefore not a potential heir to the throne. As if this weren't enough drama for the Boleyn family, Anne's sister, Mary, was also involved with the King and rumoured to have had a child he fathered prior to his involvement with Anne. Regardless of how sordid the whole affair might have been, it altered England's history dramatically and Anne went on to become both a martyr and a feminist icon. You would think that a screenplay about both sisters' involvement with the King by the Oscar nominated writer of THE QUEEN would be an impartial account of the period but instead, THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is nothing but a sexist farce that reduces both the male and female players to tired platitudes before robbing the story of all its humanity.<br/><br/>Men crave power and status. Women crave powerful men that they can manipulate to do their bidding. Men will essentially do anything to get into the skirt of a woman they desire and will lose their minds and capacity for rational thinking if she denies him. Women will in turn step over anyone, including their own sister, in order to bag a supposedly good man. Not only are all of these statements borderline offensive but they are also inane. There is always so much more to it than simply that. These clichés are the stuff great teen movies are made of and perhaps it was unfair of me to expect more from a costume film than insipid, nonsensical melodrama. What most undermines first time feature film director Justin Chadwick's work is that it is amateurish and not at all convincing. Anne and Mary Boleyn (Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson) are introduced as loving, caring sisters. They protect each other, respect each other and love each other. Why then would I believe that either would hurt the other so maliciously? I guess because they're girls and that's what girls do when there is a man involved, right? Sure to stereotype both sexes fairly, the men do not escape Chadwick's narrow view of gender definition. Am I to seriously believe the King of England (Eric Bana) would risk his throne and country's well being just because a girl he lusts over refuses his royal wanting?<br/><br/>As Anne, Portman is a natural for the period but as she gets caught up in her father's plans to have her bed the King as a means to better position her family's standing at court, the inherent intelligence she brings to most of her roles makes it seem entirely unnatural that she would be naïve enough to play along with Daddy's game. Johansson has never looked more drab as she stands amidst an always-overcast English countryside, her long, golden locks lying limp on her shoulders, her eyebrows almost invisible against her pale face. Though she seems to be playing catch-up to Portman's supposed ease with the material at first, it is her poise and restraint that make for a more believable and sympathetic Boleyn. While Portman certainly masters the pain, remorse and paranoid fear necessary to convey Anne's arch, she is incapable of escaping the same trap the entire cast falls into. Perhaps from having seen too many period pieces prior, the ensemble acts as though the events taking place are not actually happening to them as characters. Instead, they come off as amateur theatre actors caught up in the lore that comes with corsets and faked British accents.<br/><br/>THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is not all that horrible. I too find myself getting lost in the barrage of bodices. Still, marrying off your children as commodities should not be taken lightly and the knowing twinkle in these girls' eyes gives away their modern feminist thinking, making their wily behaviour seem all the more implausible. The only thing that makes this all worse is that all this trouble comes about to please the patriarch of the Boleyn family who is nothing more than a pathetic, insecure coward."
"Poseidon-3","Null","2","4","5 March 2008"," How to get a-head during the Tudor reign.
","One of British history's most captivating female figures is examined in this fictionalized account, which sticks to some undisputed historical facts while weaving a story in between the cracks (and often tweaking the facts in the process as well.) Portman plays a young commoner from a family with designs on raising its station in the world. They attempt to place her in the arms of King Henry VIII (Bana), but she winds up being overshadowed by her younger, more demure sister Johansson. Bana moves Johansson into the palace (despite his marriage to Torrent), setting off a rivalry between Johansson and Portman that will forever change the face of England. Portman, after a brief exile in France, returns to claim Bana for herself and provide him with a male heir to the throne. However, that may not be as easy as she thinks it is. Portman gives an able portrayal of this complex character, though the script sometimes muddles her motivations. Her demeanor generally suits the time period. Johansson is often equally at home in the period and gives a nuanced and sincere performance. Little is known of her real-life counterpart and, thus, she is able to graft characteristics and qualities onto her without getting historical aficionados too far up in arms. Bana looks fetching in his many elaborate costumes and hats and is manly enough to carry them off, though he in almost no way resembles the legendary king. He is more of a supporting presence here and the script, as in the case of Portman, but even more so, doesn't allow him to display much, if any, reason for some of his actions. All three actors try hard and are superficially successful, but a more incisive script would have gone a long way in presenting a more resonant story. Morrissey is effective, if a bit one note in his role as the girls' relentlessly social-climbing uncle. Rylance, as their father, is appropriately weak and conflicted while Scott Thomas, as their mother, radiates knowing sensibility in every drop of her scant dialogue. Sturgess is appealing as the girls' sensitive and caring brother. Torrent manages to command the screen in her few scenes as the first wife who has been dealt a cruel hand of infertility and children who have died in infancy. It's all a very fascinating subject for a film and it's astonishing to think of the way kings could maneuver people at their will, regardless of the circumstances, and then, when up against a brick wall, change the rules altogether! The way women were treated and yet how they sometimes managed to work it to their advantage is an equally compelling topic. The (strangely claustrophobic) film is handsome and attractive to the eye and is mostly interesting, but suffers from a few issues. The script, as previously mentioned, just doesn't afford ample reasons and/or insight into what makes most of these people behave the way they do. Also, the film's pace is askew. The beginning is leisurely and deliberate, but the final third is practically break-neck, with things happening swiftly and with very little explanation for them or dwelling on them. That said, the film remains an arresting, if soapy, historical drama with charismatic acting, lovely music and beautifully appointed sets and clothing. History buffs and fans of the novel (which has only partly been adapted faithfully here) will give the film further demerits."

","I have been eagerly awaiting this film for a long time, but recent reviews had me starting to get worried. My verdict is... It was very good. Superbly acted, beautifully shot.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman carries the film. Although her accent falters at times, it can be forgiven by the power driven behind her performance. Scarlett Johansson is also very impressive. In the book, Mary is drippy and annoying. But it appears that Scarlett did not make her so. She did the unknown character justice by portraying her as a selfless, good sister. Although Eric Bana was good, he did slightly disappoint, but I think that this might be due to his relatively short screen time. Jim Sturgess and Juno Temple shine. he plays the perfect George Boleyn who gets caught up in his sister's problems and tries in vain to protect her. I even forgot that Juno Temple was the malicious Lolaa from Atonement, she was so good! (Another fantastic film!(Amazing book, too!)) The only real down point for me was Anne's execution. By historical accounts, Anne did not break down. What strangely annoys me is that they FORGOT TO BLINDFOLD HER!!! I have no idea why that annoys me so! I think that they could have given Anne more justice by doing it RIGHT!! Anyway, that's it!"

","Other people have dealt with the multiple questions of historical inaccuracy, so I'll concentrate more on issues of storytelling.
It's a real shame to engage so many good actors and then make them say (repeatedly) lines like: ""You are my sister!"" ""How can you do that to me?"" ""How dare you?"" ""Now you will give yourself to me!"" , bits of life wisdom such as ""Court life changes people, and not necessarily for the better"", plus plenty of dialogue in which 16th century characters explicate and discuss their feelings in the best style of 20th century American soap operas. Kristin Scott Thomas is possibly the only person given anything remotely interesting to say. Mark Rylance manages to create a mildly engaging character despite the hopeless script, but then he's a genius. Most of the other characters have no depth or complexity: Mary is simple, trusting and affectionate; Anne ambitious and scheming.
Historical inaccuracy shows itself in more than a simple disregard for chronology and family relationships. There's a lack of feel for what was and wasn't possible at a 16th-century royal court. Anne could never have concealed a miscarriage; a queen's pregnancy was a public affair and she was closely attended and observed at all times. Ladies of high rank didn't routinely jump on horseback and gallop off on their own at the drop of a hat. Mary couldn't have just taken baby Elisabeth, a royal child, and made off with her. Anne as a young lady-in-waiting couldn't have entertained the whole court by ridiculing the King of France, beacuse all monarchs were seen as anointed by God. (All of Anne's supposedly witty banter with Henry is crude and, well, not witty.)
Neither the pretty costumes nor the palaces nor even the brilliant actors are enough to rescue this piece of abysmal writing."

The father maneuvers his eldest daughter, Anne, into the eyes of the King yet she is quickly overlooked by her sister, Mary, who is already married. The mother clearly disapproves this plan.

"makleen2","6","0","0","7 January 2019"," A colorful attempt to breathe new life into a familiar story
","An all-star cast weaves a sixteenth-century soap opera in this colorful attempt to breathe new life into a familiar story. Written by Peter Morgan and directed by Justin Chadwick, The Other Boleyn Girl (2008) was based on a novel of the same name by Philippa Gregory. Billed as a scandalous portrayal of King Henry VIII's courtship and eventual marriage to Anne Boleyn, this film seems quaint by today's standards. Its release was timed to capitalize on Showtime's The Tudors (2007-2010), but lacked that show's outstanding performances.<br/><br/>The film opens in Tudor England during the reign of King Henry VIII (Eric Bana). Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey) and his brother-in-law Thomas Boleyn (Mark Rylance) learn the King is unhappy with his wife, Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent), who has not yet produced a male heir. They sense an opportunity to advance their social standing by installing one of Boleyn's daughters as the King's mistress. His daughter Mary (Scarlett Johansson) has already wed William Carey (Benedict Cumberbatch), so they turn to Anne (Natalie Portman).<br/><br/>Over the objections of his wife, Elizabeth Boleyn (Kristin Scott Thomas), Thomas invites the King to his estate to introduce him to Anne. Things get complicated when the King is injured in a hunting accident and he falls in love with Mary when she tends to his injury. Mary becomes the King's mistress, and Anne is exiled to France for trying to marry an earl without the King's knowledge.<br/><br/>Anne returns from France a transformed woman, and despite Mary giving birth to a baby boy, she sets her sights on winning the King's affection and becoming Queen. It's an all-too-familiar story, which ends in an all-too-familiar way. Unfortunately, the filmmakers chose to continue the story past its logical conclusion, when Anne wins the rivalry with Mary for the King's affection.<br/><br/>King Henry VIII ruled England from 1509 to 1547. He is known for severing the Church of England from the Roman Catholic Church, and for having six wives, two of whom he had executed. Mary Boleyn was the King's mistress for a time, and is rumored to have bore two of his illegitimate children. She was married twice, the second time to a common soldier, and died estranged from her family.<br/><br/>Anne Boleyn became Queen of England in 1533, however, her failure to produce a male heir led to her execution for treason and other trumped-up charges three years later. Henry and Anne's daughter, Elizabeth, became one of England's most renowned queens, who reigned for over 44 years.<br/><br/>The Other Boleyn Girl follows the general outline of history but changes many details. King Henry VIII met both Mary and Anne Boleyn at court, not at their father's estate. Henry had been present at Mary's wedding. Mary was not an innocent maiden when they met, having already had an affair with the King of France, among others in the French court. In contrast, Anne was well-educated, intelligent, gracious, and politically astute, a far cry from the brash and boorish depiction in this film. The Tudors also unfairly portrayed Anne this way.<br/><br/>Compared with The Tudors, the acting in The Other Boleyn Girl leaves much to be desired. Natalie Dormer played a much more convincing seductress than Natalie Portman. She oozed sexuality, confidence, and energy. Jonathan Rhys Meyers' portrayal of King Henry VIII makes Eric Bana's seem flaccid by comparison. Of course, The Tudors had more time to develop their relationship and keep building the suspense. That's why The Other Boleyn Girl should have ended when Anne became queen and devoted more time to the rivalry with her sister.<br/><br/>The Other Boleyn Girl is the kind of romantic costume drama that critics generally dislike but that appeals to a certain audience (the word ""soap opera"" comes to mind). It currently holds a 42% positive rating from critics and 62% audience favorability on RottenTomatoes. The film was commercially lukewarm as well, grossing $26.8 million on a $35 million budget. The filmmakers should have focused on what unique elements they brought to the story, rather than waste screen time rehashing what audiences have seen before."

It rather got stick in my head for its rather disgusting scenes, such as the one were Anne sleeps with her brother. <br/><br/>Of course, this one was by NO MEANS a real adaptation of historically accurate events. Mary was not loved by the king, just a mistress. And Anne was witty, charming, strong, had allies. But I can look past that. So the historical inaccuracies did not really bother me. What rubbed me the wrong way was, that the movie did not clearly point out that the king parted churches for his marriage with Anne! It was such an important historical event and they just put it in somewhere for a few seconds and moved on from that. <br/><br/>I enjoyed watching the different ways the king treated both sisters. One very loving and caring and the other only with desire, which kind of burnt out. I also liked Anne's development, when she lost her mind over the fact that she could not bear a son. It was definitely not relatable that she had sex with her brother but it added to her internal break down, which was a vicious circle. However, as much as I liked the idea of this dramatic downfall, I didn't like the execution of it. it was rushed, seemed fake and just didn't fit into the character. Anne was sent to France, supposedly changed sooo much, she came back to hold this new version up for how long? five months? maybe four. And then she became bitter again. Her ups and downs just were WAY too quick. Natalie P. had done a brilliant job in the Black Swan, because the movie was SLOW paced. Her loosing her mind, going from mentally little unstable to a maniac seemed kind of expectable. But not in this movie. She did a great job acting it out, but it happened too fast. <br/><br/>I liked Mary. She seemed very relatable. The one, who carried the movie on her shoulders and kind of even saved it. Scarlett J. did a great job acting out a most overlooked sister with a very gentle and caring soul, who at the end stood by her sisters' side and at least tried something to save her. I liked that she didn't play hero too much and instead just moved to the country with a broken heart. Seemed kind of realistic. <br/><br/>I would not recommend watching this. If you want to get informed about history, just read an article about Anne Boleyn. If you want to be entertained, find something else, because this movie fell kind of flat."

There were two Bolyn girls, you see -- Scarlett Johanssen as shy Mary Bolyn, with her exquisitely misshapen features, and Natalie Portman as Anne, girlish and grasping. The Bolyns, like the royal family itself, is full of knaves. I mean, imagine a father pimping off his two daughters, even to a Eric Bana's king. <br/><br/>Henry VIII (ruled 1509 -1547) is Eric Bana, who gives a subdued performance compared to, say, Charles Laughton or Robert Shaw. Henry ran through six wives, enough that a mnemonic peg has proved itself useful over the years: <br/><br/>King Henry VIII, To six wives he was wedded. One died, one survived, Two divorced, two beheaded.<br/><br/>This movie deals with the first two -- Catherine of Aragon of Spain, who stubbornly refuses to give Henry a son and heir but becomes instead the mother of Mary Queen of Scots, perhaps out of spite. The marriage is annulled, a great shock at the time, and the actress, the magnificent Ana Torrent, gives the role all she's got. But as Catherine approaches menopause after twenty-four years of marriage, the frustrated younger Henry has had enough. Catherine leaves the court in a high dudgeon, dies later in prison, and Henry takes up with shy Mary, she of the low dudgeon but high bosom, of which the viewer gets not a glimpse. <br/><br/>Now, I'm describing the movie, not the historical facts because I'm unable to remember anything that happened before I was five years old. In any case, Mary and Henry get along quite well, although of course they aren't married. The men of the court, especially Boleyn pater, are anxious to see Mary become queen. The dialog is exceptional when the nobles question Mary about her first night. ""Did he lie with you?"" ""Yes, he lay with me."" ""Did he lie with you more than once?"" ""Yes, he lay with me more than once."" It was enough. She gives birth -- but to a girl, not a boy. The end credits tell us that this is, in fact, the case and that the girl grew up to be Elizabeth I -- the Elizabethan Age of Shakespeare, Sir Francis Drake, the Spanish Armade, Errol Flynn, et al. I understand the claim is in some dispute.<br/><br/>The king sheds Mary, though. First of all, he's not keen on baby girls as heirs, though he's willing enough to give it another go. ""Well, if she can bear a healthy baby girl, she can bear a healthy baby boy."" He's put off the scent by the conations of Mary's sister Anne. It's hard to tell from the film whether Anne is deliberately trying to undo Mary's position, which has seemed secure. The king is tender with Mary and she has grown to love him. In any case, Anne enters the king's affections kind of crabwise, which isn't hard since Anne is beautiful and flirtatious while the king seems to be ruled entirely by his glands. As history has shown, Anne has made a big mistake and is succeeded by Jane Seymour, the wife from whom the actress (née Joyce Penelope Wilhelmina Frankenberg) copped her name.<br/><br/>All of the performances are up to par, as is the direction. Scarlett Johansson gives the most notable performance, possibly because it's the most complex, whereas Portman is shackled to the role of bitch with mute. We don't see that much of Eric Bana as Henry, but he joins all the men of the story in being scheming and unscrupulous brutes. Not that the women are much better, with the exceptions of shy Mary and proud Catherine. <br/><br/>I kind of enjoyed it, although if you stripped the story of its historical roots and cut its budget by about 999,999% what you'd wind up with is something resembling a Lifetime Network Movie. You know, give the characters contemporary dress, get rid of the ""lie with""s, and make the king a CEO, and there you have it."

","Let's face it. There are two main reasons why people went to see this movie when it came out. Nobody was expecting wonderful British wit (from two Americans and an Australian), people were not expecting to see a thought provoking look at a significant period in British history. Nope. People either wanted to see a pretty looking period piece, or two of the most beautiful women in the world trying desperately to get a man in bed for two hours. Don't get me wrong, I think this movie does provide more than that, but admit it: that's why you came.<br/><br/>It's a time of upheaval in England as King Henry VIII gets increasingly stroppy with his french wife's infuriating inability to give birth to a male (on a serious note the queen was pregnant several times with boys, but for various reasons, none survived to reach primary age). It would be catastrophic for England to have a weak female heir, so in comes the sleazy Duke of Norfolk (David Morrisey who would play Gordon Brown later in his career) who colludes with his brother in law Thomas Boleyn, to use his hot daughter Anne (Natalie Portman-solid) to seduce the king, become his mistress, produce a male, and help them climb the social ladder. Unfortunately, the king is more interested in that Other Boleyn Girl, Mary (Scarlet Johannson), who is married to Sherlock Holmes. Long story short, Sherlock dies while working overseas and ends up falling for the King, much to the chagrin of her sister Anne.<br/><br/>So Henry knocks up Mary and an unimpressed Anne marries an Earl without the King's consent. Anne tells her brother George, who tells Mary, who has Anne exiled to France so as to not bring trouble down on the family. Mary nearly miscarriages so they call back her sister, who talks herself into the King's bed, forcing him to forsake Mary. Mary has her child, but the King has already turned his back on her, as any red blooded male would when Natalie Portman is the Other Woman. Anne won't sleep with Henry until they are properly married, so Henry establishes the church of England (along with various other significant structural changes) so he can get a divorce and marry Anne. From there we have rape, incest and an execution as Anne proves herself a woMan For All Seasons (and degradations). <br/><br/>This is a pretty film to look at and features strong performances from Bana and Portman and Johannson does well enough to be more than a third wheel. If you want to look at this time in history more closely you should probably do some reading (Simon Sohama would be a good start), because what we see here barely scratches the surface. <br/><br/>But I'm going to give this movie a pass, not only does it give you what's promised on the label but it does this with good acting, great costume and set design, and a story that genuinely engages. I was outraged, angered, amused and yeah occasionally turned on. C'mon guys, you don't have to be that teenager telling your mother you only picked up that Playboy issue she found in your bedroom to read the articles your whole life. It is OK to find one of the most beautiful women in the world playing a seductress arousing.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the Other Boleyn Girl is more than the sum of its parts and does more than is promised on the DVD cover. This is not an accurate look at history, but it is a well made, well acted production with a decent story, which is probably helped by its narrow focus. It's above average, but far from essential. Let's leave it at that."

What's makes it very interesting for me is the level of acting I find in this movie, which a great work in overall. The two main female roles played by Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson were outside of their own usual characters. Natalie Portman is a frequent at the roles of the protagonist who often gets the sympathy of the audience. In this movie she really succeeded in shedding her usual image and transformed into the ruthless Anne Boleyn this movie envisioned. Scarlett Johansson on the other hand is used to the more challenging role, particularly action roles. But here she really grasped the emotions and mannerisms of a girl being tossed into the politics of the aristocrats. I also enjoy Eric Bana and Jim Sturgess' convincing performance, and was pleased to see the seeds of even greater actors in the likes of Benedict Cumberbatch and Eddie Redmayne."

","The Other Boleyn Girl is an adaptation of a historical fiction novel by Philippa Gregory. It was previously made as a BBC mini series and several years later BBC films co-produced the condensed film version.<br/><br/>Looking at it now its an all star cast with Oscar nominees Benedict Cumberbatch and Eddie Redmayne is small but important roles, Andrew Garfield credited although its blink and you miss him and Oscar winner Natalie Portman plays Anne Boleyn and Scarlett Johansson plays her younger sister Mary Boleyn.<br/><br/>The film is not meant to be historically accurate given that the source material is a fictional historical. In that sense it ties Henry VIII need to father a male heir with the Boleyn Family trying to engineer their rise in social status, riches and political power by using the Boleyn girls hooked up with Henry.<br/><br/>The film also deals with rivalry as Mary first becomes Henry's mistress and gives birth to an illegitimate son and then Anne pledges herself to Henry but only if he first divorces his wife and also send Mary and her child away.<br/><br/>Of course as Anne could not give birth to a son causes friction and for her Henry's wrath which results in the two sisters bonding again as the Boleyn family are put to peril.<br/><br/>They say life in olden times was short, nasty and brutish. It seems to be no different even if you are in the inner circle of the Royal family particularly the Tudor court. This is a quick romp through a period in Henry VIII's life with enough intrigue, plotting that is doomed to failure.<br/><br/>The film is carried by its actresses both Porter and Johansson are very good and Kristin Scott Thomas as the mother is excellent as the one who realises that her daughters are at risk from this foolhardy plan."

","Endless dancing, rich feasts and courtly love affairs. Women used as pawns for the advancement of men and a king so intent on having a male heir that he took six wives in order to obtain one. These are the descriptions that come to mind when one thinks of Henry the Eighth's court and are the aspects movies try to capture in their plots. The Other Boleyn Girl specifically focuses on the rivalry between Mary and Anne Boleyn as they fight to hold the king's ever wavering interest.<br/><br/>When looked at simply, the plot is one most are familiar with: two women in competition for the love of one man. The audience is introduced to these two women in the very beginning of the movie and they are portrayed as great friends and sisters. This knowledge of the characters gives us a false sense of security; these two could never betray each other for love, right? Unfortunately we are forced to watch as the desires of the men in their family pit the sisters against each other in a battle over a kingdom and king's heart. These reasons make me fall in love with the plot; it is not a necessarily deep story, but it does have a certain level of dramatics that capture your attention.<br/><br/>Excellent movies keep an even, steady pace and do not rush the telling of the story. The Other Boleyn Girl races through over a decade of events, jam-packing rich and interesting history into less than two hours. For example, Anne is exiled to France, Mary becomes pregnant and Anne is recalled from banishment, all within five minutes. These events are supposed to show a time span of several months and the movie did not make this apparent in any way. Further, Anne's marriage to the King Henry is squished into the last half hour of the movie. There was not enough time allotted during this film to give the events their due attention, and it leaves the movie sorely lacking.<br/><br/>When movies undertake the task of telling a historic tale, they take upon themselves the responsibility of correctly displaying the facts. Mary Boleyn did not have a child with Henry the Eighth as the movie portrays. She was also not as pure as the movie leads the audience to believe, as the only reason Henry coveted her as a mistress was because of her sexual reputation. The Other Boleyn Girl also incorporated nothing about George Boleyn's heterosexuality, which was a big issue facing the Boleyn family during their rise to power. There were also several important historical events occurring during the same time frame that may have given the plot more depth had they been explored. For instance, Queen Katherine is hardly mentioned throughout the movie, and she is an instrumental player in Anne's game to win the king. While the story primarily follows the Boleyn sisters' relationship, more elaboration on supporting characters would greatly aid the overall story.<br/><br/>Typically before viewing a film, people will look to see if the actors are known and experienced. The Other Boleyn Girl does not disappoint in this category, boasting Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson as the Boleyn sisters and Eric Bana as King Henry the Eighth. All of these performances are splendidly put on, with the portrayals appearing to be sincere and convincing. Unfortunately, the characters do not seem to have much depth behind them. Mary and Anne's characters are both stereotypical: Mary is the ""milk and honey"" sister, with fair hair and eyes and Anne is dark haired, dark eyed and the seemingly ""bad"" sister. King Henry's character appears to be nothing more than a dark and brooding philanderer, instead of a king that also enjoyed sports and music and politics.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed The Other Boleyn Girl. The idea behind the plot was interesting, and Tudor history fascinates me. However, having read the book written by Philippa Gregory, the movie could have been so much more than it was. If it had more depth in the plot, characters and history, I feel it would have been much more successful. Unfortunately, it is nothing more than another costume drama attempting to capture the intrigue of the sixteenth century Tudor court."

But, what I feel was the biggest disservice to Anne's legacy was the abysmal portrays of the leading characters. Mary, or in this case "" the other Boleyn girl, was not an innocent un-worldly woman as she is shown to be in this poor excuse of a film. While she resided in France, she was the mistress of many , many, MANY men. She wasn't called the Great Prostitute for nothing. Henry is shown to be brutish, cruel, and a RAPIST in this movie. There is mention of any of his positive attributes, like his artistic and athletic temperament, or the tenderness and respect he showed Anne in the beginning of their relationship. He was devoted to Anne utterly, and historical accounts in no way suggest that any sexual interaction with her was anything but consensual. Finally, Anne Boleyn has suffered so many injustices, and the portrayal of her in this movie is just another injustice to add to the list. She is shown to be manipulative, calculating, and in a scene that by itself could earn condemnation of this film, incestuous. Anne was recorded in the annals of history as a woman before her time. Intelligent, charming, outspoken, charitable, and captivating, her features were admired even by her enemies. This movie and everything about it is an insult to her memory. And, even if you're unfamiliar with the story and its characters, the acting, the dialogue, and the overall storytelling is so insufferably subpar, that no real entertainment can truly be derived from this rubbish."

Portman manages to hold firm but Johansson's evident disinterest in even being on the set is off putting and her utter laziness when it comes to speaking dialogue or expressing emotion is frustrating.

","Put it this way, if you saw Anne of the Thousand Days, you probably felt sorry for Anne Boleyn. After seeing this film, while you might feel sorry for her - not so much.<br/><br/>The Other Boleyn Girl is a 2008 film starring Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johannson, Eric Bana, Kristen Scott-Thomas, Mark Rylance, David Morrissey, and Benedict Cumberbatch who at this writing is #2 on the IMDb Starmeter, so I'd say his fortunes have changed.<br/><br/>The story fills in what we don't actually know about the Boleyns and tells some of their story, though the writers had to leave a great deal out. Nevertheless, this is a great drama, beautifully costumed and filmed, with wonderful acting and, let's face it, two of the most stunning women in films today.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman plays Anne Boleyn, who is more or less pimped out by her father (Mark Rylance) hoping that she can give Henry VIII a son and, in so doing, increase the family's fortunes. It doesn't work out; instead, the King takes a fancy to the newly married Mary, Anne's sister, and both the young women are given a position at court. Henry, then married to Catherine of Aragon, then takes Mary as a lover. Mary later gives birth to a son.<br/><br/>Anne secretly marries someone who is betrothed to another, and as a punishment is sent to the court in France. When she returns, she captivates King Henry by refusing to become his mistress while he is still married, driving him to distraction. He eventually gets the law changed so he can divorce Catherine and marry Anne. By now he is long finished with Mary, barely acknowledging his son.<br/><br/>One of the created scenes in the film occurs when Anne miscarries her child, a boy. She is desperate that Henry not find out and appeals to her brother to sleep with her. He can't do it. In truth, one of the crimes Anne was charged with was incest, but these allegations were made up. Her brother George was executed because of it, however. In the film, someone sees them together and reports it.<br/><br/>I actually think the writers did an okay job with this story - in historical films one always has to combine events and characters or leave them out.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman is excellent as Anne, rather bratty, seductive, and emotional. Johannson has a less showy role but she's marvelous as well. Eric Bana is an attractive Henry. The real Henry was a redhead, but the depiction of Henry as slender and attractive is certainly correct for the period in which the story takes place.<br/><br/>The film makes a great deal out of the relationship between Anne and Mary -- Anne is furious when Mary nabs the King, then Mary is furious when Anne makes her big move. In fact, the two sisters weren't particularly close. And though in the film Anne is the older sister, historians today believe that Mary was the older one.<br/><br/>Mary actually had two children, but there isn't a lot of evidence to support that her second child was actually King Henry's. What isn't mentioned in the film itself is that after Mary's husband (Cumberbatch) died, she married a soldier secretly, a man way beneath her station, and was banished from court, never to return. Her family also disowned her. Up until then, she was at court; when she was widowed, Anne arranged for her to have a pension and had Mary's second child, a boy, educated.<br/><br/>After Mary's and Anne's parents died, Mary inherited some property and she and her husband lived quietly and happily for the rest of their lives.<br/><br/>Very good film, well worth seeing."

","Many are the attempts to tell the wide and deep story of England's talented but power-spoiled Henry VIII and his wives. The intrigue and the ramifications for Europe and the Christian religion are the ""wide and deep"" of it. This one rates well for acting, costumes, and scenery. Its flaw is in the concept of limiting it to the Boleyn family. That should have been its strength. Something doesn't go right. The skips and jumps, the telescoping in transitions may be the culprit. That's a director's job, and that of his staff. If it were to be otherwise, the story takes more care and not 115 minutes as is allowed here, but about twice that. It has been done. A series. This cast could have been a good one for that re-effort. Portman and Johannson are excellent as the Boleyn sisters. Their ambitious and doomed father and uncle are done very well. And King Henry's actor has the figure and face that could be aged unto his death, shall I say, comforted by his sixth wife. It would then take another few hours to tell the story of the daughter of Anne and Henry, Elizabeth I. History demands this to be told many times, probably each generation. Henry's father, Henry VII, was the last English king to win his title on a battlefield, at Bosworth in 1485, defeating Richard III. It would be good to see the story from that point. It could be carried through to Shakespeare and beyond Elizabeth to James I. Therefore, from 1485 to the earliest part of 1600. That would be something to shoot for. I wanted to see ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" and did so over a 2.5 hour stretch with 45 minutes of TV commercials. Interruptions were every 10 to 15 minutes, and the ads were a jumble of nothingness as several were stacked without consideration for whatever part of the plot is chopped into. That's what TV has become: the greatest salesman ever invented, and yet powerless to do much beyond brand-naming. It may well be the goose that laid the golden egg but is cut open in greed to find them all -- so greed will kill it. Television is not an entertainment medium so much as it is an advertising medium. Rent the movie for a better experience and a chance to appreciate."

","The Other Boleyn Girl is not as artsy as Anne of the Thousand Days or The Lion in Winter, which also have their shortcomings. TOBG explores the human side of these historical figures. As much as we might mock dead white men (and women?) they did have hormones, which demonstrably motivate state figures from Helen of Troy and Cleopatra to WJC.<br/><br/>I see Scarlett Johansson more as eye-candy than actress. While she has avoided sex-exploitation films for the most part, I feel she gets so many good roles in Hollywood due to her physical attributes.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman on the other hand, I've liked her in everything I've seen: The Professional, Mars Attacks!, Where the Heart Is, Garden State, V for Vendetta.

","I am pretty sure I saw the review for this film on Film 2008 with Jonathan Ross, I have seen a few films based on Henry VII, not many of them about his liaisons with other women besides the six that became wives, this film looking at that sounded interesting enough. Basically King Henry VII Tudor (Eric Bana) is having marital difficulties with his first wife Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent) because she failed to give him his male heir to the throne, so the Boleyn family are summoned to his court. They are father/husband Sir Thomas (Mark Rylance), mother/wife Lady Elizabeth (Kristin Scott Thomas), their son George (Jim Sturgess), and of course their two beautiful daughters, Anne (Natalie Portman) and (the sister I'd never heard of before) Mary (Scarlett Johansson). The original plan was for the beautiful Anne to become Henry's mistress eventually leading to a marriage and of course her pregnancy, however the King is more interested in the innocent sister and as beautiful Mary. She agrees to his courting, despite the fact that she is engaged to also innocent William Carey (Benedict Cumberbatch), who obviously grows increasingly jealous. Sir Thomas, along with Lady Elizabeth's brother The Duke of Norfolk (Cape Wrath's David Morrissey) are doing whatever they can, even with Lady Elizabeth's dismay, to secure a place royal position for the Boleyn's, and keep the King happy. Mary does indeed fall pregnant at the hands of Henry, however his interest in her dwells and his eyes are drawn to originally planned partner Anne, which of course leads to a new passion. Mary does have the baby boy he always wanted, but because Henry didn't marry her it is essentially a bastard child and useless to a kingdom that can't use an unofficial heir. Henry decides to get married to Anne instead, who does get pregnant with his child, but he is disappointed to learn that it is a girl at birth. They try for another child and she gets pregnant again, but she is devastated to have a miscarriage, which of course causes Henry to fall out with her. The sisters really rival for his affections, but the arguments all come to a head when Anne is arrested for suspected treason to the kingdom, and possibly practising witchcraft, and Mary begs with Henry for him to spare her. So it comes to the day of execution, George is also beheaded on the day, and Mary hopes that Henry has a letter for her saying that Anne will be spared however, the execution goes ahead, and in the end we see the King with new wife-to-be Jane Seymour (Corinne Galloway), and little Elizabeth who grew to be queen for over forty years. Also starring Eddie Redmayne as William Stafford and Juno Temple as Jane Parker. I have say first that Johansson is normally one of the most gorgeous stars on screen, and her she is a little less glamorous compared to Portman, but they both do well sporting English accents, an improvement from Star Wars for Portman, and Bana is quite good as the King too. The story is patchy in places, and you really wonder about historic accuracy at times, despite the fact that it is based on a novel, but it isn't such a bad historical romantic drama. Scarlett Johansson was number 10 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols. Okay!"

My father(who is also a history-buff) and I went and saw the movie soon after it came out. The movie is both and good and bad.<br/><br/>The good parts of this movie includes casting Natalie Portman as Anne Boleyn. I have always thought her to be a wonderful actress and was excited to hear that she would be in it. The costumes are wonderful as well, enough to make me want to get one myself! The sets are also great and transport the viewer back in time. The movie is good, but it does have its problems.<br/><br/>The bad parts of this movie are mainly dealing with the facts. The only reference to the period of time passing is the birth of children. The Anne Boleyn Henry VIII affair lasted a total of 13 years, but a viewer would guess maybe a total of 5 years. The one scene that drove me crazy was the rape scene. In the theater I said aloud ""What the Hell?"" Anne was not raped by Henry for their first sexual encounter, and this did not result in Elizabeth's birth. Other screw-ups include the absence of Mary's daughter Catherine by Henry and the death of her first husband William Carey, Elizabeth being raised by her aunt, or the fact that Anne was sent to France as punishment. In reality Anne was sent to France at the age of 4 and grew up there. She was sent to Hever after the affair with Henry Percy.<br/><br/>All in all the movie is okay. My suggestion is that if you want to see this movie and enjoy it, see it before you read the book. The movie is good by itself, but when compared to the book it is a failure. I like the movie as a movie standing alone, but not as an adaptation of the Gregory novel."

","Anne Boleyn (mother of Elizabeth I) is one of the most fascinating Queens in the royal history of England. If one is expecting a realistic portrayal of her life in 'The Other Boleyn Girl', then they're in for a huge disappointment. The movie is full of inaccuracies and is best watched as a work of fiction.<br/><br/>I haven't read the novel but seeing that it was a vast Hollywood-type production, I was expecting something fictitious. In a way, that worked. The movie's more like a drama of rivalry, jealousy, despair etc of these fictional Boleyn sisters. There are many melodramatic moments too that exude a soap opera feel. The movie is supposed to be set in the 1500s but the language feels very modern. The actors look the same throughout the entire film. There's no indication of passage of time. The men are portrayed in a negative light and most of them are hateful. The settings, sets, costumes and visuals are impressive but the cinematography is very ordinary.<br/><br/>As for the cast, Natalie Portman, does not physically fit the part. Women in those days were far curvier and Portman's skinny body looks out of place. Both she and Scarlett Johanssen lack the mannerisms of women of 1500s. Portman's Anne is manipulative, witchy, desperate, and impatient which is quite the contrary of what the real Anne Boleyn was, but then again this is a flaw in the writing. Otherwise, Portman's performance is okay. Scarlett Johansson looks very pretty. She does look clueless (again) in many scenes but there are a few notable sequences where she shines. Poor Eric Bana looks like he doesn't know what he should do. He lacks the charm and ruthlessness of Henry VIII (it's pretty much the women who are forced to work the charm). David Morrissey's Thomas Howard is evil but one-dimensional. Kristin Scott Thomas and Ana Torrent are the only ones whose wonderful acting linger in mind after the end credits have rolled.<br/><br/>'The Other Boleyn Girl' is best watched as a fictional semi-soap opera. But if you're expecting some historical enlightenment, forget this one and try 'Anne of the Thousand Days' which is also a far more engaging film."

","For a dynasty that only lasted a little over a century (although in that relatively short span of time it produced 5 monarchs - or 6, if you count Jane Grey - including two of the greatest in Henry VIII and Elizabeth I) the Tudors have had a disproportionate impact on both history and Hollywood. ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is the latest in the Tudor-inspired collection of films. It's not the best of the bunch (I'd personally give that place to ""Lady Jane"") but it's also not the worst. It features an excellent performance from Natalie Portman as Anne Boleyn and also from Scarlett Johansson as her younger sister Mary. Yes, it perhaps has too much of a soap opera type feel to it (although that tends to be the way we regard the British monarchy today as well) but it is interesting and I thought it portrayed a believable account of the complicated relationship between the two Boleyn girls as they competed for the attention and love of Henry VIII, played by Eric Bana, who I thought failed to nail that part as well as he could have, but who wasn't bad. I also thought that Ana Torrant gave a pretty good performance as Henry's first Queen, the unfortunate Catharine of Aragon.<br/><br/>The reconstruction of 16th century England (in the sets and the costumes) was well done, while some of the dialogue was, frankly, less than engrossing. To modern eyes, the most unsettling thing about the movie might be the way in which the Boleyn girls were used as pawns by their own father and uncle - knowingly sent off to the royal court to be sexual playthings for the king (even though Mary was already married) - in order to gain the family favour and status. Even having said that, it's difficult to feel too much sympathy for them - especially for Anne, who is portrayed as a master manipulator who would willingly sell out anyone to fulfill her dream of becoming England's Queen. As I said, this is neither the best nor the worst ""Tudor movie"" you'll find, but it is a decent enough movie - not a masterpiece, but worth a couple of hours to see it through. 6/10"

But it's still kind of fun to watch badly miscast Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johanssen give horrible performances as the Boleyn sisters. Scarlett Johannsen's sultriness is smothered by her passive role as Mary, and Natalie Portman fails to deliver in her big emotional scenes as Anne. Eric Bana's King is pushed into the background by the focus on the sisters, so he never really gets a chance to give us insight into the much-married King. Despite all it's flaws, I still found the royal intrigue enjoyable enough to while away a lazy Sunday afternoon. And I do enjoy anything with costumes. Sets and design were quite nice, but it was a shame to see Kristin Scott Thomas become part of the furniture in her thankless role as the mother of the girls. Luckily she is getting major wraps for a new French drama, ""I've Loved You So Long"", so I can stand it.

The historical tale of Henry the 8th's passion for Anne Boleyn, which resulted in the creation of Protestantism and the downfall of absolute Papal secular authority, is one of the great tales of Western culture,one of truly Shakespearean proportions, the consequences of which have reverberated for the last 400 years.<br/><br/>This movie, which seems at times like a simple shameless ripoff of the great film ""Anne of the Thousand Days"", and at other times, seeks to dumb this story down to a bland soap opera, with the elements of bodice-ripper dimestore romance novels, completely ignores the virtually earth-shaking political and religious dimensions of the actual events, and speeds up events in a ""Reader's Digest Condensed Books"" fashion, so that they become devoid of all meaning, while piling on absurd historical inaccuracies, is evidence of the extent to which popular culture has Dumbed down over the last 4 decades. Most of the acting is wooden and unconvincing, especially in the case of Eric Bana, who is only slightly less believable than he was in the first ""Hulk"" flick, although the two lead actresses, in particular Ms. Johanssen, do make a heroic effort to rescue some feeling from the otherwise banal and pedestrian dialogue. Anyone who is not particularly familiar with the historical events, or has not seen the superb film of this story done by Hal Wallis, starring Richard Burton and Genevieve Bujold, can be forgiven for considering this a passably interesting entertainment, but, to realize how fully awful this movie really is, one needs to watch ""Anne of the Thousand Days"". You will NOT be disappointed !!"

","I read the historical novel by Philippa Gregory before I saw this movie so maybe my expectations were too high... but what a terrible disappointment this movie was to me. My main problem with this movie was the horrific weakness in every inch of it. It didn't examine the themes in the book with nearly enough grit or depth and if I were Gregory I would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this soft, teen fluff...<br/><br/>Eric Bana as Henry VIII... whose bright idea was THAT? He was fake, stereotypical and way too clean cut for the adulterous, revolting, chauvinistic fiend Henry VIII was. Natalie Portman was passable... but Johansson was revoltingly flimsy as Mary, which is accurate to a point... but her blandness was just painful.<br/><br/>They skated over issues that they obviously dubbed too scandalous and confronting (i.e. incest, homosexuality etc) and instead presented us with this fluffy, flimsy, weak... THING with no backbone and less substance than its main actors... This was just a Hollywood corrupted crowd pleaser and I am saddened that this, THIS represents such a fantastically gritty, unpretending and absorbing novel. Tsk tsk"

Mary is called from the country after hearing the news. George gets beheaded..before Mary arrives. I'm sort of upset since George was so innocent..anyway, Mary talks the king into sparing her sister Anne. since the king trusted and was always fond of Mary(he chose her first, no?) he says he will.. so Mary goes to tell Anne of this. when brought out into the public, she makes a speech while looking hopefully around for the kings messenger to bring the message of her freedom..but.....the letter says that though henry is very fond of Mary..Anne had committed a crime that was punishable only by death..and that he hoped that god would have mercy on Anne's soul. i really was sad and depressed after this movie...oh but! at the end Mary goes back to the country with William Stafford (the guy who truly loves herrr) and the children.

"Bunuel1976","7","0","0","3 September 2008"," THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL (Justin Chadwick, 2008) ***
","Having studied European History in Secondary School, I've always been fascinated by the reign of England's King Henry VIII  a period less noted for chivalrous deeds than bed-hopping antics, as he married no less than six times in order to secure a male heir to the throne (even if this caused a rift between the country and the Roman Catholic Church which endures to this very day). Unsurprisingly, all of this has made him ideal film material  personally, I've watched THE PRIVATE LIFE OF HENRY VIII (1933), THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER (1937), THE SWORD AND THE ROSE (1953), YOUNG BESS (1953), A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS (both 1966 big-screen and 1988 TV versions), ANNE OF A THOUSAND DAYS (1969) and, of course, CARRY ON HENRY (1971); I recently acquired HENRY VIII AND HIS SIX WIVES (1972), which was adapted from a much longer TV series, but have yet to check it out.<br/><br/>This, then, gives a 'novel' twist to the most turbulent period in Henry's life and reign  as we discover that, before making Anne Boleyn his Queen (whose offspring was Elizabeth I), he had been involved with her younger sister (who had actually borne him a son)!; incidentally, these events  based on a novel by Philippa Gregory  had already been adapted for the small screen in 2003but someone thought that this little-known romance was intriguing enough to make it into a feature film. As it stands, THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is a sumptuous-looking production  despite being mostly restricted to interiors, and where the color scheme is actually quite subtle; for this reason, much depends on the acting  and the three leads (Natalie Portman as Anne, Scarlett Johannson as the titular figure and Eric Bana as Henry) are all given the opportunity to shine, thus overcoming their basic youthfulness for the roles. Two other notables in the cast are Kristin Scott-Thomas as the two Boleyn sisters' mother and Ana Torrent (still best-known for playing the little girl in THE SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE [1973]) as the barren and jealous Queen Katharine.<br/><br/>Even so, the plot (which, reportedly, doesn't play fair with history) defies credibility at times and tends too often towards melodrama. For one thing, Henry is depicted as something of a pawn in the machinations of an over-ambitious family; he's also gullible (it's Anne who pushes him into breaking with Rome!) and, least convincingly of all, is the fact that everything seems to happen simply because she refuses to sleep with the King before he makes her Queen (which then leads to a potentially campy scene in which Henry rapes Anne)! The less said, then, of the Queen's attempt to entice her fey brother into impregnating her (soon after she loses Henry's second child)  and how this is what ultimately led to Anne's execution!  the better; incidentally, the film rather rushes through her tenure as sovereign (despite the title, she's the real protagonist)  while the pivotal character of Sir Thomas More (the subject of A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS) doesn't figure at all in Church-rupture affair! That said, such narrative shortcomings don't really impinge on one's enjoyment of the film  hence the respectable rating accorded it.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL won't dispel memories of the better cinematic versions of Henry VIII's reign and (some of his) loves  but it's nonetheless valuable as much for shedding light on an episode which had previously been all but overlooked as for its atypically frank detail of life at court."
"marcin_kukuczka","8","0","0","31 August 2008"," Captivating Movie with Lots of Surprising Merits
","Although British history has been brought to screen in several memorable productions, there has been a shortage of some historical periods on screen, periods which are very interesting and which could constitute nice bases for a wonderfully entertaining movie. These feelings of lack had been rising in me until I went to see this latest movie by Justin Chadwick, THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL the content of which is set in the infamous period of Henry VIII's reign. And let me make myself clear at the beginning: I did not go to see it because of young starlets, neither Natalie Portman nor Scarlett Johansson. I went to see it as a genre buff being interested in two supreme factors: historical period being executed and its artistic features. What were my impressions? <br/><br/>I was stunned by beautiful cinematography, a very accurate mood of the times, impressive wardrobe and particularly lavish sets. This movie proves the fact that they can really make wonderful movies these days, too. Together with the action and strong storyline, the director did not forget that historical movies need to contain some grandeur which, like nothing else, stir our imagination of the days of yore. There are lots of scenes in THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL that leave you breathless. Let me mention, for instance, the beautifully shot scene of hunting during the king's first visit at Boleyn family's. Katherine of Aaragon's trial is also filmed memorably with managed pace and unforgettable atmosphere. The execution of Anne Boleyn contains unforgettable moments. Therefore, I think that this movie truly provides a viewer with an accurate image of the period. However, that is not all I would like to praise about the film since the merits of the film went beyond my expectations, beyond my factors.<br/><br/>What surprised me a lot were the performances. As I mentioned at the beginning, I am not a fan of new actresses who play the main roles but I must admit that both Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson do pretty good jobs in their portrayals. Ms Portman depicts the very psychological complications of her character changing from a shy girl into a wicked mistress of the king to whom love matters only when supplied with power and position. It is her who finally changes into a suffering victim. Scarlet Johansson memorably portrays her character's goodness of heart, simplicity and straightforward attitude towards people and their feelings. She is easily identified with and appears to be extremely appealing to tender people. As far as supporting cast are concerned, Eric Bana depicts the king really well providing us with the insight into desire which affects all the rest. In a memorable scene, we see him kneeling down in a chapel behind Anne and lustfully looking at her neck. His decision to tear apart from anything that should have meant much to a noble king proves that powerful impact of lust. Kristin Scott Thomas also surprised me in her role of Lady Elizabeth Boleyn who portrays a good mother, a reasonable woman who strives to stop the mad conspiracies and sickly ambitious plans of men in her house.<br/><br/>But what makes THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL a must see is the particular insight into the psychology of humans, into various bad acts that we either regret or forget, into desires that blind men to many significant matters. Finally, it is an insight into selfish hatred that usually ruins the lives of the innocent, calm people. It is not a sort of historical film about which you could only say: a spectacle. THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is truly a captivating movie that you watch with attention and interest. Pay attention to Henry VIII and Katherine of Aragon and you will notice the core of what the film offers. It really touches the gist of human nobility or human wickedness, the gist of upright feelings combined with devotion or earthly desires that, by chance and mistake, got the name of ""love"" <br/><br/>THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL is a movie I highly recommend, one of the very best productions that have been made these days. 8/10"
"Red-125","8","0","0","8 August 2008"," Six wives and a mistress
","""The Other Boleyn Girl"" (2008) was directed by Justin Chadwick. It stars Natalie Portman as Anne Boleyn, and Scarlett Johansson as her sister, Mary Boleyn. As everyone knows, Henry VIII broke with the Roman Catholic church in order to divorce his first wife, Katherine of Aragon, and marry Anne Boleyn. We all know what happened to Anne when she failed to produce a son and heir. What many of us don't know--but is apparently true--is that Henry fathered a son by Anne's sister Mary. Because this child was born out of wedlock, and because Henry assumed he would have a legitimate male heir, he didn't acknowledge the child. The relationship between the king and the two sisters is at the center of the film.<br/><br/>The film doesn't adhere to a strict timeline. For example, Anne Boleyn spent most of her early life in the royal households of the Netherlands and France. In the film, she is sent to France as a punishment, and almost immediately recalled. However, the basic facts- - that Mary Boleyn was Henry's mistress and that Anne Boleyn refused to become his mistress, but became his wife--are correct. The acting is excellent, and the casting choices are outstanding. (Some people have written that the two sisters are cast against type, but I don't agree. Johansson, with her blonde hair and open expression, is perfect for Mary, who is portrayed as naive and trusting. Portman's exotic dark beauty is ideal for Anne, who is manipulative and ambitious.) <br/><br/>Eric Bana does well as Henry Tudor, but three of the supporting actors are truly excellent-- David Morrissey as the amoral Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, Kristin Scott Thomas as the girls' mother, Lady Elizabeth Boleyn, and Ana Torrent as Katherine of Aragon, Henry's first wife. <br/><br/>If you hate costume dramas, stay away from this film. If you enjoy movies with great castles, magnificent horses, gorgeous costumes, handsome men and beautiful women, ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" delivers all of these things. <br/><br/>We saw the movie on a large, flat-screen TV. It would work better in a theater, and would lose some of its grandeur with DVD on a standard television screen. Still, whatever the format, I think it's good enough to be worth finding and seeing."
"evanston_dad","6","0","0","7 August 2008"," Where Were My Heaving Bosoms?
","I was expecting heaving bosoms and bodice rippings galore from this costume drama, but sadly, the filmmakers and actors decide to take this piece of ""historical"" fiction seriously, and so ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is not nearly as fun as it could have been.<br/><br/>Either Natalie Portman, as Anne, or Scarlett Johansson, as Mary, is the ""other"" girl of the title, depending on your point of view. Both are paraded before King Henry VIII (Eric Bana -- yeah right!) in an attempt to make one or the other his mistress and so establish the Boleyn family firmly in the king's favor. It's a vaguely feminist story -- the girls' uncle and father pull the strings, while their mother (Kristen Scott Thomas, underused) stands in the background looking disapproving. But first and foremost, the film is a gussied up bit of Masterpiece Theatre starring beautiful Hollywood actors.<br/><br/>The film is entertaining, but never fully engaging. For me, this was largely due to the casting. Natalie Portman is directed to play Anne Boleyn like a scheming villainess one moment, and a nobly suffering wife the next. The performance is uneven and unconvincing, and I'm not sure if the fault lies with Portman as an actress, the way the part is written, or the way she's directed to play it. Eric Bana does not have the physical presence or spirit to play Henry VIII, though the ladies in the audience should be happy, because the only bosoms to be seen in the movie belong to him. Let's just say that if Henry VIII had looked like Eric Bana, history might have turned out differently.<br/><br/>The only actress who I felt truly did service to her role is Scarlett Johansson. Johansson gets a bad rap from people for some reason, but every time I see her in something, I'm impressed by how much I like her. I think she's a good actress who doesn't coast on her looks (like she certainly could), and I wonder how this film would have come across if she and Portman had switched roles.<br/><br/>Fans of elaborate costumes and production design should have fun with this movie.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"
"maryfabuk","5","0","0","4 August 2008"," A bit of a let down
","I was really looking forward to seeing this film as I'm very interested in the Tudor period. I was disappointed though to see that a lot of the dialogue had been lifted practically word for word from the adaption of Henry the 8th played by Ray Winstone and Helena Bonham Carter as Anne. Especially the scene where Catherine of Aragon meets Anne and Mary in the corridor before going into court and the court scene which tries Anne later on in the film. The two girls who play Anne and Mary in this are very good in their roles and manage to portray a convincing sister relationship. Eric Bana as Henry doesn't do it justice though, he just seems to walk around looking menacing. I never got a sense of just how long Anne and Henry had been together. In the film it looks like they've been together hardly two minutes when in reality they were together for 7 years before they got married. I realise that it's a lot to fit into just under 2 hours but the film Anne of the Thousand Days managed it very well. As with loads of these films, the film didn't do the book justice. The book focused more on Mary as the centre of the story while this was just another tale of Anne Boleyn with Mary on the sidelines. A story none of us needs to be told again. I was interested to see what they'd do with Mary as the main character but I felt like she was too much watered down. Even at her peak of Henry's affection, you never feel that shes just more than a wham bam thank you ma'am, instead of the real threat she was to Anne. The mother of Anne and Mary was turned into a caring woman who didn't like to see her daughters as pawns, but it didn't give the sense of Mary not being in control of her life. Mary's mother was just as ambitious as the rest of the family. Also there was absolutely no mention of Mary's husband after Henry got rid of her, or her later marriage. It was a good effort but it was a swing and a miss for me."
"mchi","6","0","0","31 July 2008"," Interesting movie
","I enjoyed this movie for several reasons. I'm really not into history all that much, but since Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johanssen were in it I thought I would give it a chance. I really liked how they portrayed the parents as willing to do anything in order to gain favor with the king and all of the important people. That is just like human nature and they portrayed it wonderfully. They were really making a sacrifice in jeopardizing the chastity of their daughters in order to become more important and what not. I wish that they would have shown Mary's husband's reaction a little more. I guess he was just okay with the whole situation or really didn't care that his wife was having an affair with the king. There was probably nothing he could do about it. I would recommend this to anyone who is in the mood for an interesting and intriguing movie."

","This movie immediately grabs you from the start. The moving performance from both leading actresses, beautiful costumes and breathtaking shots.

It makes your heart beat faster in your chest.<br/><br/>It gives a good view on how offspring could be used for the family's ambition and status. After seeing this movie you will embrace your freedom (especially if you are a woman) even more.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman shines in this movie and has definitely convinced me as an actress after her shallow performance in Star Wars. She has truly grown. Furthermore it is very entertaining and refreshing to see her play the bold, wicked sister for a change.<br/><br/>It is a very interesting movie about what (could) took place in history before Elizabeth took the thrown.

","Having read some of the previous comments (fortunately after seeing the movie), I can understand why English people aware of their history might find the movie disturbing. However, coming from the south part of Europe and with no detailed knowledge of the history as written in the books, I must say I enjoyed the movie. Yes, it was not a 10/10, but it had an interesting plot, lots of twists, drama, intense scenes, and a nearly unexpected ending. After reading the previous comments, I could then recognize some elements that were not exactly right, but the movie left me with a satisfied feeling, and in the end maybe that's all that matters."

","My girlfriend insisted we watch this last night. Since I've subjected her to quite a few dubious movies, I couldn't resist. Or should I have?<br/><br/>THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL was not a terrible film. And I couldn't complain about it being unrealistic - although I do question some of the historical conclusions drawn by the book and script authors - but I can complain that it wasn't all that exciting. What you've got here, my friends, is another in the BBC's endless series of historic dramas. This means it's for fans of great locations. Great costumes. Great acting. But endless soap opera sequences. This picture might work great as a mini-series, but as a film it hasn't the guts it needs.<br/><br/>Which doesn't mean it's a bad film.

","The acting is pretty good, Natalie Portman stands out as usual. She is a naturally gifted actress and has only gotten better since her debut in ""The Professional."" My main complaint and although this is a movie it takes way too much liberty as far as the falsehood of the stories. ""The Tudors"" on Showtime though is guilty of the same, but this just was too far-fetched an actually absurd in places. It just goes to show that time and time again that people love their soap opera stories and find history to be too boring on it's own. I think that is a pity and believe that we don't actually need to have fake stories to make history interesting. If you actually want to learn anything don't bother watching this. I give credit to the actors doing the best they could with this pretty mediocre at best script. Again watch ""The Tudors"" for a little bit better history & the same excellent production values."

"jdesando","Null","14","58","25 February 2008"," Squandered . . .
","Losing your head to ambition is pretty much what we know of Anne Boleyn, wife of the mercurial Henry VIII, who clipped a few necks to get a legitimate Tudor heir. The Other Boleyn Girl details the inner workings of the Boleyn family's intrigues to get their daughters in the bed of the king to secure their fortunes. The relentlessly disappointing births form the boring center of a period drama that shows how the superior talents of Natalie Portman (Anne) and Scarlett Johansson (Mary) can be squandered.<br/><br/>The accessories, like those in Sophia Coppola's Marie Antoinette, are visually stunning: costumes, castles, boudoirs are appointed sumptuously and, I presume, accurately. What's lacking here is in the depiction of Henry by Eric Bana, as physically, intellectually, and emotionally far from Charles Laughton's defining portrayal as could be possible. Even if Laughton's part were trumped up, the king who married six times and may have composed Greensleeves (Anne did reject his advances, after all ( ""cast me off discourteously"") was more than a disappointed baby maker, as neophyte director Justin Chadwick has Bana play it.<br/><br/>That Anne was beheaded for adultery is known; when the film proposes incest as a mitigating circumstance, I'm lost to the extent that I'll have to verify this salacious footnote at a future date. The film does acknowledge that Henry assumed a dangerous power after he realized that an alliance with Rome was unnecessary. But then this is essentially a study of sixteenth-century women lost to the power of men, not a history of bad boy Henry.<br/><br/>As a feminist tract, The Other Boleyn Girl works. These ladies define their lives by achieving social station in whatever way possible, being reminded of their infamy by their mother, Lady Elizabeth Boleyn, played with an ominous resignation by Kristin Scott-Thomas. The ascendancy of the surpassing Elizabeth to the throne, presiding over the arguably most productive era in Western history, is a satisfactory coda to this film and a supreme irony for a king who thought only a male heir could assure transcendent hegemony.<br/><br/>Hillary Clinton's achievements can be illuminated and enhanced by looking at the centuries-old queen who supported William Shakespeare. Perhaps Hillary will join Elizabeth in making converts of obtuse men and enabling women in the 21st century."

","A terrific story with excellent multi-dimensional characters; particularly the 4 leading female actresses; most particularly Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johanssen. I'd never have given either credit for the brilliant job they do here. One of the few films for adults, I'd like to say that when I was an 11 year old boy (since 90% of Hollywood product is targeted at 11 year old boys) we would have enjoyed a film like this, and learned something from it.<br/><br/>When you watch the almost G rated sex scenes with Scarlett Johanssen you can understand why she was named #1 in sex appeal in a recent poll.<br/><br/>As the Episcopal Church was created for the ill purpose of providing the King with a means toward his unjust divorce, as well as to allow his false marriage to Ann Boleyn, these ill deeds --- including the head-chopping of moral men -- seems of comparable high purpose in light of the recent split in the Episcopal Church to allow the consecration of a man who divorced his wife and dumped his children in order to have sex with his buddy. As Liberals steer their church into the abyss and attempt to force compliance through extortion, righteous persons stand strong, as their leader the Archbishop of Canterbury -- spineless and weak -- does nothing at all. Thus does history repeat itself.<br/><br/>Sex and the City is definitely this years's chick flick, but this excellent historic drama stands right there with it; both films strongly recommended for men."

","Instantly, the movie starts telling a different story than the book. It continues with gorgeous sets, great acting, but a horrible screenplay. I was not expecting the movie to be half as good as the book, but I was not expecting it to not follow the book at all. The movie depicts Anne Boleyn as a victim of King Henry VIII, but in the book she is not a nice, caring sister, but a vicious, competitive woman who will stop for nothing, even her sister. The book was a wonderful read that allowed for a great movie, but it was not filmed in that way. If you have read the book you will more than likely be incredibly upset after seeing this movie. If you still insist on seeing it, wait for it to come to DVD and see if you can have it sent during the free 2 week trial of Netflix. I saw it for free and that was even too much!"

","The Other Boleyn Girl is normally not a film that I would see in the theater. I took my mother to see this for her birthday. She wanted to see this so off to the theater we went. I thoroughly enjoyed the film. The performances are fantastic, but I have to say Johansen surprised me a bit as I didn't think this was her kind of fare. She doesn't come off as being a period piece kind of actress. However she and Portman turn in the film's best performances, as well they should since they are playing the titled characters.<br/><br/>Bana gives us a tortured and VERY faulty Henry VIII. Everyone of the cast, all BBC regulars, are stellar.<br/><br/>The histrionics of the film aside, I was never bored and was kept completely pulled into the story mainly by the performances of Johansen and Portman. The locations are beautiful and you get a real sense of history from the production design and costume design, though the film's and the book it is based on, are not entirely factual in the account shown.<br/><br/>I would recommend this one even at full price admission."

","As a movie, The Other Boleyn Girl is interesting, compelling, and visually stunning. However, if you are like me and absolutely loved the book, then the movie version will (as usual) be extremely disappointing. The purpose of the book is to follow Mary's story (hence the title). We all know Anne Boleyn's history, it is the chronicling of the younger sister's journey that caused the book to be such a phenomenal read. Apparently someone forgot to clue the screenwriter in on this little detail because Mary is virtually forgotten for the middle portion of the movie. Her romances and emotions are swept aside for the drama of her older sister's life. What is somewhat ironic is that this is the reason Mary's story was neglected all of these years- she was perpetually overshadowed by her sister. The movie was no exception.<br/><br/>To be completely fair, Scarlett and Natalie give incredible performances and the movie, taken as a separate entity, is very good. However, for the hard-core Phillipa Gregory fans out there, do not expect to see the book come to life or you will leave, as I did, greatly disappointed."

","I love historical fiction, and I do not require it to be all that accurate. But I generally don't want to pay 9 dollars to see a soap opera.<br/><br/>Henry VIII is already, all on his own, an almost cartoonish character. The challenge in adapting movies about his life is bringing something new to his story. The Other Boleyn Girl tries very hard to do that, but unfortunately pushes this story so over the top the movie is actually kind of funny.<br/><br/>We open with a wheat field, which makes me feel like I'm watching Gladiator, and are introduced to the Boleyn family with some very stilted dialogue between Sir Thomas Boleyn and his wife. While these family scenes are supposed to introduce us to the family and their sibling dynamics, it's really just wasted air time. We then flash forward immediately to Mary Boleyn's first marriage, and get introduced to Mary's desire to have a simple life, which is then instantly interrupted by the arrival of the English Court and her placement (once Anne fails at the task) as the mistress to the King of England.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie Anne's seduction of the king and eventual fall, a story almost anyone who's taken a British history course knows. But rather than let the king's moodiness and indecision speak for itself, this film goes so far over the top. Anne is rushed back to England to keep the king from straying in a scene that reminded me so much of the Ring Wraiths I laughed. She then proceeds to seduce the king, actually hammering out the details of their agreement while her sister is literally howling away in the next room as she gives birth to the king's bastard. It's just too much.<br/><br/>The drama continues to it's natural conclusion. Spoiler alert: in an ending as shocking as the sinking of the Titanic, Anne Boleyn loses her head. In an added twist, we're supposed to believe Mary Boleyn then rescued Elizabeth from court and raised in the countryside by her aunt rather than her actual miserable child, which would be okay if the scene wasn't again was so overly dramatic and ridiculous with all the court stepping aside as Mary flees with her niece.<br/><br/>I saw an amazing amount of potential in Scarlett Johanssen and Natalie Portman in this film, but they are so bogged down in a ridiculous movie. Natalie Portmanin particular shows some real talent in Anne's breakdown, but it is at the very end of a film that had already lost me as a serious picture. The supporting characters are not helpful. On the bright side,it has beautiful costumes and scenery, minus one really bad bluescreened Westminster Abby shot.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it, but not for the reasons I should have. I would wait to rent it on DVD."

"webmaster-3017","6","1","2","30 June 2009"," HK Neo Reviews: The Other Boleyn Girl
","Tagline: A tale of two sisters <br/><br/>Review by Neo: In a dream combination of two of Neo's favourite Hollywood starlets, Natalie Portman and Scarlet Johansson, movies just don't get better marketing than this, at least in Neo's honest opinion. Without being too bias, the two stars radiate the sort of screen beauty that is enough to keep Neo focused and watching for the entire 2 hours duration. Perhaps it is the style of Portman, or the angelic face of Scarlet, the movie is well-paced, at times compelling, filled with moments of tension all add up to disguise what is actually a thinly plotted historical drama. Still, the film somehow managed to brisk by the 2 hour duration without a second of boredom and that's an achievement alone.<br/><br/>History have always been an area of interest within Neo's life and while he is very much an ancient historian, his fascination in King Henry VIII is without question. Perhaps it is his ability to conquer 8 wives or maybe it is the tragedy of his character, King Henry is by far the most interesting and fascinating King of England. Aussie Eric Bana is given the aforementioned role and unfortunately despite his undeniable coolness his character is never given a role where Bana can stamp his authority and depth. The answer to this is that this is ultimately a vehicle for the two starlets to perform and most notably Natalie Portman.<br/><br/>Portman have always been the stylish one, but then again this is probably because she shares the same favourite colour with the current reviewer – sky blue. With that aside, Portman who stole the show in My Blueberry Nights (which will be released later in the year), outshone the entire cast in a role that she is born to play. Jealousy, death stares, threats, sexy, deadly are a few side of her character and more importantly she is able to do so with radiating screen presence. Her final scenes of awaiting death are a perfect indication that Portman have certainly come of age since her stoic Star Wars days.<br/><br/>It is without question that Neo likes Scarlet Johansson and here she reprises the sort of innocence last seen in A Girl With a Pearl Earring. She is suitably elegant, graceful, lovable and absolutely adoring. Despite being hampered by some awful makeup (Whoever did the makeup on her, should never work in a movie again!), Scarlet manages to match Portman, despite the later star given a more substantial role. Who can forget the expression on her face when she faces her uncle and father in the question of how many times did she do it with the King. Her expression was just priceless and the look on her face tells a thousand words.<br/><br/>All in all, The Other Boleyn Girl is a movie that brisk by despite clocking a little under 2 hours. It is a credit to the producers and director for creating plenty of thrilling and tense filled moments of timeless themes in romance, betrayal, love and redemption and doing it in absolute fine style. It is easy to be critical about such a film, as the plot is so thin that you can probably sum it all up in a single line. Luckily, the actors carry the film up and above all shoulders and the result is an entertaining if not substantial ride. While the film is certainly the case of what could've been and what ifs, the film is still enjoyable enough for any fans of the above stars to sit through. Then again, who can resists the charm of Scarlet Johansson and the style of Natalie Portman, well at least, Neo cannot (Neo 2008) <br/><br/>I rate it 6.75/10<br/><br/><ul><li>www.thehkneo.com</li></ul>"

","First, let me start by saying, I do not hate or rather despise this movie for its historical inaccuracies. Although numerous in their quantity, other shows based on the same time frame and with the same amount, if not more manage to carry the rise and fall of the Boleyn's with far more grace than this movie does.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman's acting is dubious at best and the same can be said for Scarlett. Eric manages the role with far more grandeur and skill than I had expected and yet it felt somewhat lacking. The costumes and sets are gorgeous and yet it all seems very stilted and wooden.<br/><br/>Now, let me get onto the historical inaccuracies. 'The Tudors' (Showtimes production) has near the same amount of inconsistencies but they at least keep true to the more important and vital parts of history. Anne Boleyn did not cry at her execution, it is a shame as I thought this would be the strongest part of the movie, she was dignified and strong until the last blow of the sword. Mary Boleyn was banished from court and was in no accounts present at her sisters executions. Anne wasn't married and there was no rape.<br/><br/>As much as I wanted to love this movie, it was hard to move past the glaring inaccuracies and slightly boring performances.<br/><br/>It is a great shame, Alison"
"Hancock_the_Superb","7","1","2","27 July 2008"," Lavishly made historical soap opera
","It's the reign of King Henry VIII (Eric Bana), and as usual, the Boleyn family is plotting to take advantage of his inability to have a son with Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent). The weak but ambitious Thomas Boleyn (Mark Rylance) and their arrogant Uncle, the Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey) enlist Anne (Natalie Portman) to be the King's mistress - but the headstrong Anne proves unsuitable, and so Anne's demure sister Mary (Scarlett Johansson) fills the role instead. Mary has the bad luck to fall for Henry, who dumps her when she becomes pregnant. Henry falls for Anne, but she is more reluctant: she manipulates him into divorcing Katharine, severing ties with Rome, and marrying her. Unable to bear Henry a son, Anne quickly falls out of his favor, and she must rely on her sister to save her life.<br/><br/>Yes, it's another film set in Tudor England, and the only new thing ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" can claim credit for is bringing Mary Boleyn to our attention. It's all been done before, and better. It's a lavishly made film with good acting and excellent production values; but story- and character-wise, it never rises above the level of melodrama.<br/><br/>The most interesting aspect of this film is its exploration of women in the 16th Century. Anne and Mary are loving sisters who are torn apart by their family's ambition. This was a time when women were nothing more than pawns of their family; society condemned them to be little more than wives, mothers, sex objects, and pawns in elaborate power games. Love doesn't matter, as marriages are arranged and parents can break up any relationship they dislike (as with Anne's match with Henry Percy). Girls like Mary simply accept their fate, leading to personal ruin and a miserable life. For a woman like Anne to stand up to the King is unthinkable; but in an age where women have no rights, it's the only way to gain the slightest bit of power.<br/><br/>The movie does a good job sketching this issue, and sets up a game of one-ups-manship between Anne and Mary. But this never really goes anywhere. Anne may be willing to sell Mary out to advance herself and her family, but Mary is too polite, and too noble to do the same. This would be interesting, if the first hour of the film isn't spent setting up a ""Battle of the Boleyns"". Mary is almost saintly in her nobility and loyalty to Anne, and in light of what happens here, one might question why. She's endearingly sincere, but as a result, she's a rather boring character compared to naughty Anne.<br/><br/>The movie also errs in skimming over the historical context in question. The movie somehow manages to go its whole length barely mentioning, if they do at all, Cardinal Wolsey, Thomas Cromwell, Thomas More, Archbishop Cranmer - you know, the guys who made Henry's reign interesting - let alone the momentous changes set forth by Henry's actions. It's not dumbed-down history, it's non-existent history. We don't even get to see Anne's influence on Henry's reign. Does Anne have interest in religious reform? We don't hear about it, except in one or two oblique lines of dialogue. Yes, the politics are not the point, but how can you create a film about Henry VIII without acknowledging his achievements? <br/><br/>Curiously, I watched Anne of the Thousand Days this past week as well, and it shares the same basic flaw. Both films do a good job of establishing our characters and portraying Henry and Anne's decidedly rocky courtship, but once Anne actually assumes the throne, the movie goes south due to much-too-quick pacing and lack of focus. Unfortunately, here this flaw is magnified by MTV-style editing and complete lack of historical and political context, causing things to zip by at a ridiculous pace. Natalie Portman's acting and the powerful execution scene go some way towards redeeming this, but we get little or no indication of why Anne and Henry fall out of love; it just happens.<br/><br/>One of the most egregious bits is the ending. As in AotTD, we are also needlessly reminded in a neon-light display at the end that ELIZABETH I IS ANNE'S DAUGHTER! YES! THAT ELIZABETH! THE DAUGHTER HENRY DIDN'T WANT AND THAT HE KILLED ANNE FOR! In both instances, gimme a break. Is there in anyone the audience who doesn't know this going in? <br/><br/>Technically, the movie is gorgeous: the costumes, music and art decoration are as gorgeous as any other period film you care to name, but that comes with the territory. The real revelation here is Kieran McGuigan's ravishing cinematography, full of moody colors and tones that create an almost surreal storybook atmosphere.<br/><br/>The cast is generally good. Natalie Portman is an astonishing Anne, ravishingly beautiful throughout and capturing Anne's fiery and strong-willed nature (not to mention vastly improving on her previously naff English accent). Scarlett Johansson is a good Mary, although her role is the weaker of the two. Kristin Scott Thomas delivers a knock-out performance as the girls' sympathetic but helpless mother, with Mark Rylance and David Morissey appropriately loathsome. Jim Sturgess, Juno Temple and Benedict Cumberbatch are good enough in supporting roles, although Ana Torrent is a rather clichéd and uninteresting Katherine. But the film's weak spot is undoubtedly Eric Bana. Normally a very good actor, Bana attempts to create an unusually understated Henry, but instead he ends up a dreadful bore. Even in his angry scenes he is too nice to be the capricious monster we know Henry as. Even Jonathan Rhys-Meyers' scenery-chewing on The Tudors is light-years ahead of Bana's Henry.<br/><br/>The Other Boleyn Girl lives up to its source novel and its own billing. It's a pretty good historical soap opera, but that's about all it is. Not that there's anything wrong with that.<br/><br/>7/10"
"mgerity-1","7","1","2","18 July 2008"," Why does the movie feel the need to make Anne the older sister?
","Pretty decent movie, but there is one thing I just don't understand. Historians seem to be pretty much in agreement at this point that Mary was the older sister of Anne, not the other way around. Despite that fact, this movie goes out of its way (way out of its way) to set forth repeatedly that Mary is the younger sister. Twice Anne calls her ""my younger sister"" and once the King says something about what it is like to be in the shadow of her older sister. The thing that is bizarre about this is that it adds absolutely nothing whatsoever to the movie--it's not important to the plot and is essentially unrelated to the story. So, the movie goes out of its way to establish something that isn't true, and even if there is legitimate dispute on the issue, why not just steer clear of the topic altogether? There was no point to or reason for the movie going down that path at all, so why do so?"
"angusiscool","5","1","2","25 June 2008"," It gets a bit better towards the end
","The beginning of the film is dry, but it gets a bit more intense as the film goes on. The acting for the most part is really quite horrible and stunted, save for Portman's performance (it actually evolves...what a concept). The rest of the actors would have seemed more natural if they had been reading from a teleprompter. Johannsen (sp?) plays the same mopey character she always plays, Bana has done much better, and the others should go back to TV soaps. Portman definitely carries the film, and makes it worth watching. I don't even like her that much normally, so it means something for me to say that.<br/><br/>As for the accuracy of the film, it never portrayed itself as a historically accurate portrayal. It is an adaptation of a book written by an author who is entertaining but not a historian. The film makes a bit more historical sense if you watch the deleted scenes - most of them really should have been left in."

","Another venture into Tudor History Lite. This film has gone the way of the recent HBO miniseries on the Tudors. I admit the Tudor family, with the exception of Elizabeth I, were the B-movie equivalent of English royals, but this film poorly modernizes their lack of sensibility and desperation to build a dynasty on very shaky hereditary ground. The conflicts all seem equivalent to Silicon Valley mergers. Dry, scrubbed clean, and dressed with cable-TV sex scenes. The movie's on-screen talent is immense. I have never seen Natalie Portman acting so badly, so over the top. I have to surmise this was the director's bidding. And what was happening with Mark Rylance's beards? I think that make up person might end up in The Tower. The whole production reminded me of the history pictures of the 1940s and 1950s. However, those beloved old films were great camp and did not take themselves as seriously as this misguided attempt."

","In fiction and history alike, it's Anne Boleyn who gets Henry VIII & thus commands most of our attention. Philippa Gregory wanted to examine Mary's history, though her novel plays fast & loose with the facts of Anne Boleyn's ascendancy at Henry VIII's court. It's a decent enough yarn, but ends up serving Mary poorly. She comes off in both book and film as a passive woman whose family treat her horribly but, weak & pliable, she's always there to help no matter what they've done to her. As Mary's character is at the heart of Gregory's story, her passivity doesn't rouse much sympathy for herself or the film. Mary was, in fact, more adventurous than Anne--mistress of the French King Francis I in her youth at his court, & sent home for loose morals. Back in England around 1520, Mary attracted Henry VIII who, to camouflage their affair & likely to cover up her first pregnancy by him, set up her marriage to a gentleman of his chamber. Henry probably fathered both children Mary bore while married & she may have continued to service him while Anne was playing the virtuous virgin. After Henry married Anne, Mary met William Stafford, became pregnant & married him in 1533/34. She was exiled from court & never saw Anne again. There's plenty of spice there but Gregory's curious failure to address it--especially Mary's early experiences at the French court--leaves this side of Mary's character in darkness. The film, alas, does likewise. That said, the film is a sumptuous delight for eye & ear even if the writing is stilted and the acting uneven. Eric Bana's Henry is badly served by a poor script &/or lousy editing. (Comparison to ""The Tudors"" is unfair; a theatrical film does does not have as much time as a TV miniseries for detailed character development.) As written & acted, Johansson's Mary is too passive, almost naive, to impress. The film really belongs to two characters. Kristin Scott Thomas, as the troubled Lady Boleyn, comments from the margins of the social fabric on the forces at play in the Boleyns' story. Of the film's performances, Scott's is the most likely to be remembered at awards time. Natalie Portman's Anne resents Mary's unexpected success with Henry, childishly tries to steal the spotlight with a secret marriage to Henry Percy, then uses all her wiles to take the king from Mary. Portman handles this with ease & assurance, and compellingly portrays Anne's despair as she finds she has cost Henry too much: he realizes the prize was not worth the chase. Indeed the strength of Portman's portrayal only further subverts the supposedly central role of Mary Boleyn and wrests control of the narrative from Johansson's character. Gregory's novel was clear that Mary was to be considered the ""other"" Boleyn girl, but by allowing Anne to upstage Mary completely--or rather by having Mary allow Anne to do so--the film at least introduces a challenging ambiguity as to which sister really was, or should be regarded as, the ""other."" That ambiguity is, however, the only really challenging aspect of the whole production."

","In an age of absolute monarchs, an authoritarian church, and despotic courts, the free will of an individual was often discarded for political or other such means. One family, the Boleyns who are an otherwise modest family with low connections to the court, will experience this with tragic results.<br/><br/>Sir Thomas Boleyn (Mark Rylance) is traditional father for his time. He is concerned not only for the future marriages of his two daughters Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary (Mary Boleyn, but also what his family can gain from such unions. It is no secret that he favors Mary above Anne so when he offers the latter to a suitor of otherwise middle class statue such as his own family, it is of little concern to him or anyone else in the family. Anne herself seems pleased with the choice and has little desire for a more wealthier and prestigious husband. Mary, even though it would be expected that she be married first, herself is excited over her younger sister's marriage and only promises support.<br/><br/>Thomas Howard (David Morrissey), otherwise known as the Duke of Norfolk, is the uncle to Mary and Anne. A political creature if one ever existed, he learns that the queen has suffered a recent miscarriage. He knows that Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent) will not be able to please King Henry VIII (Eric Bana) much longer so he devises a way for the still unmarried Mary to catch the eye of the king. Not for Mary or Henry's own personal sake but so that his family may gain by having a union with the crown itself. Especially so if the Mary is able to give Henry the son he has always wanted.<br/><br/>What happens next is a series of ironies and misfortunes that send the Boleyn family, especially Mary, Anne, and their brother George (Jim Sturgess) down a path of jealously, rage, sorrow, and destruction. Henry, a cruel and petty man who discards women much as he discards old clothing, is impossible to please and once both Mary and Anne fall into his sight then their fates have been sealed. In this way the fear of their mother, Lady Elizabeth Boleyn (Kristin Scott Thomas) are realized when she sees that her daughters are to be traded as if mere goods to be exchanged at a whim.<br/><br/>The Other Boleyn Girl circles, as one expects, around the relationship between Mary and Anne during their relationship with the king. Anne, who ironically was seduced by the king after her marriage while Mary was ignored, is able to give Henry the son he needs. However, by that time, Mary has already caught his eye and thus Anne finds herself no longer in favor. However, Mary goes further then perhaps even her uncle imagined by having herself crowned Queen of England (and upsetting not just the entire kingdom but the Catholic Church which Henry VIII would later break away from). While Anne is portrayed as an innocent girl who is heartbroken at her fate, Mary is just as calculating as her uncle and perhaps just as blind because of her greed. In this we have a good sister, bad sister conflict where a once close relationship has been broken because of lust and politics. Only in the death of Mary at the hands of an executioner do the two sisters finally reunite as they were before their lives were corrupted by the desires of their father, uncle, and the king himself.<br/><br/>If there is a complaint to be made it is the otherwise wooden acting that occurs mainly from Portmand and Bana which can only be blame on the script itself. As with all historical movies, one might question the historical accuracy that is portrayed when drama is needed to make things more ""interesting"". Regardless of these few problems, The Other Boleyn Girl is a case study in power politics and the price that must be paid when ambition outruns caution. However, love and honor can transcend these faults if only the will to do so is there.<br/><br/>8/10"

It boils down to a schoolyard level jealousy story between those Boleyn sisters which simply drags along. Characters are stereotypes with a single characteristic standing out and otherwise flat and poorly developed. In other words, boring in every respect.<br/><br/>Second, this film is heavily miscast.

Natalie Portman as Anne is great, as is David Morrisey as her uncle, and Kristin Scott-Thomas as her mother. However, Scarlett Johansen is far too weak, as is Eric Bana as Henry; I kept thinking of Robert Shaw in ""A Man for All Seasons"". Winona Ryder probably would have made a better Mary. George Boleyn ended up too much like Del-boy's brother Rodney. However, I did enjoy it, although the TV version was as good. In addition, it paled in comparison with Elizabeth, Elizabeth: The GoldenAge, and Elizabeth I. One other thing; Scarlett's performance does not bode well for Mary, Queen of Scots. She's pretty enough, but does not have the stature that both this Mary and MQoS requires."
"velene","8","1","2","4 May 2008"," Horrible history
","Asides from historical inaccuracies, and certain excruciatingly awkwardly written scenes (e.g. the King and Mary's bedroom scene), I thought this movie was quite well done.<br/><br/>I do not agree with naysayers that claim Anne Boleyn was made out to be manipulative and cruel in this movie. She did have instances where she came across as cold-hearted, but the filmmakers did the best job in terms of character development for Anne, because at the end of the movie, in the face of possibly devastating circumstances, her cold facade slips off and we see her genuinely as a Boleyn girl. For me, the final scenes showed her fragility and I began to understand why she put up the front. Perhaps it all boils down to the almost always underrated role of women in court life.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman did a brilliant job and her acting most definitely made me forget the historical inaccuracies. Scarlett Johansson was overshadowed by Portman to some extent, but given that she had extremely limited space to work with as a mostly one-dimensional character, I thought she did provide depth. I think the best thing of the movie is the chemistry because the chemistry of the Boleyn family, and especially between Portman and Johansson, really brought the movie up to a whole new level."
"denis888","8","1","2","2 May 2008"," A Spellbinding Winner
","The story of the hapless wives of King Henry the Eighth is not any new. How many films and books do we have by now? Anyway, the new movie is a pretty fresh look at this never getting old story. The film boasts three huge stars  Eric Bana as Henry himself, Scarlet Johansen as Mar Boleyn, and Natalie Portman as unhappy Anna Boleyn. The film offers us a newer look at this story, and the whole 1 hour 45 minutes holds us tight. The plot is very curious and the actors play extremely well. A big cheer must go to Portman for her deep, serious, endearing and earnest performance. Her tragic heroine is very real, very convincing and very deep. Bana is a bit too slow and bleak as Henry, he really lacks some energy at times, and likewise Johansen is all the same frightened scary pretty face with half opened mouth. We saw it many times, did not we? The movie is not bereft of some bias. It seems that the filmmakers did everything to shift the initiative on all things from Henry to Anna. It is her who starts the whole machine rolling; it is her and not him instigating the schism with Pope, divorce and all. Bana seems so weak and passive here, that you start wondering if he is a king after all. Anna sometimes seems so evil and cruel in her plots that her tragic death sometimes looks like something she really deserved. But still, as a whole, this movie is a very good effort that is spellbinding in its portraying of the severe times. Recommended for a fresher look at old, trite story."

I thought Scarlett and Natalie were wonderful in their roles, particularly Natalie in her descent from the Kings favour, her increasing panic and insecurity was chilling. The scene between Anne and her brother was heartbreaking, that he would risk everything to try and help her and her utter desperation to please the king. George just looked so terrified, it made me so angry that he ended up being executed, so completely unfair! I have also read rubbish about the dialogue being farcical but if you actually took a moment to understand the characters you'd see that of course Anne exclaiming she'd use ""her thighs"" to stay on the horse was meant to be comedic! Her blatant flirtatious comments were meant to be in good humour, so to those people i say chill out and stop taking things so seriously!

","Philippa Gregory's novel comes to the screen for the second time, the first time being a small screen BBC production in 2003, using a 'confessional diary' style, and now on the big screen with a larger budget and huge name stars.<br/><br/>Eric Bana (Troy, The Hulk) makes a rather bland Henry VIII, not big on personality or character. Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johanssen play the Boleyn sisters, the showy and scheming Anne, polished from the French court, and Mary, quieter and content to live a plain life away from court. As the older members of the Boleyn/Howard family, Mark Rylance, Kirsten Scott-Thomas, and David Morrissey make an impression, plotting to sell their family members as you would cattle for the amusement of men and the enhancement of family fortune.<br/><br/>I preferred the original version in many ways, and some of the source novel was tweaked and changed to make more of a big budget statement, but this is not a bad film, it looks good and has obviously had money spent on it, it has good performances and, although historically shaky, tells an involving tale."

"Quinoa1984","6","2","9","29 February 2008"," could've been a good deal better, but as it stands it's not too disrespectful (not of history, I mean as a movie)
","The Other Boleyn Girl's approach to its story of corrupted love and lust and, in the end, the cold search for a male heir to Henry the VIII, might have worked a lot better had the director gone for one of two approaches: either an extremely restrained, Barry Lyndon-esq style with the performances and a tight control of shots and editing, OR a trashy guilty-pleasure kind of style, with an R rating and a look at the historical documents that throws it on its head completely. As it stands it's just... conventional, emotional kind of stuff. It's about as shallow in its own way as an episode of Beverly Hills 90210, and yet has enough really good acting (or at least appearing to be so) to justify its existence in movie theaters as opposed to straight-to-PBS weeknight. If you've seen the trailer, you'll know if this PG-13 material is for you.<br/><br/>Now, taking just from history perspective, one should understand that it's not for purists: there's very little actual politics here, except ""No, Henry can't split from the Catholic church (next scene) Henry splits from Catholic church"". It's a relationship drama when it comes down to it, between the two Boleyn sisters, Ann (the more famous one, for obvious reasons, played by Natalie Portman) and Mary (the shy and sweet one, and thus the one to produce a male not-so-heir played by Scarlett Johansson), and how they become ""involved"" with the infamous Tudor. Involved, by means of a pushy uncle and father who through power and influence get Mary to become his mistress and use her for a child which, ironically, can't be used as an heir to the throne. Meanwhile, Ann tempts Henry in the most dastardly way she knows how- reject him, and force him to break certain rules (i.e. divorce) to truly get what he wants. Bad move, it turns out of course.<br/><br/>All of this plays out with sweeping, romantic/period music, great costumes and very good sets, and even the acting from Portman is way above average for this type of pap. She's truly on her way to being one of the best actresses of her time. Johansson, on the other hand, isn't given as much of a character to work with, so her performance doesn't go quite as deep (albeit when asked to do so she is good, weird non-eyebrows and all). Bana, on a whole other hand, has the crap end of the stick: he's so good an actor in other pieces- most notably Munich and, as I've heard but not seen, Chopper- that it's a shame to see him with such a one-dimensional cliché. It almost becomes like a dull running gag where it's more like the Henry Tudor corporation, where we continue to procreate the finest male seed to the next male heir.<br/><br/>If it was more dangerous and seductive ala Dangerous Liasons, it's dramatic ambitions might get more and more interesting. As it stands, it's a good piece for the crowd its meant for: highbrow chick-flick fans, and those who want just a spike of difference between their Masterpiece theater and actual Hollywood product. If you want a great film, look elsewhere, probably much elsewhere."
"TheLittleSongbird","7","1","3","15 May 2009"," A historical character study that is beautifully-designed...
","I saw this last year when I was 16, at the cinema with my mum and my sister, and I must say we were impressed. I will confess that I haven't read the book by Phillippa Gregory, but from my perspective of the film, this is a beautifully made historical character study of some of the most famous historical figures in history. The film does look exquisite, with lavish costumes and splendid locations. The acting from Natalie Portman and Scarlet Johanssen are the redeeming merits of an above-average but rather unsubtle movie. These two actresses are brilliant at showing emotional depth. I also liked the actress of Catherine of Aragon, though I didn't expect Catherine to be conveyed in the way she was. However, I was not so impressed with Eric Bana as Henry. He fits the part physically, but emotionally he comes across to me as rather flat and lifeless. There are many historical inaccuracies, probably an attempt to be faithful to the source material, and because of this, sometimes the dialogue is very wordy and could have been simplified, and the rape scene seemed as though it came from another movie. I also thought the film rather overlong and a bit slow, and I will confess that I was out of my seat in the execution scenes with genuine fright inside of me, believe me a man screaming for mercy is one of the last things you want to see portrayed on film.(I really found that scene in particular very upsetting to watch)In conclusion, a beautifully made and in general well acted period drama, but suffers from uneven dialogue and pacing. 7/10 Bethany Cox."

","I looked at the cast and thought that this movie would be fantastic. I was wrong. Everyone is wooden and fake.

There were no clever or good lines or scenes, the whole movie felt like a bad soap opera.<br/><br/>As for the accuracy, the names were right... And that's just about all. First, Mary is the older daughter and Anne is the younger. Second, Mary was no virgin when Henry got her; she'd been with the French king and most of his courtiers when he'd finished with her. Third, getting sent to France was no exile; both daughters had been living in France since Mary Tuder went to marry Louis, the old French king when Anne was around ten. Fourth, Thomas Boleyn is too nice, the man was greedy and grasping beyond belief, whoring out both his daughters. Fifth, the French Queen was not heretical, she was staunchly catholic, it was the Duchess of Alencone (sp?) the sister of the king who was heretical. And where were Sir Thomas More and Cardinal Woolesy? These were major players and they just never showed up!

"ridiculonius","9","1","4","23 June 2008"," Critics Know Nothing!
","Reading reviews for this movie, I saw that most of the critics found it an awful piece of junk. Like they do EVERY movie! I've learned not to take reviews to heart, for they are almost always bad. There is no in between for these people, only awful movies, or perfect movies. ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" was NOT, in any way, a perfect movie, but it was brilliant nonetheless.<br/><br/>The story of Anne Boleyn's seduction of King Henry VIII and his famous seceding from the Catholic Church so he could marry her, ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" also focuses on a previously unimportant factor in this famed tale - Anne's sister Mary, who was also a mistress of the King. In this movie, you get to see how mercilessly Anne is dangled under the King's nose for a potential mistress. When Anne accidentally leads King Henry into a nearly fatal fall from his horse, she is cast aside as the pawn and her sister Mary takes up the position. Anne seems placid enough about this, until the Boleyn's are summoned to court so that the king can get to know Mary better. Anne secretly elopes with one Henry Percy, and Mary tells her father before it leaks out so that her sister's prospects for marriage aren't ruined by it. <br/><br/>Anne, however, doesn't believe that Mary had her best interests at heart, and blames her for her exile to France to wait on the French Queen until her manners have improved. Upon Anne's return, Mary is pregnant with the King's child, and can no longer please him. Anne takes this as an opportunity for revenge, and begins to further seduce their sovereign, whom Mary has come to love.<br/><br/>Of course, everyone knows what happens to Anne - she marries the king and is beheaded - for the fame of her story precedes this movie by hundreds of years, but that doesn't at all reduce the pure drama and excitement of the cat-and-mouse theme of seduction Anne chooses for her conquest. <br/><br/>I thought that the performances reflected the best of Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman's careers (especially Natalie's at the end - wow!), and that the movie itself was a brilliant retelling of both the novel and the timeless story. The costumes weren't bad either - in these movies, the costumes can either make or break the performances, and in this case, they made them. I also must say that ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" brought up an important point - I'd previously despised the person who was King Henry VIII, for his hypocrisy and cruelty towards his wives, but this film opened my eyes to the fact that all of the people at that time were victims, although they were not innocent. Anne and Mary's lives were completely thrown into chaos because of the ambition of their kinsfolk - Henry himself was a victim of all the rich families who were trying to take advantage of him. You can't feel sorry for a lot of them, but you can sympathize with some of them. <br/><br/>Critics know nothing! This movie was amazing!"
"anissina21","10","1","4","25 April 2008"," Disappointing interpretation of the story, beautiful to look at
","There is a lot to like about this film, but also a lot to dislike.<br/><br/>It is simply fact that a book cannot be translated to the big screen without significant changes. (Read The Lord of the Rings and you will realise there was no way Peter Jackson could put in all of Tolkien's endless pages of singing!!) The problem with The Other Boleyn Girl is that the translation is done so terribly that there is no clear focus on what the story is actually about.<br/><br/>The heart of the story (or it should be, as it is in the novel) is about Mary Boleyn  the 'other Boleyn girl'  and how she defied everything to find a life of her own. Put into the king's bed, she eventually turned her back on her family's ambition, married for love and spent the rest of her days in the country.<br/><br/>But for some reason, perhaps to sell the film to a wider Hollywood audience, the decision was made to turn the film into 'The Anne Boleyn Story  truncated'.<br/><br/>Anne has been done and done again. The remarkable feature of the book was that this was Mary's story  an unknown and yet extraordinary woman. But in the effort to cram in all the details of Anne's life, there are gaping holes and painful errors left in Mary's. Her first husband, for example, simply disappears from the film. She remarries without any explanation to where the first man is. Also, there is no explanation as to when Mary had the second child we see running around at the end, even though the child's age would place her birth right in the middle of the film. But most painful is that what should be the most moving part of the story  Mary's secret marriage to a man she truly loves  a man well 'below' her in social standing  is barely mentioned. Not only that, but the film makes it look as though she flees to him only to save herself from the executioner. It's hardly the heroic and romantic story it should have been.<br/><br/>The 'Hollywoodisation' of the story is, to a certain extent, necessary, but is done to the point of melodrama. For example, King Henry's decision to desert Mary literally the moment she gives birth to his son. Also, Mary and Anne finding out Anne is to be executed only when she is actually standing on the scaffolding. The fact their mother is turned into 'the concerned, moral woman' is also a bit difficult to swallow.<br/><br/>But there is good in this film  especially for those with not a clue about Tudor England. The acting is excellent. Scarlett Johannson is just as Mary should be. Though Natalie Portman is physically wrong for the role, she plays it well. The other roles are  largely  well done, most notably the portrayal of Katherine of Aragon.<br/><br/>The film looks wonderful, with the costumes a dream to look at.<br/><br/>If you let yourself be carried away by the drama you will enjoy this film, though be left with a lot of questions as to what it was actually about."

","THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL suffers from overexposure to the passion for all things Tudor that has produced multiple novels, television series, and films that range from great to mediocre. Having not read Philippa Gregory's best selling novel, this viewer entered the theater without preconceived notions of the path the story would take/stray in the wake of heightened interest in historical data. From the opening scenes to the end the impression is one of having viewed some very beautiful scenery, sumptuous costumes, grand lighting - and very little involvement in caring for the plight of the characters. The soggy music score underlines the unrelenting dark atmosphere of the story and the production, and despite a cast of actors known for credibility in historic roles, there is little compassion stirred.<br/><br/>King Henry VIII (Eric Bana, in relatively little screen time) tires of Katherine of Aragon (Ana Torent) and her inability to bear a male heir. The Boleyn clan (Mark Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas in collusion with the Duke of Norfolk David Morrissey) seize on Henry's frustration and serve up their daughters Anne (Natalie Portman) and Mary (Scarlett Johansson) to satisfy his dalliances. The younger Mary beds him first, produces a daughter (Elizabeth), then falls our of favor leaving Anne to works her newly honed skills of feminism learned in her exile to France on the easily seduced King. The results are tension in the castle, in the Boleyn family, and between the sisters Anne and Mary. History is molded by the writer to maintain more of a Hollywood soap opera that a recreation of fact and it all ends with beheadings and the child Elizabeth running gaily through sunny old meadows of England.<br/><br/>The actors all try to make us buy into this version of betrayal and lust and loathing, but the dialog (written by Peter Morgan) is tired and used and anything but in keeping with the period. But then, the movie is a collection of scenes that are very pretty to watch... Justin Chadwick directs. Grady Harp"

Portman as Anne is driven by greed and power going to great length to ensure her place but met with extreme and fatal consequences. Johansson is more focused despite being played by higher powers. Despite the fact that her children were pleasing, her final decision makes her the strongest character in the film. Jim Sturges plays their brother caught in a dire predicament that bares consequence and perhaps the audiences greatest sympathy. Eric Bana plays Henry VIII driven by lust and greed with two beautiful sisters at his disposal.

I know it's usually the case for a movie to fall short of expectations when the book was so successful, but successful novel-based films aren't impossible to find: Lord of the Rings, The Shawshank Redemption, Sense and Sensibility, The Shining, Schindler's List, Jaws, Jurassic Park, even Bridget Jones's Diary!<br/><br/>It's perfectly forgivable to forgo a few plot points to save on time, but when you forgo key elements of the story which made it a page-turner in the first place, you sacrifice crucial character development and you're audience is in for a world of disappointment. Because, to be honest, who cares about a movie full of plot when you don't give a toss about the people experiencing it? Now I'm not saying that The Other Boleyn Girl was a tragic, horrible, hot mess, but I truly am sorry that it missed so many opportunities to be great, especially when it already had a successful and juicy blue-print to work off of.<br/><br/>Missed opportunity 1: We lost the chance to see one of the most wonderfully colorful villainesses to come along in years. Yes, Natalie Portman's Anne Boleyn was a brat with ambition and most of the time you wanted to smack her, but the film version turned the dial way down and left out wonderfully horrific details and for what? She got her head chopped off for a reason.<br/><br/>Missed opportunity 2: Where's the romance? A book that's full of ""love, sex, ambition, and intrigue"" was not in the movie that I saw. The whole third act of the book revolves around a romance of Mary's that ends up saving her life and it's given a good thirty seconds on screen.<br/><br/>Missed opportunity 3: The novel is told vividly from Mary's point of view and for good reason. The title should have been a hint.<br/><br/>Verdict: Read the book. Forget the movie."

","The story of Henry VIII's marriage to Anne Boleyn is well known throughout British history, but the story of Anne's sister, Mary is not. I will not give away anything from the movie because there really is not anything to tell. The story is fascinating as Mary tells what happens in the events surrounding Henry and Anne, but there is nothing too shocking that history hasn't told us about them. The acting is average with Natalie Portman (Best Actress winner at the 2011 Oscars for 'Black Swan') as Anne, Scarlett Johannsen as Mary and Eric Bana as King Henry VIII. Scarlett has her moments during this drama and so does Portman, but Bana's talent is lacking as the king who executed two of his wives (Katharine Howard was the second to lose her head). The best part is Johannsen as Mary and that is all."

","The title of this movie is ""The Other Boleyn Girl "" directed by Justin Chadwick and was film in 2008. The main cast members include Natalie Portman as Anne Boleyn, Scarlett Johansson as Mary Boleyn, and Eric Bana as Henry Tudor (King Henry VIII). This movie is a biography,drama, and history based on a true story about Anne Boleyn. this movie has been rated PG-13. To visual this movie in a review is that this movie is all about sisters fighting for something they both love and trying to fix their relationship after-wards.<br/><br/>The interesting detail about this movie is that where Anne comes back from France and becomes a whole new person, thinking about greed and power for herself all the time, made King Henry VIII divorced with the queen."
"KineticSeoul","5","0","1","19 February 2011"," A tale of two sisters, not as compelling as the trailer makes it seem
","I saw this movie on a plane to pass the time or else I would have probably passed on it. Nothing about this movie really stood out to me, in fact the trailer makes this movie seem better than it really is. It would have been somewhat entertaining if there was a cat fight in this metaphorically speaking. Like the two sister constantly clash with each other by trying to set a trap for one another or try to figure out ways to hurt each other in order to win King Henry VIII affection. But the story isn't like that, Natalie basically plays the bad sister and Scarlett plays the good sister. Natalie basically plays the sister that deceives in order to get what she wants and Scarlett's character basically gets forced to be with the King by her family's wish and Natalie's character wants to steal what she has. Natalie Portman is the actress that really drives that movie, she played her role really well. However I didn't find this movie all that gripping like some people claim or compelling like the trailer makes it out to be. Plus for a movie that has a lot of seduction and sex in it, there is no nudity. Now I don't judge a movie for it's nudity in most cases. But for a movie like this it would have been better if it had some and added more to the movie and made it engaging. Besides the performances and the production of this movie, I just found the story and direction to be bland.<br/><br/>5.5/10"

","I'm sorry, but Henry VIII will always be Richard Burton in my mind. Eric Bana just doesn't cut it. He's good in other movies...ie:Troy, but he just doesn't have the volcanic effect that Burton brought to the screen in Anne of The Thousand Days. Not that either of these women are going to make me forget Genevieve Bujold, either. They do a passable job and Natalie Portman finally kicks it into gear just before they chop her head off. The only place where this movie has the edge is that it gives an overview of the lives and intrigues of the Tudor court but you better be up on your English history to keep up with all the wives. No timelines are given and many prolonged dramas are Reader's Digest condensed into a few minutes so that anyone not familiar with the actual events might wonder how we got from A to B. The costumes and the castles are exceptionally well done and make this worth viewing."

","I have not read the novel, but I am now considering it. Also, if you are unsure, this is *not* entirely historically accurate; I personally have no problem with that being so. When taking in a work of *fiction*, you are not meant to consider it to be completely authentic. I would think that anybody realizes that, and no one who expresses themselves in any medium have a responsibility to those who do not understand that. This is very compelling, with an interesting and smart(but easy enough to follow) plot. The production values leave nothing to be desired, with lush and beautiful costumes and sets. This is graced with excellent acting by all of the principals. For one of the first times, I was impressed with Eric Bana's performance in something. The characters are credible and well-written, and the women are strong, determined and even, at times, outspoken, without this coming off as entirely unrealistic for when it takes place. This has gorgeous cinematography and spot-on editing, as well. I love how this uses the Old English, and yet you can follow it with no problems. There is a bit of sexuality, a little disturbing content/violence and infrequent mild to moderate language in this. I recommend this to any fans of dramas and/or period pieces. 7/10"
"kyspatz","7","0","1","8 December 2009"," Entertaining despite the historical inaccuracy
","Many criticize this film for its lack of historical accuracy but to judge this film on that fact alone is to do in an injustice. The Other Boleyn Girl is first and foremost based on a novel by Philippa Gregory and that novel is specifically stated as historical fiction.<br/><br/>I thought this was an aesthetically pleasing film and was well acted throughout. The dynamic between Natalie Portman and Scarlet Johansson is captivating throughout. Many films focus only on the life of Anne and leave Mary in the shadows. Well this film did no such thing. The interesting approach to the sibling rivalry gave the film a much more intense vibe. The sibling rivalry being the main focus of the film prevented it from becoming an overdone telling of the life of Henry VIII. Eric Bana does a passable job as Henry. Bana may be aesthetically pleasing which the real Henry lacked but that does not make up for the lack of character development withing the character. The lack of character development is in no way due to a lack of acting. Better writing would have helped the character. But this film focuses on the Boleyn girls not the king.<br/><br/>The costumes, set, and props all were true to that of Tudor England and therefore added to the draw of this film. Although it may lack historical accuracy in the true sense the costumes and set do not.<br/><br/>The main draw to this film is its ability to please the mass audience. If you are looking for a film filled with historical fact and period language this is not the film for you. This film is intended to introduce the common audience to parts of world history they may not be aware of while still entertaining them at the same time.<br/><br/>Overall this was a pleasing film and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a pleasant night of entertainment. Will I recommend this film to fellow historians as an accurate film I think not, but I wouldn't condemn it to the back shelves of rental stores throughout the country either."

","Perhaps it is my lack of historical knowledge on the subject of Anne and her sister that allows me to enjoy this movie so much, or perhaps it is simply that I understand more things that the simple passing of time cannot always be shown in a movie.<br/><br/>Yes, the dresses are of the same make as a general rule, however it was just a so in the old days. Whatever was 'in' was worn to death and beyond - straight into hells gates. No, the actors and actresses did not look EXACTLY like who they were playing, but you can't clone people and so yes, they are going to look different - that is one of the best parts of being human, the diversity in how we look. I have seen comments that Anne is portrayed as one-sided or as a smiling idiot. Um, no. She shows distress, fear, ambition, love - she asks her sister to look after her daughter! - and independence. And, guess what, she was flirting with the king so yes she was smiling a lot. Cry, people, cry and weep into your graves and may they be shallow ones at that. The King was portrayed as a womanizer and from how many wives he went through, I wouldn't say it tarnishes his reputation. But he does show love and compassion, but he is a King and cannot show too much favoritism or it could lead to an uprising. Mary, yes quiet and docile - mildly whorish - but she can be strong and demanding. Being quiet, it probably took a lot for the real Mary to get riled as well.<br/><br/>The Rape scene wasn't in the book? So what? Every artist, every director, actress or actor brings something new to everything they do - or they simply won't be remembered. It showed the difference between what the King felt for Mary and Anne. For Anne it was merely lust, he didn't really care about her, but with Mary it was sweet and loving. He loved Mary, but was seduced by Anne.<br/><br/>I love this movie and bugger to the rest of you who can't just sit quietly and enjoy a damn movie for whatever it is worth."

There is a lot more to like in this film. I had problems with Elizabeth: The Golden age that I can't name because I am not sure of what they are. The Other Boleyn girl is better because there aren't as many flaws and not as boring. Also, I find scandals a little more interesting than, well, whatever that movie was. There are some intriguing moments in this film, like Natile Portman's baby dies. So to replace it, she has to have sex with her brother. That settles it, it's better. That sounds a ton more interesting than the other film.

","I am having difficulties rating a movie of this genre. The acting was very good, the story complex (even if inspired from history), the portrayal of the time's way of things was both well rendered and disgusting. The subject was not so interesting to me, so I am trying to ignore my slight boredom to try to maintain some sort of objectivity.<br/><br/>About the movie, imagine women (and young men) planned, traded, manipulated and used as a mere commodity, nothing more than cattle, for the reasons of gaining favor upon their families. Marriages were ignored or broken at the whim of kings or higher noblemen, daughters were forced to accept whoredom and everybody had a plan.<br/><br/>In the middle of things, the Boleyn sisters, played by Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson. Handled between their greedy family and a petulant and immature king, they become part of history without, I would wager, having much to do with any of the things that happened to them. People have deplored the lack of historical accuracy of the script, but I wouldn't know about that. In the film Anne is shown as manipulating the king by refusing to bed him and the king, maddened with passion, does everything she asks. I wonder if that could ever have been possible.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if you are a history buff, you should watch it. Women might also get a kick out of marriages and babies and miscarriages and drama. It is a well done movie and, subject aside, a very decent film."

"hall895","7","0","1","4 March 2009"," The sad saga of the Boleyns
","If you are a student of history you know that this is not a movie in which everyone is destined to live happily ever after. If you are not a student of history you've probably wandered into the wrong movie. 16th century English royal dramas are not everyone's cup of tea. I suppose one could try to ignore the historical aspects and just look at this as a romance film. But there really is nothing particularly romantic going on here. The characters in this film are motivated by many things but love certainly does not seem to be one of them. It's a rather tawdry spectacle and very few of the characters do much to earn your sympathy. But there is no denying that it is an enjoyable, compelling film.<br/><br/>Henry VIII has been a popular film subject but while he is an important figure here this is not a film about the king. Rather it is the story of two sisters who would end up vying for his affection. The story of Anne Boleyn is well known. But there was another Boleyn girl. Anne's sister Mary may not be nearly as famous in the annals of history but she has her own story to tell. And in this film that story is told and some of it is even true. Yes, this is a film littered with historical inaccuracies. It's not a documentary, it's entertainment and the film takes liberties with the truth to try to make things more interesting. But the gist of the actual historical story is there. And it is quite a story.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman plays Anne and her performance is probably the best thing about the film. It's a fascinating character arc to say the least and Portman hits all the right notes. Sweet and charming at times, conniving and ruthless at others. It's a powerful portrayal. Scarlett Johansson has a less showy role as Mary, not getting very many of the big dramatic moments presented to Portman. But her performance is certainly fine and she creates one of the very few sympathetic characters in the film. Mary does things of which she may not be proud but she really had very little choice. While Anne's lust for power is evident you get the sense Mary would have been perfectly happy living out a quiet, nondescript life out in the country. In the end Mary is one of the few who comes out of things able to hold her head relatively high. Since we're dealing with Henry VIII here the fact she holds on to her head at all is probably an achievement.<br/><br/>This is a film in which the story grabs you and it will certainly hold your interest throughout. For a period drama it is important to get the costumes and sets right to give things the proper feel and this film certainly does so. It looks spectacular. The film does have its problems though. There are some characters, most notably the sisters' father and especially their uncle, who are absolutely irredeemable louses and their presence at times makes it very hard to embrace the film. The things these two force upon the girls all for the supposed good of the family are deplorable. In their blind quest for power they don't seem to mind the fact that they may well ruin the girls' lives. Whereas Portman and Johansson do fine work one gets the sense that Eric Bana's portrayal of Henry VIII is somewhat lacking. Henry does not come across as powerfully as one might expect. The ruthless streak is there but it seems there's a certain something missing. And while the story is engaging you feel that in the end things are rather rushed. The second half of the film moves at breakneck speed with important historical events flying by as the film hurries to its conclusion. After spending so much time setting up the connection between Henry and the sisters in the first half of the film more time certainly could have been spent to allow things to be properly paid off. All of a sudden the film's over and you're left wanting to see and know more. All in all it's an enjoyable film. Not perfect by any means but entertaining enough and a worthwhile, if not always entirely accurate, look back at a fascinating time in history."

","Despite the strong performances, this is just too depressing to be really enjoyable. Anne and Mary Boleyn (Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson) are sisters competing for the affections of the King (Eric Bana as Henry Tudor). The King is seeking a male heir to his throne, and when the Queen is unable to provide one, he decides to take a mistress. He is attracted to Anne, but then he meets Mary and falls for her. Mary would prefer a simple life in the country with her husband, but her father (Mark Rylance as Sir Thomas Boleyn) and uncle (David Morrissey as Thomas Howard - Duke of Norfolk) pressure her into becoming the King's whore. But the King becomes bored with the simple girl, and he falls under the spell of the scheming Anne. She persuades him to break with the Catholic church and have his marriage annulled, so that she can marry him. Of course her tricks all back-fire when the King realizes how he's being manipulated. Unfortunately, all these twists and turns in the plot are not very entertaining. The acting is consistently fine, especially by Portman, and the film is visually outstanding. The story just becomes too unpleasant as it unfolds, and the phony happy ending doesn't fool anyone."

","The story of the six wives of Henry the Eigth is a staple of British history. Director Justin Chaswick , who cut his teeth on period drama with a TV production of ""Bleak House"", makes an excellent job of converting Phillipa Gregory's novel, in which she picks out the Boleyn girls contribution, onto the Big screen. Much of the credit for this goes to Peter Morgan whose fine screenplay confirms his status of one of the best writers of screen dialogue around at the moment.Whilst historically inaccurate in some key respects, the context is enough to provide a convincing and rewarding ""faction"".<br/><br/>Two hours of intrigue, treachery, plotting and heartbreak focus on the efforts of the Boleyn family to do a spot of social climbing courtesy of their daughters Anne and Mary. Natalie Portman as the former, leaves Scarlett Johansson as the latter somewhat in her wake in a towering performance of froideur and ambition. Eric Bana as King Henry is absolutely convincing is his arrogant amorality, yet still allows the side of him which can be manipulated by women to shine through.<br/><br/>Lavish, whilst falling short of being a full blown costume drama, the story depends upon plot , rather than action, and succeeds triumphantly. The below par CGI recreations of Medieval Cityscapes are more than compensated for by a rip roaring pace to a cleverly paced tale. My only criticism is that the cerebral battle between Henry and his wife Catherine, and the visceral passion of his relationships with Anne and Mary are somewhat under drawn, presumably to give it as wide an audience as possible with a 12A rating.<br/><br/>However the ingredients of a King, mistresses, a scheming Court and razor sharp dialogue deliver an impressive result, which I can recommend to all."

","Though no ""A Man for all Seasons"" by any stretch of the imagination, Justin Chadwick's ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is a handsomely mounted, reasonably entertaining soap opera set in the politically-charged court of King Henry VIII.<br/><br/>Based on the highly fictionalized and speculative novel by Phillipa Gregory, the movie chronicles the 16th Century catfight between the two Boleyn sisters - the more famous one, Anne, whose marriage to the divorced king resulted in England's final rupture with the Church of Rome (and the eventual loss of her own head when she, like his first wife Catherine, could not provide him with a male heir), and the lesser known, already married Mary who, at least as portrayed in this film, was every bit as attractive to the king as the sister who would eventually win his hand.<br/><br/>The Peter Morgan screenplay reduces the complex historical events to the level of a Harlequin Romance, pitting the two sisters against one another in a competition for the king's affections. All of this is of considerably less interest than the almost ruthless, behind-the-scenes machinations undertaken by the girls' family to groom them as concubines for the crass purpose of currying royal favor. In fact, it is when the movie touches on the mores of the time and of life at court that it is at its most compelling.<br/><br/>Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson and Eric Bana all seem to be having great fun playing at dress-up, but the richest performances are delivered by Mark Rylance and David Morrissey as the girls' calculating father and uncle respectively, and Kristin Scott Thomas as their levelheaded, pragmatic mother, helpless to prevent the tragedy that was doomed to engulf her family.<br/><br/>The costumes and settings are nothing short of sensational, and they alone maintain our interest even when the scriptwriting fails to live up to the level of its subject."

Her undeserved humiliation is portrayed with stunning sensitivity, and that she so nobly and elegantly chastised both her husband and his whores, demonstrates her superiority among Henry's subsequent wives and indeed a greatness among women in history not unlike her mother, Queen Isabella. Anne Boelyn is depicted as the adulterous whore that she was at the time and remains forever etched in the annals of history. She was instrumental in tearing England apart and her daughter carried on that despicable legacy with inherent ease. Even toward the end of the movie I found little sympathy for the Boelyn family, and even less for Henry VIII, Anne's kingly dupe.

","I like historical fiction in general. I like films that deal with historical events. So I really made time out of this very busy week to see this film. The star power of course helped a lot to convince me to catch this. Imagine a movie that combines Natalie Portman AND Scarlett Johannsen. It is certainly a must-see for that combination alone.<br/><br/>These two stars played the Boleyn sisters at the time of Henry VIII. Natalie is the more familiar Boleyn girl Anne, while Scarlett plays the unknown sister Mary. While their ambitious family is trying to push Anne to interest the King (played by the lucky Eric Bana), he actually falls for younger and married Mary first. Because of this, the family is brought to live in the King's court. Mary gets pregnant and gives birth to a son. But by then, the King has turned his eyes to Anne.<br/><br/>The rest of the story, we are more familiar with already -- how Anne teases the King with her wiles so much that he breaks with the Catholic Church in order to divorce his wife Catherine of Aragon. However, when the King finally gains Anne's body (in an unexpectedly violent manner in this film), he is at the same time racked with severe guilt feelings about what he had done.<br/><br/>This situation was not helped when Anne first born was a daughter. When Anne suffered a miscarriage next, she was already on the brink of madness on how to hang on to her position in court, especially since the king has already begun to show interest in Jane Seymour.<br/><br/>We all know what happens to Anne in the end, so there is really no suspense there. But the family dynamics in the Boleyn family is really very interesting, albeit disturbing, to watch. The side stories and fates of Mary and brother George, as with those of their parents (particularly the mother so well-played by Kristin Scott Thomas) are so well integrated in the known history. I am not really sure where fiction separates from facts in these auxiliary stories.<br/><br/>It was melodramatic, that is for sure. There were so many key omissions, such as the role of Thomas More, who was not even mentioned. Nevertheless, I was entertained. Got me interested to reading the book by Philippa Gregory soon. Good enough just to see Natalie and Scarlett together, most definitely."

","Java Man Reviews ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" (Rated PG-13. Directed by Justin Chadwick. Written by Peter Morgan. Starring Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson, Eric Bana, David Morrissey, Kristen Scott Thomas, Mark Rylance, Jim Sturgess & Ana Torrent. Running Time: 115 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW: <br/><br/>England's Henry VIII (Bana) and his Queen, Katherine of Aragon (Torrent) have been unable to produce a male heir to secure the Tudor royal line. While the Henry decides on a course of action, he finds himself in need of a mistress. The Duke of Norfolk (Morrissey) and Sir Thomas Boleyn (Rylance) realize that their family fortunes can be greatly enhanced if Boleyn makes one of his fetching daughters available for the king's consideration. Strong-willed Anne (Portman, pictured left) is chosen, but soon falls out of favor and is banished to France. Naive Mary (Johansson, right) then catches the king's eye and becomes his lover, even though she is already married to a merchant's son (who approves the match when offered a cushy job at court). By the time Henry loses interest in Mary, Anne is back from France having studied the womanly wiles of the femme fatale. She captures the king's fancy and plays him like a lute. She will gladly submit once his majesty meets a few minor requirements... break with the Church of Rome, annul his marriage to Katharine, and take her as his queen. The rest is history -- and you know some heads are gonna roll.<br/><br/>REVIEW: 2.5 Java Mugs out of 4 <br/><br/>This is the story of how the course of human history was changed when the most powerful man in the world risked his kingdom and his soul for the love of a beautiful woman. I'm not sure any movie can do justice to such a momentous theme, and this one wisely doesn't even try. It begins as a mildly interesting, conventional costumer, but somewhere along the way deteriorates into an embarrassingly soapy melodrama.<br/><br/>While the characterizations never rise to the level of the historical figures they are based upon, the acting itself is more than enough to keep the viewer's interest. As the king, Bana seems a strange casting choice. My image of Henry forever remains Charles Laughton gleefully devouring a leg of mutton. Bana's Henry is much younger, more virile and interested in legs, but not of the mutton variety. The problem with Bana is that his kingly bearing is overshadowed whenever one of the Boleyn girls enters the frame.<br/><br/>Portman is nicely naughty as England's most notorious seductress, while Johansson brings the voluptuously innocent Mary as far as the screenplay will allow her. The supporting cast is impressive too, with Morrissey as the dastardly duke of Norfolk, Scott Thomas as a proto-feminist Lady Boleyn and Torrent as the spurned Katharine.<br/><br/>The movie's greatest strength is certainly the art direction and production design. All of the exteriors and many of the interiors were shot in castles and estates that actually date back to the period portrayed. England has what it calls the National Trust, a system that preserves its history all the way back to King Arthur. It's great for tourists... and movie makers, too.<br/><br/>In many movies made in England the setting is often a central character, and -- as in this film -- one of the most interesting."
"imdbfriend","7","0","2","19 April 2008"," If you want to! Watch it for Natalie Portman
","Just watched this movie and must say I was disappointed by the treatment to this royal subject. This subject required more screen time than under 2 hrs as after the movie the feeling you are left with is there should have been more, more in detailed. But apart from less details in the story, acting is superb and especially by Portman. Natalie Portman definitely deserves praises and awards for her depiction of 'Anne', she is simply brilliant. Her portrayal of the Other Boleyn Girl gives her everything, every space to show off her skill as an actress and she does that with complete authority. Scarlett too is good in her role, and so are other actors. Again among another negative aspect of the movie in Eric Bana, he is a very good actor but he had nothing to do in this movie and also for me he wasn't at his best either and at any time didn't feel like he is the King of England, he lacked that authority. But watch this movie if you want to, only for Natalie Portman, she not just looks good throughout the movie her acting is wonderful too."
"eclectick05","8","0","1","18 April 2008"," Huge performance by Natalie Portman
","The historical context depicted in the film is really to put under doubt, because many of the events naturally presented as facts are more than dubious.<br/><br/>Still the story line is great, the plot is really well turned and as a fiction movie based on true events, this film is very moving, a strong achievement.<br/><br/>What is truly exceptional in this film are the actors performances, truly amazing cast.<br/><br/>The men are, like in the plot, the most powerful in terms of action and decision but the most fade too. That is voluntary, I believe, as they always step back in front of the king. For the king himself, Eric Bana does a perfect job to show this spoiled child becoming obsessed by the only one who resists him.<br/><br/>But where it gets really amazing, it's with the female cast. I would hugely recommend this film if you love the cinema for great actresses achieving great performances.<br/><br/>Kristin Scott-Thomas is fabulous, playing this torn woman, torn between her subtle perceptive mind, the love of her children and the social role in which she is completely discharged of guidance, although she sees more than anyone the disaster coming. She is a HUGE actress, one must be certain about that.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johansson does a very good job, playing her part with delicate manner, concern and fading behind her sister more than often.<br/><br/>And, having the best part, Natalie Portman is simply astonishing in her performance, putting herself in an another level of achievement from film to film. After her tremendous Ines in Goya's Ghost, her tricky Leslie in Blueberry night or Evey in V for Vendetta, she is still going further in powerful, moving, realistic performance, all at once. She has an emotional palette which is really huge, and she drives all the emotion, she tears you apart between disgust and a natural, emotional empathy. The end of the movie is simply one of the best achievement I feel I have seen in years from an actress. She is beautiful, and she is clever in her choices. Dazzling, stunning, an award-winning performance if there be some justice.<br/><br/>A must see, in my opinion, for this artistic stunning achievement."
"DICK STEEL","8","0","1","14 April 2008"," A Nutshell Review: The Other Boleyn Girl
","The art of being a woman is to let the man believe they are in charge, as advised to Anne Boleyn in the movie by her mother Lady Elizabeth Boleyn (Kristin Scott Thomas)<br/><br/>Chilling words, aren't they, for all the men out there when watching this movie of a power struggle of sorts between the Boleyn sisters for the love, power and position from the King of England of the time, Henry Tudor (Eric Bana). I've been intrigued with the British monarchy of old ever since getting quick history lessons by the Beefeaters at the Tower of London back in 2004, and setting foot into the very premises where the events of the time took place, and visiting Anne Boleyn's final resting place at the Chapel Royal of St Peter ad Vincula, makes one wonder about its rich history. After all, I've stood where many have stood hundreds of years ago when they witnessed Anne Boleyn's execution, and one could only imagine what the atmosphere was like back then.<br/><br/>With the relative success of English period dramas like Elizabeth, thanks to the powerful performance of Cate Blanchett, The Other Boleyn Girl takes a step backwards in the timeline and dealt with the events immediately before Elizabeth's reign, tracing her ancestry of sorts, since Anne Boleyn is her mother. And nothing beats having the web of intrigue weave its tangled mess as almost everyone plays for self advancement.<br/><br/>The Boleyns good fortune likes with having beautiful daughters - Anne (Natalie POrtman) and Mary (Scarlett Johannson), hence the opportunity for marriage, used as a tool for consolidation of wealth and position should they marry into privileged families. And of course, there's none other when Dad Sir Thomas Boleyn (Mark Rylance) and Uncle the Duke of Norfolk (David Morrissey) scheme to plant the seeds of lust in the reigning King of England, and in doing so, causes the sisters to battle it out under heaps of misunderstanding, and growing hatred one has for the other, given a lust for power.<br/><br/>The political intrigue is nothing mind boggling, but goes to show how lust corrupts. In the case of Anne, her desire to be Queen outstrips her compassion for everyone, and as a one woman operator, out-schemes everyone in order to further her goals. For Mary, what seemed to be at first a non-noble thing to do in having to commit ""sanctioned"" adultery for the good of her family's standing, becomes a love for the man who's every so fickle. Eric Bana's Henry broods too much, and often thinks with his other head, so obvious in his explicit want to covert Anne even though he has his wife Queen Katherine (Ana Torrent), cast aside for not producing a male heir, and having child with Mary.<br/><br/>You might be anticipating some form of contrast of love that Henry had for Anne and Mary, but this is reduced to the comparison of love scenes, one tender, the other taking the rough and tumble route. While Johansson's Mary doesn't get a lot to do, nor opportunities for her to shine, the star of the show is undoubtedly Natalie Portman, as she plots and plans and allows for a series of emotions to come through as she struggles hard to be accepted, and then crumble into a heap toward the end under pressure to reproduce. It's not very often you get to see this negative side that get played out by Portman, so fans of hers, you're in for a real treat.<br/><br/>I thought the production values was excellent too, with rich costumes designed as well as attention to details paid, though certain important events and their impact were quickly glossed over, like how Henry VIII broke ties with the Catholic Church. Sure it is a Hollywood dramatization which allowed for some artistic license to be taken, but I thought, if memory served me right, that the finale was quite accurate, even though the sequences of events had to be super compressed. Things like her final appearance, and even the weapon of choice changed from an axe to a sword, are testament to those values, though some may argue that the ugly details were spared, which I felt could be left out, otherwise it might be a little morbid anyway.<br/><br/>So with period dramas recounting key events from relatively famous historical figures from the past - the Boleyn girls, Elizabeth and even Marie Antoinette, one wonders which other female blue blood will get the opportunity to be brought to the big screen."
"schappe1","8","0","1","13 April 2008"," Anne Boleyn as Lady Macbeth
","I didn't read the book, although I have read some of the history, and found myself blown away by ""The Other Boleyn Girl"". What blew me away was Natalie Portman's awesome performance as the tragically ambitious Anne, whose scheming creates a slippery slope that sends her into desperation and almost to madness before she literally loses her head. I had always regarded her as a great beauty and a charming performer but in this film Ms. Portman becomes a great actress. People have said the film concentrates too much on Anne but it really doesn't. Natalie just so dominates the film you think she's in every scene. She's just in every scene you care about. Hopefully Oscar voters will still care about her a year from now. With the heavy criticism of the film and its lack of box office success, they may not.<br/><br/>The problem, of course is that the film, historically, is nonsense. Every indication is that Anne Boleyn was not like this, (Wikipedia has some very good discussions of this). And if she wasn't the film is not merely inaccurate but a libel on her character. The question is: do we simply accept this and ""go with the flow"" so we can enjoy the story? Or do we condemn the film and everything in it because of the liberties it takes? Portman blows away every other Anne Boleyn that I've ever seen but the comparison seems unfair because she wasn't really playing Anne Boleyn. She was playing Lady Macbeth, (and showing she'd be very good at it if it ever came to that).<br/><br/>Anne Boleyn seems to be kind of like General Custer- her portrayal depends on the political climate of the moment and the agenda of the writer. The same could be said of the criticism of the portrayals. Many of the alleged inaccuracies are open to debate, (see Wikipedia on the book itself). Perhaps it's best just to look at it as a story and enjoy the blossoming of a great talent. If you have to read the book to find out it's a bad movie and you have to read history to find out it's a bad book, why do either?"

Besides the names of the characters the book is different enough to enjoy and not ruin what is happening.<br/><br/>The actors chosen were excellent, the costumes fantastic, but the plot just wasn't shocking enough."

","This film details the power struggle between two Boleyn sisters for the King of England.<br/><br/>Normally I get lost in historical drama, but ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is surprisingly easy to follow. Anne and Mary both fight for the affection of King Henry VIII, and this struggle and the resultant emotions are detailed engagingly in the film. It is quite a heartache to see two sisters having to manipulate each other and hurt each other in the process, as they cared for each other deep down.<br/><br/>Acting is excellent. Kristin Scott Thomas gives a memorable performance in the few seconds after she learns of the calamity that happens to her children. Scarlett Johansson is not just a pretty face, while Natalie Portman gives a stunning performance of all the emotions under the sun.<br/><br/>""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is an engaging and well-acted drama. I is definitely worth watching."
"JamesHitchcock","7","0","1","3 April 2008"," A Footnote in the Pages of History
","The cinema in English-speaking countries has long had a fascination with the sixteenth century; there are a few exceptions, such as Queen Victoria, but otherwise there seem to be far more films about the Tudor dynasty than about British monarchs from other periods. The Stuarts are mostly represented by Restoration romps and the occasional political drama like ""Cromwell"", while the Hanoverians have retained to this day the reputation for dullness which dogged them during their lifetimes. With odd exceptions like ""The Lion in Winter"", the Plantagenets are largely confined to Shakespeare adaptations.<br/><br/>The last few decades, however, have seen numerous Tudor dramas, such as the two versions of ""A Man for All Seasons"", ""Anne of the Thousand Days"", ""Mary Queen of Scots"", ""The Prince and the Pauper"", ""Lady Jane"" and, more recently, Shekhar Kapur's two films about Elizabeth I. ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" falls within this tradition. It covers much of the same ground as ""Anne of the Thousand Days""- the story of Henry VIII's courtship of his second wife Anne Boleyn, his divorce from his first wife Katherine of Aragon, and Anne's eventual fall from favour and her execution. It differs from its predecessor, however, in introducing as a major character Anne's sister Mary, someone who is normally regarded as a footnote in the pages of history.<br/><br/>Most historians believe that Mary was the elder of the two (their exact dates of birth are not known), but in the film she is shown as Anne's younger sister. The two sisters differ in both looks and character. The blonde Mary is innocent, warm-hearted and straightforward; the brunette Anne is ambitious and scheming. Both become pawns in the schemes of their social-climbing father Sir Thomas and their ruthless uncle the Duke of Norfolk. Sir Thomas believes that the best way to secure his advancement is to insert one, or both, of his daughters into the King's bed, and appears to have succeeded when Mary briefly becomes his mistress. Henry, however, soon tires of her and turns his attentions to her sister, who has ambitions to become something more than a mistress. Anne suggests to Henry that he should divorce Katherine, who is unable to bear him a son, and take her as his second wife.<br/><br/>The film essentially treats the story of Anne Boleyn as one of sibling rivalry. Initially Anne and Mary, despite their differences in character, are devoted to one another, but they become estranged when Anne supplants her sister in Henry's affections. (Mary is portrayed as being in love with Henry the man, Anne as being in love with Henry the king). Later, however, they are reconciled, and (in one of the film's numerous departures from historical fact) Mary even risks her life in a vain attempt to save Anne from her fate.<br/><br/>The film stars two of Hollywood's most beautiful and talented actresses, Natalie Portman and Scarlett Johansson, and both are very good here, bringing out the contrasting personalities of the two sisters; Anne becomes someone we can sympathise with despite her flawed character.<br/><br/>I was, however, less taken with Eric Bana as Henry. Some have criticised the film for showing Henry as young and handsome, but this is historically accurate; the young, athletic and good-looking Henry VIII of the 1520s was very different to the Henry of the 1540s- fat, in fading health and old before his time- with whom we are perhaps more familiar from our history books. My criticism would be that Henry came across as too likable. Perhaps this was necessary in order to explain why Mary should have fallen in love with him, but there is no getting away from the fact that Henry was a deeply unpleasant man and that his treatment of Anne Boleyn, whom he killed as soon as he had tired of her, shows him at his worst.<br/><br/>At least, however, Bana was better than Jonathan Rhys Meyers in the dreadful recent TV series ""The Tudors"". As I noted, ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is not always scrupulous in its adherence to historical fact, but compared with ""The Tudors"", which seemingly engaged as historical consultants the authors of ""1066 and All That"", it comes across as an academic textbook.<br/><br/>The look of the film is distinctive, with strong contrasts between the darkened interiors and the bright, sunlit, soft-focus exteriors. A notable feature of the indoor scenes is that many were shot from a distance, as if through a door or window, with much of the screen remaining dark. This seemed to me to be an effective device, emphasising the secretive, claustrophobic, intrigue-ridden world of the Tudor court. Although ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" is not in the class of ""A Man for All Seasons""- the original Paul Scofield version, not the inferior Charlton Heston remake- it is an enjoyable historical drama which can hold its own with most of the other Tudor sagas. 7/10"

","I thought it was a nice movie, especially as far as the photography and music were concerned. Now it's interesting to find out it's quite historically inaccurate, but this is usually the fact in this type of movies. I am Greek and get upset every time I see movies about Greek history (eg. Troy - I'm talking about the storyline).<br/><br/>I think they chose a very young and sexy actor to portray the king. I mean, which girl would really regard giving herself to him as a sacrifice? Anyway, I imagine why they did that - that's the reason I myself went to see the movie in the first place! Eric was great as always, but I don't think the script helped him much.<br/><br/>About the actresses. I think Natalie Portman was quite good there. She managed to make me both like and dislike her character at times, which I think is good. Johansson was awful, I see her acting the same boring way every time in every movie she is in, I think I would act better! I found Christine Scott Thomas's acting surprisingly dramatic and persuasive. I think she would make a great supporting actress academy award nomination.<br/><br/>In all, the movie was pleasant but a bit tiring, too few characters maybe and script loops.I give a 7/10 - worth watching."

Some of the scenes are gruesome, such as when Anne gets beheaded, or when her brother dies. I wouldn't say it's that disturbing but not for the weak stomach.
