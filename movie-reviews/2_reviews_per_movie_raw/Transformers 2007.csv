","Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay team up for the exciting and action packed blockbuster Transformers. Earth becomes caught up in a war between two groups of alien robots that have come in search of a device that gave life to their planet. That cast includes Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox, John Turturro, and Jon Voight, who all bring a certain charisma to the film. But the real stars of the film are the special effects, which are amazing. And Michael Bay does an excellent job at delivering high energy action sequences that are visually stunning. The writing is exceptionally poor and the film goes on for far too long, but the action and the visual effects keep the audience engaged. Transformers is messy and cheesy, and sophomoric...but it's also a lot of fun and immensely entertaining."
"GuyCC","1","671","1071","8 July 2007"," When Summer Blockbusters Go Really REALLY Wrong.
","When the announcement came for a new Transformers movie for Summer, I was pretty excited. I wasn't a major Transformers fan, but I had fond memories of the cartoon and toys. However, I hated the re-designed Transformers, thinking that these new designs were an overly busy cross between Lego's Bionicle toys and expressionist modern art sculptures. I also heard the script was poor, so I decided to skip this one.<br/><br/>However, I started hearing movie reviews about what an amazing film this was. ""The greatest film of all time!"" people proclaimed. So I came to terms with and accepted that these weren't the robots I grew up with, this was a ""new"" version, and I'd at least find interest in robots transforming into cars and beating each other up. I'd even go see this even though I don't like Michael Bay films.<br/><br/>How was it? Transformers is a disgustingly bloated and self-indulgent piece of crap. I understand that I'll get rated down for my review, but I'm prepared to accept that. Sadly, my theater must not have gotten the euphoria inducing gas that apparently other theaters got, causing me to gush over this film like other people.<br/><br/>Even the 1986 Transformers film wasn't perfect. It was basically one fight scene after another, and was a means to replace the old toys for a new line, but the action was good, showed the consequences of war, and featured the death of a beloved character. It kept true to the mythos, even though it was different. This movie makes reference to so many other films that it feels like a mishmash of 30 films you've seen before.<br/><br/>Bumblebee sends up an ""Autobat Symbol"" to summon the other Autobots like Batman. There's a scene in an underground bunker which felt totally pulled from Terminator 3 (and a few scenes later, uses the exact drumbeat from the ""Terminator Theme""). The fight scenes with their out of focus cameras and ""shaky cam"" style seems like they are trying to treat the battles as if they were ""Saving Private Ryan"" caliber. When Bumblebee gets captured during a scene, the music swells up so mournfully and overdramatically, that it makes the tragedies found in ""Schindler's List"" seem modest.<br/><br/>The biggest problem in character design lies in the fact that they all really do look alike. The worst offender was the Decepticon Frenzy, which looked like a 3D rendered pencil scribble, and acted like the Zuni Fetish Doll from ""Trilogy of Terror"". During the final battle, I was having problems telling who was who, and when the robots collided, it was hard to see where one began and the other ended. The car forms were presented as blatant product showcases, ripped straight from a commercial. Then again, there was so much product placement in the film. eBay must have made a fortune.<br/><br/>The slow set-up to the action or even any real glimpses of the title characters felt like ""The Hulk"". I pay for a movie about transforming robots, that's what I want to see.<br/><br/>Why would they keep a deadly robot under Hoover Dam, a major water source and tourist attraction? Why would they bring this ""All-Spark"" out of the desert and into a heavily-populated city where property damage and civilian casualties could run their full course. The dialogue was painful, sounded like it was written for teenagers, by teenagers in a really bad fanfic like what they thought people would say. What really irked me is how the Autobots couldn't seem to kill a Decepticon, but a lone soldier skidding on his back could dispatch one with a single shot. Why were the Autobots even there if the humans could do it better? How is it that they can save Bumblebee, but they can't repair Jazz? What was the difference? The government/military/robot/anyone dialogue was totally unrealistic, with officials willing to ""bet their ridiculously high government paychecks"" on hunches. Every line smacked on bad puns, clichés, or just sounded stupid. There was an extended conversation about masturbation between Sam and his parents that felt really awkward and extended far too long.<br/><br/>The personalities were also way underdeveloped. Transformers has over two decades of history that wasn't touched upon. The Starscream and Megatron rivalry, where Starscream tried to usurp Megatron for leadership was not mentioned or covered at all. Jazz was cool and fun-loving with a sense of style, while in the film he sounds like a ghetto thug. His first line is profanity, and I felt insulted. Not because of the language, but the fact that this was apparently the best the writers could do. Decepticons were introduced and blown away within minutes. The Autobots weren't much better. Did the people who wrote the story know anything about the subject material besides the fact that robots changed to vehicles? And then Optimus Prime. Obviously, Bay's madness knew better than to totally ruin this character, as he was the only robot who looked even remotely familiar to any previous version. And the personality was fairly accurate... up to the backyard scene, where Prime's personality suddenly shifts, breaks character, and he becomes a clumsy comedian. The next scene, he shifts back into a ""leader"" personality.<br/><br/>The saving grace outside of Prime was Sam Witwicky (played by Shia LaBeouf), who brought a credible ""gee whiz"" performance to the film, and yet I felt sorry for him using such ham-fisted dialogue.<br/><br/>Summer 2007 has been really mediocre for ""blockbuster"" films, as we're apparently supposed to lower our standards, ""sit back, not think and enjoy"" with these types of films, but how is one supposed to do that with with film devoid of heart, personality or no focus on the main characters? As a stand-alone film, this is a really bad movie. As a Transformers-licensed film, it's a God awful embarrassment. I'm avoiding the sequels unless they drastically overhaul the franchise and get a script not limited to high-school level online fanfic."
"PretentiousID","6","849","1383","27 June 2007"," Don't shy away from ""Transformers""...this is in no way a kids movie
","I went to see an advance screening of ""Transformers"" tonight, and I walked out of the theater in disbelief. Not because the movie wasn't what I thought it would be, but on the contrary, it was so much more than I had ever expected.<br/><br/>Going into the theater, I was expecting a corny kids movie with decent acting and a fantastic, unrealistic plot. Needless to say the plot was indeed fantastic and unrealistic, but it was all kept in check with solid acting and the most incredible display of visual effects that I have EVER seen. Most...actually almost all of the acting credit in this movie has to go to Shia LaBeouf, whom is quickly becoming a Hollywood star after recently giving an excellent performance in the thriller ""Disturbia"". It was another great performance from Shia in ""Transformers"", with his clever wit still ever present.<br/><br/>However, the most impressive aspect of ""Transformers"" was most certainly the special effects. The robot vs. robot fight scenes were, in a word, remarkable. I didn't know that modern day special effects could produce images so fantastic AND realistic, to the point where the robots didn't seem computer generated at all. The interaction between human and robot was beautiful and flawless. It seemed like the actors were actually interacting with real, 50 foot tall robots during the movie. ""Transformers"" will, without a doubt, be the pioneer for future cinematic visual effects.<br/><br/>The plot may have been a little unrealistic and some of the acting a little sketchy at times, but it does not in any way override what was truly an entertaining movie. The plot simply stayed true as best it could to the cartoon story without becoming overly ridiculous or corny. When I say unrealistic, that does not mean ""cartoon-corny"". In fact, I would recommend that ANYONE over the age of 13 go to see this movie. I promise you won't be disappointed."

","(This comment was deleted by IMDb based on an abuse report filed by another user, so I'm guessing it was pretty abusive; maybe it spoiled some aspect of ""the plot,"" if you can call it that, for some poor soul)<br/><br/>I think it was about four or five words into the opening narration when we burst into laughter. ""Before time began..."" Ouch. When a film can't go 5 seconds without a cliché, it doesn't deserve to be watched, at least not with a straight face.<br/><br/>Michael Bay's Transformers is hilariously awful, a sub-Ed Wood affair all the way through, a camp classic in the making. If Bay is the new Edward D. Wood, Jr. then Transformers may be the new Plan 9 from Outer Space. Let me count the ways: <br/><br/>1. Incoherent narration/ incoherent plot? Check.<br/><br/>2. Laughably bad dialogue? Check.<br/><br/>3. Pompous aliens with inexplicable plan to conquer Earth? Check.<br/><br/>4. Day turns to night in an instant? Check.<br/><br/>5. Copious use of military stock footage? Check.<br/><br/>6. Epic numbers of continuity errors? Check.<br/><br/>7. Dramatic confrontations solved via fistfights? Check.<br/><br/>8. Dramatic scenes that fly straight out of left field? Check. (""I'm so glad I got in the car with you."") <br/><br/>9. Formerly respectable older star sinks to a new low? Check. (Poor, poor Jon Voight) <br/><br/>10. Incredible overacting that is obviously encouraged by the director? Check.<br/><br/>11.Character who cannot speak for no apparent reason? Check.<br/><br/>12. Rampant stereotyping (not just the racial ones but stuff like cops acting dumb, doing a lot of shouting, and eating doughnuts, and military officials being all secretive one minute and spilling said secrets the next)? Check.<br/><br/>13. Characters with a lot of face time who end up playing no important role in the ""story?"" Check. (What useful purpose did Duhamel and the troops in Qatar serve after the first ten minutes?) <br/><br/>14. Heavy handed social/political commentary/references? Check. (eBay, eBay, eBay;imagine how much trouble could have been avoided if they'd just BOUGHT THE DAMN GLASSES OFF OF EBAY!) <br/><br/>15. A flying saucer catches on fire then crashes? Check.<br/><br/>16. Sudden flashes of light appear from nowhere and knock characters over? Check.<br/><br/>17. The action in some shots is hopelessly muddled? Check.<br/><br/>18. A character's hilarious death scene is matched only by his hilarious eulogy? Check.<br/><br/>19. The action halts suddenly so that someone can explain the back-story? Check.<br/><br/>20. Random bursts of laughter fill theater during screening? Check.<br/><br/>21. Gaps in dialogue perfect for Mystery Science Theater 3000-esque commentary? Check.<br/><br/>22. Inevitable cult following? Check.<br/><br/>Only these three things are missing, keeping it from true Ed Wood greatness: <br/><br/>1. No giant octopus. (Though Scorponok comes pretty close.)<br/><br/>2. No transvestites. (It has the prefix ""trans-"" in the title, though.)<br/><br/>3. No ludicrously campy speech made by the main villain. (Just "" I AM MEGATRON!!!"", which is plenty campy but not much of a speech.) <br/><br/>Maybe these'll be in the director's cut.<br/><br/>Except, of course, Ed Wood's movies had heart; even at their worst they feel like more than exercises in feature-length product placement. Bay doesn't have anything even remotely resembling a heart in his chest - that's why he's not even in Wood's league as a bad director, no matter how many laughs his terrible films get. And at least Wood's films didn't cost $150 million to make.<br/><br/>I'm a Transformers fan from way back. I've got an Optimus Prime and a Megatron atop one of my bookshelves. I have ancient videotapes of the fondly remembered cartoon series and a copy of the 20th anniversary movie DVD. I had worried that this film would damage my childhood memories beyond repair, like Star Wars Episode I did. But the film is just TOO bad and TOO stupid to have any real effect on me. The old animated movie, bad as it is, mops the floor with this one. If anything, it is a more mature(!) and entertaining work. The music in the old movie is terrible, but it fits. The music here is just terrible.<br/><br/>There are good points, but none anywhere near enough. John Turturro is the only actor who escapes this mess unscathed - his great over-the-top performance suggests that he actually understands how Z-grade the script he was given was. He's a lot of fun to watch, even as he's quickly reduced to a non-entity by the plot mechanics. Turturro is a great actor and this part only serves to elevate his status in my eyes. I hope he got a serious paycheck.<br/><br/>I can't stand CGI as a rule, but the special effects here are moderately convincing, at least in those rare moments when the camera isn't performing idiotic cartwheels to obscure them. I honestly like the models for the new TFs (the Autobots, anyway - I can barely tell the Decepticons apart), but the fact that they have little personality isn't so endearing.<br/><br/>Maybe the sequel will be up to the lofty standards of Ed Wood's Night of the Ghouls. But I doubt it."
"TheQuietStorm","1","554","911","4 July 2007"," How could Hollywood mess this ""sure thing"" up? What a shameful disaster!
","This deafeningly loud, obnoxious, usually stagnant and glorified epic disaster of a film was presented with too many opportunities to be one of the all-time greatest summer flicks ever. However, despite the advancements in today's special effects, it being inspired from the highly popular 1980's Hasbro toys and cartoon, with Steven Spielberg overseeing the production as an Executive producer, Michael Bay and his writers were still guilty of making this a ""steaming pile."" I can effortlessly breakdown at every level why this film didn't work for me.<br/><br/>The story was about a teenager name Sam (Shia LaBeouf) who purchases a car that happens to be a robot in disguise from another world. Sam is then caught in the middle of an ancient battle between two groups of these alien robots, the heroic Autobots and the Evil Decepticons. Both are seeking a mysterious cube known as the ""Allspark"" that contains their ""life source."" This central plot intertwines with the story of a special ops team being attacked by one of the Decepticons in the beginning, the pentagon enlisting teams of computer hackers to decode a signal they detected that ultimately came from the Decepticons and a hokey love story between Sam and Mikaela, the gorgeous bombshell in his class.<br/><br/>As intriguing as all of this may sound, besides the many battle scenes, car chases, attempts on Sam's life and Decepticon attacks, nothing happens to move the story along. Whatever layers of stories that were suppose to be happening beneath the unimpressive action sequences were uneventful and slow. So, all you're left with is the action, which by the end was boring and tedious to watch.<br/><br/>The characters were flat and moronic. The humans were one-note, soulless caricatures. They were also more than capable of damaging the robots, which took away from the extraordinary antagonism the original cartoon presented for our human heroes. The humans were helpless against the Decepticons and this made the Autobots necessary. In this absurd film, the humans didn't really need the Autobots to take out the Decepticons.<br/><br/>And whatever happened to characters like Jorge ""Fig"" Figueroa and Maggie? They sort or left this film halfway to the end to join the film playing in the theater next door.<br/><br/>Also, part of the cartoon's success was the personalities of the Transformers. They were emotional beings that were capable of treacherous, loyal, courageous, cowardice, morose and optimistic behavior. They weren't just giant piles of junk destroying an American metropolis. Whatever happened to the ongoing struggle for power over the Decepticons between Starscream and Megatron? This would've added some real complexity to this paper-thin story. Instead, Bay and the writers settled for hinting at it with a laughable one-liner from Megatron that rang falser than the action. Wasn't Bumblebee the kindest, frailest of them all? He was essential for his undying compassion for the humans in the cartoons. Not in this film, where he obviously fought in many battles and, when annoyed, can urinate on a human being at any given time. Now going from the true character to the characterizations of the robots, the looks of the original were more engaging and attractive to the eye. In this film, they looked like metal scraps of junk.<br/><br/>Then the films auteur had to take it there by making Jazz the Transformer with the Black-American soul, screaming, ""What up, b****es?"" Ironically, he was the only Autobot that easily gets killed as well. Now, a lesser minded person would pull the race card for this. I would just blame it on lazy, unimaginative, sloppy, hack writing and directing. In the end, I couldn't care less about any of the characters, human or Transformer.<br/><br/>The original Transformers could be chastised for wooden dialogue. However, when the characters weren't trying to be funny in this film, the dialogue was ten times worse than that of the cheesy words spoken in the cartoon. It was absolutely ridiculous, with zero subtext. The quality of the dialogue was lessoned in scenes where exposition was inappropriately forced in, like the ineptly written scene when Agent Simmons (John Turturro) was questioning Sam and Mikael in the backseat of the SUV, revealing Mikaelas' weak back story. And how many times did Optimus Prime have to tell us his name? At one point, I thought he was forgetting the many times he said his name previously. Besides, the whole introducing-yourself-thing from the Transformers, especially the Decepticons, was extra cheddar cheesy to me: ""I am Megatron!"" Yeah, and?! The monologues underscored by the sappy music could've gotten the collective ""heave-hove"" from this film as well.<br/><br/>The special effects were cool but could've been better. Most of the time, the Transformers looked animated instead of real in my opinion. And the confusing, unorthodox way they transformed, not to mention detailing that made them look like piles of scrap metal, revealed most of the flaws in the cartoon like computer generated images. As a director, I wouldn't be satisfied with the end result.<br/><br/>The most entertaining thing about sitting through a screening of this film was the hordes of people that were going ballistic over it. They laughed at anything and applauded for everything. From Bumblebee shattering all the glass in and around the car dealership to the Autobots skidding in unison on a U-Turn, these people thought every little thing deserved a standing ovation. Okay, maybe they were not standing. But it was all so laughable to me.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Bay, Spielberg and the writers massacred what could've been one of the greatest sci-fi films ever made. The only thing amazing about this experience was my girl sleeping through most of it with me nodding off right along side her. Bay has proved himself to be one of the worst, overpaid film directors in the history of Hollywood."
"spencey7","1","180","285","5 July 2007"," Utterly awful
","I honestly don't know where to start with this movie. I will say however, that - like many other people - this is the film I've been waiting 20 years to see.<br/><br/>I suppose it's sensible to start with what should be the foundation stone of any cinematic experience - the script. It's cheesy, cliché-ridden, and poorly-structured. Characterisation (especially of the Autobots/Decepticons) is non-existent. Optimus Prime uttering the words ""My bad"" must go down in history as one of the worst moments in movie history. Actually scratch that - the ""lubricating"" scene is definitely worse. The writing of human characters is lazy at best, sticking with stereotypes such as the beautiful code-breaker, fat computer whizz, bumbling government agent etc etc. The performances (Shia aside) are instantly forgettable, but a great deal of that comes down to the script and direction. Megan Fox may be a great actress for all I know, but she may as well be a stripper for the purposes of this movie.<br/><br/>The effects are incredible (although not helped by Bay's erratic editing style), but when you've no reason to care about them it results in an empty experience. Effects DON'T MAKE A MOVIE.<br/><br/>With Spielberg as part of this project I allowed myself a little optimism, but it's patently clear that Bay and Co. had no understanding or respect for the Transformers franchise. GIANT ""FLIPPING"" ROBOTS BLOWING ""STUFF"" UP this may be, but it is most certainly not Transformers."
"brando647","8","53","78","17 August 2009"," Wild/Loud Summer Fun w/Robots
","I was not a Transformers kid when I grew up in the 80's and I think that's why I wasn't so hard on Michael Bay's film when I caught it in the summer of 2007. Going into the film for the first time, the only characters I knew by name were Optimus Prime, Megatron, and Bumblebee (and I only knew of him through the mention of friends). So, without having the fanboy mentality, I was able to enjoy the movie as it was...and I did. I thought it was a fun action flick and one of the best popcorn movies from the year. Based on the Hasbro toyline and it's resulting animated series/comics, the film follows high-schooler Sam Witwicky who discovers his Camaro is a shape-shifting alien robot; he is soon brought into the middle of a war between the Autobots and the Decepticons, warring factions of a race of sentient robots.<br/><br/>Let's be honest. The only things that matter about this movie are the special effects and the action sequences. ILM did a fantastic job with the Transformers in this film. The robots look amazing and their transformations are seamless. I've heard that some classic fans aren't satisfied with their designs but I felt they did a good job adding what realism they could to giant fighting robots. The action sequences aren't as abundant as one would expect, but I'm not complaining. I felt there were enough action scenes without going overboard and drowning out story. The battles feel epic and they aren't heavily edited into quick jump cuts so you can still understand what is going on.<br/><br/>The cast does an adequate job and keep the movie from feeling B-grade. Shia LaBeouf was charismatic and had a good sense of comedic timing; John Turturro was a fun addition as the mental Sector 7 agent Simmons. Jon Voight seemed almost out of place in the film, though added a bit of class. I know there have been a lot of complaints about human characters in the movie, but it's a necessary element and I'm not complaining. The supporting cast did a great job; my favorites had to be Kevin Dunn and Julie White as Sam's eccentric parents. I felt the movie shouldn't have gone over 2 hours as it does begin to strain on the patience after a while but it still made for a fun ride."
"catpantry","10","5","5","11 April 2020"," Its really good
","You know that part of being human where you need things to matter, a lot. Theres no escape from it. This movie does it for me and can satisfy anyone else. Strong dramatic decision made in this one. Powerful time stunning move when Seeker climbs on the bars of a cesna plane and salutes walking by people who don't know who he is."
"ChristianLinnell","1","421","701","2 July 2007"," A horrible movie
","What a concept it was. Two rival factions of transforming robots crash land on Earth, and are re-awoken in 1984 to continue their epic struggle amongst a vastly inferior race. One side, the heroic Autobots, battles to save their homeworld from the evil Decepticons.<br/><br/>Humans took a back seat in this war. Seen by the Autobots as life that should be protected and by the Decepticons as insignificant obstacles, the characters that made Transformers so popular were the transformers themselves.<br/><br/>Alas, Michael Bay's vision was obviously something quite different.<br/><br/>After an outstanding exposition in which we meet the lead and supporting characters, the movie goes downhill. Fast. Full of plot holes that invalidate half the events of the movie, and stupid writing that just doesn't make sense, Transformers severely makes me doubt the abilities of its writers (then again, one of its writers did do Catwoman AND The Core - two more stupid movies).<br/><br/>Plot flaws? That's right! The better part of the movie is spent following the two factions as they race to find a map Megatron made to the 'Allspark'. Naturally, we later find out that the Allspark was moved by the humans AFTER the map was made, to a place specifically selected to prevent the transformers from finding it. But does that stop them from using the now invalid map to find it? Not at all! The map leads them right to it. Somehow.<br/><br/>So now the Allspark is found, but entrusted to Bumblebee. And what does a US special forces operative decide to do? That's right - drive it into the middle of a large city, where hundreds, if not thousands of people can be killed in the inevitable battle between 20 foot tall transforming robots.<br/><br/>A good story can be set in the present day, or in Shakespeare's time, or Ancient Rome, underwater or in space. Your characters can be humans, farm animals or robots, and if it's a good story, little will be lost.<br/><br/>So why did Bay find it necessary to give the transformers barely any lines or decent screen time? And why were half their scenes just petty jokes (I refer to the far-too-long scene in which the transformers act like complete idiots as Witwicky searches for his Grandfather's glasses. It was funny for about 2 minutes. The other 30 minutes were just painful.)? <br/><br/>I don't think I could ever run out of bad things to say about this movie. Seriously, don't see it - especially if you care about Transformers and have more than one brain cell."
"bigben5","1","138","220","14 July 2007"," American Pie meets Transformers.
","This was one crappy movie and a pain to watch. Just hearing Optimus Prime utter ""Oops my bad"", made me want to bolt for the door. Anyway, here is just a brief summary of all the good and bad this movie has to offer.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/><ul><li>The transformations- I'm surprised at how well they made the transformations work. Optimus Prime, Bumblebee and Megatron don't look half as bad as I thought they would. It's nice to see the parts warp and change instead of watching these big blocky characters that were in the cartoon.</li></ul><br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>On my, where do I start...<br/><br/><ul><li>The jokes were awful. For some reason they decided to make this movie as a crossover between American Pie and Transformers. Bumblee ""lubricating"" the man and Sam masturbating, just wasn't funny. The only people who were laughing in the audience were little kids.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The humans stole the show. I thought Transformers was supposed to be about the Transformers themselves, who each had unique personalities with a little human action thrown in the background. Instead the tables are reversed, where we are FORCED to spend lengthy amounts of time with characters the audience truly doesn't give a rat's ass about. Who cares about Sam Whitwickey? Or that smart programming chick? Or that fat donut eater? Who honestly gives? This is a Transformers movie folks, not a love story with some dumb robots thrown in for kicks. Oh and Sam himself, was super, duper irritating and annoying.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The choreography was terrible. Some fight scenes were cool enough but the shaky camera movements and extreme closeups made it difficult to tell what was going on. The fight between Megatron and Optimus proved to be extremely disappointing, as we are only given a few shots of Optimus punching and tripping Megatron, while the army tries to destroy Blackout. </li></ul><br/><br/>-They completely destroyed the Transformers back story. Those even remotely interested in the Transformers will know that they came from Cybertron and that their ship crashed on Earth only to be revived centuries later. But here Cybertron is destroyed to pieces with no chance of it ever being revived. Well, I guess the Transformers are screwed folks ... but they already were when Michael Bay decided to direct.<br/><br/>In short, if you were expecting to see a movie about the Transformers, you were sadly mistaken. Be prepared to spend hours focusing on Sam and his loser girlfriend instead. Also, why the hell did it take an hour and a half for Optimus Prime to show up in the first place- that to me, is a disgrace."
"nielad","3","241","401","5 July 2007"," Nothing More Meets the CG-Eye in this Baytravesty
","Summer action flicks should never be seen with the preconceived notion of high expectations. The reason for this is simple: eye candy films that are released when school is out aim for a youthful demographic who are simply looking for good way to kill 2 and half hours. These films can be instant blockbusters even without a coherent plot or compelling dialogue. Films about massive robots based on a toy line which wreak havoc narrow the demographic further (and lower the bar of cinematic standards), but throw in wannabe epic director Michael Bay (Armageddon, Pearl Harbor) and you can guarantee the trailer will pull in other audiences. I never played with the toys or watched the cartoon, but it can be assured nothing more meets the eye than CGI goo and decent Foley artists on sound in Transformers.<br/><br/>The basic plot involves the benevolent Autobots and their archenemies (Decepticons) dragging their robot war on Earth, as if humans didn't have enough of their own war mongering to deal with. The Decepticons are looking for their cube which is powerful enough to create new robot life or destroy Middle Earth..err...the universe but the Autobots are willing to have Frodo...I mean... Sam (Shia LeBeouf) sacrifice the cube (and new transformer life) for the victory of the human race. The stereotyped prodigies give hope to nerds everywhere: teenage intelligence agents, a computer hacker, even a car mechanic with too much make up. Sam probably feels left out as the average kid, but is reassured later that ""you're a soldier "" too. Michael Bay, who is only good at directing big locations blowing up on camera , struggled to find a logical reason for the final battle. He fails at doing so and consequently has a character suggest (with knowledge of an impending robot onslaught) to rendezvous in a major human population area. Everyone else, including the Secretary of Defense (John Voight), quickly agrees to this idea of jeopardizing the safety of an entire city. I have this to say to Michael Bay: No, pushing the story along so you can have your 20 minute destructo-scene isn't going to make me forget about that line earlier in the movie. You know, the one where the boy films the Autobot simultaneously crash landing and yells, ""Wow! This is cooler than Armageddon!"" I didn't sit down in the theater expecting fine cinematic quality, but I don't want to see a movie where the director services himself for what he believes to be past ""accomplishments.""<br/><br/>At least there were a few well done casting elements. Shia LeBeouf was good as the quick witted underdog student, but I'm afraid he is in danger of being typecast. Didn't I already see him play this role in Disturbia? John Turturro as the oddly likable top secret agent also makes the monotonous dialogue scenes more dynamic. Most importantly, the film lacked Michael Bay's favorite fan boy Ben Affleck (It was reported that for this reason, the crew had to stop production for a week because Bay locked himself in the bathroom, sobbing uncontrollably.) Hugo Weaving (The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings) was in the film voicing Megatron but you wouldn't know it considering his two lame lines. Then there's Sam's caked up love interest (Meagan Fox) who, besides the horrible acting, loses points for actually saying, ""Sam, whatever happens, I'm glad I got in the car with you."" It must have been a homage to every poorly delivered, cheese ball romance line in the the history of cinema.<br/><br/>At least Bay, who sold his soul to corporate America in this film, didn't force her to to replace the word ""car"" with ""Camaro."" It wouldn't have been surprising, considering I counted 11 different products being shamelessly placed throughout the entire film. Ebay is not the only online auction site, I'm not letting Bay have that one. As for the rest, was it really necessary to show the words ""GMC"" and ""Camaro"" as if the movie was a car commercial? Was it really necessary to include the words ""Blackberry"", ""Nokia"", and ""Energizer"" in under a minute of dialogue? Did John Turturro feel as sold out as I did for not walking out when I heard him say, ""...your little Taco Bell dog?""<br/><br/>I only stayed for the duration of the movie to write this review, which will never happen again if I witness such disgusting product placement. A summer action flick about fighting robots is tolerable, but the special effects weren't even that great. A shot without any movement other than the CGI spectacles, isn't live action, it's animation. The music sounds stripped from another Bay film. Take away those elements, Bay's pathetic direction, the typecast characters, the poorly written plot and all you have left is the sound, which actually made the film audibly pleasing. I salute you Erik Aadahl and friends of the sound department. Michael Bay, please take the advice of Matt Stone and Trey Parker and stop making movies."

","THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.<br/><br/>Anyone who has seen a previous Michael Bay movie knows exactly what to expect, so I went to the movie theater very cautious about what I was about to see, and tried not to think about it as a movie based on a beloved show from my childhood, and rather as a ""big budget action fest with robots"".<br/><br/>There are just too many problems with this movie. Like all Bay movies, its at least a half hour too long. It has both unnecessary scenes and too many characters, and thus, no character development. The action scenes are both drawn out and short at the same time. There are long periods of action, yes, but each Decepticon that is fought is generally defeated very quickly, so don't expect to see any decent robot-on-robot battles that last any longer than a few seconds. The action scenes, specifically the ones involving Transformers fighting each other, are very hard to follow. For example, I have no idea how Bumblebee lost its legs, or how exactly Optimus Prime lost his fight with Megatron (and neither did any of the people I was with). There are definitely plenty of explosions and a good deal of action...the only problem is that the action isn't actually any good.<br/><br/>Much of the dialog was cheesy, and half a dozen times people in the audience broke out in laughter in scenes that were definitely not meant to be funny, simply because of how bad the dialog was at times.<br/><br/>The movie portrays the Decepticons as unstoppable killing machines, but shows the Autobots as awkward, bumbling fools. The scene at the Witwicky's is especially bad, as the Autobots refuse to listen to Sam and apparently cannot movie with any hint of finesse, instead managing to crush anything near them or just trip over their own feet. The Autobots generally serve no purpose throughout the movie but to provide comic relief, and many of them have very little on-screen time or dialog. Are we supposed to believe that the Autobots can learn English from watching television, but cant learn anything about earth in the process? There are also a number of obvious plot holes in the movie that practically jump out and slap you across the face. A good example of this is how Megatron had been frozen for thousands of years but immediately after being resurrected could speak English perfectly.<br/><br/>As a Transformers movie, there is very little here resembling the original series. The characters all act and look very different from their G1 counterparts. The vehicles they transform into are now all brand new GM automobiles, which are featured throughout the movie. Other advertisements are rampant as well, for example the mountain dew soda machine that turns into a Transformer covered in mountain dew advertisements, and fires cans of mountain dew at people....which is probably the only way they could get anyone to drink it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I couldn't enjoy this as a Transformers movie, or as a big budget action flick...it is just too horribly directed. When I saw it, a dozen people walked out, and many booed at the end. I cant blame them.<br/><br/>There's plenty of other flaws to point out, but unfortunately I just don't have that much free time. If you can turn off your brain and watch the movie without thinking about anything you are seeing, as a person has to do with any other of Bays films, you may enjoy it. If you like coherent story lines and character development then this movie is not for you."

","Tripe. Filth. Mud. Worthless. Blunt. Stupid. These are six words that aptly describe the idea behind Michael Bay's latest smash-fest ""TRANSFORMERS."" <br/><br/>As one of those ""poor saps"" (as I was called while waiting in the theater) who had never seen the TV show as a child, I went into the movie expecting nothing, especially considering that Michael Bay is one of the least artistic, most pandering directors of the present. But once the movie started, it was all right. Shia LeBeouf was charming, as was the quirky teen-humor that pervaded the first 45 minutes. In fact, the Transformers were pretty bad-ass.<br/><br/>...Until minute 46, when they began to talk. Not only was their behavior evocative of stoners and idiots, they lumbered around his backyard, and, later in the movie, peed on a federal agent. There was even one transformer (I forget the name, and I am all the better for it) that talked like he was from the ""projects."" The plotting was puerile and idiotic. There was even a subplot where Shia LeBeouf's love interest was discovered to have a criminal record, but that subplot was handily absolved five minutes later when Shia LeBeouf cuts a deal with the government. SO STUPID AND POINTLESS! Not to mention, the movie abounded with Michael Bay's never-ending car chases and slow-motion hoohah. Very very bad scripting like ""I'm not leaving without Bumblebee!"" and the leader of the good Transformers saying ""Oops, my bad"" made for a horrible experience.<br/><br/>The bulk of the movie was terrible. The acting, aside from noticeably realistic screams from Shia and others, was stilted and just perfect for the sort of film that doesn't even hide that it relies wholly on special-effects and the toy franchise itself, the kind of things that Michael Bay loves to beat over movie-goers' heads like a blunt object."
"Seiryu","1","74","117","4 August 2007"," Formulaic BS that showcases everything wrong with the action genre...
","It worries me that anyone could actually fall for **** like this in this day and age...<br/><br/>Michael Bay's latest crime against the cinema is by far his most by-the-numbers venture yet with so little creativity that it should be considered punishable. Big explosions, high-priced special effects meant to dazzle, generic comedy, and female cast members meant to dazzle are just about all this movie has to offer, and it all culminates in a big battle in downtown Los Angeles that by nature and set-up is almost as implausible as even the inclination that a guy with Shia LeBouf's face could score a pity date with a girl that looks like Megan Fox without fame or fortune to help. Yet as a summer movie the audience is not simply sold this idea but expected to accept it in a ""neat"" marketable package complete with overwhelming amounts of product placement. As a result a vicious cycle is born. Visuals reign over every aspect of this film as it does in many of its kind which leaves little room for anything else that is supposed to make up a movie, and too often the story is the first victim and audiences buy into it like a toddler distracted by a shiny set of keys. The robot effects are nothing short of impressive, but with the price tag on this production they should be at the least. However movies are not simply pretty moving pictures. The story does matter, and that is why blockbusters are considered by many to be a joke.<br/><br/>Transformers is really no different from the blockbusters that have become easy cannon fodder either. Plot-holes and inconsistencies are usually considered a hindrance, but in a movie like Transformers the audience is supposed to accept the idea that taking the catalyst for the movie's battles into town to in affect endanger countless lives is a good plan. Not only that, but taking it by helicopter is safe or sensible when two of the most violent pursuers can easily fly faster and would be willing to shoot the helicopter down. All of the characters are shallow and sometimes superfluous. Look no further than Anthony Anderson's character for an example of a role that takes up time unnecessarily and is ultimately meaningless. In this case even a lead character in Optimus Prime is not fully developed. Much of what we know about him depends solely on preexisting knowledge of the franchise. For anyone else his nobility is simply to be taken at face value without much of a basis. When you see him bypass a crashing helicopter for the ""allspark"" (*cough*MacGuffin*cough*) it really makes all of the talk about protecting humans feel a little pretentious. Then again the very design of the robots in this movie are contradictory.<br/><br/>If the Autobots and Decepticons are supposed to be alien robots, their designs don't reflect that at all. The fact that Bumblebee has an engine is really absurd. He's not a car, he just needs to look like one to an outsider. Optimus Prime's face looks like it's constructed of truck parts when if he is meant to be a robot first and truck second he should just have a face...period. The same can be said for all of the robots (look at Blackout's hand in the close-up for example). Too much of their look is steeped in the technology of Earth when that really doesn't make any sense considering their origins. But that's only a part of the problem here. The real problem lies in the shitty cinematography and even lousier action. Fights in this movie look like scrap-metal tumbleweeds. A lot of what goes on is indecipherable nonsense that lasts all of seconds on-screen WHEN it actually is on-screen. Even the climatic final battle is rather anti-climatic.<br/><br/>In the end what you're left with is a ****-stain of formula right down to the awful Goo-Goo Dolls song that accompanies the ultra-implausible half-ass teen romantic-""comedy"" that most of this movie centers around augmented by pro-militarism in the most idiotic and insipid way. Plenty of detail went into the SFX of the movie, but even that was misdirected. The story didn't receive half as much attention, and it wouldn't have taken 1/8 of the work and that is one of the key flaws. If effects were all that mattered then there really would be no such thing as a good or bad movie (and that goes double for the BS inclination toward ""judging a movie for what it is""). Narrative is more important than the ""whizz-bang"" and ""aint-that-cool"" of special effects. One need look no further than a lower-tech classic of the genre like Aliens, or Terminator 2 to see my point. Comedy also shouldn't be so painfully transparent as that defeats the purpose of the joke. If you don't see that you probably like this movie. If that's the case then you should know that you're ****ing up the genre for the rest of us..."
"Danymal","1","179","299","1 July 2007"," Bay and Dreamworks massacre Transformers
","I saw the advance screening a few days ago and in a nutshell, two whole years of anticipation were stripped away by a flash of severe disappointment within the first 45 mins of this film. I'm a hard-core G1 fan and can't tell you how blasphemous this film is to those of us who who followed the original series from Cybertronian history to character profiles and traits.<br/><br/>The script itself is utter garbage and reminiscent of a Disney film with ultra-lame jokes and childish references. The mere reference to teenage masturbation in one scene is just completely uncalled for and unnecessary in this film. Too much focus was placed on the human characters than the Transformers themselves who are the stars of the show. It's sad that the original film in '86 was a lot darker than this slop that Dreamworks has tastelessly thrown together and expected us to swallow. There's absolutely no character development regarding either clan of robots. The only thing keeping my attention was Peter Cullen's voice as 'Prime...that's the ONLY justice Dreamworks has afforded this film. I understand they needed new body styles to fit today's society...not a problem...but they should still have the same basic look in robot mode and the same voices!! Starscream was everyone's favourite Decepticon...he looked awesome and his trademark voice made the character. He's now absolutely hideous, completely beyond recognition and his voice is just as low and bland as the rest of the characters.<br/><br/>Way too much comedy in this film...Transformers don't tip-toe around people's front lawns in the middle of the night trying not to be seen by human parents...that's lame. Transformers is an epic, intergalactic war over ENERGON, not this ""allspark"" that Dreamworks fabricated. It's a dark battle, like Lord of the Rings but with Cybertronians! My last argument has to be the score/soundtrack. Talk about minimalist...Steve Jablonsky did NOTHING for this film. Was Danny Elfman not available?! All my fellow fans out there need to know that the Transformers theme song does NOT even appear in the film, ANYWHERE by ANY means. Not even a melodic reference to it in the orchestral score which I find completely absurd. The band Mute Math did the theme for the soundtrack allegedly though it never actually plays in the film, not even over the end credits!! From start to finish this was absolute mockery of all traits that made the original series and film so great...it's nothing now. I'm forced to pretend this new film doesn't even exist because it's defiled the Transformer name so bad...a complete injustice to my expectations as a true fan. If they have the nerve to make sequels to this slop I refuse to watch."
"Christopher_Reid","8","708","1253","30 June 2007"," Great visual and sound effects, lots of humour and a lot of flaws.
","Transformers is a very mixed bag. There are great things about it and there are some not-so-great things about it...<br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/><ul><li>The visual effects. Perhaps the best special effects I've ever seen in a movie. The transformations are amazing not to mention super-awesome. The CGI fits in seamlessly with the live action and it's easy to forget how logistically difficult a lot of it would have been to film.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The sound design. The sound effects complement the action perfectly making everything twice as exciting. Probably less acknowledged is the alien atmosphere created by some of the score which heightens the tension very effectively and probably without the majority of the audience noticing.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Shia LeBeouf. Without him the movie wouldn't be nearly as engaging. He has natural comic timing and is probably second to none in expressing disbelief of the ""holy crap, there's a giant alien robot transforming in front of me"" variety.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The humour. Transformers is funnier than most good comedies which I was not expecting in the least. The transformers themselves are often funnier than they are impressive.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Decepticons. Man are they cool. The opening scene is particularly kick-arse.</li></ul><br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/><ul><li>Megan Fox. If hot means ""can't act and doesn't weigh much"" then yes, she's very hot. It's not a good sign if you want one of the main characters to die or at least get out of the way and stop trying to act. Her performance just seemed very shallow and probably wasn't helped by her dialogue.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The script. Although the overall storyline is good, some of the dialogue is terrible. Too much of the film is spent on mumbo jumbo technical explanations the audience just doesn't care about. The less serious parts of the script work very well though.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Michael Bay. Although some of the action scenes are very well put together and the humorous parts are timed very well, Bay can't help but ruin some of the scenes with unnecessarily flashy editing and over the top drama accompanied by none-too-subtle dramatic music. It's not that Michael Bay's style is too loud, it's that it's too clichéd.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The music. Nothing new here (other than the alien sounding parts). Practically rips of Batman Begins and is otherwise forgettable. The music should enhance the film by bringing out interesting themes or emotions, not force feeding us the drama we can plainly see on the screen in super slow motion.</li></ul><br/><br/>The ugly:<br/><br/><ul><li>Megatron. He's ugly. And super cool.</li></ul><br/><br/>So, my verdict? The good outweighs the bad pretty comfortably. If you took out the bad you might even have a classic on your hands. Instead you get revolutionary action scenes and some great comedy with Michael Bay's unique brand of mediocre directing sprinkled throughout."

","Seriously, why do we still see Michael Bay movies? We, as a people, need to unite against him. And how in God's name is this movie in the top 250 right now? This movie is lucky that I just saw Spiderman 3, otherwise this would be the worst movie of all time. <br/><br/>Michael Bay just does the same thing in every movie: way too many helicopters, pilots running to their planes, and the flare overhead to alert the planes (why didn't he just use stock footage of Nicholas Cage from The Rock?)<br/><br/>And John Turturro, why? You are a great actor, why reduce yourself to this trash? Please tell me you got paid over 10 million for this. <br/><br/>Words cannot describe how bad the script of this movie is. I was dying laughing at Optimus Prime's emotional ""Were we so different"" speech. And the scene at Sam's house that goes on for about 16 hours with the American Pie rip-off? The Transformers are treated like little kids in that scene who say things like ""My bad"" and ""Oops"". Are you kidding me? These are The Transformers, not the Ninja Turtles. <br/><br/>The thing I don't get is how people liked this movie. Shia wasn't bad and the girl was hot (while doing her best Jennifer Connelly in Blood Diamond impression), but the rest of the characters were miserable. Am I the only one who thinks that Anthony Anderson's line in Entourage (""You need any color in that movie?"") is really the only way he gets any acting jobs? <br/><br/>Needless to say, I hated this movie and simply laughed at it with my friends the whole time. But I contributed to Michael Bay making more movies, and for that I am sorry"
"jedi_junny","7","374","653","2 July 2007"," Shock and Awe, and some gripes
","This movie is ACTION. I say this first because if you think this movie will be anything more than this, you will be disappointed on some level (as I was). Frame for frame this movie screams Michael Bay.<br/><br/>Now that's out of the way, there's a lot of stuff here that works and a lot that doesn't. It's a good thing that the robots do work. Seeing autobots and decepticons in glorious photo-realistic CGI is enough to wring out any childhood fantasy from anybody (not just boys from the 80s). Watching these robots move is to realize a revelation to what is possible with modern movie effects. Whether it's transforming on the move, bashing the living daylights out of each other, or just standing and talking, these guys alone make the movie work. And unlike the other blockbusters that have came out this year, these effects have a sense of weight that adds so much to the visual satisfaction.<br/><br/>As for everything else, well... that's when things start to go downhill. In typical epic fashion, this movie contains a sprawling cast. Along with this however, are a large number of writing and acting issues. With such a large number of underdeveloped characters, names are pretty much luxury. Also, most of the human related humor gags miss badly, which makes it hurt more considering a lot of the characters were unnecessary. Jon Voight's Secretary of Defense character completely baffles me, which makes me think that audiences responded positively to the President in Independence Day doing aerial dogfights. Any positives from the supporting cast (including the strange yet entertaining overacting of John Turturro) are outweighed by the large set of negatives.<br/><br/>However, the cast has got it where it counts. Shia Lebeouf plays an important part in selling the reality of the robots as the lead character Sam, and also carries an easy likability factor. Megan Fox's acting does a reasonable job bringing some interest to her character to beyond her looks. The voice cast also does an overall superb job. Peter Cullen IS Prime, and although his dialogue does border on the ridiculous, he always has a sense of gravity to his lines. Hugo Weaving also does an equally commendable job as Megatron (His booming entrance will forever be embedded into the minds of little kids everywhere). The rest of the transformers don't say much, which is a shame because I wanted to see so much more interplay between them (The taunts that Optimus and Megatron yell as their fighting is great stuff).<br/><br/>Another major gripe I have is Bay's ADD editing. Although it does keep the movie constantly moving, it creates some issues with continuity and distracts from some of the action (probably the biggest crime committed in the movie).<br/><br/>I could go on and on about the good things (Bumblebee, Frenzy) and the bad things (Anthony Anderson and his family, forgotten Barricade) and the downright weird things (Dubya's cameo, Sam's friend climbing in a tree). Overall, the film delivers where it really matters. Although I was disappointed, the amount of potential for the sequel (which just got greenlighted) just gets me giddy (is it too much to ask for a tighter script and better acting?) <br/><br/>(Also, the Autobot Assemble scene is one of the coolest things I've seen in theaters in years.)"

","There is not enough syntax in my own very limited vocabulary that could express just how horrible this film was. Let me be fair by starting off with the fact that I freakin love Transformers. I watched transformers non stop, and then continued on with the series with the whole beast wars bit. The autobots are awesome. Now keeping that in mind, only anyone dumber than a monkey will like this film. There is no glue to hold the film together. Stuff happens without any explanation at all. There are no rules. The only rule is that anything could happen at any point without any explanation for any reason, and you just go along.<br/><br/>Ladies and gentlemen, we have gathered you here because you are the best of the best. You are here to crack this code that no one else could figure out. We have three floors of operatives working on this code and no one has figured it out. We are counting on you.<br/><br/>Hi, I'm the super hot blond girl with the even hotter Australian accent and I know there is only one person who could hack this code. Let me steal this classified material without the slightest of difficulties and bring it to some fat nerd who lives at home with his mom and spends his time playing DDR. Yeah, he'll crack the code.<br/><br/>What?!? <br/><br/>Not only did Bay ask his audience to take huge leaps of faith when watching a movie that was 10,000X more unrealistic than Live Free or Die Hard (which I loved, by the way), but he tops it off with the most ludicrous comedy scenes that only bring the movie down. I mean come on, what was John Turturro thinking when he signed up for this movie? His character is a cheap police knock off who is from Sector 7? Could we be any more less original? <br/><br/>And the writing was soul shattering...but not in the good way. There is a line in the movie where a Sector 7 agent actually said, ""I would be willing to be my ridiculously large government salary that I'm right..."" Or something along those lines. Ugh! Thats not art or cinema or even something out of a story. That's something a quarterback says when he is writing a screen play.<br/><br/>The only thing good about the movie was the special effects. Every action scene with the robots was amazing. <br/><br/>Final Summation....<br/><br/>Visuals and Action- Amazing Dialog- Worse than Roadhouse Plot- Had potential but nothing was explained Context- Terrible and painful<br/><br/>Grade- D-<br/><br/>DO NOT waste your money on this movie."

","What a huge let down! I'm a transformer fan that was hoping to see a cool SCI-FI about the Transformers, but instead I got a dumb slap stick comedy that makes fun of them. This movie has a randomly generated plot that only matches the worst type of teen comedy. I can't even say it was better then Epic Movie. There was even an American Pie rip off moment where the main human characters parents think he locked the door to masturbate. They even go to the levels as to have a transformer pee on someone. Thinking about this movie gives me a headache and based on the ratings and reviews so far I am extremely concerned about where society is going as whole. You will only like this movie if you are a young teen that does not know any better or you are a babbling(typically obnoxious in theaters)idiot.

","Based on the popular toys from the 80s, ""transformers"" tells the story of giant robots from outer space bringing their intergalactic war to Earth. As strange as such a premise might sound, I can imagine a fun action-packed summer movie based it. This is not this movie. <br/><br/>The common wisdom about Michael Bay is that, if his movies are not really masterpieces of storytelling and character development, at least, he can deliver some kick-ass action sequences. ""Transformers"" should put an end to this: inept storytelling and cardboard characters, yes; great action sequences, no! Even though his subject matter is gigantic by nature, Bay insists on keeping his camera close to the ground and to the robots, cutting so fast that the end result is one big ugly visual mess: it's impossible to figure out what's happening as the screen is filled with close-up of scrap metals moving fast. <br/><br/>The rest of the direction is just as incompetent: constant mindless camera move and fast editing in a typical ADD style to make us forget that, most of the time, nothing really interesting happens on the screen. And what about the awkward transitions from broad daylight to night time which occurs not once, but three times in the whole movie! <br/><br/>The script is simply awful, filled with plot holes, stereotypical characters, terrible dialog and ridiculous attempt at humor: the 15-mn scene where the ""cute"" autobots try to hide from the main character's parents in their backyard is simply an embarrassment for anybody past 5-year old. Add to the bad acting, especially by veteran actors who should know better (yes, John Turturro and Jon Voigt, I'm talking about you!). The only one to stand up from this train-wreck is Shia Leboeuf: although his character is the stereotypical awkward teenager found in countless other movies, he manages to make him more sympathetic and a little bit less one-dimensional that it should be. <br/><br/>Otherwise, besides ILM's amazing FX (but who's still impressed by CGI these days), there is not much to recommend about ""transformers"", without any doubt the worst movie I saw at a theater in the last months."

","I have been a fan of the transformers since my childhood, ever since I first saw the robots in action I was awe struck. When i heard that they were going to do live action movie I thought 'Wow, its got to be impossible to get that wrong!' You could be forgiven for thinking that a movie about waring giant robots that transform into various vehicles would be about robots. So I would have to ask where were they?? What were they doing?? In this movie they get very little screen time and even less character development than a dog, which is called 'Mojo' in case you were wondering.<br/><br/>Optimus prime hardly has anything intelligent to say, why they made him into another Lee Evans or even Charlie Chaplin I'll never know, when he does say something intelligent its a huge dramatic speech. By the time he breaks out a speech you are genuinely shocked he's capable of it due to his bumbling foolish mannerism he is presented with.<br/><br/>As if that wasn't bad enough this movie has too many story lines going on at once, which detracts from what should be the main story line of the Transformers themselves. At times it tries to be a teen romantic drama and at others some sort of slapstick comedy movie.<br/><br/>The movies effect are faultless, ILM did a wonderful job. Their effects are the only reason this movie gets anything above a 1. I just wish the same could be said about everyone else involved.<br/><br/>I'm not going to comment upon the acting here as I believe the underlining fault with the movie was with the choice of script and and the direction.<br/><br/>If you MUST see this film, don't worry you can fall asleep and not miss anything. Take someone who will wake you up for the last 20 minutes and you should be happy.

","Okay, i'm 23 years old, pretty well educated in both life and film and have decided to review this is 2 sections:<br/><br/>1) as a transformers fan 2) as a member of public who knows nothing about transformers.<br/><br/>So...<br/><br/>1) Well, This film was always going to be very different from the cartoon. I was just surprised by how little respect Michael Bay clearly has for the original. Read the boards and you will see a list as long as your arm about 'fan boy' faults...Prime has blue flames, jazz acts like he's from the ghetto etc. I won't list the whole list but it's enough to say that Bay probably has NEVER watched a TF cartoon in his life. Another major gripe is there was outrage at the 'non-mass shifting' rule they placed on the robots, meaning Megatron couldn't be a gun, Prime couldn't have a trailer and Soundwave couldn't be a cassette (all would require their sizes to change during transformation), yet the 'allspark' CAN change for seemingly no reason. Hypercrites. <br/><br/>I would rant longer but i don't want to say more than a 1000 words.<br/><br/>2) As a non-fan i found this film RUBBISH. Bay cannot direct. The simplest rules of directing seem unheard of to him, as one meaningless action scene blends into another, followed by 10 minute scenes of tanks, planes or other military hardware. The humour is well, not funny and the script badly written. The actors try but really can't do much with this rubbish, filled with plot holes big enough for unicron to fall through. A word for the visuals as well - rushed. Each battle scene is so shaky and unfocused that i couldn't physically watch the screen most of the time. I felt nothing for any of the characters and left the cinema wondering why i'd wasted my time on this pap.<br/><br/>1/10"
"darthheimdall","1","91","150","11 July 2007"," Biggest disappointment of the year
","I loved the cartoon series as a kid and, after seeing the commercials, thought it would be freaking awesome. Instead, I wound up stuck in a movie with a ridiculous plot, too many irrelevant characters, and too much sex humor for a movie that is supposed to be about giant robots wailing on each other (I am in my twenties and male, so I can hardly be considered a prude. The fact that even I cringed at the mother making masturbation jokes means that there is such a thing as a limit for that sort of humor). Most of the Transformers do not even show up until the movie is halfway over. The subplot of the signal detection team (who did nothing except point out that some alien being had hacked the network-a no-brainer) could be cut without losing anything of note (except for the funny scene where Anthony Anderson's on-screen cousin gets tackled by the FBI agent into the pool). And what's with Bumblebee pissing on the FBI Agent, and Mikaela making him take his clothes off? The action scenes are stellar, but not enough to make up for all of the other mistakes in the movie. If you copy and pasted scenes from Independence Day, Matrix Revolutions, a bunch of US air force commercials and Bad Santa all together on your computer, you would wind up with basically the same mess."

You don't expect such shows to be long on plot, character development, etc, and it wasn't. But Bay has pulled off the impossible: he has created a big-budget, 2 1/2-hour feature film that is actually MORE simplistic than the original source material. Well done, Mike.<br/><br/>Optimus Prime is the only Transformer with a personality of his own. He spends most of his time over-doing the messiah bit; seems like he's conspicuously proclaiming his willingness to ""sacrifice himself"" every three or four minutes. The rest of them, Autobots and Decepticons alike, have completely interchangeable personalities; you can't tell them apart by the way they act (except for the horribly, unnecessarily stereotyped Jazz), and you CERTAINLY can't tell them apart by the way they look--one walking pile of tires and hoses looks much like another.<br/><br/>All Bay had to do was keep it simple. But, of course, he failed. He utilized a completely ridiculous ensemble cast of characters, with new ones being introduced right up until the last quarter or so of the movie. Air Force combat controllers, hormonal high school students, chubby computer hackers, shadowy government agents, public officials, and many other pointless characters stagger across the screen bumping into each other, stealing each other's lines and cluttering up the screen.<br/><br/>The story moves at a ridiculous pace--close to an hour goes by before we see any real Autobot v. Decepticon action. It's hinted (but never actually said) that Megatron is more powerful and fearsome than the other Transformers. So he shows up in the last five minutes and is killed, almost as an afterthought, by a sixteen year old.<br/><br/>The special effects are, of course, good, but everything else in this screaming disappointment of a movie is a complete failure."

","I've seen probably close to 1,000 movies at the theater, including every single major release over the past 15+ years. I've seen crowds get up and leave after 10 minutes. I've seen crowds all jump and scream at the most frightening of scenes. I've seen crowds cry together.<br/><br/>Transformers took me back to the re-release of Star Wars: A New Hope back in the 90s, and then went much further. From the start of the movie the entire theater here in San Antonio got very involved. Clapping, cheering, and even a bit of hooting were commonplace throughout the film.<br/><br/>First, let me tell you who carried this film: The Robots and Shia Lebouf. Of course the Autobots were the main attraction, but they went well beyond that by being absolutely stunning. When Blackout lands at Soccent Forward AFB in Qatar, gasps were heard throughout the theater. I found myself literally in awe just staring at him every chance I could get, unfortunately causing me to miss a good bit of what else was going on.<br/><br/>Shia Lebouf did a wonderful job of playing an awkward teenage boy from start to finish. His first speech in class trying to hock his Grandfather's valuables was disconcerting to someone like me who treasures their family, but very understandable. I was a teenager once and remember quite well that I'd have done just about anything to buy my first car! In one of his final scenes, when he's on top of the building, cornered hanging off of a statue and Megatron on the verge of fulfilling his hunt for the AllSpark, he seemed very genuinely scared and yet steadfast in his desire to do the right thing.<br/><br/>And if it is possible to put humanity in a digital robotic creation of ILM, they accomplished it with Bumblebee. Not only was his humor poignant and sly, but very heartwarming. If you could believe that your car loved you back, Bumblebee could pull it off.<br/><br/>For those of you who are hardcore ""old school"" fans of the series and looking for your goodies, you will not be disappointed. From Shia's nervous flirtation with Fox (good name for her!) that leads to him explaining that he's ""More than meets the eye"" to many of the lines directly from the original series and movie, Michael Bay didn't let you down.<br/><br/>This is the first movie in years I've been able to give a 10/10 rating. I've read several other reviews already, some very disparaging, and I have to say this: Send a 10 year old to review Sense & Sensibility and you're most likely going to get a very nasty review. Don't send 60 year old know-it-all movie critics to review this for you, because those that actually go see it will most likely never agree with them and get nothing from your ""reporting""."
"isamu20002002","1","63","102","11 August 2007"," Never again!!!
","After having been forced to watch ""Pearl Harbor"" a couple of years ago (and for my memory's sake I wish it was 50 years ago) I promised myself to never go see a Michael Bay movie again. However, a friend of mine tried to convince me that ""Transformers"" might be worth an attempt, based on the fact that a non-history related, action-packed comic-and-toy-franchise-adaption might be a fitting theme for a megalomaniac director like Bay. Even the critics who booed ""Pearl Harbor"" back then said that Bay had finally found his genre, and that ""Transformers"" was indeed an enjoyable popcorn movie. So my buddy and me went to the cinema.... and I painfully realized I should have stuck to my promise!!! I'm still looking for negative superlatives to describe the movie, because ""awful"", ""horrible"", ""worst movie ever"" and ""complete waste of time and brain cells"" just don't quite say it.<br/><br/>I don't know where to begin... well, let's start with the overall impression of the director's ""efforts"". I had the feeling of watching not an entire movie, but a line up of trailers from different genres. Bay was genre-hopping from infantile American Pie-like humor (pretty much every scene with Sam, his parents and the girl) to cheesy drama (when Bumblebee gets caught) and last but not least to horrifyingly pathetic gung ho heroism made in the U.S.A.! And it went back and forth all through the movie without the slightest attempt to get these connected in a bearable manner. Every single scene felt completely out of place due to the previous and following one. Screenplay and editing were virtually non-existent.<br/><br/>The characters (be it human or Transformer) were all totally mundane, archetypal in a horrible way and completely cliché-dominated. My heart bled when I saw John Turturro embarrassing himself with this joke of a character. But it's not the actors' fault that the characters came out so thin. Given the screenplay I would say that the Teletubbies would have been the most appropriate cast for both the protagonists and the villains.<br/><br/>The effects were top notch, yes, but nowadays that's not an achievement anymore, is it? Especially not if you can afford to hire the most expensive FX Company in the world. And still Bay manages to spoil the action by shooting it so fast, that it was almost impossible to see any details. Pretty much all the robot fights were one big blur on the screen - which is far away from what I call enjoyable special effects.<br/><br/>One last point of criticism before I come to my destructive conclusion for this flick: Subtlety! That's what Bay needs to learn (among a lot of other things)! Subtlety! You just can't go over the top for 140 minutes straight! Not even in an action-packed SF robot whatever movie. It's simply too much! So far every single Michael Bay movie I had to endure felt like a bad stimulus satiation. This isn't film-making, this is cheap grandstanding for big business.<br/><br/>Summary for ""Transformers"": The latest and saddest proof that talent is no longer of any value in blockbuster Hollywood. Not sure exactly how high the production costs were (probably once again the highest in Hollywood history so far) but as far as I am concerned every single dollar was wasted in this project. I can only advise you to keep the money and spare yourself the brain damage. I have definitely drawn my conclusion from this and will never watch a Michael Bay movie again."

"bh_tafe3","9","20","29","18 September 2012"," My childhood up on screen....sort of
","For me just hearing the words ""Autobot"" and ""Decepticon"" brings back so many childhood memories. I was a massive fan of the G1 cartoons (never watched any of the spin-offs) and the Marvel comic books from the UK and US. The cartoon appealed to me as a child, while the comics took the mythos deeper in my teenage years with cosmic battles between Gods, a yin/ yang conversation regarding why certain Transformers are inherently good or evil. It was cracking stuff and it was with a lot of excitement that I greeted news of a new big budget movie.<br/><br/>Transformers (2007) delivered! OK, so they fiddled with the origin story a little bit, but so do most of the different versions of the show. I thought they got the major characters spot on. Optimus, Bumblebee, Megatron and Starscream were all the same characters as in the TV show and comics. I really liked the fact that Bumblebee could only communicate through radio signals, and, after the execrable scene introducing the minor autobot characters and Optimus Prime's various sermons, really wish that had been the case for all of the autobots. The decepticons are far more interesting, though we see nowhere near enough of Starscream. Megatron and Soundwave are both effective and the best realised characterisations in the film.<br/><br/>The humans in the story all do a good job. Shia Lebeouf had not yet been over exposed, and is actually quite entertaining as Spike. Megan Fox was a smoking hot brunette bombshell, still playing a stereotype (hot girl with a blokey hobby who deep down just wants to fit in), but at least not a damsel in distress as we typically see in these films. Spike's parents are awkward, but funny. John Turtorro's character seems to have accidentally stumbled into this film during a coffee break from a Coen brothers film. He seems like he has something much more interesting to do in an edgier film than this one. But his presence, while out of place, is welcome.<br/><br/>My big complaint with this is that the the film, after doing a nice job of setting up for a finale, seems to go in light speed in its last twenty minutes. It's often difficult to tell who's fighting who. There's also a death scene that we are supposed to feel sad about, involving a character who's been in a handful of scenes, and had a maximum of two lines of clichéd stereotyped dialogue. The resolution is neat and sets up well for a sequel. Overall, this was a reasonably faithful big screen portrayal of the characters I loved growing up, if not the story. The arrival sequence, and Armageddon-ish soundtrack are both breathtaking and really hammer home a sense of awe and wonder as the Autobots arrive. The awkward attempts by Prime to communicate with humanity are funny. The human characters, apart from Turtorro (who acts like no human I've ever met) all seem to react to the Transformers and their war in the way a normal human being would react. It is a very different back story and beloved elements like the Autobot and decepticons Volcano and underwater bases are lost. But what's left is a the characters we love fighting out the same war, in a way a new generation will find accessible, and didn't alienate me, well not in this original version anyway. I am more than happy to share Optimus, Megatron and Bumblebee with a new generation of fans."

","And drive he does as Michael Bay translates the Transformers world of animation and toys to the big screen.<br/><br/>But before I get ahead of myself I have to admit I never watched even a single episode growing up. I had just hit high school and I wasn't interested. So there wasn't any real baggage involved either side of the coin.<br/><br/>Yet there I sat in the first public screening anywhere on the planet (June 12th in Sydney, Australia, with Michael Bay introducing it) and it just overwhelmed me and everyone else! There was never a dull moment, the script flowed easily, the acting was first-rate and the seamlessness of the CGI and live action was taken to another level.<br/><br/>It's going to be the hit of the summer and was better than any of the big third installment trilogies I have just also seen. And I love each of those franchises.<br/><br/>Congratulations on a movie that not only met expectations but exceeded them."

","No, it is not a smart movie, or a well written one, but this movie certainly has it's goods, and one can hardly deny it is fairly entertaining.<br/><br/>The goods were pretty obvious. Stunning visuals, brilliant editing, mind-blowing set pieces, say about mister Bay what you will, he has always had an eye for the visual. And this is an absolute plus to all his work, basically. But we can also state that Bay's previous work, with a few exception, was nonetheless fairly disappointing. Transformers went further than just the visual shebang.<br/><br/>The movie had a good sense of humor too. It was clear that everyone knew that one can hardly take a few car robots seriously, and so no one didn't. Which is a good thing. It made the movie one hell of a lot funnier. The actor's were cool too. Shia LaBouf is a great lead role, John Turturro, John Voight, Anthony Anders and others had really cool side roles, and they made the movie worthwhile.<br/><br/>The only downs were the ridiculousness that often crawled onto the screen, of course fault to the slightly preposterous script. Usually I cringe with issues like these, but aforementioned points somehow made the movie awfully amusing. A great watch, especially in the cinemas, but maybe somewhat less entertaining to watch on a TV. be warned"

","I always liked Transformers, and this movie was one of my must-see-this-year, I really wanted to see this one so, but now Im now I just want to forget it.<br/><br/>The movie is full of incomplete scenes and things that don't have anything to do with the rest of the movie at all. And all the obvious product placement scenes made it look like long commercial some times.<br/><br/>The camera angel was just awful and painful to see, unnecessary zooms and when somebody is running it shakes like a earthquake and you can't see the person is running in a forest or a city.<br/><br/>The animation scenes was quite okay, but when people was running throughout the Transformers, I became frustrated, but when they ran throughout the broken lamp post I almost ran out.<br/><br/>I had hoped for a more serious movie but, when I laugh it wasn't for the jokes but for how bad the movie was.<br/><br/>So to end this, I think you should watch the previews and trailers instead they were much better and cheaper.

","*SPOILER WARNING <br/><br/>I walked into Transformers with drastically lowered expectations. With such low expectations I could almost enjoy Fantastic Four. Sadly, Transformers fell below the bar considerably. I understand that story takes a back seat in a film of this nature, but did they have to drag it behind the chariot over a street laden with potholes and speed bumps? Overly long scenes that attempted humor were nothing more than filler for Michael Bay's inept storytelling ability. Every authority figure was treated as a complete moron, the only plot device Bay knows.<br/><br/>There was also a useless scene featuring an obscured view of George Bush asking for some Hostess Ding-Dongs, used as a bridge to show us the covert ops boombox robot hack Air Force 1 computer systems from the storage area. What? Huh? Yeah, I didn't get it either.<br/><br/>'Transformers' has a lot of bark, but no bite. The action scenes were heavily edited so as not to let us really sink our teeth into them. I wanted to see Bublebee trash Barricade. I wanted to see Prime get in some shots at Megatron instead of getting his trasmission handed to him. I don't care if Sam's parents are overbearing. Nothing in the movie adds to anyone's character arc. The only cool things about this movie are: The Bumblebee/Barricade chase (which wasn't even CGI), and the...wait, I can't think of anything else that was cool. Bay teases us cruelly with dramatic tension, then lets it fall flat by skipping what could have been the best part of the scene and giving us the results instead. He forgets that 'Transformers' is about gigantic robots in knock-down drag-out fights for the fate of humanity and themselves. The battle seemed only for the fate of the editing room under the crushing weight of the ego-maniacal director.<br/><br/>The Prime-Megatron fight started out to be the most awesome moment ever. ""One shall stand, one shall fall."" says Optimus in a classic moment, as we cut to Sam running around and his girlfriend towing Bumblebee before cutting back to see Optimus defeated and Sam killing Megatron. What? Huh? Yeah, didn't think it could get worse, did ya? *END SPOILERS* The special effects were abused horribly. I was cheated. This movie doesn't deserve the high rating it is getting. Probably due to Dreamworks shilling the vote system. I wouldn't be surprised. Hopefully people pick their brains out of the trash can once they've seen the movie and give it the 4 or less it really deserves. This movie does nothing more than to prove that Spielberg's Hollywood no longer cares. ADHD directors like Michael Bay should be blackballed. Hollywood should just die and let the knowledgeable independent filmmakers to rule, so that maybe yet again we can have movies of substance instead of bankrolls.<br/><br/>Skip this monstrosity of a film. And pray that a new director can be hired if they make a sequel. Heck, I'd even settle for Brett Ratner."
"Al_The_Strange","9","16","23","4 July 2011"," ""I bought a car. It turned out to be an alien robot. Who knew?""
","At the release of this film, 21 years have passed since the animated film came out. In all that time, we've seen two decades worth of cheesy action films, spirited adventures, imaginative sci-fi, and immense special-effects development. And with director Michael Bay fine-tuning his larger-than-life work style and sense of grandeur, it seems that cinematic fate has cumulated in the creation of this epic film. For fans of the classic cartoons or modern action junkies, the film delivers all the way; the action starts off strong and intense, and hardly lets up. Some scenes are quite awe-inspiring; the opening base attack, the highway chase, the city battle are among the best action scenes in any film. The scope and scale is impressive. The pacing is relentlessly fast. The humor is genuinely amusing and helps keep things light and fresh. It's every bit as big, original, and entertaining as some of the best blockbusters out there, and I think one would be hard-pressed to be bored by it.<br/><br/>The story for this could probably be picked apart easily by the most critical viewers (it's especially odd seeing a number of scenes turning from day to night in a matter of seconds). But if you're able and willing to forgive the film for its faults, it is a decently-structured plot with a fine cast of characters. It's pretty fun watching the film kick off with the relationship between a boy and his car; but heck, intergalactic robot war is pretty fun too.<br/><br/>The film has awesome photography; there must be thousands of gorgeous postcard-worthy shots throughout. Some scenes are a little shaky and editing is pretty darn fast; it might be a major turn-off for some folks, and I do believe it does make the actual transformers harder to see. But it is still mostly coherent, and helps keep the pacing up. Acting iswhat it is. Shia LaBeouf borders on being annoying, but for his character it's fitting. Megan Fox is a little iffy in this role, but she is a looker. I enjoy Josh Duhamel in his role; Tyrese Gibson and Zack Ward are pretty fun in their parts. I didn't like John Turturro at first, but he grew on me. And of course, the voice-acting (including the talents of Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving) is great. Production value is insanely high, featuring top-notch sets, props, costumes, and special effects; it's also noteworthy for implementing a huge amount of authentic military hardware and real soldiers in action. Music is pretty darn cool too.<br/><br/>Recommended! 4.5/5 (entertainment: 5/5, story: 4/5, film: 4/5)"

","Well, lets start off with the critics. People say that the movie lacks plot. Plot. What plot? It's an ACTION movie built around Sci-Fi CG. Since when do these need a plot?<br/><br/>Next step is the 'dirty-stupid TEENAGER humour'. Yes indeed - loads of it. But hey, haven't you all guru people ever wanted to go back to your younger years and do something unspeakably cheesy? Not that the movie is a masterpiece prank, but look around you - teenagers conquering the internet with their testosterone-filled jokes and nobody saying a word about it. I agree, the humour is rather teenage for some veteran viewers, but are such people numerous? No. The jokes are not that astronomically stupid and do actually crack a laugh. Some people even said ""oh god, half of the theatre was laughing, it was so horrible"". And what's bad in that, huh? The jokes aren't that bad if YOU don't like them and a dozen of people do. I'm not even mentioning the ""mastrubation"" and ""pee"" moments. Many said these were awful moments of the movie. Oh...so sad :)<br/><br/>And the third most criticized part is bad acting. Well, yes, I wouldn't call the acting superb or anything (except, of course, Shia LaBeouf), but yet again: this is ACTION. Who cares what's the plot and the caliber of the actors. They did perfectly fine to complement the robots. Of course, some say that the robot part is done badly, but that may be true only for the fans of the original movies and toons. For the bulk - it is a completely new experience that can even lead to digging up the...hmm...Hasbro toys.<br/><br/>Now let's get to the fun part. The visuals are impressive, the action is even more impressive...and...well that's it. Aside of the movie being a bit too long, you get a great action-packed Sci-Fi effects galore, which is easy to watch, entertaining and fast-flowing. Most of the ""1"" ratings grow out of the high expectations around this movie. In reality, people shouldn't expect a classic or anything. Transformers is not Star Wars, folks, its a waaaaay smaller universe.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you don't expect that lot out of it, it turns out to be a pretty nice package of this and that. ALL the critics are right, yes. But hell, the move is fantastic! I am by no means sorry to have spent my money to watch it on the big screen. 10\10!"

","After a series of disappointments this summer (Spidey 3, Pirates 3, FF2) I was not massively optimistic about this one, especially given the involvement of Michael Bay, despite the decent advance press I'd seen. Well, how wrong was I? This movie absolutely nails it, Bay does a terrific job, Shia LaBeouf is superb, the script is (deliberately) hilarious and the robotsahh, the robots! They're uniformly magnificent, setting a new high-water mark for CGI, and adding everything that they should to this thrill-ride. Speaking as a Transformers G1 toy geek (I can freely quote the mottos from the little stats card that was on the boxes  and Megatron was my favourite) I am totally at ease with the design and vehicle changes that have been made  movies are not toys and it isn't the 80s.

","Okay, as those who have seen the trailers will figure, the CG is pretty much the cornerstone of this movie. While it probably will blow you away, the novelty eventually wears off and then you wonder: hey, where did the plot go?! But then your attention is quickly drawn back by a giant robot slamming into an office block - or a wonderfully shot car chase; probably some of the most impressive action sequences to ever grace the silver screen.<br/><br/>A hefty dose of cheese seems to have been added to the movie, but most of it can be laughed off. One particular scene was reminiscent of the fighter jet in the movie Stealth downloading songs off the internet. A few loose ends in the thin story probably suggest a sequel is coming - but how can anyone have a problem with that! It has its laughs (even if some are cheap) but the 2.5 hours go fast; I'm sure most people will leave the cinema on a high note. Hopefully this movie gets Bay the credit The Island didn't.<br/><br/>And a postscript for hardcore Transformers geeks: go with your expectations at your ankles because you're probably going to cringe when something isn't as it should be (although even a minor fan like myself noticed a lack of original transformation noises). But on the whole this movie has plenty more to offer, and appeals to many more people."

","I watched this film at an advanced screening in New Zealand. I loved Transformers as a child, but was not a die hard fan, so I did not complain over the changes. However, I had decent expectations for this movie as people were saying it's better than expected.<br/><br/>I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. However, it did fall a little flat on what I expected it to be. It's Michael Bay, ladies and gents, don't expect anything more.<br/><br/>Transformers begins with the reason for the alien robots' existence. How the all important AllSpark (essentially the life giver) was lost into the vacuum of space after the robots divided between good and evil. Falling onto Earth, a handful of these entities travelled the galaxy to find this all important device. Great premise, but how about the execution? Visually, the film is astounding. ILM have outdone themselves once again and have created top notch visuals for others to measure up to. The robots look real, feel weighty yet elegant, and with every Bay movie, there are explosions. And what beautiful explosions they are. This is complemented with a hit-and-miss musical score. At times, the score is cinematic brilliance. At other times, you wonder why Linkin Park was included, when sequences with emotional pieces are suddenly juxtaposed with the current Billboard Hot 100.<br/><br/>The acting is competent. I thought that with a cast mostly compromised of underwear models and hip hop artists, I would be disappointed. Shia LaBeouf (Sam Witwicky), Josh Duhamel (Cpt. Lennox), Tyrese Gibson (Sgt. Epps), and even Megan Fox (Mikaela) delivered surprisingly well. Even with Jon Voigt in the cast, you cannot see a distinct line in ability between the seasoned vet and relative new comers. But although the acting was top notch, it was severely hampered by the script.<br/><br/>The script, to put it frankly, does not take itself seriously. At all. Firstly, there was a lack of story. Autobots and Decepticons want the AllSpark. One wants to defend it. The other wants to use it. Battle. Fin. Secondly, I could not remember one scene that did not have some humorous one liner put in to make the audience laugh. Even in the most grave of sequences, did some joker blurt out something (admittedly) funny, making you wonder ""Wait.... Earth's in danger, and you're cuing for a crash on the drums?!"" Some of the script was clever, and in the parts which were appropriately funny, hit the nail on the head (Shia LaBeouf is a child prodigy in comedy).<br/><br/>Transformers. Everyone wants to know ""What about the Transformers?"". Well, personally, they were simply awesome. They could have been more 2D than they were and I still would have liked them. Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Jazz, Frenzy, Ratchet... Megatron, Starscream, Bonecrusher, Barricade and Ironhide -- they were masterfully put on film.<br/><br/>However, only two of those actually got a decent amount of character development -- Bumblebee and Optimus Prime. Bumblebee, being the first Transformer Sam sees, and Optimus, of course gets plenty of screen time being the Autobot leader. It's a shame that the Decepticons were only there to be the ""bad guys"", even Megatron. It would have definitely benefited the movie if all the robots were fleshed out and given some emotional attachment to the crowd. It doesn't, and this does have a few repercussions towards the end of the movie. Nevertheless, it was enjoyable to see them wreak havoc in different countries, and with the inevitable sequel, one can only hope that we get to know more about these ""loveable"" mechanical beings.<br/><br/>It is definitely the must see summer flick of the year, and whilst not Oscar material, it is one of the best 'popcorn' movies of recent times.<br/><br/>7.5/10<br/><br/>**Upon a second screening, I found the impact of the movie to remain just the same as the first. In certain aspects, that impact heightened. New score 8/10"

","Let me first start by saying that I know absolutely nothing about Transformers, which may be part of the reason why I gave this such a low ranking. I have no in-depth analysis of this movie, because I just couldn't bring myself to pay that much attention to it.<br/><br/>This movie was amusingly funny, though not always in a good way. Some parts were actually funny, and many others were the kind of cheesy hero lines that sounded like they came straight out of an episode of Power Rangers (""Bumblebee was a brave soldier. His death will have been in vain if we cannot destroy the Allspark and stop Megatron""). It probably would have helped if I knew what to expect. The way everyone was talking about the movie, I thought I was about to see something really cool. But while the graphics were very good, the rest of the movie just didn't live up to expectations at all. There is a plot, which was good, but I found it to be extremely shallow, not pieced together or explained very well. And very long. With 2 hours 35 minutes runtime, my attention span was long gone by the time Optimus Prime showed up.<br/><br/>This movie was okay for a one-time thing, but I don't plan on ever seeing it again.

It was like they couldn't be bothered to write dialogue, so they made the robots mostly mute, and tried to fill time with lame sub-plots like the army guy trying to get home to see his daughter. Seriously, any jerk can try to pull you in with cheap sentimentality, but it is pretty obvious that Michael Bay couldn't make a movie with anything resembling real emotion or dialogue if his life depended on it. With this movie, Bay has solidified his position as the worst director of our generation. I would rather watch two hours of security camera footage of a garbage dump that watch this movie again."

","Michael Bay doesn't disappointed us. I've seen Transformers in a press screening today, and I'm under the film's impression right now. The robots are cool as much as they can be. Bay's vision about the cult-comic and animation of the eighties has become one of the greatest effect-movie of all time. However I must disapprove that the Decepticons lost their personality, they're just mainly destroying and killing machines, Megatron and Starscream are more complex characters like they're featured in the movie. But I don't want to tease. Spielberg and Bay has created a gigantic, spectacular and funny summer blockbuster movie, that the sequel manufacturer studios can consider as an example. So, Transformers is more than meets the eye! And by the way OPTIMUS RULES!!!!"
"Polaris_DiB","3","25","40","1 October 2007"," Giant robots standing around looking impressive does not count as action.
","Boredom isn't an argument, it's a complaint. Because of this fact, I try to avoid using the term ""boring"" to describe any movie, no matter how boring it is, instead searching for some better way of criticizing it. However, I think there's no other real way to express it this time: Transformers is a very boring movie. Here's why.<br/><br/>I went to the movie theatre to see giant robots fighting each other! Yeah, I got some of that... maybe about 25 minutes of it all told in a movie that was two hours and twenty minutes long! The rest of this behemoth was filled with scene after inconsequential scene of not much happening except the following three types of dialog:<br/><br/>1) The characters trying to be characters. I.e., Shia LeBeouf: ""I want a car! This is my car! My car is an alien robot! Car car car! Worry about my car! What should I do about my car? I just wanted a car!"" Jon Voight: ""What is this, Chinese? Korean? Iraqi? Afghanistani? What? How should we deal with this? What is it? Why do I know nothing of this?"" Optimus Prime: ""We're here to fight for the human race, which has a choice, and that choice is a freedom, and there must be sacrifice, and, and, well, we're not much better race either!"" Jon Turturro: ""I can tell I'm a completely useless character, so I'm just gonna be a jerk until I'm supposed to be a friend, or something! It's all because I have power because I have a badge!""<br/><br/>2) Self reflexive junk: ""This is 100 times better than Armageddon!"" (Hey Mike? None of us remember that POS movie. You could at least have said ""The Rock"" or, if you were more daring, a recently released movie from a different studio, perhaps.)<br/><br/>3) Ill-fitted and awkwardly random social awareness: ""I'm willing to bet my ridiculous government salary that..."" ""I'm sure if anything was going on, the government would tell us, right? Right? Hint hint hint!"" <br/><br/>All of these things would have been at least a little fun if there was any amount of intelligence or wit behind it, but most of these moments are simply shoved into a giant, glurgy sentiment that goes on literally for hours with only the occasional transformation or rifle burst to keep interest. The apotheosis of this approach has its form in the scene in Sam Wicwicky's bedroom, where a relatively simple scene of him trying to find his grandfather's glasses turns into a twenty-minute bumbling session involving stupid parents talking about masturbation and earthquakes, stupid robots destroying a yard for no reason but to be funny, and way too much of Shia LeBeouf yelling at both of them. By the time that scene alone is over, Transformers has already lost a huge amount of momentum. It doesn't really pick up after that, and it's still a good half an hour before the final battle scene takes place.<br/><br/>Michael Bay seems to have lost something, somewhere. Not that he was ever the greatest director in the first place, but at least one could depend on him for some action. This movie just doesn't have it. It has no suspense. Whenever things finally do get going, Bay seems to prefer to cut to a character worrying over something else, which ruins the moment. Hell, half the time the movie goes back and forth between night and day as if the average earth day is about three hours in length! The directing is lazy, the dialog is poor, and even the good actors have a difficult time truly making their characters seem zany or even interesting. <br/><br/>The really bad part is how most of the action is resolved. The little spy robot thing that follows everyone around? Accidentally knocks its own head off. The defeat of Megatron? Accidentally activating the Cube... Oh, so that's all that had to be done? Great, let's go home now. And how does that have anything to do with ""sacrifice""? And why do we need a grandiose speech by Optimus Prime about how, like, humanity has hope or some crap like that?<br/><br/>Forget it. This would have been a perfectly reasonable 45 minute movie, maybe stretched out to an hour fifteen for good measure. Instead it was two hours of painfully dull and unimportant crap with only just enough action to even claim that a giant robot war was all it was about. It's a pretty bad sign when I'm more interested in cleaning my nails than paying attention to whatever other character happens to be introduced for little purpose than to add yet another flat-trying-to-be-funny voice into the mix.<br/><br/>I saw this movie in second-run because I didn't want to risk nine bucks on it. Even after that, I STILL want my $1.25 back. I've already run into some trouble when talking about this movie to some of my friends. ""You're over-thinking it, it's supposed to be fun!"" Yeah, that's my point: I was disappointed in a movie about giant robots fighting each other. How can a movie about that not be fun? Bay somehow managed<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

Why do small robots act like gremlins? (from the movie gremlins that is) 7. How can a robot from another planet know when you plan to buy a used car? 8. Do used cars come with some kind of papers (previous owners, registration plates, etc)? 9. What can a robot gain by hooking up two teenagers? 10. Can a teenager out run a robot that can change himself into a car? 11. Can a teenager defeat a robot in hand to hand combat if the robot previously killed loads of air force 1 security team members? 12. If you where frozen on North Pole years before 1897 (there was no radio or TV stations back then and certainly there was no Internet) how is it possible that you can speak fluent English upon your unfreezing? 13.

But then something happened, and quite rightly as another user has stated, it starts a down hill spiral.<br/><br/>It's quite obvious why this one was released for independence day. It has all the elements. .ludicrous plot, abominable script, lots of things blowing up with sparks and fireworks. Those, and the usual actors thrown in to do nothing more than show a comedic face while performing some antic in the film purely to raise the laughter bar.<br/><br/>I know that this was an adaptation, I know that it was not meant to be taken seriously; unfortunately the film makers are asking me to deal with two different kinds of movie here. The first, a semi serious military campaign going badly wrong with Robot invasion. The second, little Johnny and potential love interest counterpart have to save the world from evil robot dominance; they do this after the robots suss out who they are courtesy of ebay and with a succession of ridiculous and badly staged situational hazards.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but no amount of special effects or large robots rolling around in the air and into each other can save something that was conceived on Stifflers homework paper.<br/><br/>I lost respect for this film the moment it turned into something that pubescent teens would find wildly entertaining.<br/><br/>""Bros not Ho's man!""

","It was incredible to see the Transformers come to life. I can't wait until the next one comes out in 2009. The last movie that just left me talking to myself as I was exiting from the theater was probably the first X-men movie. This movie was even better for me than X-men was because of growing up watching the Transformers cartoon every afternoon. The greatest part of the movie for me was after the Autobots assembled together just like in the old days of watching the cartoon when Optimus Prime gave that famous command ""Autobots roll out"". I almost fell on the floor after that it was awesome. Of course it was almost as great when Megatron yelled at StarScream for screwing up the mission again. Well, if you haven't seen the movie and you enjoyed it as a kid like i did you will probably come away from the movie as I did. That is in amazement. Also, don't worry about the people slamming the movie for bad dialog. That is what the Star Wars movies were slammed for from critics time after time and Star Wars survived just fine. I am not putting this movie that high on my list because that would be unfair. I can however see this series of movies as I have already heard that they will make a trilogy out of it. I can see this trilogy being almost if not better than the X-men movies.

"mickran","1","37","63","8 October 2007"," The Worst Film Ever Made
","""The Worst Film Ever Made"" was a previous title I held for another Michael Bay film Armageddon. I'm not a fan of his movies but I was however willing to give this movie a chance as it looked like fun. I was never a fan of the original cartoon as I was too old at the time but I did see and enjoy the carton Movie in 1996. I'm aware that Transformers is a summer blockbuster and is supposed to be lighthearted fun so I can forgive it the terrible and clichéd romance between the beauty and the geek and the many corny lines but it kept throwing so many curve balls my way I couldn't ignore the many flaws and eventually I switched off the DVD. I neither know, nor care, how it ended. Why do I think it was so bad? There is the complete absence of a story. Robots come to earth and fight, the end. The acting went from mediocre to bad. When the robots are finally introduced the movie changes tone from semi serious mood to wise cracking silly antics  jarringly. The various Transformers are introduced in a sloppy, and anything but memorable manner, which shows what a clumsy director Michael Bay is. The robots themselves are badly designed and 'transform' in an abstract blur of fancy CGI only to distract that there is no cohesive design  there is a truck, spinning CGI, then there is a robot, they do not actually transform at all. The cheap plastic toys you could get in the 80s were more impressively designed. The flashy but inadequate robot design meant the fight sequences were an unchoreographed mess that completely lacked tension. On top of that there is a shocking approach to casual violence which is surprising considering Steven Spielberg's recent outburst against violence on TV. A man is flicked aside against a car which would obviously kill him for a throw away gag. A building is ripped through by two fighting robots as you see people running around on the various floors before they die. I'm guessing Bay thought it would be clever to see such detail but I felt it was gratuitous and sickening. Other utterly ridiculous ideas are weak but when the giant pyramid of Giza size cube folds itself up into a Rubix cube size key ornament my common sense just wanted to bail out of the movie altogether. I know it's only a movie and I shouldn't even be thinking about physics, I know the average age watching the movie wouldn't be bothered, and I'm no science geek but it is just so impossible for that much mass to disappear and I just had to laugh at the concept. The robots have such little 'humanity' in their personalities that during the 'death sequence' I really couldn't have cared less. At the final fight sequence I was so bored, as I said earlier, I just switched off the DVD and went to bed. The Worst FIlm Ever Made isn't hyperbole, Michael Bay worked hard to earn that credit."
"rwh58682","3","20","32","9 August 2007"," Garbage -- Michael Bay never fails to disappoint
","After seeing this movie, I am compelled to write a review...<br/><br/>This movie is riddled with clichés, gratuitous clips of Ms. Fox, ridiculously conceived plot lines, and not to mention bad acting...<br/><br/>The fight scenes are nearly impossible to follow due to their speed and the complexity of the Transformers' bodies. Moreover, the most important and final fight scene -- Megatron versus Optimus Prime -- only lasts 30 seconds at most. It's a complete let down. <br/><br/>Michael Bay would not have a career if Americans had any taste.<br/><br/>The only saving grace of this film was Peter Cullen's voice work for Optimus Prime."
"p_jones92","5","15","23","14 October 2007"," Hold your horses people, this has not lived up to the hype
","OK, OK, can all the fanboys just get a hold of themselves for a second and not overhype this movie and give it a high rating on here.<br/><br/>Now, I was an 80's child, so I understand all the nostalgia and was a fan of the cartoon series, so yes I was eagerly anticipating this, and the trailer did rock, and rock hard, and promised so much.<br/><br/>One thing the trailer didn't do was let on that the Transformers spoke and had moving lips, of which there was much debate during production on whether the transformers should have lips or not. They plumped with should, when hindsight shows they shouldn't.<br/><br/>The movie starts nice enough, and Shia is definitely watchable and likable and the introduction to Bumblee is nice enough, if a little cheesy with the whole music thing. The problem though is that it then quickly turns into some sort of comedic farce movie, I mean once all the Transformers reveal themselves to Shia's character, it's a bit of a joke, especially that whole homeboy street routine for Frenzy, WTF man, way to be stereotypical. And the whole hiding from the Mom & Dad routine? They're four 20ft robots, and the ground shakes when they walk, how did the parents NOT notice them, come on man!<br/><br/>The whole plot is pretty weak, mystic talisman, maps on ancient glasses? And John Turturro, I love you brother, but what the hell do you call that, acting? Were you deliberately trying to get a Razzie nomination?<br/><br/>Some of the set pieces are nice, Scorponocks entry particularly, but the main problem is that the action scenes are so fast and dizzying, you don't really get a chance to check out the cool transformation from car to Bumblebee, or truck to Optimus or whatever, it's really just a blur, when it's actually the coolest bit. The intro's to the fight scenes are pretty cool with their whole rock music kick off, but then the actions is so fast you're not sure whose hitting who with what and where, it's just a big mangled mesh of metal.<br/><br/>I left this movie really disappointed, it doesn't live up to the hype, or even it's own trailer, I mean the movie makers have really just dumbed down the whole thing, and I guess it's a double whammy of disappointment because I remember the cartoons fondly, and they even taught about life and values, I remember the cartoons had morals to every story and a lesson on life in every episode, but this movie doesn't say squat, so it makes me think maybe the cartoons I enjoyed so much in the 80's weren't that good afterall?"
"productionslykos","9","3","3","2 April 2020"," Transformers is a perfect action/sci-fi flick that everyone needs to watch before they die!
","In all honesty, I completely forgot how epic and perfect of an action/sci-fi this movie was. I'm not a huge Micheal Bay fan yet this movie wouldn't have been the same without the madman. Every mechanical lash, every technological pulse fed that little destruction craving demon inside from chaotic (and momentarily perplexing) yet captivating action pieces featuring flawless CGI that crossed the line between digitally animated creatures and pure flesh made man. Shia Labeouf performance was ultimately scary for how exceptionally realistic and convincing he built the character of Sam. Furthermore, every role was perfectly acted; both actors and actresses actualized a plethora of characters whom felt formerly grounded in this world before the plot called for their aid. In light of this, the dialogue was creepily faultless and featured the naturalism that comes in arguments, fearful conversation and disagreeable banter. Moreover, the comedy was on point and didn't try to be anything it wasn't, withal it depicted the messy reality which is humor between several voices. The pacing this movie planted was endlessly aggressive with little to no breathing room but it was brilliant; assisting the 'end of the world' concept to a near perfect standard and always keeping the audience on their feet with no blunt moments. In pair with the stunning, picturesk visuals delivered from the anamorphic lenses, Steve Jablonsky's godlike score conquered the science fiction aspect this movie so desperately reached for and undoubtedly achieved. However, not to be fooled, this movie featured a wide variety of plot holes and awkward tangles that tears from the piece of art it is. My biggest gripe being Sam's and Makaela's underdeveloped relationship that required only a fraction more screen time to further captivate. Nevertheless, in combination with all it did well, especially with the addition of the astronomically incredible, jaw-dropping sound design; Transformers is a perfect action/sci-fi flick that everyone needs to watch before they die!"

","Transformers is without doubt one of the best summer blockblusters of 2007. it has great character development and a decent storyline it start out with millitary men on a plane landing to their base were lieutenant lenox does his job and then scypes with his family and their newborn child, as well as talking with the leader of the army rangers surviving team, then an unidentified helicopter which turns to be a decepticon named blackout who was persuaded by his scorponok shows up and the men target it to step down but then forms and makes a cybertronic sound or call it a sound wave, cause deceptions use it when they prepare an attack or doing, then it just transformers and then the soldiers begin firing on it but they don't stop it, it just keeps destroying and attacking the base destroying planes and, causing massive explosions just so he can hack into the quatar base but then fails to find the information and network about the all spark. meanwhile it also opens with prime talking how cybertron became corrupt and that the autobots who are the good transformers were once in the same alliance as the deceptions who are the bad and evil transformers, they then became involved in a civil war together which drove them apart and becoming arch enemies with each other by megatron seeking his glory for the cube, Optimus then tries to make the all spark jettisoned. later then parts of the spark which are written in a mysterious form are vanished in the underground of an ice which a big great captain who's name is archibald whitwicky the great great grandfather of an autistic kid sam witwicky discovers and finds it next to a fallen megatron whom he accidentally activates and then dies from the loud deadly sound of when a cybertronian awakens, later sam witcicky himself talks about his great great grandfather in school, where he kind of loses control and the part of this major blockbluster and well made action sci fi teaches about how it is like to be autistic and how it can be solved like in other movies like rain man and amelie which also have stuff about autistic people, though this movie is mostly good at showing how a very fine sci fi action film with lots of well done cgi can be made, witwicky also meets up with a hot girl named mikaela played by megan fox who is to be his then girlfriend. witwicky asks her if he can take him out and she agrees they communicate together in a fine manner even though some things in hand can get very annoying. sam here has alot of annnoying acts when he yells out, and especially in a scene where he thinks someone stole his car while that car turns out to be the autobot bumblebee which i think is probably one of the best and most well developed character's and autobot's in the films, but then witwicky gets tricked into making the police think that he is the thief and that when sam called the police saying someone stole his car they find out that the man who called them is the thief while he isn't and sam tries to tell them that he is not the thief and that the thief got away but the police still yell and tell him to put his arms up. later in the pentagon secretary of defense john Keller played by jon voight does a big investigation about the attack that happened like a detective, he portrays him really well even though he speaks like he is not serious but actually is. Then there is another scene and moment where a mini deception named frenzy who unlike other giant transformer robots transforms into a radio. he hacks into the air force one, and downloads all the information about the files of the glasses, the workers of the control find that the system is being hacked and try to look for the frenzy but when they find him they lose the battle over him, frenzy kills all who stand in his way and then is picked up by the police car deception barricade, and which inside the car there is a hologram of a man driving the car which the transformers also use in disguise when transforming into vehicles so they can blend in from the humans noticing or recognizing their presence, there is also a scene where to people named maggie and glen are arrested after they discovered messages saying project iceman, sector 7 and capt witwicky himself which are all classified. then sam is attacked by the police decepticon barricade who asks him if he is username 217, sam replies he is but is still attacked , then sam runs into mikaela and they both run until then bumblebee fights barricade and then frenzy comes and sam attacks frenzy and breaks him to pieces where then a piece of frenzy transformers into a cell phone, then mikaela herself and sam discover that the car is a transformer suspecting it as an alien they find out that it talks and they go for a ride with it later at the final hour all of the autobots arrive to earth as protoforms and they all use their scanning devices to scan the vehicles and transform into them, sam and mikaela then meet the autobots and their leader optimus prime and tells them about their story of how they were betrayed and that they came to their planet earth declaring it unknown to them but eventually announce it as their home. Optimus introduces them the names of the other autobots and then says that they need help to get to the all spark which is the cube before the decepticons and their evil leader megatron get to it. they then roll out to sam's house where they try to hide from his parents but then there is a very funny yet weird scene where sam's pet dog mojo peas on autobot ironhide's legs and the dog gets criticised by sam after being told that he pissed on ironhide. then later the agents of secter seven led by simmons played by john turturro capture them and then find out about the robots, then there is another funny scene where bumblebee urinates on simmons. they get in persuade and then the other agents then capture bumblebee. later the charachters, lennox, epps, sam, mikkaela and also maggie , glen and the autobots later reunite at hoover dam and are led by many defenses including kellar, there at the dam bumblebee if being frozen and the autobots led by optimus prime still do their duty in order to save bubmblbee, and they also get pulled to the area where megatron is being frozen and they all discuss what was happening and that they unfreeze bumblebee so that he can show them were the cube is and protect them with it , meanwhile megatron however is still active and alive and contacts starscream who is already near the dam and the other decepticons, and then megatron flees, and the men and armed forces try to fight them but they escape later , the autobots get into the fight on the highway with optimus prime defeating one of the decepticons and then they all come to the city where starscream blends into a jet next to the other flight forces and attacks them , they try to fire on him but fail and then flee. prime arrives at the city and fights with Megatron , while the Autobots and the deceptions engage in full combat with the tank deception and the helicopter deception , the action scenes here are very well shot and entertaining and the acclaimed action movie director michael bay clearly shows us how we can turn cool action figures into a sci fi movie its all done like he was the one who made the toys and figurines and then later planned to do it with all the effort he had, and then he finally succeeded with it at last , he chose an interesting cast and if not that good of a cast still they all did good in the film including Megan fox who wasn't the best thing about the movie but still she wasn't too bad. what the makers have done is create another visually spectacular popcorn flick that this time is not really a guilty pleasure but is a very well worth watching action flick and all the Michael bay fans will be impressed with what he did back at the time and before then when he made other great masterpieces and classics like armageddon , the rock, bad boys and pearl harbor , he has alot of creative force and many admirers who are mostly the audiences and not necesarrily the critics who dont really care much on michael bay seeing that he can also make not so good movies too but for the truth he is a great director and one of the best hollywood directors of the 21st century , the film ends with sam carrying the cube , being chased by megatron he nearly gets to it but is then saved by optimus prime who plans to sacrifice himself by telling sam to push the cube into his chest but instead shoves it in negatrons chest killing megatron, prime then is proud of sam because he made the right choice and all the autobots reunite with the humans and other special forces for thanking them all for all their courage and bravery and this is what this film shows, and it all proves Michael bay can be a talented filmmaker who usually does not make stupid garbage movies and instead makes decently well done intelligently awesome gem films , my final grade score for this film is A+"

This Is Michael Bay's CGI robot Masterpiece! The CGI is Just Awesome, with each unique robot taking up the screen. No Robot Is Lifeless, No Robot Is Boring, No Robot makes you wish it wasn't up there on the big screen ( or little screen ). The Autobot's made me truly believe they aren't so different from us humans, despite they're obvious size and abilities. Both Autobots and Decepticons are cool looking and has enough depth into them which look amazing and sound amazing. The robots are fun and exciting to see. Especially in the FIGHTS.<br/><br/>Oh Yes the fights are indeed an ""awe"". Its's those amazing<br/><br/>whirrling transforming gizmos's/ bots fights that really entertain. At first, it was a little hard to tell who was fighting who, but that's been like FOREVER. Now, I can predict like every scene and picture it perfectly. This is a really entertaining movie, with lots of exploding stuff. That's Michael Bay folks! Tanks, Helicopters, Jets, Cars, Cellphones, Trucks, radios, these bots can transform into anything! They can speak our language and they can destroy ! Good versus bad. Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Megatron, Starscream, Bone Crusher, every transformer is magic! <br/><br/>The transformations are awesome ( as I mentioned ). I liked Optimus Prime's little speeches, they felt important and kind of heartwarming ( if you know what I mean ) The humor was also a success. Loved that blonde ritish speaking women, I found her more good looking than Megan Fox.<br/><br/>""I ate the whole plate, the WHOLE plate""<br/><br/>""Get Off my Momma's Carpet! She doesn't like NO body on the carpet! Especially POlice!""<br/><br/>""You Shoot, I'll Drive!""<br/><br/>""I bought A cAR, TURNED OUT TO BE A ALIEN ROBOT. wHO KNEW?""<br/><br/>""English dude, English"".<br/><br/>All so memorable lines! all of these lines are funny except for the the ""I drive you shoot"" one . That statement wasn't meant to be a funny one. I just wanted to put it out there. The Comedy Smushed into this is very funny. My mom would agree. She laughed out loud at certain jokes. She liked the film.<br/><br/>Megan Fox, well I don't have anything to say about her except for ""school hottie"" <br/><br/>Michale Bay, do me a favor and don't listen to the negative reviews and stuff, unless you want to but don't let them bring you down into making more movies like this. My rating is a 8.5/10 not a 9. I can't rate decimals in this website unluckily! And I give it a 85/100."

","With a great soundtrack and amazing action scenes Micheal Bay shows what he can pull off when taking a franchise from peoples childhood and bringing it roaring into the 21st century. The special effects in this film certainly do not slack with big explosions and great transformations nothing was held back. With a great storyline mixing action with a slight hint of comedy this film lends itself to both adults and children. With a great main cast and supporting actors this film really does leave you on the edge of your seat.

","Transformers wastes no time getting right to the incredible robot action we're all hungering for, and rushes directly from the credits to eye-popping, rampant robot destruction. What really holds the film together though is that even when it's knee deep in save the world, all out, brawling in the streets, giant freaking robot war, at the core of everything is the simple story of a boy and his first car. For a man, there are few things more powerful than the relationship he has with his first automobile, and it's no different for Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf).<br/><br/>Transformers is a truly great summer movie. As an action movie it's a huge success; with awe-inspiring effects, tremendous set pieces and jaw-dropping things which you have absolutely never seen before in any other movie. Transformers brings out your inner child from when you first watched the old fashioned animated series on t.v. screen, but only this time it's on the main screen in a movie theatre. This movie is truly fantastic and different from any other movies that I've seen."

","This movie and part 2 has won me over in the end. Have not seen part 3 yet to comment sorry.<br/><br/>I had never bothered with Transformers toys, comics, cartoons or whatever they had - so did not have any real idea what this story was about apart from robots that change to vehicles and vice versa.<br/><br/>When the movie first started with the marines being attacked etc. I thought f*** me this is going to be the best movie of all time.<br/><br/>I think I was expecting a cross between Saving Private Ryan and Predator/Alien type movie at first and expected the robots to be more malevolent and the film to be gritty.<br/><br/>But when the silly cartoon kinda robots (Autobots) did show up and were hiding outside the house of Sam etc I felt like walking out and not watching the rest.<br/><br/>I have since changed my views after watching again and seeing the second movie.<br/><br/>I have accepted that this movie was based on a previous idea so had to copy that in most parts - and it is aimed at family and younger viewers too so accept the action had to be less raw.<br/><br/>That said Michael Bay has done a fantastic, brilliant, amazing job in showing mind blowing effects and sequences.<br/><br/>The sheer relentless action at some points I think did win me over in spite of the movie having to be tamed for general viewing.<br/><br/>What surprised me most is Shia Labeouf I think I once saw him in a bit part in I-Robot with Will Smith putting him in his place ha ha.<br/><br/>But in this movie he is perfect for the role - he is appealing to all I think be it young, old, male or female.<br/><br/>He has charm and humour and timing and sex appeal (for girls or gays not me) but he does look good I admit.<br/><br/>He is kind of a cross between a nerd, geek etc and action hero eg. Die Hard to me somehow as silly as that may sound thats how I class him and see him.<br/><br/>I just saw another movie called Eagle Eye with him as the lead and I really enjoyed that too - it's daft but non stop action and simply fantastic entertainment and relentless crazy funny thrill-ride.<br/><br/>He is just likable unlike many actors I could mention.<br/><br/>I think the movie would have fallen short without him but still would have been good because of the effects.<br/><br/>Megan Fox the eye candy who I heard is not in the third movie was nice, sexy, cute etc to look at and I thought she acted OK too but some people slag her too much for acting ability I feel.<br/><br/>Maybe Jessica Alba would have been better but not sure of age etc. Anyways they found a new one now for the 3rd movie hope she is good.<br/><br/>It's sad what happen but Fox must have done something silly or not understood her role and reason of being in the movie (eye candy only) in order to get fired really.<br/><br/>OK enough politics sorry - back to review.<br/><br/>This movie has everything sexy cool actors, action, effects, comedy and daft robots too - but in the end you can either ignore or embrace the idea and plot and just enjoy the ride it really is great.<br/><br/>I do wish as there was a grown up - darker version of this made by Bay but you cannot have everything i suppose.<br/><br/>Watch it and enjoy but don't think too much or look for reasons to criticize you will find plenty but that will spoil a great spectacle if you do."

","This was a must see when it came out and I've just watched it again 5 years later and still it is one of the best CGI flicks I have seen so far. There's nothing else special in this sci-fi flick to see, just watch it for the effects.<br/><br/>The story itself wasn't that weak at all a thing we don't see that often with such kind of flicks. And even the acting was believable. Shia LaBeouf (Sam Witwicky) did a nice job here as the main lead. Of course he's the looser here and becomes the hero, that you could tell even as the flick isn't started yet. His opponent Megan Fox (Mikaela Banes) became the new big thing after Transformers although she was a bit too young aged 21. But she was voted already as one of the sexiest girls on our planet. The producers new it and she was more sexy in the next episode but it also became her downfall.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it a lot with all the action going on between the soldiers and the Transformers but also the comedy added. Here and there you will have your laughs. <br/><br/>But if you want to see the best CGI so far then see Transformers.<br/><br/>Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 story 3/5 Comedy 1/5"

"rawdeal007","9","8","11","17 April 2011"," Perfection in disguise.
","Before I start my review I just want to confront and question some of the points in some dreadful reviews on IMDb (usually giving Transformers 1 star). What I find most odd is that pretty much all of them go on to state that they hate Michael Bay movies. Why go to see another Bay directed film if you hate his style?<br/><br/>Some of these hilariously 'bad' points made in some of these ridiculous negative reviews include;<br/><br/>""Day turns in to night instantly"" - what?<br/><br/>""Character cannot speak for no apparent reason"" - referring to Bumblebee's lack of a voice, which is clearly explained by Prime and Ratchet when they first confront Sam. LISTEN!<br/><br/>Lamenting what Megatron said when he unfroze where he stated his name ""I am Megatron"" - I'd probably want to state my real name after hearing being referred to as NBE-1 for nearly a century.<br/><br/>And probably my favourite; Lamenting the fact that the scene's in the bunker below were 'bad' because the bunker resembled a scene from Terminator 3...<br/><br/>Not all is perfect with Transformers. No film is perfect, and this isn't a true classic in the sense of the word based on the fact that most classics aren't in the 'summer blockbuster' category.- it's a family summer blockbuster aimed at the masses that, in my opinion, cannot be put down for having too much action and too much noise, like some reviews have touched on on here.<br/><br/>Tramsformers looks beautiful. The robots are sublime and transform in a way that left me in awe. Adding to the overall experience was the sound effects added to the transformations - they were perfect.<br/><br/>Some complain of not being able to tell who the robots were in combat. I think the complete opposite. Most of the robots have very distinctive features or colours. It was surprisingly humorous reading someone stating that in the final battle between Prime and Megatron that they couldn't make out who was who. I'm sorry but it was as clear as day - a red, blue and chrome vs gun metal grey. It's unmistakable.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are a refreshing mix of cool and deadly. A combination that reminded me of the King Kong vs Dino fight in the 2005 remake. Awesome stuff. And I know I keep referring to other' reviews of Transformers, but it's the reason I decided to write this so must base my analysis against them; Some describe the fight scenes style as shaky- cam and confusing. I really do beg to differ. They really are clear, cool, decisive and rewarding.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf was great and his natural comedy shows in droves. He's a natural confident actor and fits the script well.<br/><br/>I loved the little references to some of the robots that were left out of the movie (notice the truck that Megan Fox drives with Bumblebee on the back). And note the little nod to fans re the car choice given to Bumblebee, who in the originals was a VW Beetle.<br/><br/>What did the film miss?<br/><br/>While the character development was acceptable to good, it would have been nice to see Starscream (love that name by the way) 'lead' more in Megatron's absence and even confront Megatron's leadership when they get him back - just like in the cartoons I remember from being a child.<br/><br/>What was Bad?<br/><br/>While I thought the film was funny, Sam's parents were just plain annoying - over-thought comedy script that simple wasn't needed and mostly not funny.<br/><br/>I know it's an American production which may nullify this point, and I have nothing against anyone, but I am sick of seeing American soldiers being able to do things others simple can't - I refer to when the 'main' solder (Lennox) jumps on a crashed motorbike, speeds towards a Decepticon, jumps off the bike at full speed, proceeds to slide under the bot and fire a perfect shot at the 'weak spot' under the chest. Something that the Autobots can not muster with any of their shots. It's a long point to point out a small gripe, but it's a gripe I have with a lot of films.<br/><br/>Overall the film is remarkable for what it is. It doesn't need strong dialogue. It does need strong effects and big drastic noise - and it doesn't disappoint in either of those departments. Most of the humour is welcome and rather funny and characters are mostly strong, even if some are annoying or not needed.<br/><br/>I've watched it a couple of times on Blu-Ray since and want to watch it again right now. Very enjoyable."
"rathertired","10","65","127","8 July 2007"," Lots of good action
","The movie seemed much shorter than it really is because it was constantly moving. There weren't any inappropriate lulls. There was some ""corny"" humor, but definitely not enough to spoil the actual funny parts. Great effects, of course. Shia did a wonderful job as main character, although it seems odd that he becomes so comfortable with the Tranformers presence in his life in such a short amount of time. There's a lot of parts that are totally unreal, but I guess if you're going to see a movie about machines that turn into rational robots, you can't expect too much reality. For those who tend to pick apart movies, there are a lot of unexplained instances throughout the movie that you can mull over later, but all in all, a must see in the movie theaters."
"papa_mcphat","3","16","26","28 December 2007"," It's not too bad of a movie... if you're brain dead or drunk!
","****** ""Spoilers"" below ******<br/><br/>Alright, I realize a movie with giant alien robots that transform into vehicles requires suspension of disbelief. That's fine, but this movie's plot was just plain retarded. Once the awe of the special effects wore off, I started a drinking game drink every time I find a major plot hole or bad movie cliché. Not too surprising the second half of the movie wasn't too bad (e.g., I passed out). <br/><br/>I loved the part where we learn that the department of defense hires high school kids to manage computer security. I bet NASA does too. That might explain why we lost the Mars probe and sent the Hubble telescope up with its lens on backwards. Let's just say this if I was sitting there while the nations computers were being hacked and my chief computer security specialist concluded (without yet knowing about transformers), ""It must be a self-replicating DNA-like robotic intelligent life form doing this,"" I would have told her to ""Shut up and suck my ****"" because that's obviously why I hired her.<br/><br/>I'm not convinced that the acting was bad. To be honest, the parts they were given were so ridiculous that I doubt anyone could look good performing them. The main actor, Shia LaBeouf, was so annoying and dumb with so many bad one-liners that I kept wishing he would die or be seriously injured. And the worst part was that I knew this movies 1-dimensional plot would end with him winning. That made it all the more unbearable.<br/><br/>The main female role, played by Megan Fox, was the typical ""action movie girl"" of the late 90's and 2000's. What do I mean by that? Well she was never wrong. She knew more about mechanics (or anything) than any ""man"" in the movie. And a tiny alien robot thing that can single handedly take out Air Force One and kill 10's of secret service agents? No problem. Hand the ""action movie woman"" a saber saw and it doesn't stand a chance. At least she fit the rest of the ""action movie woman"" cliché (i.e., she was hot).<br/><br/>Then came my favorite part of the movie! Shia needed his glasses and for whatever reason couldn't tell his parents. Therefore, all the transformers are in his front lawn hiding from his parents. No, they don't do this by sitting in the street in car form. No, they do this while in robot-person form crouching under the windows and whatnot. This was the point where I decided that finishing the movie was going to require lots of encouragement from my friend in Old Milwaukee (beer).<br/><br/>I watched the second half of the movie about 2 hours later and it never really got better. Thank God I was drunk. Let's just say that instead of fighting in a desert, the good guys drive to the nearest high-population city and decide to duke it out there. It might have been my drinking, but all the transformers started looking exactly the same (poor artists I guess) and it was tough to figure out who was fighting who. All the bad guys die (or rather are dumped in the ocean?) and everyone lives happily ever after.<br/><br/>At any rate, I wouldn't recommend this piece of crap and expect to see it on Mystery Science Theater about 50 years from now. This review really only skimmed the surface of the plot holes and cliché's. There's plenty more if you're looking for a good drinking game! It must not be all bad it is currently rated at 7.6/10. My guess is that MTV played some Transformer's commercials or something. And we all know, if MTV says it's good, there's bound to be an infinite number of 13 year olds who agree!"

","This is what happened when we went to see ""Transformers"".<br/><br/>We bought tickets and went into the cinema. The adverts came and went, so did the trailers. The lights went down and the film started. It was then that I noticed the smell. I looked around. I sniffed here and there. Couldn't place it. I looked at my Girlfriend. Had she broken wind? No. I sniffed some more. The smell was getting worse. Then it dawned on me. The smell was coming from the screen!<br/><br/>I thought ""Transformers"" was absolutely awful.<br/><br/>Maybe it's me. My Brother (37 years old) has seen it twice. He loved it. My Nephew (11 years old) has seen it twice. He loved it. Two male work colleagues (21 and 30 years old respectively) say that they loved it. A female work colleague (26 years old, blonde, nice figure, likes to lick her lips, cheeky smile...) thought that it was ""not bad"".<br/><br/>What do they know? They know nothing.<br/><br/>If you are into a whole military hardware, scientific geek fest celebration, then there are things to enjoy in ""Transformers"" (some of the military hardware sequences are great), but there is also really, really bad and predictable comedy featuring, a geek on whom the whole future of the human race depends (who you just know is going to get the hot girl despite the fact that she seems to have been dipped for hours in perma-tan), comedy parents, comedy black ops operatives (John Turturro hold your head in shame), irritating Jar Jar Binks style robots (Bumblebee and the other villainous little robot, all squeeks and R2D2isms) and a greatest-hacker-in-the-world (Tm) who is an overexcited, fat, black dude who eats too much. Give me strength...<br/><br/>I'm also starting to suspect that for a (generally considered by some?) top action Director, Michael Bay has no idea how to direct a coherent action sequence. ""Transformers"" suffered from exactly the same too close approach that ruined action sequences in ""Armageddon"" and ""The Island"". Too much happening and it was happening too fast. For God's sake, Michael, pull back and let the audience see what is going on. You don't have to be right in the middle of it all of the time.<br/><br/>I never watched the original series. Should I have done? I feel that I've missed out on something.<br/><br/>By the way, my Girlfriend liked ""Transformers"" a lot. She said that it was a fine, Summer movie. (Fume. Snarl. Growl.

I have never wanted to leave the theater as much as I did that night.<br/><br/>I can't explain it ... I am upset about sitting there for over two hours and watching this travesty. I am upset about contributing to the gross for opening weekend. I am upset about watching a Michael Bay film. But overall, I think that I am just upset that this movie just really, really sucked. The special effects were good but even they couldn't save the movie.

"BDelandro","6","31","57","3 July 2007"," Now all we need is a little Energon, and a lot of luck.
","Well people, it's finally happened. The Transformers have exploded back on to the silver screen, and this time, with real people in tow. Live-action Transformers? Is this even possible?! I figured it was worth commenting on.<br/><br/>Being a Transformers fan for much of my life, an event like this really meant a lot to me. Every bit of hype and documentation on the production of this movie I soaked in like a sponge. Yes, perhaps I was a little sad when I discovered Bumblebee was not represented as the little yellow VW I've recognized for over 15 years (keep in mind I'm still young for a TF fan), but I knew that wasn't the important thing. This movie was to bridge an interesting gap between the generations of now and then, to bring whole hordes of us budding adults back to our childhood while children of today experienced it all for the first time just like we once did. And to top it off, this could even be the moment when our aging parents finally took the time to go to the theater and ""Get"" what the heck we were doing as kids. Finally they could see why a transforming handgun was more ""cool"" than ""dangerous,"" why a set of construction vehicles at a garage sale were worth their weight in gold, and why a robotic semi truck on its death bed could make us cry so incredibly hard. Finally<br/><br/>Well, hate to spoil the moment folks. Transformers is merely an ""okay"" movie, at least for me. I by no means felt it was a waste of my time or money, but the elements I hoped would be preserved the most in a movie of this sort just weren't there. I'm talking about ""character,"" people.<br/><br/>This movie really sells itself on the novelty of having transforming robots on screen, and having some pretty wild special effects to boot, but there's not much else to it than that. It lacks heart. It lacks purpose. Too much of the movie I found myself with time to poke at plot holes instead of being enthralled in the matters of a character's story (save for Sam's anyway). Mind you, I'm not talking about rocket science here, I usually turn to movies such as ""Bloodsport"" and ""Masters of the Universe"" for this kind of thing. Any movie that puts me in the driver's seat and gets me to throw out a few honest high-fives here and there, earns my respect. Transformers didn't quite do that for me, even though I really wanted it to. <br/><br/>Concerning the movie's faults, past a neat opening, we're suffocated with some shoddy plot gimmicks, forced scripts, excessive close-ups, and some of the weirdest cuts you'll ever see for a movie of this sort. Watch as the most important elements of the scene suddenly (and quietly) vanish from view, so we can see John Turturro be sarcastic while Shia Lebeouf tries really hard to get him to care about these giant robots ""supposedly"" behind him. Shia sells the movie way more than the robots themselves can, because the Transformers hardly have enough time to show you what they're all about in the first place. Being on screen, and developing character, are two very different things, and this movie proves that quite well. The cutting also hinders many of the special effects sequences by making it almost too easy to point out scenes that were ""intended"" for CG, and those that weren't (Frenzy does his thing here, Prime will transform here). It's almost like you could calculate the budget restraints of the film while you watched it, which I found very distracting. <br/><br/>On the upside, this take on Transformers doesn't sabotage itself. So much of the plot is forgettable, that the movie can almost work as a really expensive pilot to something better, while the action offers a unique experience worth at least one ticket to the theater. Heed the warnings, it's not perfect, nowhere close even, but thanks to the hard efforts of Lebeouf, Cullen, and a truckload of under-appreciated special effects artists, you'll at least have an interesting time at the movies. <br/><br/>As for an old fan like myself, I'm still waiting for this project to transform into something greater. Just ask Simon Furman, Transformers shed its skin as a toy fad many years ago, and the lore has yet to reach it's true potential on the silver screen. It's not quite my ""darkest hour,"" but next round, I'll be looking forward to something that is truly ""more than meets the eye."""

","This new transformers movie may possibly be the worst movie i've ever seen. I went into this movie expecting to see a good action movie with a pretty bad plot. Boy was I disappointed. The over top humor that is wedged into the movie at every possible second coupled with the incredibly annoying and uninteresting back story of our ""heros"" makes it impossible for the actual Transformers, which did look really cool, to pull this movie out of the garbage. The Transormers themselves looked great and when they actually fought each other, between peeing on people and making ridiculous jokes, it was fun. But those few minutes of enjoyment can't save the movie.<br/><br/>I'm 32 and I've loved transformers most of my life. I was really hoping that this movie would do them justice, but it doesn't. The movie is impossible to take seriously on any level. Largely because of the ""Jar Jar Binks"" transformer that is running around through out the entire movie and the other endless ""comedic"" moments. I hope you, reader, enjoy the movie more than I did. When watching the movie ask yourself one question. Why would they relocate the climatic battle between the Autobots and the Decepticons from the safety of an isolated desert to a large city filled with innocent lives. It doesn't make sense."

I mean, who could have imagined a movie about robots that transform into common objects would overshadow most of this year's major superhero movies? The movie tells the story of a war between two robot clans, the Autobots and the Decepticons, the movie kicks off with the Decepticons beginning their first assault on Earth by attacking a US military base in the middle-east, as they appear they are looking for something, on a typical US town, a young teenager(Shia LeBouf) buys a car who appears to be a robot in disguise and this will push into a middle of a war between these two races, all this while the military try to piece together what just hit them. First of all, I must say one thing: ILM did this? For a second there, people were ranting how this company was getting upstaged by it's competition, because, special effects-wise, this movie makes most pre-2005 movies look like cartoons and it's perhaps the most intense action movie, and pretty nifty dialog. And something refreshing for a change: seeing US soldiers as compassionate, fearless and unwilling to back down from a fight even if it's an over-sized robot who can kill them easily. I honestly don't know how to descibre this movie of how an overwhelming experience that it was, I just have one or two minor complaints. As I suspected before, the movie doesn't focus as much on the robots at least, not up until a certain point as the young teenager and his girlfriend play the most vital role in the movie, but to my surprise it's wasn't bad, but as a result we don't get to bound as much with the Autobots, but one scene in particular when all of them transform with Sam and Mikaela watching was amazing, but sadly said robots didn't manage to bond as much as I wanted. But still most of the awe is watching for the first time giants robots, the feeling was very much like watching dinosaurs for the first time in Jurassic Park way back in 1993, but still a little more screen time would've helped. I was kinda annoyed that Optimus Prime spend most of the movie without his face armor, but he sure does look cool when he uses it. Finally, I probably shouldn't make a big fuss about it, but we have brave US soldiers and a secretary of Defense that mixes the best of Colin Powell and Winston Churcill, so why does the President sounds like an idiot on Air Force asking for candy, wearing red socks? While it doesn't spoil the enjoyment, you gotta wonder why does a president sound like a goof while everybody else doesn't act like it?<br/><br/>Anyhoo... Go see this movie, that's all I gotta say."

","""Transformers"" is so far the most fun I have as far as this year's Hollywood summer blockbusters are concerned. On one hand, it's not saying much considering the barrage of underwhelming ""three-quels"" the past two months (plus the mediocre second installment of ""Fantastic Four""). But then again, there's just something sublime in seeing your childhood memories unraveling on the big screen: those hunks of metals transforming from pieces of automobiles to highly advanced metallic sentient, and vice versa.<br/><br/>Sam Witwicky (current Hollywood it-guy Shia LaBeouf) has just got a new car, who actually turns out to be the Autobot Bumblebee, an alien tasked to protect Sam, who is in a possession of something his great-great-grandfather owned, and which is vital to the Decepticons' plan of destroying humankind and conquering Earth. Meanwhile, as the US military led by Secretary of Defense Keller (John Voight) is scrambling to figure out who is trying to hack into their computer system and stealing classified files, Sam and his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) must evade the Decepticon Barricade as well as from the mysterious Agent Simmons (John Turturro) who claims himself from the government group Sector 7.<br/><br/>It's nostalgia at its finest. Director Michael Bay, executive producer Steven Spielberg, and screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman work on this factor and the result is more of an adult-skewed film that zeros in on audience members weaned on a retrospective mode. Sure, it isn't high-brow art nor does it boast of an intricate plot, but come on, who expects that? While the script needed more coherence and focus (do summer blockbusters nowadays really have to have, like, three subplots per movie?), Bay's trademark acerbic humor and stylish perpetually-on-motion shots work most of the time, except during the climactic battle scenes where you wish the director would take a barbiturate or something, just to at least know who's fighting whom. The film has impressive CGI and the robots are quite stunning, more of stylized versions of their cartoon counterparts. LaBeouf provides a solid central human figure, ably backed up by Fox, Turturro, Anthony Anderson (as a computer hacker), and Kevin Dunn (as Sam's father).<br/><br/>All in all it wasn't a definitive adaptation , but I have to admit it was fun to watch. Ultimately, it's nothing more than a Michael Bay-ified Saturday morning cartoon, but it really didn't have to be anything more than that. It may be empty calories but it was fun while it lasted and there were no regrets afterwards. The robots did their thing and it was a smash."

","I just watched Transformers and I can say that I was very disappointed. The robots' individual personalities didn't have the chance to really shine due to the fact that there was too much emphasis on the humans when the original concept of Transformers is suppose to be all about the Autobots & Decepticons.<br/><br/>This Michael (idiot) Bay wasn't even a fan of Transformers before he was asked by Steven Spielberg to direct the film. Mr. Bay was calling it a stupid silly toy movie before he realized the major profits he can reap from those kids(like me) who grew up watching the cartoon and are now working adults with spending power. Claiming that he became an ardent fan after some tutelage in Transformers school at Hasbro. How can he appreciate the nostalgia of hearing the original theme song which I didn't even notice a hint of in the movie...so sad. I know it's silly but I had this overwhelming feeling to cheer when the original theme song came on but alas was greatly disappointed when it didn't.<br/><br/>Regarding about the robots fight scenes, almost all were close ups and very messy to the point that it became boring. Is it suppose to be entertaining when you can't really see what's going on during the combat scenes? Another big letdown was Starscream who didn't have his distinctive red outlook and doesn't sound or act close enough to the original character. He was supposed to be one of the characters in the original series that stood out from the pack. Megatron was also a letdown.<br/><br/>At least one good thing came out from this movie, the new paint job for Optimus Prime was fantastic. ;)<br/><br/>Ultimately, Transformers the movie can entertain the general masses who are just purely into explosive CGI effects but will be a great disappointment to fans that grew up watching the Transformers series & animated movie."

","There are people who like Michael Bay for his work and others who don't. I only like Bay for certain films and Transformers (2007) is one of them. Because this is the first live action adaptation of the transformers toy line, I am amazed at how well all of it was brought together. Everything from the action, the special effects, the music and the acting.<br/><br/>Just like the TV show, transformers involves two sides of alien robots; the autobots (good) and decepticons (bad). Both of which fight for control over each other. This conflict soon brings them to planet Earth where the autobots join forces with the human race. The first human contact (dialog) that the autobots have is with an ordinary individual named Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf). Witwicky is like any other young guy; he tries to find a good-looking first car so he can impress the girl of his dreams. The girl of his dreams; Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox). <br/><br/>Both LaBeouf and Fox look great together on screen. It is easy to see that they have good chemistry. Along with them are Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson who play two military officers who become one of the first people to experience coming in contact with the ""transformers"". And this happens around the beginning of the film. As for the autobots and decepticons, Peter Cullen, the original voice of Optimus Prime returns and Hugo Weaving voices the menacing Megatron. Along with others, these voice actors give great performances.<br/><br/>The action in this film is exhilarating. Right when things seem like the movie isn't going anywhere, something either blows or lights up to get the audiences' attention. That's where the special effects come in. What amazed me the most about this is that the special effects department made sure that every single component of whatever vehicle the alien robot took form of, was all in the transforming action. Also, the sound itself of the robots transforming was so unique that it is one of those noises that can't be mistaken for something else.<br/><br/>The musical score composed by Steve Jablonsky was well executed too. Each track has its own tone and represents each scene accurately. It also has a memorable tune for when Otpimus Prime is on screen and that makes the action that much more entertaining. My only quarrel with the film is LaBeouf's character. If I were in his situation, yes, I would be quite nervous as well but his jitteriness gets tiresome really quickly. I'll partially accept it for now because it's Mr. Witwicky's first time experiencing this kind of unnatural event.<br/><br/>Michael Bay's live-action take on the Transformers toys is a blast. The action is explosive and the music is resounding."

","Wow, i am really surprised how many people actually hate this movie, i liked it, this movie got me into the transformers franchise.<br/><br/>Well I really didn't have any expectations about this movie, i did not know this was based on some toys and the G1 Transformers, i just saw the movie with an open mind and I really enjoyed it, I just wanted an entertaining movie, with robots destroying each other and I wasn't really expecting a good story but I actually liked the story but I wished Michael Bay have explained more about the war of Cybertron or other plot elements of the transformers franchise.<br/><br/>Good things- The robots look Amazing, they look so realistic and the effects when they are transforming looks...just wow for that time. Visual Effects were phenomenal...yeah i know Michael Bay loves explosions but I still liked the use of explosions here, the transformations look amazing and to me it feels like the robots are successfully brought to the big screen. Some of the acting, Shia Labeouf does a decent job as the main human character Sam Witwicky but others felt...flat especially Megan Fox, it feels like she is just there to be the love interest of the main character. I liked the story and some of the action scenes. Optimus Prime is bad-ass in this movie.<br/><br/>Bad things-Some of the acting sucked(Megan Fox), Besides Optimus Prime and Bumblebee, the other robots feel so underdeveloped that makes me to don't care about some of the robots especially when Spoiler... When Megatron kills Jazz, I thought Jazz was just there to be killed. And also some Decepticons like Bonecrusher( the one Optimus fights in the highway) just pop out, he just appeared. Some sexual jokes in the movie kind of ruined it to me in some parts, especially after I knew this movie was based on toys.<br/><br/>Overall it is a good time if you are looking for a fun movie, it's a good popcorn flick, maybe some fans will be disappointed with this movie but I am a transformers fan and I actually liked this movie."

","For those of you who are not fans of Michael Bay: for starters, do not watch this movie. It's really as simple as that. But, I've read some of the negative comments on this film, and it baffles me to read that all this film consists of is hot girls, hot action, and not the greatest acting. Come on, guys. This is a Michael Bay film, and let me emphasize the words MICHAEL BAY. When I think about him, I think about entertainment, and entertainment only, because that is what his films are about. With films like this, I don't go in expecting some great story, with amazing dialogue. This movie is not academy award worthy, nor should it be. This is an action film, that's what it's meant to be, and when it comes to action films, Bay knows how to deliver. Again, the storyline could be better, and Megan Fox could use some acting lessons, but like I said, when you watch these movies, you should watch them for entertainment. So, if you know what this film delivers, and you don't like Michael Bay, then by all means, skip this movie. But, if you do end up watching this movie, and say that it's nothing but a bunch of clanging metal and hot girls, well then, welcome to the world of Michael Bay. I saw it in theatres back in 2007, I went with an open mind, and I enjoyed it. 9/10 for me."

So when i heard they were making a film i was excited but at the same time sceptical when i heard that the Transformers wouldn't be as they were in the cartoon. But having read the booklet thing they gave at the advance media screening i understood some of the reasons as to why.<br/><br/>This film honestly was so amazing and so much more then what i expected it to be. I honestly believe justice was done with this film and the humour added to the film made it more enjoyable. I know people will complain about some of the Transformers not being what they were meant to and i do agree, but even that for me couldn't stop the film from being amazing.<br/><br/>SPOILERS!!! The only 2 downsides for me was the fight at the end between Optimus and Megatron as it should have been a fight which should have been ended up Optimus.<br/><br/>Also the fact that Starscream didn't say much and could have been more involved in the film. I guess we will be seeing a lot more of him in the sequel???"
"tedg","Null","33","63","4 July 2007"," Spatial Flitting
","For once, what I see in a film is what most others do. So unlike most comments I write, this one will be ""mainstream.""<br/><br/>The way this is put together is based on fractional narrative. Its the notion that if you leave big holes in the story, things are stronger than if you seek to explain and fully reveal everything. Its a solid technique, often used in the story itself. Its used that way here, almost automatically as the cosmology invented here was devised for what, 8 year old toy consumers. But its extended. One extension may be an accident: characters appear and disappear at random with none of the completion or agency that we expect. I believe that's because Bay is a nitwit in this department and the guys in the front office thought it wouldn't matter. Also, its likely that Bay shot a 6 hour movie that makes some sense storywise and then he took out all the parts that got in the way of the ""value.""<br/><br/>But there's another ""incomplete narrative"" element that I think was by design. The camera sees and understands very little of what is going on in the battles. The camera is looking in the wrong directions, is too close, shifts in panic and jumps from view to view (when close in) as if it didn't actually know what was to happen next. So you don't actually ""see"" a full transformation, or a battle event. Often you can't tell who are the good and bad robots. Often you cannot tell actually who's up and who's down as you could, say in your classical fight, all of which it seems come from that 1938 ""Robin Hood"" sword fight at the end.<br/><br/>This cinematic technique is not new or novel. Its the first resort of filmmakers whose CGI aspirations outstrip the budget. But this is a whole new reason: that business of what you don't actually see is always grander than what you do.<br/><br/>Combined with this is a second phenomenon, and here it fits perfectly. Its the use of the dimensional camera. In this case, sometimes the camera is as a human would act. Sometimes it is disembodied, but there's a very strict vocabulary here too, determined by the restrictions of cranes and helicopters. What we have now is something new, the camera that flits, that moves in all three dimensions. We saw it first on 100% animated cartoons. I think ""Treasure Planet"" was made just to test this. Pixar created a whole philosophy and took over Disney based on it.<br/><br/>Then we saw it in CGI-heavy films. It was thrilling in ""Van Helsing,"" and there a new convention was tried: show something on screen that has similar behavior to the eye we will shift into. In Van Helsing's case, it was the three flying harpies, in particular (of course) the redheaded one. She flits with precisely the same gestures as the camera.<br/><br/>Then we saw it full bore in ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" and ""Kong Kong."" In the former it was architectural, and the latter fully integrated into the action. WETA led the way on this. There's a new technology that makes this within reach of even dopes like Bay. Its called preanimation, and what it does is completely model the scene before any work starts so that the camera has absolute freedom and isn't static as storyboards would have it. Then the virtual worlds and real shots are just busy work, all the creativity is in the design at this stage.<br/><br/>You can see precisely which sequences were done by the preamination ""director,"" and which by Bay. The new ""law"" is followed in the sense that we have an on-screen avatar as exemplar of the flitting eye movements. Its a hypercaffeinated skeletal robot. It helps us understand how the eye moves and why it sees incompletely.<br/><br/>Oh, and its not an offhand thing that the central goal of the plot is a search for ""spectacles.""<br/><br/>So when you see this, and you wonder about whether we are worth saving as a people (which is the reason for the story), and you seriously do teeter on indecision, consider this: we are evolving very quickly in the way we see, the way we model things visually and the way introspective representations are internalized. For that alone, we deserve a chance at survival.<br/><br/>Until next summer.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"springsunnywinter","10","38","74","31 July 2007"," WOW! What an awesome & entertaining movie
","When I saw the trailer of the film I thought that Transformers was going to be another silly action movie without a story but I was wrong. It did have a story although it was simple but it was better that way because you can concentrate on the laughs in a few scenes and the ultra cool action.<br/><br/>The story was a bit hard to follow but I managed to understand so my advice would be to don't concentrate on the story too much, just sit back and enjoy the amazing action sequences. Most high budget movies always have a very weak or no story-line especially Spider-man 3 which had a paragraph of story but Transformers had about 2 pages. Also Spider-man 3 is probably the most expensive film ever made but there isn't a single thing that looks expensive but Transformers you can see every penny spent in the movie, in fact it looks more expensive than its budget.<br/><br/>The actors were not very well known, I haven't seen any of them before except the funny Black guy who ate all the donuts in the police station, he was in the film Kangaroo Jack. I think his name is Anthony Anderson he was the funniest and he never fails to impress. Probably the filmmakers deliberately got actors with low payment because most of the money is gone to the SFX.<br/><br/>The Transformers were the best throughout the whole film and there are also small robots that can change into a CD player or even a mobile phone. Overall while I was watching it my eyes were locked on the big screen and I needed to go to the bathroom but I did not go until the film ended because I didn't want to miss a second. A must see especially on the cinema and when the film ended the audience were clapping & cheering. When I left the theatre I was saying to myself WOW! What an awesome & entertaining movie. In my opinion it is the second best film of 2007 the first is the The Simpsons Movie."

"ClassicVisual","2","42","84","3 July 2007"," A Transformation Into Catastrophe (Review Has No Spoilers)
","Like many others on this forum, I grew up with the Transformers. So understandably, they hold a special place in my heart. Imagine my excitement when I first heard they were announcing a live action flick for my beloved Transformers. Imagine my despair when I heard Michael Bay was on board to direct. Despite my perpetual distrust of Michael Bay's directing abilities, I wanted to cut the guy a break and trust that he would come through with a great movie in Transformers. That confidence came largely due to Steven Spielberg's endorsement of Michael Bay.<br/><br/>In the end however, my initial instincts were right. Simply put, the film was a disappointment. Michael Bay's Transformers suffers from the same ailment that all other Michael Bay films suffer from: A lack of character development. A lack of story development. A lack of proper editing. A lack of proper dialogue. An over indulgence in jittery camera work. As in any other prototypical Michael Bay affair. The magnificent effects, the amazing explosions and the ""jitter cam"" are simply hiding the gaping holes within the film...It's complete exclusion of anything coherent. At no point did I feel I was fully invested in either the story or in any of the characters.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf does an admirable job with Sam. Given the painfully limited capacity in which he is used, Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime is affective as well. Meagan Fox is nothing but eye candy, all be it, a very beautiful candy. Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson and company are mere pawns with little purpose. The likes of Jon Voight and John Turturro are sparsely used to forward a plot that is already clinging for dear life. It is a talented cast, if you read some of those names back, but nothing in Transformers is fully fleshed out. Therein lies the problem.<br/><br/>Expecting a high end drama or Oscar material from your usual summer ""blockbuster"" release is foolish, I'm very much aware of that. Still, I expect some portion of intelligent thought in my summer blockbusters meals. The kind I could wryly shrug at, all the while, just as easily, admitting it was a lot of fun.<br/><br/>For every single ounce of life in me, I cannot fathom how this film is getting rated 9 on 10's or 8 on 10's. Which essentially means, people are putting this utter example of garbage film-making, right up there with the likes of: The Matrix, Star Wars, Alien, Terminator, Gladiator e.t.c. Now that is amazing! When it comes to films like Transformers, I've heard people say ""I didn't even have to use my brain. That's what made it great!"" I can understand this to a degree, watching dramas all the time isn't fun either. But putting your faculties on hold altogether, is simply asking for far too much. Filmmakers like Michael Bay all to often try to peddle ""flash and bangs"" under the guise of ""summer blockbuster"" or ""popcorn films."" While conveniently and completely disregarding mere basic tenants of film-making.<br/><br/>Take for example Star Wars. The film that started the whole summer blockbuster tradition, the mother of all popcorn films so to speak. Yet it's still a film that stands head and shoulders above the likes of Transformers. Why you ask. The reason is simple. George Lucas was wise enough to develop a good story and flesh out the characters. If you think about it, films such as Star Wars, Alien and The Matrix take place in an equally preposterous universe. Although, in each instance, their filmmakers decided on creating a believable storyline and believable characters. A skill that Michael Bay, rather unfortunately, is desperately lacking.<br/><br/>I've nothing personal against Michael Bay or Transformers. I take no pleasure in giving Transformers a bad score or giving Michael Bay a hard time of it. I do happen to think that there is talent within Bay. He does have a knack for action sequences and all things combustible. Though again, his absolute disregard for everything else hampers the impact of what he has managed to do right.<br/><br/>The film isn't without a few positives (few being the operative word). There are some very nice effects on display here. It's obvious that a great deal of care went into creating all the robots. The skill with which the CGI interact with their environments is amazing. The stunt work and pyrotechnics within the film are top notch as well. Though again, with Michael Bay's incessant need to use jittery camera work and disorienting edits, one isn't able to fully appreciate the aesthetics in their full glory.<br/><br/>To be honest, I really did want to like this film. God knows I tried my best. I kept holding out for something, but the end credits rolled on and the proverbial fat lady had sung. Very loudly and very badly it would seem. Ultimately, It's a very shoddy and an extremely mishandled piece of film-making. I can put up with the jittery camera movement Bay is so fond of. I can put up with the disorienting edit jobs. I can even put up with the horrible dialogue. What I can't put up with, is a poorly conceived storyline and atrocious character development. Even if it is for a ""blockbuster/popcorn"" film. Michael Bay's Transformers is akin to a huge state of the art luxury cruise liner, all the bells and whistles attached. With a crucial exception. The engine needed to power it.<br/><br/>Thumbs Down.<br/><br/>NOTE: The critic James Berardinelli at Reelviews.net sums it up quite nicely with a bit more detail. Something that I didn't want to get into on account of spoilers."

","I know many people loved Transformers as in the movie and its history of past shows and movies. I am not one of those people. I am just judging this according to how it was as a film and wasn't too impressed. Here are some reasons why: The acting was borderline horrible to bad. Shia LaBeouf was the only standout in this mess of a movie. He has something very attractive about his personality that makes him perfect for movies. He has the ability to make things so ordinary in a movie work. That shows that he has something special within him. Megan Fox is very attractive too but that doesn't include her personality or acting. She is very beautiful and good looking. Still for how many other bad actresses can you say that about? Rachel Taylor though not quite as good looking fits under this category of good looking bad actresses. Tyrese Gibson and Anthony Anderson are not exactly known for their great acting either. Jon Voight and John Turturro are known for their acting though. Voight has even won a well deserved Oscar. In here though they played worse than Megan Fox. The only thing more disappointing than bad acting from actors is bad acting from good actors. This happened in Transformers which made it so frustrating.<br/><br/>The writing in here didn't exactly help the acting though. I can't blame the acting completely because the writing brought it down even more. Some of the plot explanations were horrible in here and so many over used themes and clichés were in here you can't even count how many they appeared. Worst of all was the dialog. Man how bad it was.<br/><br/>The special and sound effects were amazing. Unlike the rest of the movie it was top notch. Some of the action sequences were a real spectacle some were a bit overdone though.<br/><br/>The director takes responsibility for all of this. To me and to many other people Michael Bay is one the worst movie directors around. He can not direct one serious sequence or scene in a movie. He is just reserved for action if he is used for anything else that movie will be doomed from the start.<br/><br/>Anybody who is just looking for pure action you should definitely watch this. If you are expecting the slightest bit of a meaningful movie of some sort of message don't watch this movie. In fact don't even acknowledge it. Transformers has now message at all (no substance) and that is really sad all, it has is a lot of nice effects (all style). I guess people need meaningless trash though."

","Transformers is directed by Michael Bay and written by John Rogers, Roberto Orci & Alex Kurtzman. Based on the Transformers toy line the plot sees Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky, a teenager who gets involved in a war between the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons, two factions of alien robots who can disguise themselves by transforming into everyday machinery. Also involved in the carnage are Megan Fox, John Turturro, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Peter Cullen, Hugo Weaving, John Voight & Mark Ryan.<br/><br/>With a production budget of around $150 million, Transformers went on to make almost $710 million worldwide. That is some hefty figures, almost as hefty as the mighty Transformer robots that dazzle and wreak mayhem up on the screen. The plot of course is bonkers, but is anyone seriously watching this expecting high end literacy? The out-shot ultimately is Good Robots Versus Bad Robots, with humans either in the way or aiding the Autobots to save mankind. There's been plenty written about the film, both good and bad. From the quite brilliant transforming sequences to the rather staid dialogue; to the wry observations on the world we now find ourselves in, Transformers has got plenty for the critics and film watchers to ponder. As popcorn summer blockbusters go, it's one of the most fun in recent times; and the box office figures tell you that it found a considerably large and appreciative audience. Great ""brain checked at the door"" entertainment it is, then. But crucially, it's not just for the kids to enjoy, it happens to be a fully rounded family treat. Go bots! 8/10"

His solution for acceptance comes when his father purchases Sam a car. Little does he know it's ""Bumble Bee"" an Autobot from a distant universe sent to Earth to protect Sam and mankind. From beginning to end, there is non-stop action and we cannot wait for the next explosion.<br/><br/>Shia LeBeouf is becoming our new ""it"" boy especially with an earlier breakout this year, Disturbia. Besides being a heartthrob to girls, he is a brilliant up and coming actor. I would even go as far as call him the next Leonardo DiCaprio with his current pretty boy status and talent. He brings a great sense of energy and fun to his role.<br/><br/>Megan Fox who plays Mikaela, Sam's love interest and brings the lovely sex-appeal and ""it"" girl status to all the young and older boys who love to see a pretty girl get dirty. I'm afraid that Fox's acting talent is a bit limited and with comparisons to Angelina Jolie, that doesn't spell so much success for her either. I'll take her MAXIM cover shoot any day though.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast gives us your fill in the places performances . We have John Turturro, Jon Voight, Anthony Anderson and Tyrese Gibson for all your comic relief, a little bit of drama and all in between. A well put together cast to say the least.<br/><br/>""Oscar"" will be pounding on the door for the Visual Effects and Sound teams. They are achievements in the history of cinema and completely revolutionized and set the bar extremely high for next year's of summer blockbusters. I'm very excited to see those teams up for Oscars in February and hopefully walk away with it.<br/><br/>An IMAX theater, a big screen, the side of a building; one of these is needed to get the full experience that is Transformers. Do yourself a favor and see helicopters, tanks and cities explode with excitement.<br/><br/>Grade: ***½/****"

","Coming from a girls point of view, I fell in love with the movie Transformers. I could probably list on one hand the amount of actions movies I have seen in my life and the only one I can truly say I enjoyed was transformers. Director Michael Bay did such a wonderful job of making sure the audience felt like they were right there in the action in each of the scenes. <br/><br/>I am a huge fan of Shia LaBeouf's and felt like he did an outstanding job of bringing comedy to an action-based movie. Because I enjoyed the movie so much I have actually now started having an interest in the comics involving Transformers. I have to admit, I watch the movie almost once a month and will never stop enjoying it."

","This movie is very BAD, but I bet you're gonna watch it anyways <br/><br/>This has to be the most disappointing movie I've watched this year. What a let down! It's probably up there with great franchise flops like Dungeon & Dragons (which was really really bad) and Terminator 3 which was nowhere close to the very much dated T1 & T2.<br/><br/>Sure, I understand this Transformers is a Michael Bay Transformers (made 2007 and not 1980s) it shd be different .yes yes but almost everything lacked character!<br/><br/>I guess what I wanna say is a good movie is timeless. It tells a good story and leaves deep impression in the audience. 50 years from now, you may tell people about an excellent movie you've watched in 2007, but it's probably NOT Transformers.<br/><br/>If you are a 5-year old kid, you may like the movie. If you are an adult with no great expectations, you may find it visually entertaining. If you are a Transformers fan I suggest not watching it cos it may spoil your day, as it did with mine. <br/><br/>But you probably are gonna watch it anyways as I did cos it's TRANSFORMERS tsk tsk ☹"
"Wildislander","5","37","76","7 July 2007"," A recipe for mediocrity
","I loved the first 15 minutes of this movie. Unfortunately, the film didn't end until almost two hours later.<br/><br/>Here was the recipe: start with fifteen minutes of interesting character development and mysterious robot attacks. Next, throw out all efforts to deepen character development in favor of moving the lame plot forward. Next, bring in several unnecessary and uninteresting characters (the blond computer hacker and her black friend) to confuse things and take up time. Then, make the audience wait for the action by adding unnecessary attempts at humor (i.e. the scene at the boy's house and the addition of the John Tuturro character with Special unit 7 or whatever it was called). Finally, be sure to fill the remaining time with cool shots of the transformers transforming and shooting things (which were good I must admit). The audience will be awed by the special effects and won't realize what a poor movie they've just seen.<br/><br/>By the way, how is it that one robot could destroy an entire outpost earlier in the film but a whole fleet of robots couldn't hit even one marine later on? Those guys must have trained at the G.I. Joe headquarters to be able to dodge so many bullets. <br/><br/>This movie started great but quickly transformed into a sub par action film with shallow characters and little plot. The special effects were great but they weren't enough to keep this film from ending up on the scrap heap of mediocre action films."
"malky_muff","1","22","42","13 August 2007"," The blind went to see this film in force!!!
","Im sorry, i no ill get slated to hell for this but every single person who gave this film anything more than a 5 out of 10 is clearly delusional and need serious mental help immediately for the sake of the planet and the universe at large! I don't dislike that many films I'm usually quite easy to please but this film was easily one of the worst I have ever had the misfortune to sit through! It started out so well  that initial sequence in the army base was amazing and I was captivated  i expected so much after that and then it just died  much like I wished I would so i would have to see or hear any more of it! This film was exceptional for being one of the few that actually didn't work on any level at all! The plot was paper thin at best and I'm sorry but the largest part of the film was nothing more than filler! SECTOR 7!!!!!! OMG Christ on a bike what was that about!!! Seriously!!! It was the most ridiculous piece of anti American diatribe that I have ever seen and the thin veil of anti American feeling that surrounded these idiotic characters was nothing less than disgusting! Are we really meant to believe that the highest level of American security is entrusted to someone that would make a t-shirt like that for themselves  seriously  what was realistic about that or funny for that matter! People who thought that was funny are very easily amused! Then there was the notable lack of a President! Again, are we actually supposed to believe that during a time of extreme crisis that the President wouldn't be at the helm taking control? Again the anti American/anti Bush feeling in this film was well over the score and completely unnecessary in this film! If you want to take a shot at Bush do what Moore does and do it upfront and in person and don't ruin perfectly good films for it! Then there's Megatron! How, pray tell, did the generally primitive people of the world manage to transport this huge lumbering behemoth from deep below the arctic ice to somewhere in America (Hoover Dam wasn't built until the 1930s) given how large and heavy he would be  and how did they keep him frozen during this time without the obvious aid of cryogenics. It may be a small gripe but its part of the huge number of inconsistencies that exist in this film! The scene outside Sam's house is painful  giant robots playing hide and go seek  I actually thought I smelled the BS during that scene  not only was it excruciatingly painful but it was far too long! This could have been such an amazing film and MICHAEL BAY destroyed it  not only that he destroyed the film, raped its mother, pi*sed all over its dad and systematically mutilated all of its siblings! And, it should not be forgotten that Spielberg was involved in this  I can only think he was asleep the whole time! I can only hope that they bring in Bryan Singer or someone who actually knows what they're doing with this kind of film and chain Bay to the underside of a boat and leave him there to rot and not ruin any more potentially fantastic films! PS wow that was scathing wasn't it  honestly I hated the film but I've read too many high and mighty comments from people who said they loved it and slated those that hated it! If there are police officers reading this I promise I have no intention of chaining Michael Bay to the underside of a boat please don't arrest me LOL!"
"zkonedog","9","4","5","7 March 2017"," Escapism Film-Making At Its Finest
","Sometimes (probably more often than not in this day and age), movies are not meant to be intensely analyzed and picked apart. If one were to do that to ""Transformers"", the review would likely come back a negative one. However, this flick requires its viewers to be one simple thing: sit back and enjoy the ride! If that can be done, ""Transformers"" will thoroughly entertain you.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Transformers"" focuses on high school student Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf). While leading a relatively normal teenage life and trying to get the ""hot girl"" of his dreams Mikaela Barnes (Megan Fox), Sam is swept into an invasion of Earth by the evil Decepticons transformer robots. Allying with the U.S. government and the benevolent Autobots, Sam becomes central to the action due to his family lineage.<br/><br/>If one could ever classify a film as ""whiz-bang"", this one be the textbook definition of that statement. It has everything most cinema fans want: pulse-pounding action, cool gadgets, romance, and a script that never takes a down moment...the action is always moving forward.<br/><br/>What makes ""Transformers"" a truly quality experience, however, is the fact that the plot and characters contain a great deal of heart. The plot isn't Shakespeare, of course, but who can't relate to ""good vs. evil""? LaBeouf is absolutely perfect as Witwicky, while Fox turned herself into a national sex symbol simply by playing ""that hot girl from high school that all the boys lusted over"" & leaning over the engine of a car (!). Again, a set of characters that most individuals can relate to.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Transformers"" will sweep you away if you can let it. Instead of nit-picking or analyzing ""the small stuff"", this is one to ""get your popcorn ready"" for!"
"alindsay-al","8","4","5","12 March 2014"," CGI Marvel of fun
","This film is all about one thing for me watching big robots beating each other up and in this film that was a success. The autobots led by Optimus Prime are in a battle with their long enemies the Decepticons of this greater power called the All Spark. With many scenes and performances by the human actors we get to the final fight scene which is literally one of the craziest fighting scenes ever. The performance of Shia Labeouf, Megan Fox and the other soldiers are good but the whole point of this film really is around all these transformers fighting and when they do it is a marvel. Michael Bay is well known for big explosions and action but in this film it is perfect and he gets these encounters between these different transformers as good as it possibly gets. This film is fun, exciting and action packed leading to a great 2 1/2 hours that are fun and easy to watch."
"lesleyharris30","8","4","5","1 October 2013"," Action Packed and Funny at Times,
","Transformers is a great movie with a pretty good storyline and a decent cast.It is a bit long but the two and a half hours fly by.I enjoyed the action in the movie,although it did go on a bit too long many times,sometimes so much that you would forget whats happening,but it is very well directed by Michael Bay.I enjoyed Shia LaBeouf a lot in this,but,although she is very attractive,Megan Fox is not a very good actress,I feel like she just says her lines and she probably wouldn't have got in to acting if it wasn't for how good looking she is,I definitely think a better actress like Emma Stone or Amanda Seyfried could have put in a better performance as this character.The best part for me is without a doubt the robots themselves,Optimus Prime,Bumblebee and the rest of the Autobots and Decepticons are beautifully animated and the voice work is outstanding.While Transformers has many flaws,its still very enjoyable and I would recommend it to all fans of Michael Bay and the Transformers in general.<br/><br/>A long fighting race of robots,the Autobots and the Decepticons,head to Earth and one young teenager might be able to fix things."
"RyanEberhart","9","4","5","17 September 2013"," Pretty Good
","In 2007, Michael Bay brought to the silver screen a favorite cartoon series of mine from when I was a kid in a live action version of the Transformers. Many people have found fault in this movie and the two subsequent movies. I like these movies in their entirety.<br/><br/>The first movie introduces the audience to the different characters. Who, men mostly, wouldn't have wanted to meet Bumblebee, Optimus Prime or even Megatron; I'm sure there are a few women out there that can say they would. We also meet Sam Witwiky (Shia LeBeouf), Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox), Captain William Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Agent Simmons (JohnTurturro).<br/><br/>It is hard to think of these movies as serious or action movies when there are so many jokes, comic relief scenes, and prat-falls. Shia LeBeouf is very good at doing prat-falls and having a that kind of background help him be able to play his character very well. However, I think that as you move from one movie to the next you start seeing Sam Witwiky become more mature.<br/><br/>My first favorite scene is when Sam finds out that his car is in actuality a robot that can transform into a Camaro. At one point Sam tries to escape his car because he doesn't understand that the car is a friendly robot, not yet anyway. Sam grabs his mom's bike and tries to outrun his car. At one point he doesn't see a crack in the sidewalk; he ends up flipping over the handlebars right in front of Mikaela, who he has a crush on. It is only when the Camaro saves Sam and Mikaela from another robot that can change into a police car that they begin to trust him. Later Sam finds out that the cars name is Bumblebee.<br/><br/>Another favorite scene is the awkward scene when Sam is looking for his Great-Grandfather's glasses. The other Autobots are anxious to get the glasses and they end up taking out the electricity to the entire neighborhood. Sam's parents come up to his room because they wanted to make sure he is OK. Sam's mom, Judy Witwicky (Julie White) asks him if the reason he had locked the door was because he was masturbating. It is after this conversation that Mikaela reveals herself hoping the conversation would stop being embarrassing... it doesn't.<br/><br/>I like this movie because it brings to ""life"" a favorite cartoon from my childhood. I try very hard to make up my own mind about movies and other entertainment without reading reviews of others. I have read articles describing what some reviewer or another had to say about this movie but I take it with a grain of salt. I like what I like. I try not to write a bad review if I can help it.<br/><br/>That said, I give this movie a 9 out of 10 stars. I don't know what could have made it better to get that last star."
"sharkattack2","Null","4","5","24 June 2012"," Great action movie
","I really enjoyed this movie. This movie was hyped for months, and I'm happy to say that it lives up to most of its expectations. Transformers fans are really going to love this, because they brought back Peter Cullen who was the original voice actor for Optimus Prime, and they use a lot of the original Transformers body designs and sound affects, and a lot of other things from the original cartoon.<br/><br/>The action scenes were fantastic. They always keep me on the edge of my seat. Michael Bay is known for a lot of explosions in his movies, and while this movie does this, not all of the action scenes are like that. There are actually a few really good car chases with no explosions at all.<br/><br/>The comedy actually worked well most of the time, but some of it is a little stupid and didn't need to be in there.<br/><br/>This movie is great, but not perfect. The love story was really cliché, and at times it moved really slow, but that didn't ruin the movie for me and it probably won't for most people. This will be a great movie to watch for the summer. Go watch it. You'll have great time."

","Michael Bay has made some very enjoyable movies, including this one, and a couple bad ones. Transformers is one of his better films. He has put in a great mix of visual effects, special effects, and action. This movie also has a lot of humour, but not not enough for it to be a comedy. It has one of the best uses of CGI, visual effects and special effects along with Terminator 2: Judgment Day, The Matrix and Jurassic Park. The acting was absolutely astonishing. Shia Labeouf was just brilliant for playing the lead character Sam Witwicky . And hands off to Megan Fox for playing Mikayla, Sam Witwicky's love interest. The fight scenes and battle scenes were shot very beautifully. I recommend this movie to anybody who are fans of the TV shows and the action figures."
"rvnc","8","4","5","29 September 2008"," Very very silly but very good fun.
","OK i'll get this out of the way early on. This isn't a great piece of cinema, it's not a particularly good story, the characters aren't great and the acting is mediocre to poor. Generally that would mean disaster but fortunately it doesn't really matter.<br/><br/>Transformers works despite these flaws because it is an unashamedly populist action/adventure movie aimed almost exclusively at 15-30 year olds who want to be entertained without having to think. It serves up a constant menu of explosions, car chases and fight scenes, supplemented by hot cars, girls and some good jokes. This adds up to a movie that's very easy and enjoyable to watch. The effects on said explosions/fight scenes are superb, and the Transformers themselves are fantastically animated.<br/><br/>What really stands out in this movie though is the comedy. It's surprising that a movie that appears to take itself very seriously, and has a plot line featuring the potential end of the world, would be filled with so many gags. It's a smart move by Director Michael Bay, who has clearly followed 'The Pirates of the Caribbean' recipe in creating an action movie that is semi-serious and therefore doesn't disappear up it's own backside. The comedy is pretty good throughout, and doesn't descend into Jackass/American Pie territory, which is a relief. The biggest compliment I can pay is that I saw 'The Simpsons Movie' and Transformers in consecutive days, and Transformers got far more laughs.<br/><br/>There are, of course, problems within this high-action teen based formula. We could have certainly done without the cheap black stereotyping in the Jazz character, and Optimus Prime's rather cheesy speeches seem to be fawning to be the comic book crowd a little too much. In addition there is too much schmaltz, particularly at the end, but then Spielberg did produce.<br/><br/>But ultimately Transformers prevails because it sets out to entertain and thrill it's target audience. Had Bay and co set out to produce a completely straight-laced realistic movie like the Dark Knight it would have been complete rubbish. This may be the most stupid movie ever, but it's also great fun to watch."
"yem777","10","4","5","30 May 2008"," Stunning unlike anything ever seen before
","this movie is far and away the best visual achievement in any media ever ever ever. It is so unbelievable. Everyone is talking about how Michael Bay went too ""over the top"" with the visual effects. This is ridiculous. That's kind of the point! This movie was not meant to be some epic drama like the Godfather. No. This is like Star Wars, but 30 years better graphics technology. The only reason this movie isn't on Star Wars level was that the script could have been better. Looking back, there were some very corny lines, but in the moment of the action, they just work. I don't know how it didn't win Oscar for best visual, somehow the Golden Compass beat it, which is ridiculous, because the Golden Compass would have to be the best visual of all time to top transformers. I actually haven't seen that movie, but it has ""Eragon"" dreadfulness written all over it in that it will have 10 million new concepts every 5 minutes, no character development whatsoever, which Transformers actually did have, despite what the critics say.<br/><br/>This is the kind of movie that has so many dimensions. You'll watch it once, and you focus on the transformers. The next time you'll notice more things about Sam and Mikaela, then the next time you'll focus on the Army officers, then it'll be the Pentagon lady with the accent. Their characters are actually far more complex than you notice at first, because you're so zoned in on all the action. ""Bring the rain"" is now my favorite line of all time. This movie is so amazing you must see it i can't even tell you how much you need to see it. Even the drama-loving, detail-focused, picky critics will be awed by the action, despite what they will say about it's other ""flaws"" (i swear the script is the only one). This movie has something for everyone, and if you play COD4, R6V, or some other game like that then you'll really appreciate the weapons used in this movie.<br/><br/>Please see this movie, it should really get like 9.5 stars, because 10 is perfect, and the script could have been better, but really, it works in the moment, and there are some really great lines, mixed in with some bad ones.<br/><br/>This movie should have won, maybe 5 or 6 Oscars, and it probably would have if the critics had watched the movie 4 times, but they only saw it once, and only saw the action, thus, it wins no Oscars. I cannot stress enough how you need to see this movie more than once to appreciate it beyond its special effects, which are the greatest part about the movie, but you really should see it again, it just kind of all fits, it's kind of all wrapped up nicely. It's like a great book, everything just works.<br/><br/>Lastly i would like to comment on the use of lines/scenes/shots/ideas from other movies used in this movie. Transformers does use lots of that, such as the fighter pilot scene from Independence Day, the Bunker scene from Terminator 3, and there's more, but the thing is, these are great scenes/ideas/etc. that Michael Bay borrows, so it is actually a good thing.<br/><br/>Cannot say enough about this movie, you need to go see it, even if you don't speak English, it's worth seeing."

","I'm a transformer fan, not fanatic  to save you any time reading, I suggest you pass on seeing this in the theaters, wait for it on OnDemand or DVD. If you DO go to see it in the theater, be prepared to not be on the edge of your seat for about half the film. <br/><br/>The film exhibits either one of two classic Hollywood film making errors. Either there was a lot of story in the writer's heads that didn't make it to the screen OR too many cooks were throwing all sorts of 'trendy' ingredients into the soup spoiling the meal.<br/><br/>Here are some basic notes;<br/><br/> The numerous subplots were SO inconsequential, poorly acted, cast, and edited - all conspired to slow down the film. It felt like a committee decided they need to fill the time between the special effects with a cute girl 'scientist' (with a heavy Aussie accent no less), Hip Hop computer hackers, teenage angst and crazy men in Black. (the kids are going to LOVE the zany Defense Secretary!) <br/><br/> The romantic tension between the two lead characters (the human ones) was cliché and padded the film with useless scenes that didn't move the story. A degree of this is to be expected but it's so poorly managed here that it only adds more speed bumps to the script. <br/><br/> As mentioned already by others, the action scenes use the ""shake the camera"" technique to both mask the effects and make it feel 'real'. Man this was irritating as hell, it made me wish the scenes (that I came to see) would just end. <br/><br/> The fights were so chaotic that generally you didn't know what was happening until it was over and even then you don't get a good sense for how it went down.<br/><br/> I'm not sure if it was the print we watched but the film itself shifted between good quality to super grainy, and it wasn't being done for effect, it was like they used the wrong speed of film when they shot it.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this film but sadly the more I think about it, the worse it gets. If they do a sequel (and that seems inevitable) I hope it's darker and better written.<br/><br/>--------<br/><br/>Post First Week Box office note: I'm glad the film did well, I REALLY hope the sequel comes back darker and allows the Transformer Characters be more the story and not this 'Independence Day' style of disaster flick.<br/><br/>Maybe get Ronald Moore or the team from Batman Begins to write it."

","Yes, I loved Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List, but Steven Spielberg is the executive producers of garbage flicks like War of the Worlds and AI, both testimonials to lavish over-budgeting and plot less rambling in scriptwriting. Well, I guess he put Michael Bay in front of this over-bloated silly mess, Transformers, so that he could be the crap shield.<br/><br/>This movie is the war sequence we wanted but were denied in War of the Worlds, played in over-sized, out-of-focus for the most part, and boringly-repeated fashion, between the ""good"" Autobots and the ""evil"" Decepticons who are after a source of unlimited power that landed on Earth thousands of years ago, and discovered by the grandfather of soon- to-be-metro-sexual-wimp Sam Witwicky, played by Shia LaBeouf. Apparently the map of the location of this ""Allspark"" is etched on his grandfather's glasses, which he possesses.<br/><br/>At any rate, through twist of fate, Sam obtains a car, which is an Autobot in disguise, and picks up a jock-chasing chick Mikaela Banes, played by Megan Fox. From that point on, the movie is a mindless array of action sequences as the Decepticons make their way to Earth and attempt to cripple all defense and communications prior to a battle with the Autobots.<br/><br/>My main problem with this film is that it spends virtually all its time in overblown (and out of screen scope) CGI action sequences that are either too close up to fully comprehend or almost too fast to make any sense of. John Voight is wasted in the role of the Secretary of Defense, choosing to take the paycheck and act like a slightly-intellectual hard-headed redneck bureaucrat instead of playing an interesting character.<br/><br/>The rest of the performances by cast are really unmemorable, and the action sequences are just a jumbled mess. The other annoying aspect of this film is that it is a virtual commercial for Chevrolet, Taco Bell, and every other kind of franchise item (candy, tools, and cars), and the actors use their names with great repetition. I have to assume that the executive producer of this film (no stranger of cliché ad usage, remember Reese's Pieces in E.T.?) was banking on merchandising revenues if the film failed at the box office.<br/><br/>In the end, it is another brainless, mindless thrill ride we expect from Spielberg. Thank God he has Michael Bay to point the finger of blame should this thing fail. This movie has the indelible mark of the ultimate King of Cinema Crap, Steven Spielberg, and has a similar feel of his ""epic"" action films.<br/><br/>I would not even bother renting this one. It really is not worth the viewers time."

","As nigh unto impossible as it may seem, the master of Second Unit Cinema- none other than Mr. Michael ""Oy vey"" Bay- has rocketed to the top of the charts with his take on the old TRANSFORMERS toytoons. (I was one of those who watched the original series when it aired because, even though it wasn't- nor isn't, nor ever shall be- food for thought, it beat the daylights- then, as even now, believe it or not- out of the infinitely inferior Americanimation to be found on the tube... or even on the Big Screen, for the most part... again, to this very day.) Even Second Unit Cinemasters like Tim Story (whose FANTASTIC BOREs run a close second and third to TRANSFORMERS) can't begin to come close to what Mr. Bay has wrought. Bay, unlike Story, at least had the good sense to go with a full cgi cast and thereby save himself the embarrassment of working with real, live human beings. (One of the cgi even looks like Angelina Jolie's father. The geniuses who generated these computer images must take a bow- as should their computers, who did most of the work, anyway.) By handing the reins of most of the film over to the techs, Bay frees himself up to do what he does best: direct the second unit. It was nothing less than a stroke of genius. If there's another director more worthy of the title of Master Of Second Unit Cinema than Bay, I've missed him."

","I had been looking forward to the Transformers ever since the teaser trailer was released and in this bloated summer of sequels I was looking forward to seeing something new - Transformers completely passed my by when I was growing up!<br/><br/>CAST & CHARACTERS: The cast were fine - Shia LeBeouf an actor whose career status is definitely rising was very good in his role and had some fine comedy moments as did Kevin Dunn and Judy White, who played his parents. Josh Duhamel & Tyrese Gibson were fine as the obligatory one dimensional soldiers - the fact that Captain Lennox has a baby daughter is as much character development that we got. John Voights Defence Secretary just seemed to fall apart towards the end and lost all sense of order and control. John Turturro played the oh so clichéd secret agent and a really strange way. Shia LeBeouf asked his character if he was on drugs and by that stage I was also wondering the same thing. Megan Fox has got to be one of the worst actresses on the history of the planet - a very very attractive actress also a very very untalented one. There was an actual attempt of character development in the fact that she had a criminal record for stealing cars and this proved very useful later on in the movie Rachel Taylor and Anthony Anderson were two very unlikely code breakers. Then don't forget the, almost comes as standard Bernie Mac cameo. The man is not funny people. I cannot think why this man is in movies.<br/><br/>PLOT: I do understand how Michael Bay films work plot wise -we get one line of sensible dialogue for about ten explosions. We are introduced to Sam Witwicky giving a report on his great great grandfather who went exploring in the Artic Circle and stumbled across Megatron frozen in the snow. Many years later Sam is selling glasses that his grandfather wore to the Artic on EBay, one of the many subtle product placings in the movie. But really, lets be honest with ourselves - who came to see Transformers for plot?? I didn't for one - I came to see an action movie were big super intelligent robots come to earth: some are there to help and some are there to destroy. There was a mention of finding a big cube at various stages. I did notice a mocking dig at George Bush as the President on AirForce1 but it was all a bit unnecessary <br/><br/>ACTION: In a Michael Bay movie it's action that matters and not plot and here we got plenty of it. Plenty of explosions, action and thrills to satisfy even the most hardened Michael Bay fan. It was just loud and unsubtle and to be honest it was great!<br/><br/>THE TRANSFORMERS When the Autobots were on screen the movie really picked up. Each had their own personality and style. The scene were they were all in the Witwicky garden was very funny - silly but still funny. We were all so into the movie that when Bumblebee got attacked by the humans I was grabbed by a friend and told to ""do something!!"" and when Jazz got killed the whole audience was devastated. The Decepticons, all complete with silly names such as the Destructor and BoneCrusher, actually all transformed into cooler vehicles than the Autobots, but were never going to win. Megatron actually got the biggest laugh when he flicked away a human in disgust. The fact that the Transformers could feel pain and could get hurt seemed to make them seem more human - and made you care for them further, especially since they all had human like eyes<br/><br/>PLOT HOLES There were some: What happened to the group who stayed at the Hover Dam? Maggie, Glen, Agent Simmons and the Defence Secretary? Are they still there now? We seemed to forget about them at the end. Why would it be helpful to send Shia LeBeouf off to a helicopter to get the cube to safety? Surely Megatron would just blow it - and low and behold he did!! Why did Optimus Prime tell us that the Autobots were all hiding yet, there he was standing as bold as brass on top of a big hill? Plot holes yet - but do they really matter in the long run? No<br/><br/>OVERALL I was not disappointed. I knew I was going into a Michael Bay film and I knew what to expect. There will be many people who will automatically hate it because of Michael Bay and will criticise all the explosions and noise, but they seriously need to get over themselves and just enjoy a summer action movie for what it is without looking for a deeper meaning. I didn't care that the characters were a bit clichéd and one dimensional. I didn't care about all the product placement - A Nokia cameo is almost as expected as a Bernie Mac one these days and who doesn't want the new Camaro? <br/><br/>I would give it an 8/10. It loses a point for Megan Fox and Bernie Mac and it loses another for the few plot holes that were scattered about the film. Transformers should be seen in the cinema so it can be enjoyed at maximum effect. <br/><br/>It deserves credit at least for not being a sequel in a summer full of threequels (I know there were cartoon movies made before this one!). Is a Transformers 2 needed ?.erm no. Will I see it?yep!!"

","This movie is probably the most incomprehensible piece of trash film I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Its typical Michael Bay fare - an empty but full-of-itself plot interrupted every 10 minutes or so with a half hour's worth of smoke, loud explosions, and metal crashing against one another. (See Pearl Harbor) This one is made particularly bad by Shia Lebouf's spastic, annoying performance. If you've seen anything this kid has done, you've seen it all. Lebouf's acting grab-bag seems to consist of talking fast....and talking too fast.<br/><br/>Lebouf's performance is the keystone of a plot that won't be too appealing to an audience who values logic in an entertaining story. Why a group of super space robots so advanced they can shift their shape to mirror an alien race's technology can have anything hidden from them or need the help of the young boy to find it is a question that Bay hopes the audience won't be concerned with as they sit enamored with his signature bells, whistles, and gunshots.<br/><br/>However, the transformers were an important part of many of our lives as children, and there were certainly many other people leaving the theater who enjoyed it. If you like the transformers (or are one of those nerds who decided you did because you wanted to wear an optimus prime t-shirt you say at Hot Topic, even though you never actually watched the cartoon) you may still enjoy it.<br/><br/>If you respect film and enjoy good movies, rent something and stay home."

","Growing up watching the original cartoons and loving them more than almost anything else, I was really really REALLY hoping not to come out wanting to hit someone, like I did with that waste of time money and hype that was Thunderbirds.... GRRRRRRR... and I can gratefully say I wasn't.<br/><br/>Although there was a moment or two where I was very worried that I was... It does take a little while to get going... but once it does ohhhhhhhhhhhh boy!!!! This is a typical Bay film, lots of shaky cam work, which is a bit of a shame really (especially as I was stuck 3 rows from the front!), and some of the acting was a little duff (Mr Leboef was good though I have since decided!), but lets be fair that isn't the reason we went to see it, we went to see some kick ass transformers fighting to take us back to our childhood.... and we got it alright! Prime is awesome and looks great, updated for 2007 but still has the style of days gone by. In fact every one of the transformers is very well done in the same way (Megatron is not as good but still a solid character). And their interactions with each other, with the humans and their enemies is spot on. My advice would be to watch the original film just before you go and see this, or as much of the original series's as you can cram in! The only reason I can't give this 10 out of 10 is that the film, like SOOOOOO many other remakes for the 2000's, is the inclusion of kids again... Leboef was good I'll give him that, but still.... if they had 2hrs of transformers fighting with no storyline (and NO KIDS) I would watch every time! But still a brilliant film, came out bouncing like a 5 yr old and that is the sign of a good film in my books!!!"
"robinhoodfilms","1","21","41","17 August 2007"," Terrible, terrible film!
","I can't fathom how anyone gives a film like this a 9 or a 10...but, then, I can't figure out why people enjoy Jerry Springer or went to the theatre to see The Dukes of Hazzard.<br/><br/>This film passes the most important test in Hollywood which is to make money. In that sense, it's a success. The problem is, that's the only parameter that seems to matter anymore.<br/><br/>The story is weak, which can be forgiven since it's based on a children's series. But there are issues with the story and characters that any mediocre writer could have handled. The film couldn't decide if it wanted to be for kids or adults, or somewhere in between. The movie starts off as a typical Michael Bay project with lots of action which keeps it interesting. When the Autobots finally show up, the film degrades into a miasma of adolescent lameness with robots speaking in ""characterizations"" that are stupid, unrealistinc (even for a film like this) and annoying.<br/><br/>I can enjoy a mindless popcorn movie. I had fun with Armaggeddon. This is the worst film I've seen in a very long for more reasons that I can even get in to."

"Pavel-8","2","38","81","3 July 2007"," Less than meets the eye.
","I have low expectations for summer movies. I realize that they are often mindless entertainment with minimal plot and multiple explosions. That's fine. There is a place for such flicks, and I watch them without much hope of something grand. Remember that as I say this with no exaggeration: ""Transformers"" is the worst summer blockbuster I have ever seen. Let me take you through the anatomy of this horrible movie.<br/><br/>From the stiff opening voice-over that details the backstory, you sense trouble. Thirty minutes in, you're still waiting for the movie to gain traction, even though a big action sequence already happened. As the action wanes, the awkward dialogue blares through. You realize this isn't Shakespeare, but George Lucas could have improved this script. Simple words in the midst of action are one thing, but as the focus of several too-long scenes, the lame dialogue is painfully amplified. When you're not sure if the humans are delivering their lines better than the robots, that's a bad sign.<br/><br/>But you know more transformers are coming, so you wiggle your feet impatiently while anxiously awaiting their arrival. Finally the rest of the good guys show up. ""Wow, those are sweet looking robots!"" you think. You begin to settle in for a rip-roaring second half, until you realize there's not much else to them. It's like finally getting a date with that hot girl you've been crushing on, then realizing how unbelievably vapid she is before the main course is even served.<br/><br/>By then of course you're stuck for the remainder of the evening. You deal with the ill-fated attempts at creating drama. Every ten minutes, you wonder what the heck is happening or question the movie's logic, which is awful even for the genre. You laugh several times, though the causes are largely unintentional. Is that John Tuturro wildly out of place? Does Tad Hamilton actually have a leadership position in the military? You hope desperately that the show might end with something redeeming like an epic battle. Here come all the bad guys (out of nowhere), this could be good...but no. The final clash is big and loud, but also confusing and by that juncture, pointless. Emotional attachment isn't necessary in a popcorn movie, but there needs to be at least a minute level of curiosity. You don't care if they kill the humans or kill the robots or kill all of them. Whatever.<br/><br/>You sit through the credits, unsure of whether or not you want to be rewarded with a bonus scene. Yep, there's one. Yoikes, that was bad. At least it was short. Wait, there's one more, a final reminder of how miserably the movie failed, like the last rock that always crushed Wile E. Coyote.<br/><br/>The worst part is that ""Transformers"" has potential, as the trailer proves. Vehicles turn into giant robots! How is that not cool?!? But the flick scarcely if ever delivers on that promise. The visuals are representative of the whole movie. Well done, occasionally impressive, but too often fights or transformations are seen either from a distance too great or too close, depriving the audience of the true scope of the shot, and of any interest in the movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps a knowledge of the source material, with which I am only passingly familiar, would make the movie more palatable, but I doubt it. Director Michael Bay, whose projects have steadily declined since 1996's The Rock, has reached a new low.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Please don't encourage a sequel by seeing this movie. 2 of 10."

Whoever said earlier that the action shots were full of too many zooms, kudos to them because they are right on the money. My friend nearly puked a little when they played music from ""Kill Bill Vol 1"" in it. Another problem I had with it was that it kept changing from day to night at random when it was obviously a continuation of the same scene. John Turturro was highly miscast in the movie, as well as Jon Voit. Please, don't waste your time. It's awful. It makes me ashamed to be an American. ""The Triumph of Will"" was a Nazi propaganda movie that brainwashed millions of people into believing that the Nazi's were fighting for a just cause; that's still not half as bad as ""transformers.""

","Spider-Man 3, Pirates 3, and Fantastic Four 2 were all terrible, but in comparison to Transformers they are each a Citizen Cane.

Stereotypes: two sassy black grandmas; an Hispanic whose Spanish annoys the WASPs; a dumb, aggressive high school jock; the transformer named Jazz is presented as an American black (jazz music = black, apparently).<br/><br/>Cheap, sophomoric humor: teenage masturbation; dog peeing on transformer; transformer peeing on man; ""can I ride you home"" instead of ""can I give you a ride home.""

","I was astounded when I saw the ratings on this movie. nearly 40% of people had given it 10/10 stars.<br/><br/>Now I give it 5/10. The story is facile to the point of not really existing. Except for Shia LaBeouf, the acting was phoned in. The soundtrack was, well, just loud. It seemed to me that the whole point of the movie was to be a vehicle for product placements. In principle, with these flaws I normally wouldn't give a movie more than 4/10 (watch it on DVD on a rainy afternoon).<br/><br/>But I'm willing to cut it some slack because it does have some cool FX and there are some funny moments in there. I did laugh several times. And of course it is supposed to come from a cartoon heritage so maybe we shouldn't expect *too* much. (But there are other cartoon-based movies that were way, way better. Remember Spiderman, Dick Tracy, Sin City, even the first of the X-Men series). So I gave it 5/10. （Well worth renting the DVD. Entertaining if not uplifting.) I'm willing to see that rational people could disagree with me and because they have different expectations, give this movie a 7/10. (i.e. very well worth paying good money to see it at a cinema.) I can even accept that some people work on a different scale to me and give it 8/10 because they really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>But 34% of people giving it 10/10? Up there with Citizen Kane, Schindler's List, Gone with the Wind, Apocalypse Now, Lord of the Rings, City Lights, Blade Runner, Pulp Fiction etc etc etc.... Gimme a break! Seems most of the people rating movies these days are more interested in pushing ratings and driving box office than in giving any kind of honest opinion. Over half the raters gave this movie 10, 9, or 1/10. There is no way you could possibly say this movie deserves any of those ratings."

OK, some of the Autobots-Decepticons-dialogs were a bit corny, but not bad after all. Like they said in the movie, I mean Transformers is one hundred times better than Armaggedon, another Michael-Bay-film.<br/><br/>I also like the new design of the Transformers, especially Megatron's, and the play of Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox, Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson, especially the outstanding performance of LaBeouf.

","Hats off to Michael Bay, who went beyond anything - or any visuals - we've seen before to bring us this action fantasy spectacle. Almost every scene is masterfully done. The film is visually stunning and the action scenes are INCREDIBLE! The film combines so many elements of danger and suspense, and its also actually really funny during the lighthearted moments. It blends perfectly.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf is very good in this film. The score by Steve Jablonsky is also really good and very effective. For a film with a running time of 144 minutes there literally never was a dull moment, as it kept the viewer engaged and captivated all the time.

Shia LaBeouf's performance was great with decent support from Jon Voight and Megan Fox who played the loved interest. It was also very funny and not childish like the second and the camera-work wasn't all over the place. I will always like this first film, which Michael Bay has done well with but not the second.

The movie's beginning runs like this:<br/><br/>We start out with an intro from our friend Optimus Prime. He lays out how they got there. Then, we are introduced to Captain Lennox, a military man who just had a baby girl. As night falls, a strange helicopter lands in the military base.

He will grow up to be a great actor. <br/><br/>The subplots were slid into the main plot perfectly.

"df4205","1","25","51","16 September 2007"," A lame attempt disguised as a blockbuster
","While I know I'll get wailed on for this especially since its my first comment, I have to side with the haters on this one. I like so many others grew up in the 80's watching and loving Transformers. And when I saw that the movie was coming, I actually didn't have high hopes. With everything else that we loved as children being reinvented, revamped, reworked, retooled, reloaded, rehashed, and any other words that describe something wonderful being fed into a wood chipper then spat back onto our movie screens, this was no different than those three Wolverine plus ensemble films, or Willy and the chocolate factory. This movie could have been so huge, and everyone else other than me and my sister raves about it. I suppose I was immune to the LSD in the Pepsi. What film did they watch. <br/><br/>This is supposedly an action film that somewhere gets sucked up in a tornado and lands into a bad comedy. Practically every scene is laced with moronic jokes. The plot tries to focus on way to many non sequential characters. Am I watching a movie about robots? About military guys fighting a scorpion? About computer hackers? An American Pie teen sex comedy? <br/><br/>Shia Lebouff comes off as your typical done a thousand times teen underdog who is shy, and socially inept, yet gets the hot girl anyway. The girl comes off as very slutty to me for some reason. And the chemistry between the two just isn't believable. The girl's dialog is tedious at best with lines like ""They know your name"" yeah thanks I caught that 2 seconds ago when they said it. <br/><br/>The Transformers themselves are sad shells of their cartoon versions. The transformations themselves while cool are very confusing, many of the robots are similar in color scheme and you loose track of which one is which. I'm not even entirely sure what Megatron transformed into.....a jet of some sort? He was always a gun or a cannon in the show. <br/><br/>Basically if you loved this show as a child and don't get swept up by the hype and the thrall of ""Its transformers, so I'll love it no matter how bad it sucks"" mentality, you will hate this movie. You'll spend your entire time cringing at masturbation jokes, and peeing Autobots. Personally I think the taco bell dog joke was pretty bad, that social reference has been dead for years, let it go."

Megatron... the best with his henchmen Starscream.. loved this chase when Bonecrusher & Optimus prime fight on the highway. the second best the when one of the Decepticons transform in front of Sam..<br/><br/>Megan fox looks too hot & sexy.

Even the transformation are spectacular. The highlight would have to be Optimus Primes transformation when he is squaring off against Megatron.<br/><br/>Shia Lebouf puts heart and soul into his role and makes it believable for the audience. Megan Fox is good eye candy but also had a good role. Anthony Anderson was a little wasted as far as comic relief. John Turturro does a far better job in that department.<br/><br/>Overall, I know that many people don't like Michael Bay and what he does with his movies but here, in this movie, his style of direction fits the bill to a tee!

"Egamstk","8","9","15","3 August 2007"," Good film for the average viewer, but fans shouldn't expect much.
","I came into the film from a background that involved viewing the wonderful seasons of Beast Wars and some of the original seasons shown on TV. The original animated movie I had seen before and liked it (enough to get it on DVD). So, from this, when I heard of a Transformers non-animated film, I was a bit excited. There is so much lore to work with in the Transformers universe (even if there wasn't 20 years ago) that it's an incredibly viable Sci-Fi world filled with excellent possibilities.<br/><br/>I saw it the day it came out, a while back, but enough time to digest what was truly offered. Instead of going to length in paragraph form, I'll just try to break it down right-quick.<br/><br/>Tantalizing:<br/><br/>-The visual effects are stunning. The CG is incredibly well done (this coming form a discerning eye) and I considered going to see it again just to gaze.<br/><br/>-Basic storyline. The initial premise of the story holds up, if not always done to perfection. <br/><br/>-Some good comedy. There are some bright spots (the cell-phone creature at the lab made me giggle), but most of it is drawn right from Nickelodeon TV shows it seems. <br/><br/>-A decent story and film without exceeding amounts of violence, swearing, or over-the-top sexual intonations (aside from our Heroinness). <br/><br/>-Built for the beginner Transformer fan. <br/><br/>-Action scenes were well done. <br/><br/>Terrible: <br/><br/>-All the humans. This was probably the most disappointing. As much as there needs to be a background story involved, the majority of the movie centers around the cliché romance story between the awkward High-school goof getting the girl. For the Sci-Fi fan like myself who's already vested in the series, I was hoping for the main characters to actually be the Transformers themselves, instead of them acting as side-characters. Some of them were just means to an ends it seems, and some (like Jazz) were so incredibly short lived that I stood in disbelief. <br/><br/>-Too much comedy. At least for my tastes. Granted, I am probably biased from the previous relationship with the series, but when they were pulling bland jokes near the very end I found myself more annoyed than chuckling. There's merit in introducing some to break the tension, but when it's happening every 5 minutes the Sci-Fi punch loses its power. <br/><br/>-The lore. Nothing was done with it. I can honestly say I felt like the Allspark premise has merit, but at the same time it was never developed into anything. It's there, they want it, and in the end it's gone. This is the thing that started their entire civilization, something that offers ultimate power, and we see all of 30 seconds of Cybertron with a brief explanation of the war. It just wasn't enough for me. <br/><br/>-The ending of Megatron was hollow. It was Prime's duel, and making the leader of the Decepticons (which was almost omitted, it seems) fall to such an cheesy tactic made me feel cheated.<br/><br/>I'm not saying it's a poor movie. It has comedy, some action, and fulfills its purpose: to bring the next generation into the franchise. <br/><br/>But for those like myself, who wanted more substance out of the film, I left the theatre feeling a bit empty. I was always waiting for the part where the humans disappear and the Transformers to finally take control of their own movie. I wanted to see fights in space, Cybertron, and I wanted to see depth added to the characters I've come to enjoy along with an engaging storyline for the reasons behind so many unanswered questions left by the movie. What I got was an action film centered around an episode of Even Stevens or Boy Meets World that featured the Transformers.<br/><br/>A good film for the younger kids in the audience, but I only hope that any sequel made will actually be about the Transformers, and not some class clown from the suburbs and his dream-date."

LaBeouf was a good fit for a kid that just get freaked out the whole time and added a good level of comedy. I was pretty impressed with Megan Fox too. She is crazy hot, but did a pretty good job with her role as well. <br/><br/>It was really amazing to see the special effects of the film. It was hard to tell that it was not real throughout most of it. But that seems to be a Michael Bay specialty. Overall, this movie was really one of my favorite movies in a long time. It has been a while that I walked out of a movie so excited about it that I would have turned right around and watched it again. Seriously, amazing that is all there is to it.

Shia LaBeouf plays a thoroughly unlikable little wiener whose sole role in the movie is chasing after a girl 2 feet too tall for him and getting dating advice from a camaro. Also, no kid that age would have second thoughts about a girl so out of his league (Which I assume is peewee) because she has a record. What kind of Middle America suburban mentality are they trying to conjure up here? It's a shame John Turturro lowered himself to doing this crap because he's an actor worthy of better films. The only people I can see liking this are slow children and fan boys."

","I must admit I had never seen the actual series growing up and didn't really want to watch the movie, thinking it to be childish...<br/><br/>But it was far from it! The story flows effortlessly from start to finish, never dragging at any point. The action sequences are nothing short of epic, and the final battle is stunning. The effects are much better that I expected and actually are extremely good. Though the acting is okay, but it really doesn't matter. It is as good as the story requires and Shia LaBeouf's energetic, quirky and amusing style helps. Though Megan Fox's only purpose is to show herself, I'm not complaining.<br/><br/>Transformers is an action packed, thrill ride. It defines what the term blockbuster is.

But it still detaches itself from all the movies we've already seen (e.g. War of Worlds, Lord of the Rings)<br/><br/>The transformers, the alien machines, seem the most human characters in the movie.

"benjamin_lappin","4","26","54","28 August 2007"," A Self Indulgent Piece Of Bay-Mania
","Michael Bay is the amalgamation, the collective whole, the personification for everything, the entirety, the complete set of what is wrong with modern day cinema, and still movie goers lap this schmaltz up and make ridiculous claims built from ignorance that films like these are the ""greatest movie of the twenty-first century"" and some even have the gall to claim it ""best movie of all time"". For many I can appreciate that film is entertainment, that it is pure escapism, it's a place where you can sit back, unwind, drink your beverage, scoff your food and turn off your mind for ninety-plus minutes, however for people like myself whilst cinema could and should be entertaining, the entertainment doesn't always have to derive from tripe which can only and from hence forth be described as ""Bay-Mania"".<br/><br/>So what does this newly devised term mean? How is it applicable to Transformers? Well in short, I shall explain. Michael Bay is the type of director that produces grade-a cheese on an epic scale and Transformers falls foul of his mature cheddar touch. All of his films, barring possibly the original Bad Boys, have the same generic feel embedded deep within them, where it becomes almost like the Pixar film collection, same story, different animals. So within Transformers the (new) movie, we have the autobots taken from their quaint 1980s setting and placed in the manic action packed world of 2007 as they search for an object which, apparently, holds the fate of the world, and of course those evil decepitcons are after them. The Transformers themselves, well, they're a touch on American muscle side, big, colourful and brash, pretty much everything you'd expect from Bay-Mania. The special effects used for them is pretty staggering and there are some genuine moments of severe coolness emanating from quick-fire transformations which appeal to the kid within all of us, but unfortunately people become too obsessed with the look of a film and not the feel, and herein lies its major fault. <br/><br/>Typical Bay-Mania suggests that by sacrificing the storyline for special effects you can 'wow' audiences into an unknowing submission so that they go along for the ride rather than connect. This is atypical for most summer blockbusters, but even the first Spiderman film, and indeed the Batman 'prequel' managed to grasp the audiences attention with character development which made their stories rather unique. When your main protagonists however, are fifty foot mechanical entities whose personalities are predefined by comic book conventions, it's difficult to associate yourselves with them. Also the humans that become further associated with the autobots are far too generic, i.e. nerdish guy who 'believes' in the autobots, attractive female who tags along but has a great deal of knowledge over cars, standard American marine with sense, and politicians and generals without sense. The story meanders along from one 'cool' transformation to the next and eventually builds up into an all out frenzy in which thousands of extras, we daren't use the term people in a Bay-Mania film, are quite literally caught up in this mass free-for-all as one by one they all scream, run around and get trampled on, or hit by huge ten foot tow missiles. It's all harmless computer generated fun, but to be honest, I want more from a film these days. <br/><br/>People brandished Spielburgs name around, from his seat in production, citing that he would make sure this would be an ""awesome"" film, but it doesn't work like that these days, as even he succumbs to the sirens call that is the over indulgence in CGI over plot. So what does transformers bring to the film medium? Nothing, not a jot. It's inoffensive fun to a degree, despite all the jaunty unnecessarily confused angles in the fighting sequences, but a mere firework display of a film isn't enough. It's films such as these which have convinced the mainstream movie going masses, that this is acceptable, that this is what we should want to see and what we should aspire to create and critique, and I'm sorry but that's just not acceptable. Michael Bay represents all which is wrong with Hollywood, and that's profit over prolific, money over mesmerising, more revenge of the sith than return of the jedi, and what only infuriates me more is that Hollywood allow him to continue, and now I hear they're going to remake The Birds? No doubt there'll be eagles transforming into giraffes, and needless car chases as the heroes are hunted down by ten foot tall pigeons. I digress from the film at hand but this is what you get from Bay-Mania, unnecessary genericism, and for those that enjoy this film, you're the ones only furthering his narcissism. Autobots...jog on!"

"arcturax","1","20","40","26 October 2007"," Complete crap
","Honestly, was this the best they could do with a huge budget, computer animation for the robots and people like Stephen Spielberg on board? Where do I begin? First the robots... the CGI is neat looking but the robots themselves are over designed and look like they were drawn by Louis Wain. It is very hard to distinguish one transformer from another unless they are changed into a vehicle at the moment, which makes the quick moving battle scenes a confused mess where you sometimes find it hard to know who is on which side.<br/><br/>Next, let's tackle the plot. You have a very thin and contrived (not to mention cliché filled) plot which wouldn't even have made a very good comic book story. Very disappointing indeed. They could have come up with something more interesting than a weird cube and a frozen evil robot found by some obscure arctic explorer 100 years ago.<br/><br/>Finally let's look at the characters and their interaction and development. For the transformers themselves, you know very little other than they are robots and the some are good, some are evil. Some turn into cars, others into tanks or jets. You get no background on them at all and unless you have seen the 80's cartoons, you have no idea who they are and you really don't get to know these characters during the movie. While many people might remember them from the 80's cartoons, a little more background would be nice for the younger generation who missed out on the 80's altogether.<br/><br/>As for the main human characters, there is little to redeem them. They are poorly acted and are mainly there to scream and tremble as robots battle around them and destroy the city they live in. Sam is a complete loser who is sadly trying to win the heart of a girl (Mikaela) who is way out of his league and looks more like someone who constructed in a plastic surgeons office than a real girl. Why does every movie today involve a couple who is either separated and hate each other or in hopeless crush situation that you know will not last past the adventure? You just don't have normal kids in films anymore (though Sam comes the closest). The are either super crackers who can break into the pentagon while typing with their toes, modified to look like pageant models or have some mysterious figure in their family history that destines them for some great adventure.<br/><br/>The movie is poorly executed with CGI battles one moment and a sickening crush on the hot girl scene the next. The characters are shallow and have few it any redeeming qualities to them. You find yourself wishing they would get killed no matter who comes out the winner among the robots just so you didn't have to put up with the slow and boring scenes of the boy trying to make it with the plastic girl. In the end the movie becomes just one big smash fest, which while fun to watch, is ruined by the length of time spent griping about how annoying the human characters are. Once the real action starts, you are just ready for this crap bomb to be over. 1 star, and that is because they had so much potential and came up with such an empty movie in the end."
"thenexusone","1","30","64","6 July 2007"," Is everyone this retarded?
","It is hard to believe a true fan of the Generation 1 series would write such a horribly muddled movie that vomits the concept of the terribly constructed Transformer: Armada series which was thankfully canned. Yet, here it is on the big screen and very much like every other sappy teen love comedy with action story we've been subjugated to the last 10+ years. Its old, you made Optimus Prime dance around the outside of a house to hide from parents, then had a whole unnecessary conversation between mother, father and child about masturbation and the code names to call it. Reminds me of Pearl Harbor, The Hulk and a few other films out there, if you cut out the stupidity, drama and comedy, some of the core realism and originality of what it once was is there, if only for a few fleeting moments. Please stop pissing on people's childhoods for money."
"SloberDon","Null","22","45","7 July 2007"," Unsatisfying & Forgettable Summer Misfire
","I really am sad to say that Transformers was a misfire. I was looking forward to this film and was disappointed by this unsatisfying and incredibly shallow movie. It's the movie equivalent of cotton candy. It's large, bright and appears full until you go to take a bite and it disappears. It's all fluff delivering a soulless, babbling film. Most of the cool special effects are negated by presenting them with the jarring, shaky camera style. Since everything on screen doesn't read true, I guess Bay decided to jolt the viewer and to try and fool the eye by shaking everything up on many of the action sequences. My eye isn't so easily fooled and the jumbled mess of action gets washed away in the nauseating confusion. You expected plot stupidity and flaws in logic everywhere but you also expected those ridiculous flaws to be overcome by fun action and explosions. Sadly, that's not the case with Transformers. There's not one satisfying robot brawl that was not ruined by the shaky zoom of the camera. The Megatron Vs Optimus fight was a useless garble that looked like an erector set accident. The acting was beyond horrible (Megan Fox may be a cute little girl but she sure can't act) and the plot was awful. Transformers doesn't have much going for it, unfortunately.<br/><br/>When stupidity overcomes the fun, you're pulled out of a movie. Any intelligent person will ask themselves, why doesn't that Decepticon just kill the army rangers instead of following them for no reason? How does Megatron not get Sam in the old building when he's only a few feet behind him on the ground floor? (Did he really climb forty stories that fast?) Where did Optimus go when the brawl started? Why did the Transformers need to hide from Sam's parents? How do you call down an air-strike in a populated area using Morse code and old walkie talkies when everything in aviation is computer controlled(guidance, flight, propulsion)? There's far too many dumb moments to list. ALL of this stupidity hurts but it could've been forgiven had the action sequences been fulfilling. They're simply not satisfying enough to overcome the dumb plot, bad acting and to elevate this erector set GM commercial above an easily forgettable summer misfire."
"ndanell","1","31","67","3 July 2007"," Dazzling effects cannot support a feeble plot
","We are far beyond a time when special effects alone could carry a movie. Unfortunately, that's what they have tried to do here.<br/><br/>A weak plot full of one-dimensional human characters leaves barely any room for the Transformers fans went to this movie to see. Terrible designs aside, the robots had little character and practically no dialogue to speak of. The plot itself is simple enough to follow, and yet somehow they still managed to leave it chock full of holes and loose ends. A pointlessly long and drawn out introduction leads to a rushed and underwhelming ending- and If you're hoping to see any epic robot battles, you had best not blink during the movie.<br/><br/>There were some humorous scenes mixed in, but most were tacky and some were downright insulting.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was a huge disappointment, even for someone going in with no expectations. It fails to deliver as a stand alone movie as well as a film adaptation of the Transformers fans know and love."

","THIS CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS YOU WILL NOT BE BIG-TIME SPOILED!<br/><br/>Its almost a kids film. I had HUGE expectations for this film...like as many of you do right now. let me give you a BIG pointer: <br/><br/>DROP ALL EXPECTATIONS NOW!<br/><br/>If you go in with huge expectations, you will be disappointed. Like me. I will post a thread in the forums and will answer all questions that people want to know, like what happens with this and that blah blah.<br/><br/>But the SFX are INCREDIBLE. I mean absolutely incredible. The only problem , and I'm sure you will all cringe when you hear this, the camera is really shaky. I think Bay wanted to make us a part of the action, but it didn't work. The camera was too shaky and blurry that you couldn't even see the Transformers properly when they were in action. Which SUCKED. Plus: for all the fanboys wanting to know, the transformations are fast, so don't blink when your watching. Plus each character only transforms about once or twice throughout the whole film.<br/><br/>THIS IS WHERE THE SPOILER-SPOILERS COME IN.<br/><br/>The plot was quite...well....horrible. The Decepticons were introduced 3/4 way through the films, the Autobots half way. There is a lot of flip flop at the start, but the action begins 5 minutes in. Its sort of in a zig zag effect.<br/><br/>Megatron had about 20 minutes of screen time overall, with about 3 minutes of dialogue. Starscream was pretty much the only other Decepticon that spoke. And he had 3 lines. It may have even been 2.<br/><br/>Overall, I think its a kids/teenagers film (I'm 15, by the way). AMAZING action scenes, AMAZING SFX, good storyline, great acting.<br/><br/>I will say this again, go into the cinema thinking this is a brand new film. Original idea. No Expectations. Don't try to relate it to the original Transformers. It wont work. <br/><br/>I gave it a 9/10, just to be nice :P"

","IF ONLY................................................................. They had made a more coherent (or less scattered) story, not wasted so much time searching for the pair of you know whats and made the script more realistic and natural ( you'll know when you see it) this would have been up there with Terminator 2 in terms of great sci fi robot pics. I can easily see past the changes they made to the transformers of old- ie personality and what the turn into, if all of the above were corrected. I state this because most if not all of the action sequences were astounding. The sound effects, look and movement of the robots in action was almost flawless and this was the film's saving grace- along with the great voices for prime and megatron. Just when I was REALLY loving this, it cut to something else and spent too long on scenes that wern't needed at all. If there's one negative thing about the fight sequences it's that they occurred too often towards the end, spoiling us then building to a finally that ended too suddenly, making the film end with a whimper instead of a bang (the whole film is a bang i suppose, so it's just comparatively speaking). What a great looking movie, could have had more soul though, but I'll definitely see it at least one more time at the cinema!! 7.5 out of 10"

","Well, as a long time IMDb user, I've always come here for generally fair and even reviews on films. Normally you get the general ups and downs reviews and I find most movie web pages give an accurate representation of what to expect. However, after anticipating this movie greatly, and seeing the rave reviews on IMDb, I eagerly set out to the movie theater with a few friends.<br/><br/>I could barely contain my laughter during the most serious parts of this film. Never have I seen a plot so butchered by poor directing, and even WORSE dialog. There were two aspects of this film that I liked: 1) The transformations. Watching the robots morph back and forth between vehicle and killing machine was absolutely incredible. The CGI was impressive. 2) Shia Labueff gave a very good performance.<br/><br/>The rest of the film was awful. The plot is filled with holes. And the never-ending unnecessary small plots are confusing, unnecessary, and often left unfinished. The action sequences were always on the BRINK of being cool, but then would stop or cut away before you saw anything. The robots fighting to closely to actually see the reality of what they were doing to each other, and the needless shrapnel, smoke, and fire often obscured what could have been some epic fights. The needless plugs for BOTH political parties and views on Iraq, and one for one of Bay's own films were disgusting. Characters whom play significant roles rarely are given a name, and only 1 of the transformers(prime himself) has anything beyond a three scentence dialog. Most simply shout things like ""Want of piece of me!"" or ""I wanna blast him!"" However, if I had to sum up this movie in one word it would be Cliché. Bay manages to use EVER cliché I could imagine. They range from the clichéd high school movie: a 27 year old high school juniors who is a jerk to his girlfriend; A sociology teacher who doesn't like his job; an eccentric mother who says awkward things in front of her son. To the flag waving army movie involving marines who ""just want to see their daughter for the first time,"" or like to ""remember weekends,"" to whom 'losing isn't an option.' All the way down to the stereotypical overweight African American, who shouts things like ""stay of my gramamas floor,"" and enjoys eating donuts. The list goes ON AND ON AND ON.<br/><br/>So, I IMPLORE you, wait until this film is out on video to see it. Save your 10 dollars. At least then you can watch the cool transformations over and over again and skip the rest of the movie."

He is probably the only funny thing in this movie. While the action and characters are good the humor is so crude only 12 year olds will find it funny. Everyone else will just groan.

"Screen_Blitz","8","2","2","15 June 2017"," Michael Bay's Transformers is an energetic, hyperkinetic explosive fun. Someone pass the popcorn
","This loud, explosive live-action adaptation of Hasbro's popular toy franchise powerfully represents the signature big-budget filmmaking methodology of Michael Bay. It is 144 minutes of loud explosions and heavy metal-on-metal mayhem compiled in a dumb popcorn movie deluxe. Upon sitting through the hour mark, it is clear that Bay does not intend on engaging viewers at an intellectual level. That does not meant this film aborts on deliver an enormous amount of fun. Produced by Dreamworks and Paramount Pictures, This bombastic science-fiction piece sees Michael Bay operating on his trademark visual style, pumping the adrenaline-fueled testosterone through over-the-top explosions and brisk pacing. The outcome is a wild ride flowing with just enough to distract from the sporadically clumsily narrative. This film follows 17-year old Sam Witwicky (played by Shia Labeouf), a high student junior who is surprised with a 1979 Chevrolet Camaro by his father (played by Kevin Dunn). What the young man doesn't know is that the car is an autobot in disguise. When the car morphs into the giant Autobot, Sam and his beautiful crush Mikaela (played by Megan Fox) find themselves into in between a war between the Autobots lead by Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) and the Decepticons who are in pursuit of a mysterious cube known as the Allspark, a powerful cube capable opening up a world the afterlife of both the Autobots and the Decepticons. In the process, they must escape from the suspicious law enforcement officials led by Agent Simmons (played by John Turturro).<br/><br/>With Michael Bay behind the steering wheel, this movie discards from the elements of the 1986 animated movie, with the first one being the feature of human characters put into the others. The second being considerably less kid-friendly than what long-time fans have been devoted to. This movie takes the violent robot-on-robot action and cranks up a notch in a noisy, explosion-laden galore; in addition to some teen-oriented humor. Nevertheless, Bay knows how to deliver the fun and fulfill the promises of rambunctious action set pieces -- and there is plenty of it. Building are crumbled to pieces, cars are flipped over, and the streets are littered with robotic debris showering everywhere. These sequences are the biggest attractions to this bombastic thrill ride, and manage to stand above all other aspects, particularly the plot. Surrounding the plot involving a hot conflict between the Autobots and the Decepticons is a slew of subplots that at times put the story in a little topsy turvy, one involving the government agency pursuing after Sam and Mikaela for questioning on the whole giant robot chaos, another involving Rachel Taylor and Anthony Anderson in which makes very little sense. Above all, the best thing the writer give the story is that it at least make somewhat sense. But for those who just come in for the action and visual grandeur, the story may likely be the least of their concern. As for the acting department, Shia Labeouf is okay in the role of Sam Witwicky, swarming with cheeky humor and humility. Megan Fox on the other hand, stands out more for serving as eye candy with her sex appeal than for her performance. With frequent lingering shots of her body, this film holds very little restraints for sexualizing her, for better or worse. John Turturro has a few odd laughs in his scenes, but nothing that is likely to raise the eyebrows. <br/><br/>Transformers is an explosive action thrill ride bound to please not only fans who grew up with the popular toy franchise (or TV shows), but also most certainly those hungry for a near-two hours some heavy special-effects mayhem. It is loud, it is feverishly energetic, but most importantly, it is a whole of fun."

","Transformers is from the director named Michael Bay. He is well known besides for Bad Boys, The RockÂ… This film tends to lead to a direction of mindlessly entertainment and enjoyment. As we've come to expect, robot's destructions and combats, we do get these aspects in veritable satisfaction. Michael Bay is well known for chaotic, blotchy destruction that gets convoluted or diverting. Either way, this film embraces these that makes the yet the best Transformers film out of the series.<br/><br/>Transformers follows a young teenage boy who wants to buy his first car ever. Meanwhile, a conflict between the Autobots and the Decepticons intensify as they strive to retrieve 'The Cube' that can transform any material into a biological metal being. Sam (Shia LaBeouf) perchance buys a car that tends to be a transformer as he gets yanked into a situation that can redeem the human race with his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox). As the plot is simple enough, it is equitable for this type of film. Audiences do not bother about the plot being splendidly the prime. Most of the audiences crave great and astonishing robot actions. We fulfill these aspects from the film. Evenly, the visuals are marvelous. The CGI is flawless as it is the fundamental requirement and it looks precisely realistic. The sound is spotlessly well crafted. There is a gracious finish to the sound as the immaculately designed cars transform into frantic robots. However, the characters are very poorly scripted and executed. They are notably unrealistic and sometimes sadly annoying. Although frenetic robot actions are stunning and frigid to look at, flat characters still bother the film to a negative side ward. Shia LaBeouf is surprisingly tolerable as the teenage boy who is mentally junior. Megan Fox is usual, she is adequate but faulty at some acting. The acting is just adequate or exceptional in terms of big action flicks like this. <br/><br/>Overall, Transformers is the film you may or may not have expected the outcome to be. It may entertain you or find the movie to be boring and disappointing. In my opinion, I was still entertained through all the years and gave chances for the sequels to be superior. <br/><br/>Grade: B+"
"MaximumMadness","8","2","2","7 December 2016"," ""Transformers""- Surprisingly fun and breezy compared to it's over-bloated and under-written follow-ups. Still a great, entertaining treat nearly a decade later!
","One of the most fascinating franchises in the world of modern cinema has got to be director Michael Bay's near decade-long cinematic opus known simply as the ""Transformers"" series. Inspired by the classic cartoons and toys of the 80's, the current line of feature-film releases is quite something to behold... Four films with a fifth on the way next year to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the original film. And all four having been massive hits financially, bringing in billions in revenue. Yet all four have also suffered from consistent and even growing disdain from not only critics, but from general audiences as a whole. Every announcement or trailer for the latest entry is instantly met with rolled eyes and exasperated scoffs from film-goers the world over. It's what makes the franchise such an interesting one... They are so frequently dismissed and ridiculed, yet people keep going back to them with each new release. <br/><br/>And I do think a big part of why this happens is this film, 2007's ""Transformers."" Because it was such a surprising Summer-time treat upon initial release... it was just good, plain fun and it won many people over with its quirky sense of humor and grand visual scope. So no matter how many follow-ups of exceedingly low quality they pump out... no matter how many missteps the franchise takes with each and every sequel... no matter just how terrible some later films have turned out... we all keep paying for our tickets and popcorn when the newest entry is released, in some hope that it will recapture even a fraction of this film's splendid sense of entertainment value.<br/><br/>The film starts with the sort-of classic tale of a boy and his car, as teenager Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) gets a yellow Chevrolet as a gift. However, he soon discovers that his car has a life of its own, and belong to a race of shape-shifting alien beings from the planet Cybertron. These aliens have split into two factions- the heroic Autobots lead by Optimus Prime, who Sam's car Bumblebee follows... and the dreaded and vile Decepticons. As it turns out, the Decepticons are tracking Sam, having come to learn that he inadvertently holds the coordinates to an ancient device known as the ""AllSpark"", which they are seeking at all costs. And so, Sam and his massive crush Mikaela (Megan Fox) must team up with Optimus and the Autobots in order to keep the Decepticons from getting their hands on the mysterious AllSpark device.<br/><br/>The film is very much an exercise in pure escapism. From the cheese-fest opening monologue to the thrilling but overlong climax, the film never loses sight of its goal, which is to entertain first, ask questions later. And I think that's a large part of its success. This is not a film that wants to bog itself down on complex characterization or sublime story development. If there's a scene of characters talking, there's going to be a joke. If a robot is on-screen, there's going to be a fight. And thanks to a solid enough script and Bay's trademark kinetic directorial style, it works very well. There's hardly a dull moment to be had, the human characters are all instantly identifiable archetypes, the robotic characters are just a ton of fun, and the visuals are all too often stunning. You'll be shocked at just how perfectly realized the Transformers are in this film, especially for a mid-2000's release.<br/><br/>Beyond that, I found the cast to be fairly charming as well. Despite his public downfall in recent years, LaBeouf shines as Sam, giving him a wonderfully awkward social sensibility and a great physical performance. He really is quite engaging as our human lead. Fox is obviously here more for looks than personality thanks to Bay's constant oggling of her character, but I actually thought she did a halfway decent job here. The film may treat her as little more than eye- candy, but I think there's a little more going on with her than many will give her credit for. Supporting roles by the likes of John Turturro, Jon Voight and Anthony Anderson are all a ton of fun. And the voice-over rolls by a cast include original cartoon alum Peter Cullen and the wonderfully insidious Hugo Weaving give a great deal of depth to the animated characters on-screen.<br/><br/>Look, ""Transformers"" isn't going to win any major awards. It's a popcorn movie at its heart and it knows this and celebrates it with each passing moment. And while I could drone on and on about the faults that are present, it wouldn't change the fact that I got a huge kick out it. I love it. And I still watch it here and there, even ten years later. While the subsequent sequels that followed have been of a generally sub-par quality, it doesn't change the fact that the original is a fantastic, breezy bit of good fun.<br/><br/>And so, I give 2007's ""Transformers"" a very good 8 out of 10. Pop it in. Shut off your brain. And get ready to have a good time!"

","I've been a Transformers fan since I was 5. I was going into this movie will little to no expectations because all I wanted to see was to see big robots kick each others butts. Now, I was a little disappointed with the fact that the action was limited but when there was robot action then I was amused. I only have a few problems with this movie and one of them is way too much screen time for the humans. No one cares about them we came to see robots ripping each other apart give us that and not humans that will just forget after a couple of days. The other problem is that they killed off one of the best Autobots ever. Jazz. He was one of my favorite and they turned him into a stereotypical black transformer with a couple of lines and barely any action scenes. That was disappointing. IN the cartoon he was hip and cool and no this bullcrap. I'm sorry but that's just not cool. Optimus Prime was cool to see so good for Hasbro<br/><br/>Overall Grade-- A-"
"citruspanda","8","2","2","23 June 2016"," One Good Time
","A lot of people have problems with the Transformers series, including the running joke about the crazy amount of explosions. Critics savage this entire series, and just look at the ratings on Rotten Tomatoes. There are two opposing sides for the Transformers line, that being the standard movie audience, me and you, and the critics. And these two sides just can't seem to get along. The point of these movies is to have a good time, and that is exactly what I did when I watched this movie. Now, I do agree with the critics in some certain areas, such as the more than obvious tie-in with Hasbro, some critics saying it is just a glorified Hasbro commercial. I can agree with that, but does that really matter?<br/><br/>First off, I do have some problems with Transformers, certainly. One of which being the run time. It is hard for a movie to stay very interesting for 143 minutes, and for a while in the middle it got rather stale. The variety of the camera tricks and action sequences can be considered at least somewhat lacking as well. That's for sure. Also, the camera work can be somewhat annoying at times as well. It was clear what was being attempted, but the execution was just a little off. Shaky action scenes and heavily repeated camera tricks can get a little old sometimes.<br/><br/>But never mind that, I'll move on to the good stuff, which was much more abundant. Most important, the movie was fun. That was what it should have been, and that is what it was. Big explosions, big action, and lots of fast-paced, adrenaline-filled scenes. The CGI was a big part of this, seeing as how it was near flawless. It's difficult to make giant alien robots turning into cars and back multiple times look real, but, there you go. And honestly, maybe that's the only redeeming quality of the movie. Acting is par-level, script has shaky legs at times, and the rest of the movie is generally average. But the insane action scenes and purely amazing cinematic rush, to me, is deserving of an 8/10."

","I expected this to be an action movie only, but it also has a lot of hilarious jokes similar to American Pie, such as when the robots were making lots of noise, Sam's parents asked him something embarrassing. There is some action, but there is also drama. At least the action and drama aren't so bad. However, the characters weren't so likable. Megan Fox was just eye candy (yes, she was hot, at least) and Shia LaBeouf was not a likable character.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/><ul><li>Really funny</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Good action</li></ul><br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/><ul><li>Characters aren't so likable</li></ul><br/><br/>Review: 8"
"brchthethird","6","2","2","5 July 2015"," Still the best of the series
","This is where it all started: where big-budget blockbusters started to dumb down at a higher rate, and where Michael Bay's career started to coalesce into the cynical (but very profitable) mess it is today. That being said, TRANSFORMERS is still rather entertaining if you take if for what it is. The plot is as convoluted as expected, yet probably the simplest one in the series. The Autobots must find the Allspark before the Decepticons do, and Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf) is an integral part in helping them. Aside from that, you have Michael Bay's usual fixation with military hardware, hot models, cool cars, and 'splosions. He really does have a distinct style in his body of work, for better or worse. Watching it for the second or third time, all I could really think about was how unfunny the humor was, and how the camera-work was headache-inducing. Yet, this first Transformers movie remains watchable if for no other reason than that I know the quality is all downhill from here. The acting is decent, for the most part. The visual effects still hold up really well, even if most of the robot action is obfuscated with clever camera angles and ""shaky cam."" Slow motion is really the only time the viewer is given the opportunity to take in some of the best visual moments. The score is also decent and doesn't really get in the way. When it comes down to it, I don't like this as much as I may have the first time, but it still entertained me. Occasionally, something that speaks to one's inner 12-year-old can be fun, and that's basically what TRANSFORMERS is."
"joshuadrake-39480","8","2","2","4 May 2015"," Cool way to start TRANSFORMERS
","I do my film review of the TRANSFORMERS movie franchise and I am going to start with the first installment of the franchise, released in 2007.<br/><br/>The film follows Sam Witwicky, a teenager who gets caught up in a war between the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons, two factions of alien robots who can disguise themselves by transforming into everyday machinery.<br/><br/>The Autobots intend to use the AllSpark, the object that created their robotic race, in an attempt to rebuild Cybertron and end the war while the Decepticons desire control of the AllSpark with the intention of using it to build an army by giving life to the machines of Earth.<br/><br/>The film was developed in 2003 and the film went into production in 2006 and it was released on July 3, 2007 and the film was really amazing when I first saw the feature film and I was impress to see the Transformers on screen and I really did not know what they were until I went online and found out more about them.<br/><br/>The CGI and action sequences were amazing and the Autobots and the Decepticons were really created well with the help of computer-generated imagery and the final fight between Optimus Prime and Megatron is my favorite action sequence in the Transformers film released in 2007.<br/><br/>My favorite Transformer characters are Optimus Prime, Bumbleebee, Jazz and Ratchet. Peter Cullen does the voice of Optimus Prime and he does a great job. Mark Ryan does a really great job as Bumblebee. ""Family Matters"" actor Darius McCrary plays Jazz. Robert Foxxworthy plays Ratchet and they are both amazing in their performances. Hugo Weaving from V FOR VENDETTA and THE MATRIX TRILOGY does a really great job and it is amazing to hear him as Megatron.<br/><br/>The human characters are also great. Shia LaBeouf is really good as the lead, while Megan Fox is really hot and is amazing and she was the right choice to play the love interest of Shia LaBeouf and the two on-screen together is really amazing in this film. Tyrese Gibson is real cool. Josh Duhamel is really amazing too. Jon Voight, Anthony Anderson and Rachael Taylor plays their parts really amazing in their performances and the screen time they have.<br/><br/>Steve Jablonsky's score is really amazing in this film and I really enjoyed Linkin Park's song, ""What I've Done"" and I loved the music video and their other two songs from the other two films, ""New Divide"" and ""Iridescent"" in Revenge of the Fallen and Dark of the Moon and the song by Imagine Dragons from Age of Extinction is called ""Battle Cry"". I liked that song, too.<br/><br/>Overall, TRANSFORMERS is a perfect movie by all means and I am giving this an 8 out of 10."

2nd Best Best Live Action Transformers Movie Out of the series
9/10"
"CinemaCocoa","9","2","2","12 July 2014"," Fun, silly, entertaining. Unleashed my inner child!
","I feel very sorry for those many people who jumped on the bandwagon of hatred towards this series and forget how outright enjoyable the first movie really is.<br/><br/>A simple story of a boy getting his first car, only to discover his car is an advanced alien robot in disguise! He finds himself caught in the middle of an intergalatic civil war between the noble Autobots and merciless Decepticons, and Earth becomes the battlefield.<br/><br/>When Michael Bay stepped up to direct the first live action interpretation of the 1980s cult cartoon Transformers (yes, I use the word ""cult"" specifically) there were some groans and doubts. But think about it, what does he do best? Explosions and cars. What does Transformers constitute of? Explosions and cars. Under the executive producer eyes of Steven Spielberg and Dreamworks Studios, Bay's outright silliness is restrained and this film actually feels structured. This comes from some decent acting from/direction of Shia LeBeouf as Sam, regular boy who wants to win the affection of Megan Fox's Mikaela. It takes a good forty minutes before the action takes off and our planet is bombarded with thirty-foot tall talking robots. As a fan, my inner child was (and still does) itch with anticipation! This is the Transformers mandate, heck it is in their motto: Robots in Disguise! We see Bumblebee, Sam's guardian, as a regular car... the film knowingly holds off showing us transformations for as long as possible. This makes the reveal of all the others, especially childhood cartoon hero Optimus Prime, incredible to see!<br/><br/>You have to understand. As a kid this sort of thing, showing real life Transformers, was only a thing of dreams, the technology wasn't here until this movie. This film glorifies the act of these regular vehicles changing shape and continuing on their way. I still get some chills as Starscream swings around, leaping into the air and transforms.<br/><br/>Another thing this film achieved is often overlooked now. It was a massive success. I mean a massive success. Not only was it nominated for Academy Awards for special effects (and was robbed in broad daylight, The Golden Compass, seriously?!?) but Transformers was always a geeky, disrespected cartoon even at its height (sorry fandom, but it was) and this film broadened the franchise's influence tenfold. Everybody loved Bumblebee, for example, and learned how people like me respected Optimus Prime as a character. It was wonderful! So many newformed fans appearing everywhere. Even my sister enjoyed it! If you are one of these people and in denial of your initial feelings towards this film, I feel very sorry for you. There is a huge number of fickle-minded people out there.<br/><br/>Is it perfect? No. Michael Bay still has some influence, though not a great deal, and there are a handful of human characters who do not belong. The story takes unnecessary detours and bypasses just to include human characters who could have been cut completely to make a sharper film. Does it detract from the film as a whole? No. Yes, there are suspensions of disbelief, yes it is silly and the climax is a myriad of explosions but honestly! This is Transformers! For a first try at making something so ridiculous as this cartoon a living, breathing film, this hits it out of the park and lays a good foundation for improvement. Sadly, for this film (not unlike The Matrix) its sequels do their best to avoid improvement...<br/><br/>It is a fun, entertaining action romp. Exactly what Transformers was and should forever be."
"Brettyboy007","9","2","2","9 July 2014"," The start of the Transformers franchise
","In 2007, there was a movie that premiered on July 3rd, 2007 in theaters. This movie was Transformers. It was the first live-action film made since the animated series in the 80's. The director is Michael Bay, who previously worked on films such as Bad Boys.<br/><br/>The story is the Autobots and Decepticons are searching for an artifact called the Allspark that will save their planet. The Autobots wish to restore their world Cybertron while the Decepticons wish to destroy Earth. Humans are left in the middle of this. <br/><br/>Bay had a view in mind for this first film, and it was big explosions, eye candy and superb CGI for the Transformers.<br/><br/>The characters introduced in this first one are Shia Labeouf, well known for that kids TV show Even Stevens and Holes. The eye candy is the gorgeous Megan Fox, who I had not heard much of until this movie. Josh Duhamel plays the commander of a group of survivors after a base attack. Another cool thing is Peter Cullen, who was in the animated series voicing Optimus Prime, reprises his role again as Prime.<br/><br/>The acting is very good and the background characters like Shia's parents create a sense of humor that will have people laughing every time they appear on screen.<br/><br/>What makes this movie great is the Transformers themselves. Bay focused a lot of his time to them and did an amazing job with their transforming.<br/><br/>Transformers is an amazing start to the franchise and does follow up to several sequels which I will do reviews for as well. Definitely everyone should give this a chance especially if you were a fan of the animated series like me. Check it out."
"user-543-975655","8","2","2","8 June 2014"," Impressive
","Since the new Transformers movie is coming out soon, I thought I would re-watch some of the old ones. I had forgotten how awesome the first Transformers was. I hope Transformers 4: The Age of Extinction is at least AS cool as this movie. Some people rip on this movie because it is too impossible. The only thing I have to say to that is it is not supposed to be realistic. If there is a movie that has giant robots that can transform into cars and planes and trucks and back again, you should automatically know it isn't going to be realistic. But once you get past that, it truly is an awesome movie. The special effects were amazing, considering that the movie was made 7 years ago. The special effects people really did an amazing job on this movie. In fact, they paid so much attention to detail, they even made the Transformers blink, move their teeth, and even breathe, I think. However, because they were robots, it was hard to read their emotions. That doesn't bother me, though. The acting was also great. It was a good idea to have the Transformers have different styles of talking and behaving. In a way that made them seem a little bit more human, and you feel sympathetic for them when one dies or gets hurt or injured. The actual humans in the movie were very believable characters, and you feel for them as well. Everyone in the movie did a very good job, and kept the movie fun to watch. I always look for that in a movie. The story was somewhat taken from the 1984-1987 TV series, but it was still kept original in some ways. I haven't seen the series, so I can't really expound on that. Sorry. Although, the story was kept very entertaining by the writers, and there were only one or two dull moments. Michael Bay did a wonderful job directing this movie, but there was one thing I had a problem with. I don't know if it was his idea or the cinematographer's idea, but the camera was way too shaky in some of the battle scenes. There was too much going on to have a shaky camera like that, and that is the reason I give it an 8/10, because there is way too much of it. But if you are OK with shaky cameras, you will enjoy this movie 100%. Probably. Hopefully. Maybe. You might. Anyway, the dialogue was good, too. There were no bad jokes, no dull speeches, and nothing else of that sort. That's really all I have to say. I hope you found my review helpful, and feel free to check out my other reviews. See ya!"
"Sirus_the_Virus","10","2","2","3 August 2009"," Here's a shock... Michael Bay has actually done an amazing film.
","The original Transformers film is awesome. It's an eyefull of special effects,humor, and a lot of action. I won't go into the plot because there's too much to say. Transformers has tons of celebrities.Including Shia Lebeouf, Megan Fox,Jon Voigt, Josh Dushmel,Tyrese Gibson, John Turturro, and others. Transformers is an awesome film. It was sad to see such a good film collapse with it's sequel,The Revenge of the fallen. This plot makes some sense. Where the plot and everything in Transformers 2 makes no sense at all. I don't even worry about the plot in this film. Transformers is a fun thrill ride with eye popping special effects and cool action. As I said earlier, I don't really pay that much attention to the story plot. I mean I do but not that much. I am too distracted with how cool the special effects are and how cool the Transformers look. The film is really entertaining, and it's easy to love. I have seen it a hundred times and it hasn't gotten old."
"funky-dee","9","2","2","14 July 2009"," This movie is good, but...
","After i saw this movie i became a real Transformers fan and started watching the animated series and the old cartoon.I don't think this is better than the second one, because this is too simple.Autobots vs Decepticons + the all spark.In Revenge of The Fallen, they took it a lot further with a lot of spots from the plot of the old cartoon.The second movie got a lot of negative feedback, but i think that movie is the best thing, that has happened to Transformers in 12 years.Anyways this movie is great, but somewhat simple.I also didn't like the part, that Jazz got killed and didn't come back in the second one like Megatron.They should have also had more Transformers on this movie and more things taken from the old show."
"Smithy_IZdabest","10","2","2","27 June 2009"," Michael Bay is a blockbuster genius
","Transformers 2 does exactly what most fans go to see it for, it pits robot against robot on the big screen. It's an all-action explosion fest, directed by the king of over the top summer blockbusters, that turn out to be a funny, action packed flick. The CGI through out the film is top notch, one of best examples in the sci-fi genre in my opinion. the storyline, although has been largely set out for the writers due to the movie being based on a comic book series, is good quality and perfect for this type of summer blockbuster. uncomplicated, humorous and action-filled. Scenes between Meg Fox and Shia Le beuf are acted with affection and this clearly shows on screen, again, we haven't paid money to see a RomCom so the number of intimate scenes are adequate for the genre. The whole Transformers experience boils down to one thing, at the end of the day, visiting the cinema to see giant robots kick the C**p out of each other, and that they do in style. Michael Bay's portrayal of the epic battles that take place are well put together and give the audience what they are asking for. Overall this is a great movie, not there to grip the audience with a compelling storyline that deals with deep human emotion, one that shows of the wonders of CGI and gives us an epic war between giant robots. Michael Bay is a great director for the genre, and will no doubt keep making them in the future, and as much as everyone will slag him and transformers off, let's see how many of you are there to see the next one aye?"
"emee4real","8","2","2","18 June 2009"," Excuse me, are you the tooth fairy?
","I must say that I wasn't really expecting much from this movie. When I came to see it among a DVD I bought which had several movies on it, including the Harry Potter series (which was why I bought the DVD anyway), I thought: Just Another sci-fi movie. I just said let me see it.<br/><br/>However, I got more than I bargained for! I was actually riveted by the movie and the performance of its main male and female leads (Shia Leboeuf and Megan Fox). As Sam Witwicky, Leboeuf grows from a geek-like nobody into the young man who saves the world. Megan Fox seems to let everyone know how hot she is, and there is no doubt SHE IS HOT! The look she gives Leboeuf when her character Mikaela says ""I can take it all apart, clean it and put it back together,"" was one of the most seductive glances u'll ever see on screen. However it seems predictable that both of them would come together at the end, but that's a minor drawback.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that it is the CG that takes up much of this movie, I think that in general, the human actors did pretty well. Former Miss Universe contestant, Rachel Taylor was quite decent as Maggie, while Anthony Anderson was his usual funny self. As for humor, the film's got enough of it. The most moving was the little girl who is woken up by the transformers' crash-landing on Earth and promptly goes out to their swimming pool. She doesn't seem scared to see the gigantic robot (autobot) that emerges from the pool and steps over her, but simply asks if he was the tooth fairy. For me, that was the most moving and humorous scene and it whenever I watch that scene, I laugh. Another great scene was the car-chasing one in which the Camaro (aka Bumblebee) is followed by the police vehicle (aka Barricade), with Leboeuf and Fox in it. Yet another funny scene is the one in which the autobots' medical expert says that Leboeuf's pheromone levels suggested he wanted to mate with Fox. However an intelligent observer from the audience would notice that as soon as he/she sees them together.<br/><br/>One complaint I have though is the climatic battle scenes. They seem a bit overdone.<br/><br/>But beside this little detail, Transformers is good clean fun, as its merits greatly overshadow its faults. I pray the sequel is just as good as, or even better than, this one. If anyone hates this movie because of its faults, then I must say u are VERY HARD TO PLEASE!"
"jerekra","8","2","2","7 June 2009"," Great Foundation Set.
","Transformers was a very good film that I enjoyed enough to watch three times when it was in the theater. It is pretty entertaining and also sets a good foundation for future sequels to be made.<br/><br/>Sam Whitwicky has a pair of his grandfathers glasses. On these glasses are coordinates to find the cube, the cube is a cube that is able to give life to machines and turns them into transformers. The autobots arrive on Earth and warn Sam and must have the glasses. Unfortunately the Decepticons also arrive on Earth.<br/><br/>I think the effects were outstanding in this film. All of the Transformers in this film looked very real. I like how they gave them a new look, and did not just 100 percent give them the same look that they had in the cartoon. This shows that the director and effects people gave new interpretations to characters.<br/><br/>The story was good, not great. But I think that at times it gets a little complicated, especially with the military. Not overly confusing, but a little. Also I think that the film tends to drag a lot, I understand the importance of build up, but it takes a while for all of the Transformers to appear.<br/><br/>The human characters were OK. However I think there were way too many human characters that speak a lot in this film. I want to see lots of different Transformers, not humans.<br/><br/>Now for the Transformers. I think they included most of the ones they needed to in a first film. Optimus Prime was great as were the rest of the autobots (Jazz, Bumblebee, Ratchet, and Ironhide). The Decepticons were awesome as well, however it was interesting how some of the decepticons were not similar to what they were in the television show. Like how Frenzy was a boom box and Bonecrusher was a minesweeper. The decepticons, other than Megatron, did not get to say much of anything nearly as much as the autobots.<br/><br/>The action is OK. BUt when the Autobots were fighting the Decepticons it kind of gets hard to tell who is winning and who is losing. Basically the fight scenes are fast and the Transformers blend together and as a result you have no idea what is going on.<br/><br/>Megan Fox was great, I love her assets. Not much more to say on that topic.<br/><br/>So this film is very good. IF anything this film set the groundwork, so while it may lack in some areas you know that the next films should be great thanks to this film. I recommend this film and also can not wait for the sequel."
"dragongirl346","8","2","2","5 June 2009"," Enjoyable
","I don't know why you go to the movies. Maybe there are people who enjoy taking a break from real life by going to see a plot that adds even more complexity to their lives. If you're one of those people, I don't suggest reading the rest of this review. But if you go to the movies to be entertained, to enjoy yourself, to have fun, then Transformers will not disappoint.<br/><br/>The plot takes very predictable turns, but it progresses at a comfortable rate. I never found myself getting bored with the way the movie unfolded. The characters were likable, decently portrayed. I found Megan Fox's performance rather vapid, but what she lacked, Shia Labeouf made up for, portraying exactly what we'd expect from a kid seeing his car transforming into a giant robot.<br/><br/>Now, onto my big three, the real reasons I enjoy or dislike a movie. This holy trinity is Visual Effects, Sound Design, and Score.<br/><br/>Visual Effects - Spot on. Giant robots pummeling the living daylights out of each other. Explosions. Rockets. The visuals were great - I was absolutely thrilled by every scene involving the Transformers themselves and I applaud the incredible effort put into them by their creators.<br/><br/>Sound Design - Hand in hand with the visual effects. This movie was a treat for sound junkies such as myself. As a Transformer unfolds, there is literally a sound for every motion. Explosions. Rockets. All were incredible sounding and made this movie incredibly engaging.<br/><br/>Score - Jablonsky delivers. His mentor, Hans Zimmer, has taught him well and the score constantly pays tribute to the great maestro himself. I bought a few of the songs immediately after seeing the film - Arrival to Earth and Scorponok are two great examples of Jablonsky's work on this film. I look forward to his future work because his soundtrack work here was incredible.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was ENTERTAINING. I had FUN. Isn't that worth going to see a movie for? 8/10"

Now the duration time the movie is a pretty long movie the movie storyline keeps you occupied so u cant even tell that the movie is long well overall i give this movie a 10 and that it was the best movie for the year of 2007 and i hope that the sequel is going to be great as well this movie is the best."
"wyldcat2500","1","22","46","7 July 2007"," Beyond bad
","First off, the movie focuses on humans which are very secondary to the story compared to the robot. It's called the ""Transformers"", not the winer BS problems of humans. Also, all the people writing about it and claiming that since they are in their 20's are inherently connected or knowledge worthy of said cartoon franchise are full of it. In a society filled with lazy ""time out"" generation parents and kids who have to have special ""playclothes"" for playing outside that they can't get dirty, yes the Transformers might seem a good movie. In the past when I have done critic writings for newspapers I have often stated ""as long as it entertains me"". This is not the case with this piece of garbage that Michael Bay has puked out. This is not entertaining, it is frustrating. Some of the worst dialog I have ever heard and seriously corrupt versions of iconic characters spew out in over 2 hours of CG/live action dullness. As stated, the serious dim-wits and people who can't handle life without a cellphone stuck to their ear will get this movie and like it as they are rarely asked to look beyond the internet for information or (god forbid) made to play outside with toys. This movie represents a farce and an insult to those of us who (actually) grew up watching this cartoon and having fun with the toys. Even if you can't comprehend life before the home computer, time-out Christian mother punishment, ipods, or the damn cellphone that can do everything, at least understand that this movie is just plain bad and an insult and that you would spend your time better trying to get the episodes of the original cartoon off of the internet."
"zack-beseda","2","22","46","6 July 2007"," So disappointing
","I have always been a huge Transformers fan. I WANTED to enjoy this movie yet I can honestly say I can't remember ever being so disappointed in a film. I think I started to hate it when Bumblebee urinated on an FBI agent. Somewhere around there.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS* First of all, to even say that this movie is about the Transformers is a bit misleading. In reality, it's about Shia LeBouf's character with appearances by the Transformers. When I go see a movie about the Transformers, I want to see more than one scene containing a conversation between those characters.<br/><br/>In fact, the Transformers were so poorly characterized, that when Megatron and Optimus Prime actually do fight, I don't even give a crap, because I feel like I barely know them. Megatron has about five lines and he doesn't even show up until literally 2 hours into the film. And I sure don't want to sit through a lame-ass love story when there is plenty of Autobot and Decepticon action to be watching.<br/><br/>The entire film is completely unfocused. It's completely unclear what the Decepticons are doing on Earth and whether or not that Megatron is even the leader. And even though each Decepticon introduces themselves, afterwards it's almost impossible to tell them apart.<br/><br/>Another thing that really bugged me was the films annoying obsession with this sitcom-type humor. Don't get me wrong, I love some comedy in my action movies, but the silly lowbrow comedy just didn't go with the attempt to set the action in a real-world setting. There were genuinely funny parts, of course, but I was so annoyed with the potty humor junk that it was hard to enjoy them.<br/><br/>Obviously there are many people who have posted positive reviews of this film and they're entitled to their opinion. I guess they just have an ability to enjoy senseless overly long movies with no substance that I don't."

","Oh how I longed for this Movie. A Transformers Movie. How could it be anything other that amazing. I'll tell you how... Michael Bay, that's how! The man who gave us Pearl Harbour returns to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory once more. This was a sure thing. It was more difficult to fail than it was to succeed and in that sense it was a real achievement.<br/><br/>The plot involves a teenage boy who has the fate of the world in his hands thanks to an item he listed on ebay. No, I'm serious. Hilarious set-pieces involve a dog peeing on Ironhide's leg and a prolonged and excruciatingly unfunny conversation about masturbation. If that's not enough humour this Movie offers us not one stereotyped black comic relief character, but THREE! Unbelievabley, one of these racist clichés is a transformer; Jazz the Token-Ghettobot. Just to further the cliché, he is the only one to die. Classic.<br/><br/>As the Movie stumbles to a climax, our bland and idiotic heroes take the allspark (that's an energon cube to anyone who knows anything about Transformers) to the middle of a city to ensure maximum loss of life. Why not take it to a field or a desert or an underground bunker you ask? The answer is simple.

"Winds_of_Destination","5","19","39","9 July 2007"," 2 1/2 hours of Power Rangers
","You have to admit there is some truth in the title of my review. TRANSFORMERS was definitely one of the films I looked forward to seeing during the summer. The trailers looked awesome, and I couldn't wait to see the movie. I walked out with mixed feelings, although the feeling of disappointment outweighed my more positive feelings. But time has passed, and I'm slowly appreciating the movie a bit more.<br/><br/>The first fifteen minutes are very promising, providing humor and great character development. Shia LaBeouf is in the lead role, and he is fantastic! His character has a great, lovable personality you just can't resist. The scene where he buys the car, however, left me with a strange feeling because it was so fast-paced and different.<br/><br/>Next, we're trekking through the desert with a unit of soldiers when they are greeted by a transformer. These action sequences are spectacular. However, they serve almost no relevance to the overall plot of the movie, which by the way, is a very interesting plot.<br/><br/>While being your average ""unqualified person must stop beasts from taking over universe and get girl"" plot, it has its own unique way of presenting itself, providing great action sequences and awesome special effects. While the plot is obviously unrealistic (because it's a sci-fi film), it comes with some unrealistic moments, such as a 5 foot Transformer making its way through a sea of people without getting noticed.<br/><br/>This is one of several problems with the film: not being realistic. People's reactions to the Transformers are not the way a normal human would react. The humor is just plain awful (Sam's Happy Time was just outright nasty), and the movie seems to take itself seriously during some scenes and then strips away its dignity in others. These problems are what make the movie strange and sometimes hard to watch.<br/><br/>This goes for about an hour, right up until Sector Seven enters. The rest of the movie after the introduction of S7 is fine. Most of it is action, and of course the action is some of the most entertaining in movie history.<br/><br/>One other problem I could actually feel was the film trying to be dramatic. Car chase scenes were spoiled for me because of random guitar riffs beginning to crunch, slow motion effects were painful to watch, and Optimus Prime talked as if he just came from the recent Star Wars films. However, his voice was done to perfection.<br/><br/>I would also like to tip my hat to the others who did the voices of the Transformers; although some of the lines were painful to hear simply because of how strange they were (""this looks like a good place to kick it!""), all the voices were magnificent.<br/><br/>Transformers had the potential to be a great film, but it only turned out OK. Right now it's at an 8.2, but that will probably drop as more people view it. There is some truth about the title of my review; whenever it doesn't take itself seriously it feels like Power Rangers. That's the main problem; the film doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be serious or not, and that makes it a bit difficult to watch, because you want to take it seriously, but you just can't at certain moments. Overall, I give this movie a 5.5- an OK film with some positive notes and some negative ones."
"matthew-esler","3","19","39","1 July 2007"," As bad as you could do
","Wow... just wow. How can anyone say this was good? Far too much of this film was zoomed in so close that you couldn't even tell what was happening. In the fight scenes you couldn't tell Autobot from Decepticon. The movie focused FAR too much on the human side of things... it is after all supposed to be about TRANSFORMERS. The choice of music for each scene was possibly the worst I have ever witnessed. I think if a real director had made this movie it would have been much better. Terrible script, average acting, continuously disorienting screenplay, tragically bad music choices. The only redeeming features were the special effects and cinematography, and special effects can be taken for granted these days and should really only rate a mention when poor."

","Why can't anybody ever get the Transformers right? It's possibly one of the coolest concepts ever to be conceived and yet in every nearly incarnation, the execution has been wanting.<br/><br/>First, there was the so-called G1 TV series, which I fondly remember but, sadly, it just doesn't stand the test of time.<br/><br/>Then we had Beast Wars, an idea which never appealed to me, despite some good things I'd heard about it.<br/><br/>Then we had various crappy anime series.<br/><br/>Then we have this. Others have already ably described the various things that are wrong with this movie, so I won't bother to do the same, except to add that it's a damned shame that Frank Welker couldn't reprise his role as Megatron's voice and also that Optimus Prime seemed fairly powerless against Megatron and needed Spike to defeat him. BOOOO! As for the designs, I can appreciate the need or desire to update the designs but I don't see how that translates to changing them completely or making them overly complex. Less is more.<br/><br/>And now, we have the new animated series, the pilot of which aired recently on Cartoon Network. Early returns don't look promising on that one either (in other words, I don't care for what I've seen so far).<br/><br/>Sigh. I wonder if we'll ever see the Transformers done right."

","TRANSFORMERS is a thoroughly depressing movie for all the wrong reasons.

I finally Netflixed it and I'm sorry I did.<br/><br/>The original Transformers wave hit when I was in the middle of my teen years, so it pretty much passed me by, but I was aware of the comics and toys (never watched the cartoon). I ""get"" why they were and are huge. If I were a kid, I'd probably love this stuff unconditionally. But maybe I'm too old or too discriminating, 'cause TRANSFORMERS is without a doubt the WORST film I've sat through all year long. All of the ""Sins of Michael Bay"" are here... the obnoxious characters, the migraine-inducing soundtrack/sound effects, the ridiculously over-done explosions, the hyper-editing and the over-the-top schtick.<br/><br/>None of it works. What's worse is that most people couldn't see through what a completely lazy, talentless and unimaginative movie this really is. Steven Spielberg should be ashamed of himself, but he's sitting on a giant pile of money thanks to this dreck, so what do I know? Just bloody awful.

It makes some of Uwe Boll's stuff look Oscar-worthy. Perhaps it is the combination of Bay and Spielberg which resulted in something much worse than either could have managed alone. Mr. Spielberg, the king of schmaltz, has his stamp all over this one.<br/><br/>I guess the bad taste came from Mr. Bay's side of the family. I found the ""Bros before Hoes"" line to be downright offensive. And robots peeing on people. What is this, Scary Movie 5 or something?

"The_Amazing_Spy_Rises","10","10","18","19 September 2007"," The ultimate level of entertainment. Flat out fun with no looking back. Perhaps the greatest summer blockbuster of all time.
","That's a bold statement. The greatest summer blockbuster ever? No question. If you want to have fun at the movies, look no further. Transformers is a masterpiece in visual effects and its brilliant writing and direction. Michael Bay continues to show why he is one of the most bankable producers/directors in Hollywood with probably his best effort of his career. Transformers is one of my all time favorite movies, and the only movie that I would watch any day of the week. Whether it be the incredible action sequences, great jokes, the great and likable Shia LaBeouf, the gorgeous Megan Fox, the just flat out awesome Optimus Prime, or the downright evil Megatron, Transformers has something for every type of movie goer.<br/><br/>Long ago, the dueling Autobots and Decepticons fought over the power source known as the Allspark, or simply, the cube. Now that the cube has found its way to Earth, the battling alien races have brought their struggle to our planet, and it appears that young lovable loser Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) holds the key to Earth's safety or destruction.<br/><br/>First off, Transformers boasts what you could call spectacular special effects and action sequences. They are astonishingly real and well made. Nothing looks fake. The Transformers themselves are sometimes hard to distinguish because of the speed they are fighting at, but it's a non issue. I am ready to give Transformers the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. I've never been more stunned by visuals. Michael Bay really put a ton of effort into the film, and of course, his trademarks are present, such as the sun casting a bright light over the hero in the finale, but Bay has created a film that he can not only call his, but a film for everyone. This is why we go to the movies, to have experiences that leave us wowed, make us laugh, and stick with us for a long time. Michael Bay has guaranteed that this will happen.<br/><br/>The cast is great. They do what they need to and don't take anything away from the movie, sometimes adding more. Shia LaBeouf has really blossomed into a bankable leading man. It's so great to see him really succeed, and seeing how likable and great he is in this movie, I can see why. Megan Fox, aside from being drop dead gorgeous, has her own moments where she and LaBeouf really play off each other well. I liked Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson. Anthony Anderson was good, as was screen legend Jon Voight. I liked his character, who seemed really realistic. I didn't care for John Turturro, as he seemed really out of place, and he felt awkward in most scenes he was in. He tried to be funny in moments where it wasn't necessary.<br/><br/>Ah, now the voice actors. All are cast great, especially the leading Autobot Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) and the especially vile Megatron (Hugo Weaving). Cullen has been the voice of Prime for years, and I wouldn't have it any other way. He gives a warm and kind voice that also does a great job of enforcing his power as the leader. Weaving has one of the best voices in show business, with this and V for Vendetta being the best examples. It's amazing how a man who was so kind and likable in V could come back with a voice full of menace and cruelty and downright scare the audience. Though he's animated, Megatron is one of the top bad guys of the 2000's.<br/><br/>Transformers will never relent with the entertainment. It's got everything, including awkward teen romance parts, intense action, catchy dialog, a great soundtrack, and sometimes laugh out loud humor. I've never had this much fun at the movie theater and I really recommend that you catch it on DVD and watch it on the biggest TV with the best sound system you can. It's the best of the legendary 2007 summer. In a summer of sequels, the newbie, Transformers, stands clear above the rest. I love this movie and recommend it to everyone.<br/><br/>10/10 --spy"

","Do you people WORK for the studio? This movie is an atrocious mangling of the Transformer's title. It is a myriad of senseless sub-plots that jar awkwardly against one another, often never even concluding. If you enjoy the abstract image of metal smashing against metal, then you may also enjoy the pace-less action sequences where the overly-complicated and indistinguishable robots smash against one another in a big chrome blur. I commend the actors for their ability to hide the immense shame they must have felt at reading aloud the trite, clichéd and bewilderingly soulless dialogue. However, their awkwardness shows. As always, the black robot is the only good guy to die. His passing was regrettable, but he was soon replaced by the Mountain Dew Vending Machine, the X-Box 360 and the Mercedes Car Horn. You may think I'm kidding, but these characters do make an appearance during the climactic battle scene. They fire randomly into the panic-stricken humans and then are inexplicably hailed as ""friends"" by the victorious Optimus Prime. Also, Megatron is Prime's brother(WHAT!?).<br/><br/>I remain incredulous."

","Michael Bay + Transformers = failure + pissing robots.... wtf? <br/><br/>PRO = ILM SFX CON = Michael Bay (and the chaos that ensues)<br/><br/>A family rambles on about masturbation, and one of the transformers pisses on a human....<br/><br/>Every person on this site I'm sure would know better then to have scenes like this in the new transformers movie. Michael Bay in his infinite wisdom of appealing to the ""target demographic"" knows no better. The movie was a disgrace, and I do not blame the producers for hiring (or subsequently not firing) the director since I'm sure he was a integral part of financing. I blame Michael Bay since his ""style"" is all over this film. <br/><br/>This is not a Transformers movie, this is a stupid action film with robots that transform. Bay completely disregarded the fans of this property (i.e. comments in Wired magazine stating since he's the director, he's going to do whatever he damn well pleases and put flames on the truck cause visually it looks cool) News flash Michael Bay, you're blinded by whatever you think ""looks cool"" and not about story, heart, the characters or the 99 other things that make a movie good. <br/><br/>I confess I didn't follow the story, and I didn't care to. The film starts out well enough, but the bland characters began to beat reality into my head that this was a very poor film. About 30 minutes into the film, where the transformers are standing around in the garden killing the plants etc, I gave up on this film. (shortly before the American pie 4 rejected scene about masturbation) The story makes no sense, and I don't want to point out the plot holes. By the time the action started at the end of the film, I simply didn't care. That's a hard thing to for a director to do, since for the last 20 years of my life I wanted to see robots transform and fight. Yet bay managed to undo 20 years of building excitement in a few hours. <br/><br/>I don't even know where to begin with Prime's lips or the robots designs. They are so completely asinine that words fail me. I only think of Bay thinking, ""well, we'll make them have lots of moving parts, really complex cause that's cool"". Another example of his flawed judgment as a filmmaker. They should have stayed true to the original designs of the Transformers. <br/><br/>While most will just say, ""well I love the action, so this movie kicks ass"". Well you're letting this movie off the hook. I don't agree with the style in which Michael Bay has his action sequences shot. Overly hyper kinetic and so frantic I cannot tell what's going on. The second this film starts, you know it's a Michael Bay by the filters they use and the generic butt rock. I guess that's why Bay is hired, cause he will give you exactly the same thing over and over again. While that's fine, and I know to avoid his films.... I have a problem when he disrespects everything that is special about Transformers.<br/><br/>This movie is a mindless action film. I guess that's all that Bay aspires to, since there is no characters to fall in love with. No hero to route for, no hero is despise. There is nothing here but a hollow, shell of a movie. You might as well just have ILM cut a version of this movie with just all the effects and sell that version. You tell me one person in the audience who gave a rats ass about any of the characters.... and who were not just waiting for the robots to show up? And mind you, Bay removed any kind of connection to the Autobots etc. that I had. I wanted to like this movie with every fiber of my being. I would have been the easiest to please with just a few things to latch onto. There was nothing there. <br/><br/>If I made the movie, I would embrace what is loved about transformers. Focus on the transformers (not about a horny teenager). I would have set the film in the 1980's and embraced that whole era of time. At least they had some of the original voice cast for this film, but it's too little, too late. My brain is breaking down now since I'm extremely upset that they ruined this film. Obviously the nostalgia was there since the film opened so well at the box office. Hopefully when they ""re-imagine"" this film, since they would be foolish to make a direct sequel, they will respect what we love about the transformers, and not dumb it down to nothing more then a action film with robots. I wish they didn't call this transformers, since now the name transformers is a little tarnished. shame on you Michael Bay. shame on you."

I don't have kids, but if I did, I would never let them watch this. The film portrays everything militaristic in a disturbingly fetishistic light. American militaristic Propaganda. But its not done in a tongue in cheek way like the underrated and generally misunderstood Starship Troopers. Michael Bay is not nearly as smart Paul Verhoeven and no where near as talented. He is however, much more dangerous as a propagandist for the US military complex. Screw him and this movie.<br/><br/>Steer way clear of this turd!"

","This movie is simply shocking! The story is taken from a children's cartoon and is now turned into an action packed alien take over the world movie. When I was about to see this movie I suddenly got a thought. What if this movie is just another Independence Day and War of the World. It is unmistakable that aliens taking over the world is an idea that has been worn out but what makes this movie shine is the personality. What its predecessors failed to do was give the alien/robot personality which is very different in Transformers. When one of the Autobots get hurt we can actually feel there pain as if they were human because of there developed characters in this movie. If I may say so myself, this is a must see!"

","I saw it twice in the first week; awesome movie! The detail put towards the design and the meta-morphing from car to ""mech-warrior"" and back to car is great! Its so good that it is like an action pack in itself. It makes me wonder if any life size Transformers were built to help with the CG movements. I've seen how sensors can be placed on the body to record the movements of a human's muscle and bone structure. The movie is as good and even better than the previews made it out to be with a good story line and good acting. The beginning was great with the desert combat scene. The fact that the producers had so much cooperation with the Airforce and military branches made this movie so much better."

","The worst thing about this movie are the people who are loving it and are serious about it too. It just makes me feel worried that THAT many people can be so wrong and have THAT bad of taste in movies.<br/><br/>At best this movie is a bad ripoff Armageddon, I could feel the story and soul of Armageddon in this movie coming to real while the plot unfolded but not close as good. Most the movie just didn't make sense, I never got any interest for a character in the movie and how could I ? Even if you are a Tranformer freak I cant understand how you could love this film.<br/><br/>Sadly I have lost all trust in Michael bay of delivering something real and good anymore, Surly he CAN deliver to the BOXOFFFICE nodoupt. But he sold his soul in return.<br/><br/>So what is a good comic series on film? Superman ? No. Batman? Right On! There is a example to follow. what C. Nolan did with Batman Bay could never do.<br/><br/>Michael Bay needs to go back to the roots and take more care of the story and keep the balance between blowing up cars and the storyline, like in The Rock. Maybe he needs someone like J. Bruckheimer to hold him back sometimes.<br/><br/>In my opinion Transformers lacked human interference. I need to see real people I believe in and see them dealing with the problems that occur. I could never care more about a Robot than a Human.<br/><br/>I have seen the movie 3 Times now, twice in the theater and once on HD DVD and its painful to see some of my friends cheering it, and at the same time bashing great movies like The Prestige and Apocalypto. Please someone slap me in the face!"
"RabidED990","1","12","23","13 October 2007"," Awful
","Transformers is basically really awful. Everything about it is bad. Except for the special effects. It's your typical, extremely dumb load of Michael Bay crap that's paced poorly and has a ton of PG-13 explosions for absolutely no point. The vast majority of the movie serves no point, actually. Not that I'm bashing this because it's a Hollywood blockbuster, far from. But Transformers could probably have been about 30 minutes shorter and not suffered in the slightest.<br/><br/>Take the scene where Sam goes back to his house to retrieve his Grandfather's glasses. What should take about nine seconds is instead panned out into some pseudo-slapstick 10 minute scene that tries to be funny, but largely isn't. And why? What does it have to do with anything? <br/><br/>Or the whole hacker sub-plot thing. About five pointless minutes there. Or Sam's friend. We see him for like a minute and a half before Shia ditches him for the girl that tags with him the rest of the movie. Why the hell is he there to begin with? Or the whole 'girl has a juvee record' affair. It's mentioned once, only to be resolved 15 minutes later. OK, great. Wait, why? It has nothing to do with the rest of anything. At all. Then why is it there? And then there's a bunch of other really pointless stuff. I'm pretty sure the ""Taco Bell Dog"" with the broken paw was there just so the 14-year-old girls in the audience would go 'awwwwwww.' I can fathom no other reason why it is there. The whole eBay thing was nothing more than shameless product-placement in the extreme.<br/><br/>What makes all of this extremely asinine is that the Transformers have absolutely no personality. Instead of developing the real meat of the film, Bay wastes a great deal of time doing what amounts to not a damn thing. Aside from what you learn about them in the first 11 seconds of their being on-screen, the Transformers don't develop or change or show any amount of character at all, which is a real shame. There's Prime, the leader; the one who wants to use his guns all the time; the one who acts black; and Bumblebee. That's how the audience knows them, and all they ever amount to. And the Decepticons are even worse. They're all introduced at the end of the film, only to be defeated. What a menace. Wow. Megatron, who should be the 'harbinger of death,' as Shia puts it, is flat and boring. His reign of terror lasts about 25 minutes. What a character. Just wow.<br/><br/>The final battle, where the movie all comes together, is just wretched. The Transformers fight in a city, which is great for Bay because a lot can be blown up that way. But why do they go to the city to begin with? Because they take the AllSpark, the object the Transformers fight over (logically located beneath Hoover Dam, the safest and most practical of places to hide such a thing) to a city (where you would naturally want killer robots to take their fight to) for 'safekeeping.' Christ.<br/><br/>Anyway, when the Transformers get to fighting, what should be a bombastic and exciting event is instead chopped up by a bunch of really pointless bullet-time and overly-short edits. Aside from when Prime and Megatron fight, you can't tell who's who, and don't care most of the time. The fight never really takes off, let alone gets going.<br/><br/>Oh, other bad things about this movie, before I forget. The acting is bad, the soundtrack is generic, and the screen writing is awful.<br/><br/>On the plus side? The effects are cool. Also, you don't have to think once, unless you question why the hell Micheal Bay thought a discussion about masturbation was needed at all or why Michael Bay is allowed to make moves at all or try to think of a positive aspect of the movie besides the special effects. Then again, you may have to do a lot of thinking."
"guardkid","3","12","23","23 August 2007"," Ruined by inexplicably bad directing and full of horrible and tedious pop culture moments
","Having never watched the Transformers cartoons in the 80's I'm no fanboy, but I remember as a boy the Transformer toys and the cool autobot/decepticon logos. With very little info about the film but aware of the relatively high votes this had received from IMDb users, I went to the cinema expecting to see, for once a quality 'summer blockbuster'.Just before walking in I saw a flyer about the film and it mentioned the director being Michael Bay who directed 'Armageddon' and 'Pearl Harbour'.....and I thought 'Oh-oh, this could be a terrible omen for the movie I was about to see'<br/><br/>After about 15-20 minutes, my respect for the movie was already in danger of dissipating and had already lost 2 points out of 10 vote-wise. Why? Teenagers.... nauseating adolescents with raging hormones and big mouths on screen trying to look cool, meanwhile soldiers on the other side of the world...annoying grunts are trying to be macho and blurting out banal lines, one of them talks to himself in Spanish, another blurts out 'Speak in English'- 'its my heritage, man' he responds, another mentions the wife and baby 'waiting for him back home' -cliché -whom they cut to in one of many completely unnecessary scenes that punctuate this flick. Pentagon officials and other 'hangers-on' walking around being extremely important, 'Mr President' blah blah-how many times do we see this in Hollywood movies! And the film takes the audience from one scene to the next- no story, no introduction, no relevance. Later the film relies on Optimus Prime narrating the backdrop to the story when Megatron first landed on Earth in the last century....why couldn't they have started with this instead?<br/><br/>The casting for the main characters and their initial interactions on screen were terrible! We have this so annoying highly-strung teenage boy who's obsessed with a girl (she's just there for eye candy) and the audience have to endure SO MANY sexualised gratuitous camera shots of him checking her out, shots of her cleavage and derriere and close-up shots of her face taking up the whole screen- Michael Bay seemed to have a personal fixation with her! I was thinking 'I've come to see Transformers, if I want to watch a bunch of teenagers talking garbage, ogling over each other and planning how they are going to get laid, I'll just rent 'American Pie' on DVD.-Be warned, I am not joking- there are some excruciatingly bad and out-of-place scenes for this genre of film. The long farcical scene at the boy's house that has got to be one of the worst I have seen for a long time in a big-budget movie, where all the Transformers are outside 'hiding' with a silly conversation taking place between the boy and his parents in his bedroom and where a reference to 'Masturbation' is made not once, but about 3 times!!! Can you believe it? Everyone in the cinema cringed in embarrassment thanks to this piece of crass and gratuitous directing. I felt for the parents who went with their kids (this was a 12 certificate) and who probably came out with that one line ringing in their ears with little Johnny asking them what masturbate means. Then you get the secret services turning up at the house, with John Turturro doing almost a parody of an FBI agent- he is later stripped to his underwear and handcuffed to a street lamp post in another ridiculous scene (I kid you not!) Why the pathetic attempt to inject moments of humour and the rubbish one-liners? Just cut it out- as most of it fell flat on it's face. Check the scene, when the autobot comes out of the back-garden swimming pool with the little girl standing there...the camera closes in on her for the inevitable one-liner.... I thought- 'no don't do it'....as she says 'Are you the tooth fairy?' - Christ...knock another point off. Btw- no-one laughed in the theatre.<br/><br/>The teenagers were so irritating that killing them off would have been a highlight, and what was with the totally irrelevant sub-plot about the girl having a criminal record? Who cares?!!Two other wastes of space are the Pentagon code analyser (who comes across as just some young Australian model who's there as eye-candy number two) and her 'In Da Hood hysterical fat Hacker friend' (of course such natural sidekicks). An old Jon Voight is pasted in here as a Defense Secretary in attempt to add some credibility to it all, but he comes across as worn and tired. Other cringe-making moments: Optimus Prime refers to the 'WWW and E-bay', violin music playing during a silly emotional-meant scene between the boy-hero and autobot Bumblebee who's been partially destroyed, fat hacker from 'da hood' freaks out in the FBI interrogation room, rock music inexplicably accompanying some of the action sequences, a soldier trying to phone in air support is connected to some nerdy type call centre worker in India! Absolutely disgraceful and I would have laughed if I hadn't forked out money to watch this.<br/><br/>On the only positive note the action sequences are spectacular and the special effects are top class, especially the way the autobots/decepticons transform during their battles. I give all 3 points for this alone. I wasn't too sure about the way Megatron was portrayed though, as he didn't appear to be true to the version I remember from the 80's- his design looked too insect-like and he talked like that tree character from Lord of the Rings. The only redeeming parts of the film are when the Transformers are on screen and it's a shame the film doesn't focus on them more as they far outshine the human characters in this extremely disappointing and tatty film."

"CrassActionHero","1","38","89","4 July 2007"," Bay and Spielberg Smash the Transformers to Pieces
","Transformers (2007) <br/><br/>Review: In a world of remakes and rewrites, we get a childhood classic Transformers. The thing is that I was looking forward to this movie. Here is my take: <br/><br/>Transformers starts off okay with a pretty terrifying scene at a military base with a first look at one of the Decepticons in the form of a helicopter. Seems like a serious movie is in play, right? Then things go from good to bad when we are introduced to our main character. Sam Witwickey(Shia LeBeouf)is a total dork who is in need of some......companionship. He gets himself his first car that is a really worn out Camero. Of course it is our first Autobot in disguise.<br/><br/>What is wrong here is quite simple. First, Our lead character is so overblown as a desperate dork that it becomes frustrating. I GET IT. He is stuck with parents that are so out of touch like they just can't live past the 50's. It's the cliché loser title character. He picks up a hot chick(Megan Fox)and all things get awkward. The car starts playing cheesy music and starts all sorts of problems for no reason at all. This set off a series of irritating scenarios. Transformers suddenly became a 3rd rate teen comedy. Honestly, anything involving Shia's character was off the charts dreadful.<br/><br/>We get some more serious stuff from the pentagon finding out info about the alien lifeforms then we meet another set of irritating characters. Another hot chick who just happens to be an amazing wizard on the computer than anyone else in the freaking pentagon. Unreal. Did I mention that she is about 20 years old? Anyway we meet the annoying Anthony Anderson as well.<br/><br/>Then we finally meet the rest of the Transformers. One good thing here is that Peter Cullen still has got it. He is perfect as Optimis Prime. Too bad that even the Transformers(or at least the Autobots anyway)are a bunch of idiots too, the scene at Sam's house for example was horrendous.<br/><br/>After all of this, we finally get to the point and the conclusion of the movie and it's quite anti-climatic. And the closing shot of the movie could not be in anymore bad taste.<br/><br/>So to sum thing up: The Pros: The special FX are dazzling. The transforming was cool as well as the voice-overs.<br/><br/>Cons: About 90% of this movie. From having plot holes to shaky action scenes and having horrendous teenage comedy stuck in the middle(about an hour of this movie was filled with this garbage)to guys being the idiots and worthless character development to our ""hero"" and almost none to the Transfomers.<br/><br/>Get it? <br/><br/>The Last Word: Ick. This is EASILY one of the worst movies of the year. It's comedy sucked, it's action did not deliver, it's acting was wooden, the characters were annoying.....woo..gah.....let me catch my breath. I REALLY wanted to like this. Do not see this. It's not just my final word, I am doing a public service by not recommending this trash. I cannot remember having such a terrible time in the theaters."
"Joejoesan","8","14","28","26 June 2007"," Entertaining but flat
","To me the talented Michael Bay is a director who should dose his action scenes more. I actually got headaches from watching all the exploding things in Armageddon. Those scenes were very well done, but there's also something like overkill. Less action and more character development and his pictures will be more in balance. Enter Transformers. The trailers looked great, the first screenings were very well received and with Steven Spielberg as a producer this project just couldn't get wrong. It doesn't actually, but to say that Transformers is a flawless movie... <br/><br/>I guess the best thing about Transformers is that Bay succeeded in making the audience believe that a toy franchise can actually be the basis of a believable and entertaining movie. The first hour of Transformers is great fun. The movie starts with a bang (the first Decepticon destroys an entire base in Qatar) and introduces the world of the Autobots through the eyes of the character of Shia LeBeauf. He plays a very likable geek who wants to buy a car in order to be more popular at school. That car of course turns out to be Bumblebee. LeBeauf is great. Shia plays his character with a lot of humour and he carries the movie without any problems. The second part of the movie is about the war between the Autobots and Decepticons. Here the usual Bay mistake enters. Although the action scenes and special effects are great, a lot of it should have been deleted. Once you've seen a truck turn into a Transformer, you've seen it all. You know the good guys will win, so why not speed it all up? <br/><br/>In my opinion science fiction only works when it has a certain degree of logic and realism. In the first part a military captain (Josh Duhamel) who just turned into a father almost gets killed by a Decepticon. The whole world think his legion is dead. But once he's in the normal world again he doesn't call his wife that he's alive and kicking. In the last part of the movie the good guys lure the bad guys to the big city so they have more ways to hide an important item. That's dramatically a good choice, because there are a lot of potential human victims there. But is it realistic? When you know how much damage the Decepticons can do, a big city is the last place you wanna go. The role of Megan Fox is both a curse and a blessing to the story. First of all, she's so incredibly hot that sometimes you wish that the Transformers weren't there to spoil your view. Wow, she rocks! On the other side she starts out as this unreachable babe (like Kirsten Dunst in Spider-Man). But despite all that's happening to them the love story between Shia and Megan remains hard to believe. But then again, maybe I'm just jealous, hahaha! <br/><br/>I would like to end this review with one remark. The Transformers toys aim at children between five and twelve years I guess. I know Hasbro has been hoping that the movie would be 9+ (or something along those lines). If you look at all the Aliens-like violence in the movie you can imagine that 9 year old kids (despite the official rating) might visit the movie if they're accompanied by a father. But why spoil this opportunity by putting the scene in in which they talk about masturbation? If you saw the movie you know what I mean. The scene was very funny, though. Transformers is a great action movie and will without any doubt be a huge success and the first installment of a movie series. The second movie will be the movie of truth. Okay, we know now that Transformers can disguise themselves and transform from a car into a robot. Now show us things they can do that can reach us at a dramatic level!<br/><br/>7,5 out of 10"

"cairnswendy39","1","8","14","23 November 2007"," Transformers Review
","I first heard about this movie last year when it was being filmed, it would be the big Hollywood action summer film of 2007. This made me very excited and I also enjoyed the original teaser trailer. Then I finally saw this film in some old cinema during a holiday, I entered the theatre with a expectation. So, what did I get? I got a trashy, painfully written, horribly directed piece of garbage. <br/><br/>So basically, all the familiar Robots from the old series are back, but that does not help this awful movie. First of all, it is directed by Michael Bay, Who couldn't have done an even worse job on this film. He hasn't brought anything original back to the screen and, instead, has decided to rely on extremely poor editing and CGI to give us the action scenes. This could be his worse movie to date. <br/><br/>Performances on this film are not good, but that is the least of this film's issues. I mostly blame the film's script which is worth 30 minutes of a short movie into a 2 hour film making it very stretched. But thats okay! Mr. Bay has relied on senseless editing to make this film out of control. As a result, I almost fell asleep at an action scene (something that I have never done before). <br/><br/>Unlike some decent action flicks, the storyline to this film is incredibly unintelligent, and left me unimpressed. If there is one positive thing I could say about this film, it is that it has some good CGI effects, but is that all? Now this film has been rated PG-13, however that doesn't stop my 9-year old cousin from watching it. Now personally, I have no problem with this, but when it came to a extensive scene with sexual humour, I was caught completely off guard. I see absolutely no reason why this is this is in the finished cut, and to have that type of joke in a film that is based upon a huge kid-friendly franchise, this is extremely inappropriate. However if there is a age level which would appreciate this the most, it would be teenagers. Now judging by the story's sub-plot, this is kind of a teen action film, rather than a sensible family film, so with that said, this movie fails yet again. <br/><br/>Now I thought that The Simpsons Movie would disappoint me and that this movie would blow me away, amazingly, it did the complete opposite. Now unless you praise the film with good CGI, I can see absolutely no reason why anyone could enjoy this film, otherwise you have been brainwashed by cheesy Hollywood tripe. After the longest 2 hours of my life, my buttocks were ruined, my ears were bleeding and I had witnessed a film that was just unbelievably bad. Just bad! This film succeeded to disappoint me in every way. All I can say is if this film was made a decade back, and with a different film crew, this movie would be good. But I'm sorry, but they left this movie last, all the good action movies have been made, and only a good director could bring the old magic to life again. Now I have run out of words to say, so I will give you a simple overall: This film is too fast, yet too slow."
"nickzbekool","10","8","14","2 August 2007"," jaw dropping action
","this is the best action movie of the year and in fact the best I've ever seen .so much action from start to finish and its funny too. its so entertaining and a sure fire hit! when the robots start fighting after a lot you think its over, but no they were just getting started for the ultimate grand finale. the robots crash through buildings and a lot of other stuff, and destroy pretty much all of New York. the girl that Shia Labeouf likes is so sexy, she too fine to be in school. If you like transformers or not you'll love this movie. If you a kid,adult,boy or girl it appeals to absolutely everyone. This film will have you talking and have felt like you went on a fast ride."
"Spellvexit","8","8","14","14 July 2007"," Can Special Effects be too good?
","I grew up watching Transformers and surrounded myself with piles of the toys, so I was a little worried that Hollywood would touch and likely defile the Transformers franchise, almost as sacrosanct to my childhood as the original Star Wars trilogy.<br/><br/>And all in all, there was nothing in it that was a severe disappointment! Michael Bay is no master of intrigue and subtlety, but fortunately he's making a movie from a children's cartoon, so he could play his strengths: massive destruction, amazing special effects, and a jaw-dropping opening firefight that singlehandedly pays the movie ticket's price.<br/><br/>What disappointed me a bit, however, were the fight scenes that followed. The robots in this movie were far more complex than their cartoon counterparts, and when they got into extreme closeup rock-em sock-em action, I couldn't tell if I was seeing an arm, or a leg, or even a face..! All I saw were whirring gizmos and servomotors and clanky metal plates. To make it worse, they even added digital blurring effects to make the fights seem ""faster."" The opening scene worked because the camera zoomed out and let you see everything; you could fully appreciate the scope of destruction and not get entirely distracted by the 72 million polygons that made up the computer model of the transformer in action. Most of the other fight scenes were too complex, too fast, and after a while, a bit irritating.<br/><br/>I get it. You're supposed to be in the picture with the actors and the bystanders, appreciating the epic size of the robots and marveling at their sophistication. But it actually hampers the action with a visual, psychedelic overload of special effects.<br/><br/>That, and the extremely drawn-out and painful scene of the autobots all trying to hide from Sam's mommy and daddy were the only real gripes I had with the film. How much can you expect from a movie about robots who transform into little innocuous cars and trucks when they each pack enough firepower to take out several countries anyhow?"
"Faceful_of_Kitchen","2","20","43","27 September 2007"," This movie makes me embarrassed to be a Transformers fan.
","First of all, let me get this out of the way: yes, I'm a long-time Transformers fan. However, I am by no means a purist (my favorite TF series was Beast Wars), and I'm not giving this movie a low rating simply because they changed things from the original series. The franchise has gone through so many reboots, retoolings and new continuities that it never even occurred to me to be upset about the idea of another one. That's not to say that there weren't elements of this movie that I had problems with as a fan, but they had little to do with my overall opinion of the movie.<br/><br/>Since it's the least important element of this review, I'll get the fan-related stuff out of the way first. All of these are things I could easily have overlooked if the rest of the movie had been in any way good, so unless you really care about this stuff, feel free to skip down to the next paragraph. Obviously, the designs were one issue I had. In no way was I expecting a direct translation of their G1 forms, but if they're going to keep the classic names, they could at least give the other characters the respect they gave Prime by making them at least somewhat recognizable. Just look at the G1 repaint of the Starscream toy, for example; some different heads and more G1-based paint jobs could have done wonders. Also on the design front, I didn't like Bumblebee being a top-of-the-line sports car and Starscream's robot mode being very hulking and brutish, as I felt those choices went in the exact opposite direction of the spirit of their namesakes (Bumblebee being the not-too-fast, not-too-strong underdog with a lot of heart, and Starscream being a character who relied on his speed, agility and cunning rather than brute force). On the story side, I disliked the inference that Prime and Megatron were brothers (although at least it wasn't explicitly stated like in the draft script). Also, the statement by the producers that they couldn't do Soundwave because ""the audience wouldn't believe the whole mass-shifting thing"" kind of loses its weight when you have a 20-story cube compress itself to about the size of a basketball.<br/><br/>As far as the script goes, it was downright awful. It tried to be way too many things, and pulled them all off poorly. It kept jumping haphazardly and without warning between alien invasion explosion-fest, military/war film, bad teenage romance, government conspiracy movie, and tech/hacker ""thriller,"" each of which had its own unique pacing that didn't mesh with that of any of the other story lines. There were unnecessary plot lines, scenes that were pointless and/or way too long (most notably the failed attempt at comedy that was the yard scene, which was both), characters and plot lines that were just forgotten about, and more plot holes than I could count. The few characters that got any development at all (who were almost all human) were incredibly stereotypical. The Decepticons (who have always been my faction of choice) in particular suffered a severe lack of character development, being reduced to ""bad guys who destroy things."" The dialogue was no better, rife with stilted phrasing, clunky exposition, and instances of natural flow being sacrificed for forced references to sponsoring products. The result was a script so hollow and generic that while I could easily predict what would happen (after all, I'd seen it a hundred times before in different, much better movies), I didn't really care enough to do so.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Shia did a decent job considering how little he had to work with, but he's always rubbed me the wrong way for some reason. Still, if you don't mind his other work you'll probably like him here. Megan Fox's performance was what you'd expect; she's there for her looks, not her acting ability. The rest of the live cast were either dumbfoundingly hammy (Turtorro), clearly phoning it in (Voight), or utterly forgettable (pretty much everyone else). The voice actors, though, particularly Peter Cullen, did a great job despite the lousy script. It's a shame they got so few lines.<br/><br/>Finally, there was the direction, which was definitively Michael Bay. Like many trendy directors, his philosophy seems to be that the shakier the camera and the more cuts you make, the more ""intense"" an action scene becomes. Unfortunately, it almost always ends up turning it into a confused mess. That proves to be all the more true when the focus of the scene is two incredibly complex CG robots in a hand-to-hand brawl. As a result, one of the film's few redeeming features (ILM's impressive special effects) is largely wasted in baffling fight scenes that come across as a large moving pile of spiky metal pieces rather than two robots fighting for their lives.<br/><br/>Overall, this was easily the worst new film I've seen all year. There are only three things that kept me from giving this awful movie a 1. First of all, Peter Cullen and the rest of the voice cast performed admirably. Second, as I said, the CG itself was amazing, as wasted as it was. Finally, there were a couple of fleeting moments where I did get a mild ""it's a live-action Transformers movie!"" rush (mostly due to Cullen). Unfortunately, they were brief, few and far between, and occurred only when the robots stayed relatively still, as that's the only time I could really tell what I was looking at. And that tiny thrill is more than negated by the fact that I can no longer wear my Decepticon logo shirt (which, until this movie came out, was one of my favorite shirts) without the hassle of explaining to strangers who try to start conversations about it that I thought it was an utterly lousy movie."

"BdR76","1","23","51","14 July 2007"," Killer Robots From Outer Space: a moronic action flick
","If you like watching things move around and explode, you'll absolutely love Tranformers. However if you also want a movie to have a basic storyline then maybe Tranformers is not for you.<br/><br/>There is so incredibly little story or character development, even for a movie about killer robots from outer space. If they can afford all those CGI effects, surely they can afford better writers? What was with the whole backyard scene? It was completely pointless. Whatever happened to the power-struggle between Starscream and Megatron? I don't mind a few small plot holes, but why didn't the decepticons just buy the damn thing off of eBay and have it sent to them!? It makes the chases and the fighting all the more ridiculous when you think about that. And the all too obvious open door to a sequel was just laughable.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's mainly an action movie and the first helicopter attack seemed promising, but after that it moves from one car chase or explosion to the next. There's no build-up or suspense, there's no dynamics, it just turns the volume to 10 for the rest of the movie. What also bugged me, was that most of the Transformers fighting scenes are obscured by bad camera angles. For example, during the highway scenes, it suddenly cuts to random bystanders, and the action is somewhere off in the distance. And the organic robot design make the fights even harder to follow. First there's a confusing transformation and then two huge piles of scrap metal fighting each other. It's hard to even distinguish an arm or a leg.<br/><br/>The movie tries to offer some comic relief but the jokes are painfully unfunny. There's an obnoxious super hacker who lives with his grandma and plays videogames all day, a giant robot ""urinates"" on a government agent for no reason, masturbation jokes, fart jokes: all very tacky. I thought the whole Indian telephone operator scene was just awful.<br/><br/>I could go on about the shameless product placement, the pro-military propaganda, the incredible overacting, the stereotyping, the clichés etc. but I won't. I can't believe there are so many positive reviews, this movie is horrible."
"samoht9000","1","21","46","13 July 2007"," Holy bad movie, Batman!
","This entire film was a flashy commercial, start to finish. The biggest buyer of ad space--the US Army. At least half the movie was a blatant recruitment video, demonstrating myriad military systems working in seamless unison for the millions of children and young adults in attendance. Balderdash. Mountain Dew, Chevy, Pontiac, Hummer, Ford, Panasonic, and GMC are just a few of the other big spenders that were pounded into the minds of the audience.<br/><br/>The ""plot,"" if you can call it that, was simply laughable. I can't remember the last time I saw a more cookie-cutteresque, formulaic flick. The whole thing seemed like one big mad-lib. If you've seen more than three movies in your life, you can guess the next ten minutes of the film at any given point. Forget spoilers--whatever you think is about to happen, you're probably right. And talk about a blatant open door to a sequel, which we can probably expect just about this time next year, just in time to promote all the 2009 model year cars, as well as a stream of other crap that's too useless to be sold on its own merits. I'm sure the CG artists have already broken ground on it. First order of business--produce at least 300 45-second, multi-angle, overly-dramatized, ""chunk-chunk-chunk"" sound-effect filled transformation scenes. That'll put them somewhere around half the number in this one.<br/><br/>Oh, and make sure you bring all the willful suspension of disbelief you can muster, because you WILL need it if you're to make it through to the end. You couldn't count on one hand the monumental and ridiculously improbable coincidences upon which the threadbare plot depends, even if that hand was holding a calculator. My favorite--someone hotwires a brand new vehicle by opening the door, reaching under the steering column, immediately grabbing two freely dangling and apparently stripped wires and sparking them together. Holy Dukes of Hazzard. Do the makers of this film really believe that America is peopled by such feeble-minded idiots? <br/><br/>To squeeze in more action and save the poor viewers from having to think too much, every formula character in the book was pulled out. All the usual suspects were in attendance: the hardcore marine guy, the ""you can't handle the truth""-secret government agency guy (times two!), the hot computer chick, the dorky hero, the embarrassing, out-of-touch parents, the muscle-headed jock and the girl who dates him only to realize she's been dating bad boys for too long, and my personal favorite, the technically inclined but non-threatening black guy. And yes, Megan Fox is slap-your-granny hot, but it's ruined when every other scene she's in shows her with her chin up, mouth open wide, faint glimmer of sweat across her forehead in an obviously forced attempt at looking sexy.<br/><br/>This movie isn't a total wash, though. For those of you whose only desire in a film is to see big robots smash stuff (da-hyuck), boy is this the ticket for you! The action IS pretty non-stop, but unfortunately a lot of it is played too fast to really see what's going on--I suspect the CGers did this on purpose to eliminate cost and speed production. There are some decent comedic moments, but most of the jokes fall flat and some are downright inappropriate for my 5 and 7 year old. There was just enough character development for the robots to make you realize that, if they were real people, they would be MTV veejays (one of them break dances for God's sake) and were likely created in committee (think Poochie the dog from The Simpsons). And another thing--their faces were just plain creepy.<br/><br/>I had such high hopes for this film, but in the back of my mind I knew it would be turned into an ad bonanza with little to no true tie to the original story. I'm sad to say I was right on the money."
"pnfpnf2004","3","13","26","3 July 2007"," This movie officially heralds the beginning of the new Transformers...
","... Or the film-makers have seriously screwed this up.<br/><br/>SPOILERS START<br/><br/>I accept that the designs for the robots have to be updated to reflect the 21st century, but to alter the very meaning of ""transform"", that is just heresy.<br/><br/>The animation, as a stand-alone, is top-notch, but taken in context, it has failed to understand what it is to convert from robot to alternate mode and back. Boxy and comical the old transformations were, but there was an underlying logic behind their conversion and one can guess what each robot could transform into. <br/><br/>When a Transformer truly transforms, it is like a Rubik's cube unfolding itself into 6 sides of the same colour; not just ""open up the cover of the vehicle, flip the chassis over, merge all the 3 million machine parts together, stick some doors and wheels, and pop the head out of the whirl"".<br/><br/>While I am impressed by the attention to detail in rendering, I do wonder what the film-makers decided as the themes that differentiate between Autobots and Decepticons. From what I gather, Autobots have humanoid faces and Decepticons with alien faces. Well, they should point out to us where Ironhide's nose is and where Jazz's mouth is. And what Bonecrusher's and Blackout's alien faces look like. I find it atrocious that Bumblebee's face looks like a baby with a pacifier in his mouth!<br/><br/>There was also a distinct lack of emphasis on the characters of the Transformers; why Jazz was ""cool"", why Starscream failed Megatron the second time. The charm of Transformers was how the Autobots are amazed by the human spirit, and how the Decepticons grow to loathe Earth. We have none of that exhibited, exonerated or explicated in the movie.<br/><br/>Cardinal sins were also committed with respect to the original series: Don't the film-makers know that Starscream must have a screaming voice? What it means when Prime says ""Autobots, transform and roll out"", that ALL Autobots transform together and truly roll out (and not cut-away to Sector 7). The Autobots call Optimus Prime, ""Prime"" not ""Optimus"".<br/><br/>Much of the fault lies with the director; all his films seemed to factor a love story surrounded by the events that the film title relates to, and forgetting to focus on what the film titles says: ""Pearl Harbour"" is about the terrible attack on Pearl Harbour and the bravery of those who fought, NOT a love story that happens around that attack. ""The Island"" is about a facility that houses human clones, NOT a love story of 2 clones. ""Armageddon"" is about the threat of extinction by a meteor strike, NOT a love story between the astronaut and his lover down on Earth.<br/><br/>Transformers is a movie about ""The Earth is caught in the middle of an intergalactic war between two races of robots"", NOT a love story about a boy, with a robot for a car, who loves a girl. <br/><br/>At least 60% of the film was about humans, where it should have concentrated on the interactions and battles between the robots. Why bother setting things up like ""Independence Day"" when it is not the destruction of the world. <br/><br/>Other senseless points include: Is it the Cube or the Allspark (be consistent)? Why does Optimus Prime say ""We're too late"", indicating that the Decepticons reached Earth first, and yet the Autobots assembled together first? Where was the congregation of Decepticons to discuss or initiate the liberation of Megatron? Why does Blackout overpower a fully-equipped base, only to fall to a single bazooka shot to the crotch? Why didn't it use its EMP abilities to decimate the city? Where was Scorponok in the final battle? Where was Barricade in the end? Were Secretary Keller, the techies, and the Sector 7 guy still engaged in a gunfight with Frenzy when everything ended? What was the Sector 7 personnel for? Why the extended screen time only to serve as comic relief? What were the techies for, when they have not cracked any code or conjured up the anti-virus? What was Sam running around in the city for? To hide the Cube in where? Wouldn't Sam be fried when the Cube burned into Megatron? etc.<br/><br/>Another point was the amount of babble that the lead actor had been given. How many ""Gimme 5 more mins"" can he say in a minute? Does any of the specs-searching / parent-interactions / Mikaela's past served to shed more light the war among the Transformers?<br/><br/>Poor logic, poor dialogue, poor plot, not enough screen-time for robots, too many humans and a blatant change of what the original series is about make this film a big disappointment.<br/><br/>What could have saved the film was a focused animation theme, but yet against a complicated city backdrop with numerous human activity, all the beautifully-rendered frames in the final battle were, sadly, out of focus. <br/><br/>How difficult is it to have a simple uninhabited background so that the viewer can focus on the fighting robots? Why must it be in a distracting city-scape where innocent bystanders inexplicably keep colliding with the robots?<br/><br/>SPOILERS END<br/><br/>Conceptually this movie is flawed; you cannot say that it is a remake when you don't even understand the essence and themes of what is refers to. <br/><br/>If this film is meant as entertainment for the whole family, then it is not about the Transformers, but Robots that transform. And it takes advantage of past reference to create fanfare and drum up ticket sales, but it disrespects the soul of that reference. Come to think of it, it should be called ""The Auto-morphers"".<br/><br/>It only serves to alienate those who had enjoyed the past series, and forces them to adapt to this out-of-sync new, lest they be branded as not looking-forward.<br/><br/>Unless of course, this movie is meant to officially herald the beginning of the new Transformers..."

","One of the worst written, vulgar, rude and distasteful movies to come along in a long time. I squirmed in my chair all the way through this waste of good actors...and I only stayed because I hate wasting money. How these respected actors agreed to deliver dialogue a puppy could have written better is beyond me.....I hope they enjoy the money they made. Why does there have to be ugly finger gestures, racist humor, stereotypes, gratuitous sex references and other throw away inclusions in a movie just because the studios think they are pandering to the pulse of society? Well, there doesn't and if Michael Bay and all those other degenerative film makers think that they do, they are as much the purveyors of evil, just as much as a drug dealer is. There were so many problems with this movie, I don't have enough time to list them...I can concur though with others I've been reading....like how Shia's parents were useless, spouting masterbation references, plot holes including the fact that why Shia would carry the cube himself to the top of the building while avoiding the Decepticons when one of the Autobots or Prime could have easily done the same thing was stupid....like him running around the street or how about the building when somehow he outruns a Decepticon up about 30 flights of stairs to the roof. Arrrrrgh...too many things as I said, I can't list all the problems here. The fact that people see this movie doesn't mean it's good for them. This is what is contributing to the decline of western civilization...and their denial (what a great, convenient, pull from your pocket defense) doesn't make it any less true. If the film industry is to have a responsibility to society and to kids, whom this movie leans towards, then go beyond the wallet and think....geeze, isn't a billion dollars enough for you? I compare this movie to The Cat in the Hat, another vulgar cinematic waste....basically because both that and this film are slaps in the face to the authors of the originals....the cartoon as well.

Was awesome when I was 6 but when I watched it again last month it was slightly painful. Third season very painful. I like in the movie how serious it was: the bad guys could aim and shoot and hit and when they got damaged it hurt. Cities could collapse under a fight from just two of them.

"shadowman123","8","7","12","30 July 2007"," An amazing movie with an amazing experience!
","I grew watching Transformers and playing it with my friends as a little kid in the school playground (I was always a Decepticon). When I saw the trailer for the very first time I was blown away at the special affects and saw my child hood cartoon characters bought to life - something in me said that this movie was going to rock but I have had my doubts since Spider-man 3 that was billed to be the biggest blockbuster of summer turned out to be an over-hyped let down. I am glad to tell you that Transformers was something that lived up to the hype!!! Right from the opening scene one is blown away from the awesomeness and power of these cybernetic organisms and once again you felt like a little child amazed by what unfolded in front you. CGI was definitely what made this movie and without it, its hard to imagine otherwise but it is absolutely amazing as you watching a massive robot turn its self into a fighter jet and back again. It was good to see all my old goodies like Optimus Prime with the correct voice from the cartoon series and an ultra cool paint job and the rest of the gang hanging about and certainly not to mention the bad guys who really meant business. The movie retained a comical tone all the way through with gags and wise cracks from everyone which was funny. The acting was great as all the actors really put it well with the interaction with the robots . My only complaint was that I felt everyone was a little too clued up on what to do and how to tackle the impending problems and he ending left a bit like eh? was that it ? But however I did remember things kicking off and shutting down very quickly on the cartoon series as well which is another reason for old time sake I let the cheesy one liners go. I would of also like to have seen some character development on other Autobots and Decpitcons because any Transformers fan will tell you that they each have their own personality thats why you gotta love them all !<br/><br/>Too conclude Transformers was a piece of childhood that I thought I would never see on the big screen but thanks to the modern wonders of CGI done correctly it was kind of like a dream come true , I would ask fans to go with other fans and those of have young kids of their own take them and share a piece of your childhood with them. Thank you Mr.Bay!<br/><br/>TRANSFORMERS - 8.9 OUT 10 <br/><br/>SOME SHALL COME TO DESTROY US! SOME SHALL COME TO DEFEND US!"
"Maximus_Aurelius","8","7","12","30 July 2007"," A dazzling entertainment for the summer !
","I grew up watching the cartoon series ""Transformers"" in the 80s. The protagonist in the cartoon, ""Optimus Prime"" , was my childhood hero. He was the leader of the valiant Autobots (Autonomous Robotic Organisms) which opposed the tyranny of the evil Decepticons, led by Megatron, on the planet Cybertron. Optimus Prime was a noble king, much like King Arthur, who displayed affection and compassion for others. He was a born-leader who was willing to sacrifice himself for the service of freedom and liberty. I always remember his catchphrase- ""Freedom is the right of all sentient beings"". <br/><br/>When I found out that my beloved cartoon series in the 80s would be adapted into a live action movie, I was thrilled beyond words. Finally, after all the waiting, Transformers was released in Hong Kong last week. I attended a screening on its opening night and the movie did not let me down. <br/><br/>First and foremost, this movie is not going to win the Academy award for best picture because it is not supposed to win any. It is a pop-corn action flick and it delivers more than that. It is a glorious and dazzling entertainment for the summer! <br/><br/>Unlike the cartoon series back in the 80s, this motion picture is a live action movie which is set in real life settings in the 21st century. All the robots in the movie are generated by computer imagery which seamlessly blend in with the live action elements. The CGI work in the movie is groundbreaking and sets the new benchmark for modern film making. Watching real cars, trucks and fighter jets transforming into robots is truly an eye opening experience. The robots look photo realistic and their transformations on the big screen are stunning beyond my expectations. It is a pure joy to watch them interacting with humans and battling their hearts out on the big screen. Suffice to say, this movie lays the foundation for the advancement of CGI work in the modern cinema. <br/><br/>For those of you who are action movie buffs, this movie surely will not disappoint you. This movie plays at a fanatic pace which provides an adrenaline surge for more than 2 and a half hours. The action simply grabs you and does not let go. Unfortunately (albeit inevitably), the plot and the human characters have to play second fiddle to the robots and their non-stop action sequences. There is simply not enough screen time for all the characters. The screenplay is serviceable in the sense that it helps advance the story forward but it is certainly not of Oscar caliber. I also think the writer tried to put too many robot characters into the movie as a result of which there is not enough character development of the robots other than Optimus prime and Bumblebee. <br/><br/>This movie is in essence about a boy and his first car (which turns into an alien robot). I have no doubt that the gifted Shia Laboeuf, who plays the boy ""Sam Witwicky"", will have a very bright future in cinema ahead of him. His spontaneous acting with his natural sense of humor carries the movie on his back. <br/><br/>One critic said if it's true that there's an 8-year-old boy inside every man, ""Transformers"" is just the ticket to bring the kid out. How true. My 8 year old self had his adrenalin bumping when he saw his childhood hero Optimus Prime transforming from a truck into a gigantic robot for the first time on the big screen in more than 20 years. <br/><br/>Please check out my review of the 2006 feature film Miami Vice directed by the Academy Award Nominee Michael Mann http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0430357/board/flat/53105610"
"link899","9","7","12","25 July 2007"," This movie was great!!!
","This was a great movie. There was a lot of action. Some people complain about it being told from a human perspective and the story doesn't give a lot of background details about each transformer. It would've been hard to give background details for each bot anyway since there were 13(5 Autobots, 8 Decepticons). I like how the perspective is, it shows just how giant the giant robots are. <br/><br/>I went to the movies expecting to see 1 thing: Giant robots kicking the living crud out of each other. I got exactly what I wanted, and more. This movie was very funny. I was laughing so much during Transformers. The level of humor in this movie is great. Some aspects are different than the Generation 1 Transformers, but I think it works. Sure Bumble Bee turns into a Camaro not a VW Beetle. But image a little Beetle turning into all that robot. And the robots are more fancy looking, but again, I think it makes it better. At first I was skeptical of how the robots were designed to look more fancy, but I really started to like the looks of the robots. It worked well for the film. <br/><br/>There are people complaining about the plot, but I want to know this: Why would you go see a movie about giant robots fighting and expect a plot that is riveting and deep more like a drama? I don't get it. And I thought the plot was good. A few holes here and there but it worked fine for me. <br/><br/>In conclusion, if you want to see giant robots beat the tar out of each other, go see this movie. If you want to see a lot of humor, go see this movie. JUST GO SEE IT!!!!"
"LemonyShepard","9","7","12","11 July 2007"," This summer belongs to the Autobots
","I only watched a little bit of the '80s cartoon as a kid, but that was enough to turn me into a die-hard fan of the Autobots and Decepticons. Though, I must admit, when I first saw the original trailer way back when, I groaned. Transformers the live-action movie? This is gonna bomb.<br/><br/>Ha.<br/><br/>Transformers is Michael Bay's most recent masterpiece, breaking box office records around the globe. And the best part of the movie is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. It truly is a nerd's dream come true.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the show, then you know what's going down: the Decepticons (the evil alien robots) are looking for the All Spark cube, the source of life from their home planet Cybertron. Now, these robots are bad-ass and, when the US government starts getting suspicious, they aren't afraid to bring on the smack down.<br/><br/>This brings us to Sam Witwicky, played by the now-famous Shia LaBeouf. He's just an ordinary loser-like kid who doesn't know how to talk to girls, LadiesMan217 is his screen name, and is just getting his first car: a yellow 1974 Camaro. Quickly, Sam realizes that there's more to his car than meets the eye.<br/><br/>The special effects are the best I've seen so far in any movie (second only to Davey Jones in the Pirates series). When you first see an actual transformation, you will be on the edge of your seat, jaw dropped to the floor. The battles are intense, and the car chases are just fantastic knowing that the cars are really giant robots in disguise. The acting is top notch, especially Shia (who is quickly becoming a favorite of mine) and his counter actress, Megan Fox. The dialogue constantly flows whenever they are in a scene together, which, thankfully, is often.<br/><br/>The only character that I felt was unnecessary and was Anthony Anderson's character, a large, nerdy computer hacker who assists in decoding the Decepticon's messages (long story). He was annoying and clearly placed into the movie for comic relief, which Shia took care of fine all by himself.<br/><br/>The story is pretty out-there, and it will take some suspension of belief to take in everything, but the movie is staying as true to the original cartoon without being too silly. For that, I give the cast and crew complete respect.<br/><br/>The movie does seem a bit long, especially if you're seeing it for the second time, but it truly is the most fun you'll have at the movies all summer. And, really, who can resist going to hear Peter Cullen back as Optimus Prime? Seriously?"
"chup12682","10","7","12","8 July 2007"," Great Movie. What Are People Complaining About?
","Since the movie didn't follow the exact script of the original 1984 plot of robots from outer space trying to find, and thus fight over more energy to bring back to their home world, this movie isn't great? First of all, those who critique the movie of ""destroying"" a perfectly good plot, are somewhat missing the point of translating movies. If you wanted the original plot in a movie form, they already made that version. It was made into a cartoon and those who want to re-live that plot can buy that cartoon movie and put it on their shelves as one of their ""best movies of all time"".<br/><br/>I however, thoroughly enjoyed Michael Bays' take on the movie. I'm not saying I've been a big fan of Michael Bay (I only enjoyed ""The Rock"" & ""Armageddon""... ""Bad Boys"" was OK; the sequel STUNK! and ""Miami Vice"" was a flop) But when it comes to glamorizing military/action movies, Michael bay finds his niche. With that said the plot of the movie was solid! If you had problems with this plot, how do those critics not find plot holes in a cartoon series where the ONLY place to find energy in our EVER GIGANTIC universe is earth? Why would Decepticons need to spend their energy killing humans to extract energy from earth? The movie is geared so that the robots actually have a reason to interact with humans as well as giving an allegory of our own waring tendencies; the fate of the earth is tied to our own fate! How could this plot not speak to any viewer? <br/><br/>I absolutely enjoyed the acting. It properly kept pace with the action of the movie and the characters were well developed. The CGI effects were done SO well! I was truly amazed at how well the CGI characters were choreographed with the environment and actors. Overall, this movie was enjoyable through and through. I hope you go see it!"

But much like this fantasmagorical movie, you will definitely get more than you bargained for or paid for.<br/><br/>There is something for everyone in this flick and all members of the human race will see themselves in at least one of the numerous characters. For a near 3 hour movie, nothing drags, every scene movies forward to the next and keeps you on the edge of the seat. My cool barometer, my 15 y/o daughter thought it was a shorter movie than Pirates which is roughly the same length.<br/><br/>When an autobot gets his legs amputated, and he still rocks onward, I am sure every kid in a wheelchair feels like he wants to go kick some decepticon a$$. <br/><br/>A the end of this movie the entire theater erupted in an impromptu raucous applause, the likes of which I have never seen in near 30 years of movie going.<br/><br/>While it is rumored Transformers cost a whopping 155 million dollars, they will easily make it all back and then some. If a Transforer toy come out after this I for one will buy the damn thing..yup, and I'm 46 years young to boot.<br/><br/>GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!"

","Let me start off with this. I loved Transformers as a kid and I love a fun, mindless action movie (like Crank or Die Hard) This is one of the most overrated films ever made. The special effects look pretty good, but the action is poor, the acting is awful, the story is bland, and the humor is irritating.<br/><br/>OK, so the logic holes are Gigantic. For example, Bernie Mac plays a car salesman who Sam (Shia Labeouf) tries to buy a car from. One of the cars is bumblebee. Bumblebee (somehow) blows up the windows of every other car. Sam takes Bumblebee home and neither he or his father question what the hell just happened.<br/><br/>Megan Fox is hot, but she's a terrible actress. John Tutorro is great, but he's really chewing up the scenery here. Josh Duhemal and Tyrese Gibson aren't given much to do. Shia Labeouf is so-so.<br/><br/>But we don't care about that stuff right? I mean this is an action movie. Too bad that there are barely any robot fights in a film called transformers. For instance, in one scene Shia Labeouf and Megan fox are running away from a decepticon. Bumblebee starts fighting it, but instead of focusing on Bumblebee fighting, we focus on those stupid teenagers running. Screw That. I wanna see robots fight. This film is more about the humans than the transformers.<br/><br/>When the robot fights do happen, it's pretty poorly filmed and none of the fights are terribly engaging.<br/><br/>We don't even meet Megatron for like 90 minutes and we don't meet optimus for like an hour. Lame. I don't care about a couple of stupid teenagers and their car.<br/><br/>And the whole plot revolves around Ebay? That's a real cool idea for an action movie. ugh.<br/><br/>And the ""humor"" is awful. The only funny scene in the whole movie was the doughnut joke. Everything else was just stupid.<br/><br/>If you truly are a Transformers fan, don't waste your time. This film sucks"
"vlahov","1","12","24","28 August 2007"," Transformers - a diagnose of the modern American society taste (or lack of)
","Well, it isn't the ""movie"" itself which is bothering me. Mr Bay hasn't betrayed his usual bad way of film-making, or not making film at all. He certainly has no clue of directing and is the world's worst director of all times, putting Ed Wood deeply behind, but for no apparent reason is loved by Americans too. This is something I could not explain. What we have here is some ludicrous attempt backed with money and nothing else. Like some boy who was playing with so expensive toys Mr Bay has shown us he would do the same thing over and over again, just because someone down there gives green light for his movies. The flaws are so many I cant bear to count. The script is non existing. They could hire a schoolboy who would do better than current one. For those that yell ""but this is only a remake of the animated cartoon series so what script goddamn it"" I'll answer that even the bad movies around often have acceptable scripts. This is just a turkey. For 2 and a half long hours we are pressed to watch something that cant decide for itself what it wants to be - a cheap teen comedy with insulting jokes, sleazy romantic drama or parody in the end of the long run. Everything except what its pretending to be. The fact that imbecile movies like that one are given such high ratings (I kid you not, this one has greater ratings than The Godfather and The Deer Hunter!) is truly, madly, deeply beyond me. It says something for the American society as whole. It seems that so many people can go to something so low and cheap that it becomes nearly a tragedy. I am so happy of not sharing it.<br/><br/>What really bothers me (and surely pisses me off) is the fact this turd wrapped in toilet paper is so highly praised and received so great ratings here. What's wrong with you guys? No, I mean, seriously - are you all so easily amused? From such things as masturbation and pee jokes? Have you fallen so low that Marianas Trench is not deep enough for you? I keep asking these questions who might be never answered..."

","My wife and I walked out after 40 minutes. This was a huge disappointment to me. When I first heard they had made a movie our of a bad 20 year old cartoon (and toy) I dismissed it but when i saw the ratings on IMDb for my demo(Males over 45 rated 7.3) I figured this would be a Pirates of the Caribean pleasant surprise. it wasn't. And here's the thing: I like almost any movie with Sci Fi, Robots, or military action and this had all three. Yet it was offensively boring. Am i completely out of touch or have the super reliable IMDb ratings lost their way? there have been plenty of times when I liked a movie a lot more or a lot less than my peers, but never a case where I give a movie a 1 then got a 7.3 from everyone else.<br/><br/>The transformers CGI was cartoonish. The comedy was silly and not funny. The plot was non-existent. Maybe it got better after the 40 minutes i saw (there were 100 minutes to go) but I can't imagine it would've saved my opinion. I'm not a movie snob. I loved comedies like spaceballs, Austin powers, and Waynes world. I ate up Sci Fi like I Robot, Solyaris, blade runner, etc. All of these had a plot or well written comedy. what am I missing here? One or two other films this year were much worse (in my opinion) than their ratings. Rattatouille comes to mind as one of the only Pixar offerings I didn't love and somehow it got a 8.3 from my demo (I'd give it a 4 or 5). Please someone tell me have I lost my mind?"

They have a bizarre OS, that is specifically optimized for their single need - displaying a map of USA with red dots on it. 3. When a computer is hacked into, the screen flickers. 4. Evil hackers, even if hot chicks, will always be proficient at martial arts as well. 5. You can hack a computer system by directing weird sounds at it. 6.

It's about: <br/><br/>1. A young kid trying to score with the class bimbo. <br/><br/>2. Computer analysts stealing government files and trying to crack a code while playing Dance Dance Revolution, telling the police not to step on grandma's carpet or she will get very, very angry, eating donuts and all the jokes that go along with eating donuts. <br/><br/>3.

"amblin53","3","14","29","3 July 2007"," I was totally mistaken!!!
","A couple of weeks ago I was bragging about how great Transformers was going to be, but I was wrong. The movie was just a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger action movie. No offense to Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg but the movie was a not well put together movie. The acting was horrible, some of the characters were annoying, the action was sometimes impossible to see because of how much stuff was going on the shot and the sound effects were extremely and unnecessarily loud. Also the whole movie was basically a comedy that really wasn't funny. The only thing I can't complain about was that at least I understood the story, even though there were some holes and incomplete character plots. Another thing that bugs me is why did the military decide to go to LA to have the robots fight where there are millions of people. Maybe you can figure it out.<br/><br/>Even though I read the reviews about Transformers being a bad acting movie, I went to go watch the movie just to see the action scenes, I knew that the movie was not going to be any good. I am surprised that Steven Spielberg would help produce a movie like this. And in my opinion the only two good movies that Michael Bay has directed has been The Rock and The Island. As for Shia LaBeouf this isn't his best movie. Also John Turturro and Jon Voight sadly did not give a good performance in the movie.<br/><br/>The three reasons why I am giving the movie three stars is because first Megan Fox is really hot, second the visual effects were amazing, and third even though the action scenes were a mess I still found it to be amazing on how they finalized the visual effects all together. This movie just shows how teenagers like me, go to the movies to watch movie junk like Transformers and don't experience what good film-making is. If you plan to go see Transformers I don't blame you, I went to go see it too. But, in my opinion you should save your money and go see a better movie like Ratatouille, but make sure you go in the morning so that you don't have lowlife parents bringing their screaming one month old babies to the theater. I am ashame on how crappy Hollywood is becoming with their movies. As a person who looks forward into studying film-making this movie is not a good example of how the film-making business is influential."

","Major disappointment, if Bay is the king of crass crap (example: bumblebee peeing on turturro's character) this would be his crown jewel of a summer suck-fest. I grew up watching the transformers and lived through the last attempt at making a transformer movie (alas most of my toy collection did not), but my psyche could barely push through 2 1/2 hours of mountain dew machines transforming, non-stop overacting, frivolous humor, and just about the worst film editing I have ever experienced. There is no rescuing a movie that loses track of one whole transformer (I leave you to figure out who's missing). The transformations are cool for about a second and that's about all you will see of the robots because most of the film is wasted on some terrible acting with characters that did very little to advance the story. I could barely get my eyes to focus on one of the autobots (which looked amazing) before a camera would shake or a cut scene to a fat kid eating a plate of donuts. All out summer blockbuster it was not, shameless product placement for American cars and the U.S. Army it was. P.S. kids and adults alike its time to throw one more toy in the back of the closet by the end of this one. Spielberg and Bay should have known better after the last movie. Seriously what does it say about your film when you kill the only black transformer? And where did that Australian accent come from...lets pray that actress never works in Hollywood again, ugghhh...."

First off: the cast, not just the humans acting, but the voice work work for the robots were excellent and spot on to the characters.The plot is reasonable, and that's saying a lot for a movie called ""transformers"". The pace was good, and it's humor was pretty good too(definitely not as bad as the sequel's).I think the best part's pf this movie is the soundtrack and the special effects, they were REVOLUTIONARY, especially the scene where we meet the autobots for the first time, it is my favorite movie scene ever.Fans of the original may not be too happy with some of the changes, but the film has some great homages to the original television series, which should tide the fans over until a BETTER sequel.I strongly encourage you not only to watch this film, but to OWN IT. you won't regret it."

It all goes to hell in a handbasket as the Decepticons steal a fragment of the All Spark and revive Megatron! The Autobots ask for Sam's help, who declines. Soon enough, Sam is in trouble as Megatron tries to capture him because he holds the map to where the Matrix of Leadership is kept. During his rescue, Optimus is destroyed and the Autobots are asked to leave the planet by the government. Sam, now feeling responsible goes on a quest to find the Matrix to revive Optimus and learns that they Transformers have been on Earth for millions of years, led by the Fallen. It is this Decepticon that wants the Matrix to destroy the sun and take it's energy for himself! So now, there is way too much camp and comedy. The story lacks continuity. Megan Fox is hot but can't act. Shia is charmingly annoying. Who is the idiot that plays Leo? Skids and Mudflap....oops? Here is why I give it 5 stars! The Transformers themselves! They are the movie! Frank Welker from the cartoon voices Soundwave. Jetfire! There are more Autobots and Decepticons to enjoy! But the real reason for 5 stars....OPTIMUS PRIME!!! For the first time fans get what they've always wanted, Optimus unleashed. He is a force in this movie and basically kicks a$$ and takes names later! For these reasons, I forget everything else. No one will ever confuse Transformers for Casablanca! That's not what these movies are about! Way go Bay and co."
"phoenix_100","9","6","10","1 January 2011"," Review of 'Transformers'
","Transformers was brilliantly done. The film circles around Sam Witwicky who, through his ancestry, becomes intertwined with robots, known as 'Transformers'. The movie runs at a deathly pace. The dialogue and action scenes were brilliantly done. I really loved the plot, and in saying that, the action also, I mean, who doesn't want to see robots beating the metal out of each other?! <br/><br/>The movie maintained the same amount of suspense and action that it did the first time I watched it, which was brilliant. The cast was stellar, and everyone fitted their roles perfectly. The dialogue was exquisitely smooth and the acting was brilliant, with a stellar act by Simmons (played by Turtorro). Shia LeBouf was great as Sam, and so was Duhamel with his role as Major Lennox.<br/><br/>This movie runs at a lightning pace. Transformers is filled with brilliantly conceived action, humour and a fantastic plot. The physics of the transformations were really well done, and the fighting scenes were awesome. This film has massive re-playability value and it definitely deserves a strong 9/10."

Every true man and a sci-fi fan must see this! Not forgetting Michael Bay's amazing will to blow things up, this was a real half-military movie! Actors were just perfect!<br/><br/>And what about the computer graphics, I wish I could tell you. They put so much details into the robots! I wish you could see my face when I first saw a robot transforming. Not any ''bend-your-knees-and-elbows-motion'', but very detailed.. well.. transformation!<br/><br/>The camera might shake sometimes a bit, but it makes it more realistic when the aliens are in action. Remarkable.<br/><br/>And one more thing: the sounds! Wow! You gotta hear the sound effects! Not talking about the music score, which is so beautiful, and which is in my soundtracks' top list.<br/><br/>Those people writing these weird reviews, are not even serious! They went and see this movie just to find some flaws and only bad points, writing checks in their notebooks. It really looks like that. They only see bad in all things.

"lewiskendell","8","6","10","15 June 2010"," Exactly what you'd expect a big screen version of Transformers to be.
","I have great news: even Michael Bay couldn't run a movie about giant robots fighting each other. Though he did give it his best effort in Transformers 2. <br/><br/>Transformers is a fun blend of action and humor. The action never fails to impress. Some of the most beloved Transformers were lovingly created on-screen for this movie, and it's just fun to see them changing forms and actually doing the cool stuff that countless boys all over the world once had them doing in their imaginations. The explosions, special effects, and computer-generated robots are all a joy to behold. <br/><br/>The humor only occasionally strays into territory that's too childish for even the kids that are a large part of the targeted audience. Most of the time, there are genuine laughs to be had to break up the long action set pieces. Shia Lebouf is a funny and likable protagonist, and pairing him with Megan Fox resulted in a pair of reasonably good central characters. This movie isn't really about the human characters, anyway. It's about the robots. And if you're a fan of Transformers, action, CGI wizardry, or all three, you're probably going to be as pleased with this as I was."

By the way great TV show.... but back to seriousness at hand here.... Am glad Michael Bay has done this movie and hope for him to do more. I was one of them non believers and after watching the final trailer there was some hope in there that this movie was going to be worth watching. I watched, I loved! and reason being, kept the robots feeling like the cartoon an even including some old school lyrics by Optimus from old '84 movie. And Acting wasn't bad either so kept the movie epic, what else you wanted? <br/><br/>This isn't 80s anymore and if you think everything can be done like films of old, think again! This movie shows an proves the technology we have now days for awesome special FX movies can go beyond still.

","Now, i do not consider myself to be a big Transformers fan. The show was before my time, and the animation a little dated. However, when i heard that the Transformers were going to be projected onto the big screen; i was greatly intrigued. I wasn't disappointed with what i saw.<br/><br/>The basic plot is there is a war between the Autobots (good guys), and the Deceptacons (bad guys). Megatron, the leader of the Deceptacons has been frozen on Earth, and is in captivity. A cube of energy known as the Allspark, which has landed on Earth, and along with Megatron is also held by the American Government. The Allspark has the ability to turn any machine into a transformer. However, Megatron wants the Allspark in order to create an army of Deceptacons and rule the Earth. Luckily the Autobots lead by Optimus Prime intend on preventing Megatron from succeeding, and attempt to destroy the Allspark.<br/><br/>The plot is strong, and is able to keep an audience entertained for the duration, although the sub-plotted love story, although expected is a little clichéd and predictable.<br/><br/>The script is well written, with a number of witty jokes and genuine laugh out loud moments. However, it was my greatest disappointment to see such little dialect between the Transformers, and especially the Deceptacons. However, perhaps the character developments are being saved until the sequels.<br/><br/>The acting is of a good standard, although i found Shia Le Boeuf to outshine the rest. He's come a long way from Even Stevens.<br/><br/>The CGI is faultless, and the transformations are slick and intricate, and the Transformers themselves look fantastically lifelike.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a throughly enjoyable movie with enough explosions to keep the adrenaline junkies on the edge of their seats, whilst retaining a clever script to keep everyone else entertained. This movie can appeal to young and old, and it is certainly a surprise to see Michael Bay make a decent movie for once. I only hope he doesn't ruin the good work with the sequels."

","I'm 26 - one of the lucky people who got to grow up with the animated series, and once upon a time used to drive a plastic Optimus Prime around, and as a fan of the original, I must say I love this movie. It's everything I expected and some more.<br/><br/>""Transformers"" is probably the best cartoon-to-movie adaption I've seen so far. It's funny, with underlying seriousness, and honors the old animés. The actors work for me, and I won't say anything more about them, 'cause lets face it - this is not the movie to watch for the sake of human actors. (A regal curtsy to Shia LeBeouf, though, for his great interacting with the robots.) The robots, on the other hand, I could go on and on about. (Don't worry, I won't.) They look simply awesome. This is CG at its best; balanced and believable. From the moment Blackout started shooting things up and on, I sat with a happy grin on my face, that only got wider towards the end.<br/><br/>The voices are better than I imagined. Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime will forever stand alongside sir Alec Guinness' Obi-Wan Kenobi in my memory, as two actors who managed to pull off some, at times, very difficult, bordering ridiculous dialog. Hugo Weaving is superb as Megatron, and makes the Decepticon leader the menacing madman he is. His ""You've failed me yet again, Starscream"" was music to my ears. <br/><br/>As a hardcore fan of the animés, perhaps I haven't been very critical about this movie, but I don't want to be either, because this IS Transformers."

","How does one maintain objectivity when writing a review of what can only be called one of the raddest movies ever? Ah, who cares! I'm just going to pour on the praise and hope that the Transformers don't get too swell-headed. When one coughs up close to ten dollars to see a movie these days, they expect something special, and though I figured I'd be disappointed, this was probably the best Summer Action movie I have seen since the original Spider-Man. Sure it was a two and a half hour toy commercial, but that's okay. It didn't pretend to be anything more than it was; a fun movie that had its huge budget spent on action sequences and special effects. The film starts with a little exposition on the origin of the Transformers and the loss of their home world, then cuts to ""Present Day"", first at a military base in the Middle East, that is attacked by Decepticons who want to know the location of their leader who crashed to Earth. There are barely any survivors of the first attack. Then they try to raid the computers of Air Force One, gaining valuable information. The government thinks that a foreign power is behind the apparent attacks, but a select handful either begin to know, or already know otherwise. Enter Sam Witwicky, great-grandson of the man who discovered the frozen body of Megatron in the Artic decades earlier. Sam makes contact with Bumblebee (now an absolutely sweet Chevy Camaro), and through him develops a relationship with the totally hot Mikaela, who is quite tough in her own right. They make contact with the other Auntobots and learn the importance of Sam's ancestor's discovery, and that the fate of the world hangs in the balance as the Autobots race the Decepticons in search of the All Spark, a cube that is full of life-giving energy. I won't give away the ending, but I didn't think it was possible for a movie like that to create such an adrenaline rush anymore. Sure I loved the series and toys when I was younger, but this film holds up in its own right. In a great nod to the original series, Peter Cullen returns as the voice of Optimus Prime, but sadly, Frank Welker does not return for the voice of Megatron (worry not dear friends, there will definitely be a sequel and this minor wrong could be righted). All in all, for a mid-summer action flick, this movie was perfect. I don't expect it to sweep the Oscars, but I do think that it works for the entire audience; it's action packed, the SFX are stunning, there is a fair share of humor, and parents won't be bored while watching it with their kids."

I wasn't particularly looking forward to this movie, nor was I blown away by its trailers. I was thinking that this is just another CGI movie with cheesy plots and lots of fighting. Boy was I wrong. It is the best movie I've watched so far for this year! The movie started off slowly, with lots of curious humans wondering what the heck was invading earth. Later, we all will learn what the Autobots and Decepticons are, and what their mission is. It wasn't all thrown at you in one go, but the plot was slowly revealed to you, making it an enjoyable watch, as far as plot goes.<br/><br/>There are funny times, when you laugh out loud. But it wasn't too cheesy. And there are times when you want to cry out for your favourite robot. The cast was excellent, making you believe in them and want to sit with them throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, an excellent storyline, extremely good CGI, some nice action scenes (even for the girls), with cute casts to go along. Its been a while since I voted a 10 for any movie."
"Runelady","9","6","10","6 July 2007"," If you liked the 80's cartoon, you will LOVE this movie!
","I wasn't sure what to expect when I went to see this film, but I prayed for the best. When I first saw the previews over a year ago, I swore to everyone that I would see it during the sneak preview... and I did. I was a huge fan of the cartoon in the 1980's.<br/><br/>This is the ONLY film I have viewed in the theater more than once, (6 times to be precise). Normally, I am rather picky about dialogue and acting, which were sub-par at best in this film, but the action and special effects generously compensated for what it lacked. I was thrilled to hear the voice of Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime, and the personalities of the Autobots were dead-on! <br/><br/>As much as I loved this film, I was slightly upset that Jazz wasn't a Porsche like he was in the original series. I suppose the Pontiac Solstice was a close enough match. He did look pretty cool. I was quite impressed with the new image given to Bumblebee. He was, by far, my favorite character in this movie. Also, Megatron does not morph into a gun. I didn't mind that either. Even though it was great in the cartoon, it just would not have worked in a live-action film.<br/><br/>One thing, however, was way off: Devastator was a tank. Now, for those of you who remember the original series, Devastator was a giant robot formed by the Constructicons. The only tank in the original series was Warpath, who was an Autobot. I personally think Michael Bay could have done something different here, but for the sake of entertainment, it worked rather well.<br/><br/>Regardless of the discrepancies, I thought Michael Bay did a remarkable job with this film."
"bigzajspam","10","6","10","5 July 2007"," True to its roots and a fun film
","I have been a fan of transformers since I was a kid and this movie really hit it right to me. Sure some things were different, but I think it stayed true to its roots. The autobots had real personalities and weren't turned into big drones by Hollywood, they kept the banter between Optimus and Megatron during their fight in the streets and it ended off with a nice monologue by Optimus Prime.<br/><br/>It was also a very funny movie. Some critics went to see this movie in anticipation of a cinematic masterpiece. Well it isn't the Godfather and doesn't try to be. It is an in your face action packed, special affects filled movie about big ass robots from space that are fighting each other. I would have to guess the intention is not to develop the dynamic struggle within the characters but more to show big explosions and fights that make you go ""Man that was awesome"". It was about as true to the characters (transformers in this case) as any of the big studio movies based on some comic book or cartoon series from yesteryear. Awesome Awesome TRANSFORMERS movie, which is what it is, a TRANSFORMERS movie."

","Transformers the movie was awesome it's the best action movie of the year great actors,special features and everything it is worth buying a ticket for.If you like jumping out of your seat with excitement this is the movie for you lots of excitement and comedy. This is my new favorite movie the theme of the movie is great you know it had to take a long time but it was worth it. Transformers is going to be put up for so many awards and has already won an award before it hit theaters. For best movie we haven't seen yet by the MTV movie awards. If there's a movie that has been nominated for an award and won even before it hits theaters then that is the type of movie i would like to see. There are a lot of action movie's out there like ghost rider,die hard,fantastic four,spider man etc. but transformers wins them over hands down. Transformers like any action movie has it's villain hero problem solution etc, but is taken to a whole new different level of action this movie is compared to a roller coaster it has up's adventurous parts and down's slow but good parts of the movie so go see the best movie of the year(DON'T WAIT GO SEE THE DARN MOVIE)."

","The movie opened at the Local theater on Monday, I went to the 8pm showing with a friend. Bothof us are huge fans of the cartoon series. Never the less we where both expecting TRANSFORMERS to be just like the other movies of recent that remade classic 80's TV shows. After the very first action scene in the movie, when the movie paused on a black screen all my friend and I could say was WOW! This is coming from the two people who you never want to watch a movie with because we are terrible critics and rip movies apart while we watch them. TRANSFORMERS was so good that even though it has only been out 3 days I have already seen it twice, and I hate spending the money for movie theater ticket prices. Please anyone who is thinking about seeing this movie don't wait go see it cause your going to want to see it more than once."
"JSM15859","10","6","10","5 July 2007"," See Transformers, Now!!!!
","I am going to be short and sweet with this. Transformers has a perfect mix of action, and, surprisingly, good comedy. You will be invested in the characters and want to see them succeed. The Transformers looked awesome and the action sequences were amazing. If you are worried about sitting through an action movie for 2+ hours, don't worry. You won't even notice that you have been sitting that long. Children and adults will love this movie. And honestly, as much as I don't like crowds, watching this movie with a good crowd will only add to the overall experience. Truly, if you miss Transformers you are missing one of the most entertaining movies in years."
"DashingDon","10","6","10","1 July 2007"," He is a genius!
","Ah yes, military bases - no tax on goods, cheap gas, and a sneak preview of Transformers. Michael Bay did one hell of a bang up job on this one.<br/><br/>I went into the movie expecting a cool, product-placement movie, but what I got in return was a ridiculous but awesome film. From the get go, the movie is fast paced and the action starts quick. Then it slows down into a story building motion, but speeds up again after the introduction of all of the characters. Basically, the movie can be split into two parts: the ridiculous, comedic portion and the action oriented, blow your mind portion.<br/><br/>As for the graphics, simply put they are orgasmically good. The transformations from car to bot, and vice versa, are smooth and flowing even in the middle of action. They mesh well with the environments and actually appear to be real without that CGI-texture look.<br/><br/>Nerd or moviegoer alike, the movie is great and I would have spent my hard-earned money it if I didn't have the option of seeing this free screening. However, for the supernerds out there, there are a few inconsistencies in the movie but only they would let that ruin the experience. Easily and most likely the top movie of the summer so far."

If you're ever wondering how to identify a Michael Bay movie just watch for people entering or exiting military aircraft in slow motion with way-too-dramatic music piped in.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure this will hold the title of worst adaptation of an 80's cartoon ever made....until John Woo's ""The Snorks"" comes out.

I read all the time where some poster claims to be a moviefest buff and knows somebody to get to see advanced press screenings before the press screenings and they down play a movie like this simply because it doesn't follow up to traditional standards. I'm glad I don't take these kind of people seriously and check things out for myself.<br/><br/>To be honest, I never planned on seeing the movie because I for one grew out of the Hasbro camp long ago but by mere opportunity I seen this today with my son due to be late for another movie.<br/><br/>I must say that that I am happy that I've gotten my money's worth because there wasn't a dull moment for me.

","I was very excited to see a live action movie about Transformers. However I was disappointed with the results. It seems like the movie about robots wasn't really centered around the robots. While this might have been to give the movie a more human touch, it ruined it for me. Again it's a movie about robots and their interactions with humans not the other way around.<br/><br/>The good: *The robots were cool looking (hey, this is a movie about robots) *some of the human robot interactions were masterful<br/><br/>The bad: *The action sequences were many times too close up, it was hard to tell who was fighting who, and when you could tell who was fighting who it was hard to tell what was going on. * This movie should have been 40 minutes shorter, much of the plot was aimed at bringing inconsequential characters more screen time and did not move the story along. *the cheese factor: it seems like they couldn't decide if they wanted this movie to be serious or cheesy, so they said ""oh let's go for a little of both"" (e.g. the transformer introductions, or the whole ""bedroom"" scene) *The character build-up is so poor that you don't care what happens to most of them (the people not the transformers)"
"mirwais-orbit","1","11","22","19 August 2007"," Funny only for Americans!
","I don't understand and it's impossible for me to understand why this movie is being so much well rated by people. This is a crap that only Michael Bay is possible to offer. It's a movie only for Americans taste and it's funny only for that audience because the movie is full of those ""american jokes"", jokes that 95% of rest of world population would not even move a facial muscle for it.<br/><br/>Michael Bay is well known for horrible blockbusters like The Rock, Armageddon and one of the worst flops of history: Pearl Harbor. I kinda liked The Island, but I totally hated Transformers.<br/><br/>It's sad being sit by almost 2 hours and 30 minutes of horrible acting (exception of Shia, he's a very nice boy), terrible script, awful plot and those wannabe-funny robots.<br/><br/>Those robots are a shame. The robots on the animated series were fun because, you know, it was ANIMATED. Now, there's no reason for those robots that came from a totally different world to have hip hop manners, feel pain, have fighting techniques or just scream during a hunt: I CAN SMELL YOU. Where in the world those robots would do that? Oh, I know... Hollywood.<br/><br/>That movie is for kids only. If adults like it, it will be just for the visual effects and for some remembering of their childhood and not for being a very interesting or funny movie.<br/><br/>I'm completely disappointed. When the movie ended I was just wanting my money back."
"Agent10","7","18","40","3 July 2007"," Decent, but weighed down by a sloppy script and humans
","We all knew the Transformers would be well made, well crafted creatures due to the utter genius that is Industrial Light and Maghic. But its too bad the human element was what bogged this movie down.<br/><br/>Sure, we'll watch the movie, but there was just too much exposition and for us impatient, Ritalin-riddled miscreants of the world, it was excruciating. First of all, the script was pretty lousy. Now I know the guy who wrote this film supposedly wrote X-Men, but lets face it, that was a good seven years ago. There were plenty of things that could have been chopped out of this film. Now I understand the producers wanted to get a little titillation with Raechel Taylor and Megan Fox, but they were both dead weights to the movie and the movement. Without those two, we could get rid of Anthony Anderson, another waste of words, and maybe even expand Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson's roles. Either way, the female element in the film was completely useless. Let's face it, guys watched this cartoon growing up, and we want action, violence and lots of transforming. Who fricking cares if Shia LeBouf's character gets some action. Its completely irrelevant. It would have also been nice to see some conflict between Megatron and Starscream.<br/><br/>The only other thing I didn't like was the awful soundtrack. The strings portion of the film was pretty substandard, borrowing the most generic themes one could possibly imagine. Then there is the random songs and generic heavy metal they try to slip in. It was like the people who mixed the film took a lesson from the dopes that mixed Daredevil, which had an equally awful mixture of CD sales-friendly mixing.<br/><br/>But I digress. For those that had doubts about the transforming, it was put to rest rather quickly. Dazzling to say the least, it was as realistic as one could have hoped for, making the transformations rather cool. ILM must have put their best and brightest on this movie, because it certainly shows. This brilliance alone made up for the bad exposition and substandard characters. <br/><br/>I gave this film a ""7"" simply because it was entertaining, but they are gonna have to tighten up the screws for future sequels. People won't put up with unnecessary characters and bad music for very long."
"exarch3d","2","21","48","12 August 2007"," A frankly dull and terrible movie.. aimed at 6 year olds
","How did this movie end up so bad? In theory its a movie that couldn't fail.. yet somehow they manage to make it not just dumb (which can be fine in an action flick) but incredibly BORING as well.<br/><br/>It bears an uncanny resemblance to Herbie: Fully Loaded in terms of its casting, the sophistication of it's plot, and the style of movie making. Its basically a lightweight teen comedy.. which happens to have a few big robots that show up occasionally to do clownish comedy.<br/><br/>The lead character is reasonably funny, in a lightweight kinda way. Its just that the jokes go on.. and on... and on... after about 20 minutes you are severely hoping he'll get annihilated by the decepticons.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for the audience.. the decepticons don't really even show up for about 90 minutes.. apart from a crazy, comedy, mini decepticon which acts kinda like a hyperactive jar jar binks.<br/><br/>Even more criminally, the Autobots aren't in the movie much either. Probably their largest amount of screen time is an ENDLESS comedy skit where they bumble around the back garden, treading on fountains, getting peed on by dogs and trying to hide from the kid's parents. (who are also kinda funny.. but seem to think they are in an American Pie movie).<br/><br/>The special effects are pretty sweet, but not quite as amazing as they are made out to be. The integration with the real world is usually pretty good. But the little jar-jar robot looks like some reject SFX from 5 years ago.<br/><br/>The action sequences are huge... with lots of explosions and destruction. But they aren't very coherent. Part of the problem is the new designs for the robots.. when they are in motion they look like an indistinct pile of garbage. Trying to see what is actually going on when two indistinct shapes are flipping around and fighting in amongst all the explosions, and with all the bad editing, is pretty hard.<br/><br/>Which must be why they mostly ignore the autobots and concentrate on showing us the US army shooting at stuff, and running in slow motion. (its a great advert for the army... plus yahoo, pontiac, and all the other blatant product placement).<br/><br/>The action sequences just don't measure up in terms of excitement, pacing and coherence to recent movies like Die Hard 4.0.<br/><br/>The film gets 4 points for Optimus Prime. He still rocks. His voice is cool. He's not actually in the movie much.. but when he is he usually rocks. Unfortunately it then loses 2 for making him say ""my bad"".<br/><br/>Also.. what happened to the cute blonde hacker, and her comedy sidekick (yet another one)??? They just disappeared from the story.<br/><br/>I'm not exactly sure what happened to Michael Bay.. he made one of the best action movies ever in The Rock.. and every subsequent film has been worse. This one actually makes Armageddon look like a good movie. OK popcorn flick.. but as is, its pretty terrible. 2/10"
"Jim_Hopper","6","29","70","2 July 2007"," Extremely high level of robot detail + shaky camera work = what the heck was that?
","I went into 'Transformers' expecting something that would be good on many levels. I was expecting a well-paced movie with a good story, a good plot, good character development, and of course good special effects. Alas, the only thing this movie really really accomplishes well are special effects. And let me tell you, these effects are totally completely mind-blowingly amazing. To put it bluntly it takes it to a whole other level. This movie sets a benchmark. It will win academy awards for breaking all kinds of special effects barriers.<br/><br/>But this unfortunately is the film's one and only ace. I went into this movie expecting an all around good movie. I don't know why I had such high expectations though. One look at who was directing it should have made me know better. Michael Bay. What do you expect? The man doesn't know how to make anything other than big, explosive, shiny, dumb movies that usually do really well at the box office. People like his kind of movies, I guess. But to me, it just seems that they are all rather poorly planned. 'Transformers' isn't well balanced at all. Granted, its a movie about robots, and thats clearly where most of the effort was put. But like others have said, if just a little bit was taken away from the extremely hard-to-follow action scenes and put into a better story with a more intelligent script with more attention to suspense and drama this movie would be much better.<br/><br/>Its high point is the incredible special effects, but even the effects are hampered by extremely shaky camera work, unnecessary zooming, panning, rotating, and twisting to make the shot look more ""interesting"" (I suppose). There were times during some of the massive (and I mean MASSIVE) battle scenes were you literally didn't know what the hell was going on. Some battles were really well done - and ironically those were the one's you could actually follow! But most were very shaky, poorly shot, and too close-up to really take in everything that was happening. The robots were of such a high level of detail (which is normally a really good thing) its incredibly hard to see what's what as they swing their arms and legs and jump and fly and run all over each other at a very rapid pace. Was that Megatron or Starscream attacking Optimus Prime? You don't know because everything is moving so fast, the detail level on the robots is so ridiculously fine its hard to really differentiate between them, and the camera is shaking so much. Bumblebee was easy to point out in the battle scenes because he is yellow. So just look for the yellow blurs and flashes and you know you're looking at Bumblebee. The weird part about all of this is that the special effects crew no doubt did an awesome job in animating and detailing the robots. They all look so real and finely detailed -- thats when the camera is steady enough to actually see what they are. But once the fighting begins, its Headache City trying to follow the action. Maybe I'm just getting too old for this. Maybe the kiddies can follow whats going on.<br/><br/>Overall, I rate this movie a 6/10. The special effects are totally awesome and I suppose that was the major aim of the movie, which it accomplishes with flying colors. But many scenes were unfortunately degraded by bad camera work. Better directing could have made many of the scenes more suspenseful. And the comedy brings an unwelcome light-hearted feeling that doesn't compliment the huge, violent, and spectacular action pieces.<br/><br/>BTW, I don't understand why some people are calling this militaristic propaganda"". I suspect these people are the kind that label everything as ""propaganda"" in knee-jerk fashion, as in ""its all a pro-American military fascist brainwash"" or some BS. Just go home and shut up. This is basically a war movie that takes place in the U.S.A. So, yes, the military will tend to play a large role in war movies -- morons. Get over it."
"cosmorados","8","5","8","4 May 2011"," A decent blockbuster that should gets unfairly criticised
","The film begins with a mysterious helicopter heading unceasingly towards a military base. It's pilot is warned what will happen if it keeps coming bit still it comes. Upon landing it lands at the base it ""Transforms"" into one of the Decepticon and proceeds to destroy the military base, with little to no resistance from the troops who are ill-equipped to deal with such raw power, only one small team of soldiers make it out. Skip to high school dweeb Sam Witwicky's show and tell in which he reveals his grandfather was an explorer who went mad and started to ranting about a giant iceman, after getting an A for his presentation he is taken by his Dad to buy his first car, a yellow Camero. After witnessing his car driving off and later getting attacked by another vehicle, Sam discovers that the transforming robots that masquerade as cars are in a desperate quest to find the all-spark before Megatron the leader of the Decepticons.<br/><br/>In the hands of another director this may have become just another toy advert but Michael Bay turns it into a tour-De-force as the Transformers are as real as anything in our world, their metal shining and reflecting exactly as it should creating an illusion that is almost perfect. By being extremely smart and using as much real world stuff as he could, it means that we know that what we are watching is not some stuff that looks like it came off of a Playstation 3 game like in Indy 4 but instead were watching something real unfold, even when we know it is not.<br/><br/>The script does exactly the job it should of telling the story as well as it can with humour, passion, and yes even drama, as you genuinely worry about the robots as much as the humans, unlike so many other empty blockbusters that use over-hype to create a buzz and are rigged merely to sell merchandise, you always feel that in this film the story is the thing and if they do well with the merchandise, well that's a bonus. This is a big stepping stone in the right direction, if you want to sell more toys, make a better film! But for me the next thing of serious note are the actors, everyone of which takes everything they do seriously, which makes this film so believable. There are no dreadful looks to camera, no knowing nods to a post-modern world and even lines that you would think would fall on their ass like ""Gentlemen. I'd like to introduce you to my friend, Optimus Prime!"" actually works, when you would think that they wouldn't. Shia Le Beouf (Apologies for spelling) is magnificent as Sam Witwicky and he performs every scene like his life depends on it. His performance is an assured one that will almost guarantee that he becomes a star, after all he has been doing this for years. The rest of the cast do a great job with Megan Fox having little to do other than look nice, but with Anthony Anderson doing particularly well as the comic relief (He is great at that).<br/><br/>Films should always try and take us to places we may not have been and experience things we have never experienced, be it a perilous climb up the side of a building (safety last), a world of criminal corruption and secrets (LA Confidential), or a world of giant robots that are seeking an all-powerful cube.<br/><br/>For those who think that this is a terrible blockbuster I would say watch GI Joe before you are so quick to criticise this cracker."
"ASAx2345","10","5","8","21 March 2011"," The perfect movie?
","I had very high expectations for this movie. I am a huge fan of sci-fi movies, and grew up watching Shia LaBeouf on TV. Obviously, I didn't want to be let down.<br/><br/>Thankfully, I wasn't. This movie completely met all of my expectations and then some. The visual effects were amazing. Shia LaBeouf gave an exceptionally good performance. It was perfectly paced. I liked how there was actually a plot (unlike some people who didn't bother to pay attention to the dialog think) about two political parties who couldn't settle an argument over something, turned to war, brought an apocalypse to their world, and brought the war to ours. Very dramatic, perfectly paced, and the plot was appealing and interesting to me.<br/><br/>People have been really picking on the character development in this movie. Personally, they just didn't feel it. Sam is a nerd with very few friends and desperately wants to be popular. Mikaela is very popular and is constantly abused and doesn't want to be and is looking for someone to give her salvation.<br/><br/>A lot can be said about how bad the other two were: they both had lots of flaws. This movie, however, is absolutely flawless. I wouldn't change a single thing about it."

Oh and I have to say Meagan Fox is one of the most beautiful women in the spot light right now and she isn't a bad actress. I've watched this title numerous times and every time I see it I'm amazed.

","Transformers is simply amazing. It is entertaining, fun, and the special effects are mind-blowing, even for this age when people take them for granted in every movie.<br/><br/>Of course, all the critics would find many reasons why this film would be bad. They always do that. Regardless, people like it, and that is the main thing. Unlike some other animation/comics-based films, Transformers actually leave the old shell behind and focuses more on making a good entertainment rather than satisfying the die-hard fan's desires for boxy, classic characters. The pacing and editing is also unusual for this kind of movies, resulting in a very realistic environment.<br/><br/>Shia LaBoeuf is simply great as the main character, and stands out the most, whilst Megan Fox, playing the role of protagonist's dream girl, is only trying to look hot instead of acting, sometimes making me wonder if anybody would notice the difference if a poster would be put in her place with voice-over. Her lines are pathetic, but a good (or any) actor talent should have dealt with that. She just doesn't have it.<br/><br/>Overall, a great entertainment. I was very satisfied. This wouldn't have worked without Michael Bay, which made the movie into something more than one would expect from just hearing the name. 9.5/10<br/><br/>==================================================================== ==================================================================== ====================================================================<br/><br/>After a rewatch 08/07/17' of revisiting this first Transformers after watching Age of Extinction, this film stacks up and looks a lot better in comparison. Overall, this film isn't technical on a story and plot scale but it does entertain, and the run time doesn't feel as overly long since it is an enjoyment. Rated a 9 in comparison to the other Transformers film as one feels this is the clear cut best film of the franchise. It is a shame how far the franchise has came since this film 10 years ago. Where as now that the Transformers franchise has had 5 films, many people today are revisiting this film and tending to like it more due to nostalgia and the current state of the series with Mark Wahlberg. Where as back when this was released, it received a lot of backlash from critics and some fans but now it is considered 'great/enjoyable' and people are missing Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox."
"Tolbert","10","5","8","25 September 2008"," Great adaptation of the original cartoon series
","I was a big fan of the original in the 80s, I was that age group that the toys/cartoons targeted. When at first I heard about this, I rolled my eyes and though of how bad it could be.<br/><br/>I was very wrong. This is a good film. The story is there, the graphics are great and the lineage of the Transformers is nice. There are a handful of funny moments too. It's nice to see that this isn't one of those films where all of the good parts are represented in the theatrical trailer. That seems to be the case so often now a days.<br/><br/>For me, watching the Autobots transform from the cars/trucks etc into the characters we grew up with in the 80's was a great part of the film. You look up at them and go whoa! I remember that from when I was a kid! Good Job Michael Bay!"
"macrths","10","5","8","22 August 2007"," Wicked film, way better than I expected
","Yeah, I've commented on movies on IMDb a lot, and I usually give them a ten, and this one is no exception. This is another gem that I wasn't all that certain would be good until the first scene, and then WHAM you are hooked! The movie is roughly about the Transformers, technically called Autobots, who are trying to save Earth from the Decepticons, which obviously are the evil version of these machines. From the name Autobot, you can tell that these Transformers do transform into cars, among them the beat up old Camero bought by sixteen year old Sam Witwicky. Anyway, Sam has this peculiar object that the Autobots require in order to save the planet from certain destruction so the geeky teen is recruited to help save humankind from the Decepticons.<br/><br/>As mentioned earlier, I absolutely loved this movie. It has the perfect combination of humour, romance, and awesome action, the effects were very well done (was impressed that a movie as far fetched and ridiculous as a bunch of transforming cars actually seemed almost believable) and was at the edge of my seat the entire time (when I wasn't laughing or even almost crying, but I won't go into any other details, I don't want to spoil it for anyone else). Shia LaBeouf is a very talented young man, very fresh and sweet. An easy ten even if you are not into transforming robots."

"desispitz","10","5","8","7 July 2007"," the best of 2007
","Alright so there's a lot of hype. And in Hollywood, Hype is almost never good.... well this time we're wrong! Transformers is perhaps the most intriguingly visually appealing film released since the original Jurassic Park, plus the amazing star cast have sparks whenever acting together which makes special effects of its own.<br/><br/>Okay let's start from the beginning. I walked into Transformers with my sister thinking ""wow this is gonna be weak"". When my eyes adjusted to the darkness I realized how hard it was to find a seat. Once we finally did settle down I got to see four boring previews (except for Die Hard which is the best of it's lot). Then the movie started... and I was hooked. The sound is almost as sexy as the movie itself. You seriously feel like you're in the world's greatest Roller coaster ride throughout the movie. Shiloh Boueff is Hilarious, and the chick is so Beautiful. Like seriously, I fell in love. Tyrese and the other Soldier have amazing comedy chemistry together in even the worst situations (when u see it remember ""cell phone in Iraq""). But the gorgeous, most amazing, beautifully rendered characters have got to be the Transformers. My goodness, are they real? Did they really tear that city apart? were they really falling through a moving freeway? Did the Scorpion Trans really come out of the sand like that and snap that dude in half? wow it looked so real. So real, that you'll be looking at your car in a completely different angle.<br/><br/>Michael Bay has always been an amazing director, but this time he cut through my heart. This movie is the best movie I've seen in a long time... I'm going to have to even say it's better than 300... yeah it's that good. When you go see it do not expect a kids movie... there's a lot of sexual references and the two hot lead women (a Analyst with the sexiest accent ever, and the who Shiloh sweats) Jesus Jessica Alba move aside. Meagan Fox is my new dream.<br/><br/>But yes. Of all the films out right now (excluding Rattotioue cause I haven't' seen it) This movie holds the crown. Die Hard is tight... but not even close to the intensity of this movie. 1408 is scary, but not as scary as a Megatron... I love this movie, so much that I even went out and bought the game, an action figure, and I'm gonna reserve the DVD. Transformers is the best movie out this whole year. Go see it, and i guarantee you will never forget it."

","Transformers was definitely worth sitting in the movie theater until 1am for. Michael Bay is a directorial genius and the cast was so excellently picked, it was almost fate. Never a dull moment. I didn't even want to go to the bathroom. I took my 5 and 7 year old kids, so for a mom wondering if it is appropriate. DEFINITELY! My kids were screaming how awesome the movie was after it was over. I cannot wait for the DVD release definitely a movie for your personal DVD collection. I would pay to see it again. I was a kid that grew up on Transformers and to see Optimus Prime transform in front of me all of these years later, I was so pumped up when I arrived home at 1:30 in the morning from the movie theater, I couldn't sleep until 3am. You will definitely be wide open after viewing this movie."
"zgrillo","10","5","8","5 July 2007"," A True Masterpiece
","I thought the movie was very inspiring to the cartoon since I saw the show when I was a baby. and I was surprised though that Peter Cullen was still voicing and wanted to return to what he was voice acting years ago ""Optimus Prime"". Prime looked very powerful and surprisingly he doesn't always wear a face mask like in the cartoon. Other transformers that I loved were there especially Bumblebee. and some of the baddies that I know were there too. it was ashame though that soundwave was not in the movie because the only transformer that was part of the original cassette transformers was Frenzy. which in this one is a Boombox. his role was to infiltrate on top secret information. so thus hes good on espionage missions. Try and see this its great. there's a lot of humor in it. unfortunately Sparkplug isn't what he was from the cartoons"
"Cloudkillerff7","10","5","8","2 July 2007"," Transformers the Best movie?
","Truly in the eyes of most. We can all say we've had that movie, or maybe we haven't. Its a movie that just grabs u in, it amazes every ounce of u, and then we've had bad ones, that we may not even see again. Micheal bay my friends is my hero, what he has done with Transformers is just amazing, and its the best movie of our generation.<br/><br/>From the begging, you'll be sucked in to Industrial Light & Magic's CGI, with Optimus explaining The origin of there race... from then on, things get better when you'll meet the Military characters and let's just say a very kick ass Decepticon makes his way to the base and well the action already picks up. Sam is introduced a few minutes later and the movie picks up even more from there where he goes to buy his first car.<br/><br/>I gotta say. the first thing that will point out in this movie is the CGI. As i will quote from one of IGN's Reviewers: "" How many times have we seen the scrawny, bright kid confront the blonde jock bully and win the hottest girl in school? Or what about the oblivious, uptight parents who somehow manage to block out the gathering of 50-foot robots in their backyard, despite thunderous footfalls and rampant slapstick destruction? How about the cute kid waking up in the middle of the night, thinking the tooth fairy has arrived, only to find a towering robot in her backyard?"" Really, there is so much in this movie it is just astounding. The team has really mastered every Robots movements, moves etc. You will really believe a 50 foot robot is standing in front of you.<br/><br/>I also found a weird mix to the movie. I wasn't expecting Bay to put so much Humor into a movie. It's suppose to be serious Robots fighting a war, but you find your self laughing a lot of times through the movie over little jokes, and some of the robots are pretty damn funny as well, or the key term is, THEY KICK ASS! A Fantastic Story.. loads and i mean f**king loads of action. Bay has outdone himself and has proved he can make a excellent movie. It's the movie that sets Next Gen for movies and effects, 300 folks is nothing till you've watched Transformers.<br/><br/>My Score: 10 out of 10. Yes, A Perfect Score. This movie anyone can watch for years and days to come and i will still be amazed every single time.. Congratulations from me to all the Staff, you have made the perfect Summer Movie Indeed. Transformers is the best movie to date made.. believe it."
"moutonbear25","3","36","90","5 July 2007"," Scrap Metal
","Optimus Prime: Sorry, my bad.<br/><br/>No, it is I who is sorry, Optimus Prime, for I do not accept your apology. You can hardly be held accountable for the two-hour plus mess that is TRANSFORMERS, 2007's tent pole original blockbuster, but my anger needs to be directed somewhere. Seeing as how director Michael Bay is not standing here in front of me, you my fictional friend will have to do. It could have all been so simple. You had a pretty solid cartoon back in the 80's. The Autobots and Decepticons had their crews in check and their goals set. Both teams found themselves here on Earth. The Decepticons were bent on bleeding the world of its energy to bring back to your home planet somewhere so that they could rule while you were here to stop them and protect us simple humans at the same time. They would plot and you would plan and battles would go on with very little involvement on the part of the human race. Why then, in your live action feature film debut, do we see no trace of you but instead a few unpopular Decepticons and a ton of one-liner jokester humans for the first half of this film? Could your agent not negotiate you some more screen time?<br/><br/>The Transformers from the cartoon series had personality, ranging from a corny sense of humour to loyalty to caring. The movie machines, well, they have names and that's about it. Gone are the neurosis and power struggles, replaced by supposed strength and stature. Standing and looking pretty for our enjoyment only takes us so far. Without squabbling between Megatron and Starscream to scoff at, we're left to seek out personality from the human faction of this ensemble. Unfortunately, like any ""good"" action movie, actual colour in a character or a performance is entirely optional. Army boys anxiously await their return to their loved ones at home; high school jocks mock the dorks to look good for their girls; and those same girls can twist their hips just right to catch the setting sun against their bare stomachs. With such reusable filler characters, no actor actually has to try to craft depth into the fold. Luckily, the ""IT"" boy himself, Shia LaBeouf, is young enough and hungry enough to not forsake his own talents to the point of banality. As Sam Witwicki, TRANSFORMERS' central human character, LaBeouf is charming, shy and earnest. His performance shines like the brightest piece in a sea of scrap metal and solidifies his face as one that will be seen for many years to come.<br/><br/>Why do I find myself going on and on about people in a review for a movie about machines? Perhaps this is because TRANSFORMERS treats the Transformers like an afterthought most of the time. Granted, they are very elaborate and exquisite constructions but how can they be seen as anything but secondary when some of the most popular Transformers don't make an appearance until the last third of the film? And as beautiful as the talented folks at Industrial Light and Magic made these reincarnations, they are a bit too complex for their own good. Watching all the metal pieces swerve in and around while the machines transform made me think of the toys I had as a boy. If they were ever that complicated to transform, I doubt I would have played with them for as long as I did. The abundance of detail gets even messier when the Transformers start to rumble with each other. Through what he believes to be fancy camera work, Bay over uses close-up's and quick editing to turn his machines into metal monstrosities that are at times near impossible to distinguish from one another. You can't tell who's who until the metallic mess breaks apart and one machine stands while another has fallen. There's an awful lot of fighting but it's also a lot of not being able to tell who's winning.<br/><br/>It is pointed out to me time and time again that big budget action movies require a good chunk of our brains to be shut off in order to be enjoyed. Are we not tired yet of filmmakers giving us the bare minimum and the same old conventions while expecting us to fall over ourselves at the sight of awesome movie magic? TRANSFORMERS is not horrible because it is a special effects driven action film. It is horrible because it took the enormous potential to be a cheeky, geeky visual wonder and diminished that by dumbing it down to a mess of gunfire, product placement and hollowed-out, clunky machines. While it can be fun to relax our minds and enjoy the good times, it is not acceptable to dangle a shiny piece of metal before our eyes to distract us from seeing that that's all you got."

","I cannot understand how IMDb could give Transformers an 8.2 rating. Sorry, but this movie does not deserve that kind of credit. When I went to see the movie on July 4, I was not expecting to set eyes upon a freakish mess of bad acting, boring CGI, AND ridiculously laughable dialog. Transformers is a perfect example of what not to do while making a movie. I must say, Michael Bay has absolutely no artistic eye whatsoever, and it sickens me to think that a preschooler fan of Transformers could have just as well pieced this pile of crap together. Also, the voice acting of the Transformers was abysmal, and the dialog was cheesy. In some of the scenes, I just sat in my chair--staring at the screen in disbelief. This may have been one of the worst films I have ever viewed. Because the camera angles and filming is so jerky throughout the entire movie, not only was I confused, but I thought I would start experiencing photosensitive seizures! My advice: do not listen to any of the good reviews on this piece of sh*t. I you're gonna see it, wait till it comes out on DVD. Even then, you'll find it to be a waste of money and time."
"lgorenc","1","8","15","2 November 2007"," Japanese idiocy American way
","I recently read a comment here on IMDb that said this movie is in no way meant for kids and that everyone should see it no matter how old they are. For example, another guy said: When I saw the trailer of the film I thought that Transformers was going to be another silly action movie without a story but I was wrong. Oh, God! He was wrong! And I was dumb enough to fall for this. IT IS A SILLY ACTION MOVIE WITHOUT A STORY! Let's make one thing clear. I have nothing against cartoons turn blockbusters. But this is something completely different. Apart from good FX that bore you to death after so many repetitions, this flick is a mindless showcase of bad script, horrible acting and stumping plot which glorifies US Army and supposedly gang-ho government keen on keeping top secrets for the benefit of the nation. From scene one you wish the main character dies a horrifying death and you imagine him ending up in Hostel 3, but unfortunately this is not a torture-porn or a slasher where you can hope someone would perform medieval on his a*s. This aggravating actor who, by the way, carbon copied his role in Disturbia, then finds himself a peer in a pretentious, ""popular"", vain high-school girl who keeps delivering lines of a four year old and at one point agrees to sit in his lap because he said he has the only seatbelt and safety comes first. And yet, she tells him he's a smooth talker!? Are American girls really that stupid or is it what Hollywood want them to be? Shia is one bad actor who repeats himself and have seen too many sitcoms as a kid, and his acting is made even worse by lame directing. You even find yourself embarrassed by his acting. The two then make a hero couple who start getting on your nerves and every moment you wish these two wannabe actors at least get squashed by a giant robot's foot and get it over with. Except the ticket price, there is absolutely nothing here that will keep you in your seat throughout this video/audio torture, for the CGI FX are pointless if your intelligence is being constantly insulted by this no-brainer. The small Decepticons mumble like Gremlins or spiders in Eight legged freaks, which is totally inappropriate sound effect for a robot, as it is for a spider. I don't know which car company sponsored this disaster, maybe all of them did, along with eBay and US Army, but I found that TV commercial with the same robot-to-car transformation much more entertaining and fulfilling. I know Jon Voight sank low lately, but John Turturro was one of my favorite character actors. I just hope this extremely high rating is not a result of a mass voting by dumbed-down adults who suffered an incurable brain damage, but by neglected kids poisoned and brainwashed by anime. This should be banned for people over 10 outside Japan."

"kinkaideria","5","8","15","4 July 2007"," Greatest Effects Ever...but still might be worth skipping entirely...here's why
","The movie was visually stunning, and I was entranced, but I gave it a 5. Here's why; you can decide (minor spoilers): <br/><br/>1. The Iraq war vets/U.S. Army soldier massacre (set in Qatar with Iraqi vets on their way home) was over the top and inappropriate. A massacre of U.S. soldiers after they've emotionally talked about how much they can't wait to get home to their wives, and children, and mothers, followed by a similar massacre of innocent Qatari civilians, including women and children,with lots of bombs, gunfire, smoke, and (presumed) killing. (A close second on this tip is the skyscraper we see full of busy, working, socializing people getting destroyed.) <br/><br/>No blood doesn't mean U.S.service members on the ground, while mortars and gunfire go off around them, begging ""no, no"" before we see and hear his violent death, or office furniture and parts of the building slamming into the street below from the skyscraper we SAW all the people (real life actors) in, doesn't evoke memories that don't need to be evoked. Poor taste and just an excuse to be ""real"" while blowing more stuff up.<br/><br/>3. The sex, farting, and taking a leak jokes seemed like they were from another movie altogether. It was bizarre. I was thinking ""Steven Spielberg produced this?"" his stock has dropped with me. I used to be if he or George Lucas were attached to something, it might be a good or bad movie, but it would be appropriate for everyone in your family from the elementary school kids to the grandparents. To the Yahoo! Movies reviewer who said his kid learned about self-pleauring, including the actual word for it, from this film, I feel your pain. I, like another reviewer, don't slam this kind of film--it just didn't belong in the big family blockbuster of the Summer. When a government agent leers at a 16 year-old girl from a foot away and slithers ""Criminals are HOT,"" while looking her up and down. You just sort of wonder, what the heck?<br/><br/>3. The movie is really disturbing on minorities, of which there are few (and nearly all used for comic relief) and while not overtly racist, uses stereotypes in such a way that it hurts things more than the cheap laugh is worth. The only Hispanic character of substance is ridiculed and shouted at to speak English, and bores his Army team with stories about his mother and her cooking, ALL the black characters are either fat or disrespectfully profanity spewing, or both, and, with the exception of one, are either rude, dishonest, or full of attitude, to put it nicely. Even the one who rises to secondary hero status is a big, fat (literally) stereotype, who gets to pick up another one...virgin computer nerd...in addition to his D.C. ""urban"" identity. While the Indian (country, not native American) joke is a set-up we can all identify with, when taken with the others, things start to get uncomfortable. Did I mention there's only one person of color among all of the main and secondary heroic characters, all the others provide crude comic relief (mostly by being fat or profane). Other stuff is more subtle, (presumably) Jewish family is rich and conspicuously consume, black characters live with their grandmother, not their parents, in an apartment, Hispanic character chooses to speak Spanish over English even with people who don't speak Spanish, etc.<br/><br/>For this, I give it a ""5"" because it should have been a better movie. It should have been the big movie everyone goes to see with their kids and grandkids and instead it has all this other stuff to temper the awesomeness of the visuals and ultimately make the movie not great, but disappointing."

","I don't think I could hate this film if I tried. I'm not trying, but if I was, I don't think I could do it.<br/><br/>It has all the elements of the Transformers' glory days, with the juggernaut of Big Hollywood providing the driving engine. I really like its ability to be true to the original and yet be something new at the same time.<br/><br/>The nitpicks I have are significant, but a far cry from a dealbreaker. The big one is, about an hour in I leaned in and said to my friend, ""Alright, get to the damn point already!"" It drags too long before getting to the action. Bay should be slapped for some of the soundtrack choices, like when Bumblebee is scanning the newer model Camaro, the song popularized in Kill Bill plays for a second. It was tacky in the Vonage commercials; it's tacky here. The initial chase scene between Bumblebee and Barricade, as well as the hacker subplot, as well as numerous other prime opportunities to have some serious on screen fun, go almost nowhere. The Decepticons' personalities are mostly absent–originally there was much more dimension to them, making the dynamic between the Autobots and the Decepticons as a whole significantly more layered. The competitive relationship between Starscream and Megatron is completely glazed over. Prime's closing stinger line. Ugh. Also, it's plausible that the depiction of FBI raid on the hacker kid's house is at least somewhat racist–moreover, though, fewer ridiculous/absurd caricatures in general probably wouldn't have hurt the film (the sector 7 personnel are played to a ridiculous degree.)<br/><br/>But its good qualities far outweigh the nitpicks. Solid plot. Original voice actor playing Prime. Great 'bot design. All original G1 'bots–just with a fancier look (I don't fault them for that, personally). John Turturro. Prime's (and by extension, all Autobots') uncompromising honor and selflessness–something not quite so fashionable in fictional (anti)heros nowadays. The inclusion of beautiful women without flagrantly objectifying them (a bit, yes, but relatively tame by today's standards.) Excellent character development on Sam Witwicky's character–well played, multidimensional, not too subtle and not too overt in any department.<br/><br/>And then there is, the only good quality the Transformers ever need: awesome robot death match action. Of which there is no shortage.<br/><br/>Easily the most admirable thing about Bay's take on Transformers, however, is that it's garnering a new generation of fans. You can see that plainly if you see it in any suburban afternoon showing and listened to the 8-12 year old ""Ooh!s"" and ""Ahh!s"". It was, in short, really cool to see a new generation of youngsters coming into the same experience I held so dear as a child. I can't wait for 2 and 3, and I really hope they don't go downhill.<br/><br/>Bottom line, simply a great, fun movie and a worthy view. Definitely check this one out if you haven't already."
"ivo-cobra8","10","3","4","7 November 2015"," The first and the only best!
","Transformers (2007) is the only best one science fiction action film of the last three movies that I enjoy. Okay it is not the greatest or the best science fiction film but it is still a good one. It's the only, only movie I watch several times. Transformers 2 I watch three times in a row so far and that movie made me exhausted, Transformers 3 I watch it twice. Once on the computer and once on the DVD I rent it in the Library. I have the third movie on DVD till today I haven't watch that DVD and I think I give 13£ for it.I have enjoyed this movie much better than the last three. In Transformers I loved the car chases with Sam, how the story began, than the war and the chase for the glasses All Spark. I love it. I love actor Jon Voight. Now I know why he did not return in the sequels. The movie was really awesome and I can't say anything bad about it. It had a great plot great action and great excitement.<br/><br/>This movie is great out of the four, which I think Age of Extinction is the worst one so far, over too long. Shia does an amazing job, the soundtrack is awesome and the special effects/sounds are ""out of this world."" I REALLY Love Transformers! A big fan of the original cartoon I grew up with the cartoon's as a kid. Could it only disappoint? Especially after all those less than OK ""second generations"" of the Transformers tale, and seeing that everyone's favorite Bumblebee character was no longer a VW bug, but a Camaro? Well, it was fantastic! It was great to see some of the characters adapt and come to life in this version, and the movie provides great action, really good humor and plenty of realistic effects for anyone, not just fans of the old collectibles. But it can only be even more exciting for fans when they are finally re-introduced to Megatron, Optimus, Jazz and more. The film does a great job of creating the feeling of helplessness for humans, which would only make sense against technology like the Transformers. I couldn't help buy find my hands continuously gripping the arm rests tighter, and that was during my second watch! Minus a few cheesy scenarios or brief moments that seem to creep into many an action movie.<br/><br/>The Music score by Steve Jablonsky was awesome, I love all the music soundtracks in the film. Transformers is Michael Bay's first attempt of making of a Transformer movie and it succeeds. I saw this film and I was blown away, not only by the story, but how good the CGI of those robots were, these robots were looking like they were walking downtown In Los Angeles, they didn't look like CGI at all. They looked like realistic robots and that was great okay. For a movie that was under $2,000,000 that is right this film cost $150.000.000 and the robots looks that sweet, it was just great okay. The best thing about this film is not Michael bay heavy, you know what that means? It means there is no stupid and I mean stupid dialogues spoken trough the whole movie, the dialogues that was spoke trough whole this movie smart and somewhat funny in most parts funny mainly, it wasn't too over the top were feels like is not funny, that is stupid. Action in this movie is good, the movie is well paced at 2 Hrs. 24 Mins. is not the longest one that was the fourth one. Made was by Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks Pictures, they a lot and I mean a lot of Disney channel stars in in this film you got a Arwin (Brian Stepanek) from The Suite Life of Zack and Cody and that fat blonde boy that was talking about Armageddon. I think that was a joke that Michael Bay put on him self, this is hundred times better than Armageddon, and I was you mean Aramgeddon the film or the joke, because that was good poke, because Armageddon was awful, that was great I like that part. <br/><br/>The mythology that was made for director Michael Bay. This is the beginning of the trilogy that tells the story of the long, galactic feud between the Autobots and their nemesis, the Decepticons. As a child of the '80's, how could you not love Transformers? I love it. I love the science action mythology flick of the first film, which did great. <br/><br/>The interstellar battle between the Autobots and Decepticons rains destruction down on planet Earth as director Michael Bay adapts Hasbro and Takara's popular Transformers franchise into a big-budget, live-action summer tent-pole extravaganza in this ambitious sci-fi action feature starring Shia LaBeouf, Tyrese Gibson, Bernie Mac, John Turturro, Jon Voight, and, of course, Optimus Prime and Megatron. Enormous aliens have chosen the third rock from the sun as their ultimate battleground, and as the villainous Decepticons struggle to obtain the key to unlimited power, a young Earthling named Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf) may stand as mankind's last hope for survival.<br/><br/>I am giving it a 10/10 It is not the greatest movie or the best one but it is a good entertaining film. <br/><br/>Transformers is a 2007 American science fiction action film based on the Transformers toy line. The film, which combines computer animation with live-action, is directed by Michael Bay, with Steven Spielberg serving as executive producer. <br/><br/>10/10 Score: A Studio: DreamWorks Pictures, Paramount Pictures Starring: Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Rachel Taylor, Anthony Anderson, John Turturro, Jon Voight, Peter Cullen, Hugo Weaving Director: Michael Bay Producers: Don Murphy, Tom DeSanto, Lorenzo di Bonaventura, Ian Bryce, Steven Spielberg Screenplay: Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman Story by John Rogers, Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman Rated: PG-13 Running Time: 2 Hrs. 24 Mins.

Transformers (2007) is a wonderful example of this as we are thrown into the plot, and forced to walk in the shoes of the characters. It's the director's job to captivate his/her audience, and Michael Bay definitely achieves this task. <br/><br/>Michael Bay's directorial style in itself is what keeps his audience wide eyed and locked on the screen. Bay is an auteur, his style and personality reflected in all his films. Bay's style is very bold and his own, it's either you like it or you don't. Michael Bay's directorial style is fast edits and visually based (special effects). Having seen a few of Michael Bay's films, such as Armageddon (1998), Pearl Harbor (2001), Transformers (2007), The Unborn (2009), Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009), I Am Number Four (2011) and Transformers: Dark of The Moon (2011), I have come to know Bay on a deeper, more personal level. Many of his films' genres are action, thriller and sci-fi, resulting in his trademark of numerous fast cuts and visually captivating effects. Transformers (2007) reflects Michael Bay's style in regards to its various action scenes, specifically the intense battles between the Autobots and the Decepticons. With Bay you get the full works: explosions, collisions, weapons, and simply everything action. One action packed scene would be the final battle in the city with all the robots. <br/><br/>Elements such as the film's cinematography, editing, sound effects and the film's overall style reflects Bay's artistic style. Bay's camera angles and movements are very dynamic, for example his use of canted angles and high/low angles. A crucial aspect of Transformers cinematography would be the special effects, especially computer graphics in creating the robots and bullet time during action scenes. Two examples of bullet time effect would be when 1) Bonecrusher charged at Optimus on the highway scene and 2) In the city scene when Ironhide propelled himself upward to dodge two missiles. The editing in Transformers, as present in most of Bay's films, consists of fast cuts galore. Bay's editing style is ""BAM! Look here! BAM! Look over there! BAM! What's that?!"" There is no slowing down in pace and therefore no room for thinking, just pure entertainment. Most of Bay's sound effects comprise of non-diegetic mood music and sound effects. The mood music is usually suspenseful, intense and/or exciting, paralleling the incredible visual effect. Sound effects are especially used in the action scenes, (the explosions, collisions, etc) and also in regards to the transformation of the robots. <br/><br/>In regards to Bay's other films Transformers is similar in the fact that it's high energy and has stunning visuals. Though his films may not be visionary and plot oriented Bay gives the audience what they want, entertainment. A particular scene that portrays the strongest impression of Bay's personality would have to be the final battle scene in the city between the Autobots and Decepticons. This scene has everything an action scene should have and that's exactly why it reflects Bay. Bay is not a slow paced, quiet guy, but innovative and bursting of energy. A quote by the actor Ben Affleck, who starred in both Armageddon and Pearl Harbor states, ""I think Michael is actually an auteur in the true sense of the word. Every movie he makes reflects his personal creative vision. You may like it, you may not—but those movies are him without compromise. There's something to be said for sticking to your guns."" <br/><br/>Transformers does not suggest any type of growth in a new direction away from his other films. Bay's films are what they are and cannot be recreated. Either you hate or love Michael Bay's directorial style, and I love it. It's enjoyable, entertaining and visually captivating, everything a movie should be."

","I liked the movie a lot it was action packed,funny,exsilherating,and overall a great movie to a great cartoon.I definitely think people should see not as good as the third but better than the second i definitely like it a must see for fans and non-fans of transformers.Everyone should see it the second and the third they're very good a must see for everyone there are some differences between the cartoon and the movies but just like books or movie remakes it needed a little change if it was the same thing every time it wouldn't be very good would it?So this movie is great children under nine might not like it but anyone older should not all kids under nine just some."
"MedievalFantasy","10","3","4","11 October 2011"," Transformers -- A fun action film.
","Transformers is a great summer popcorn action film. It's great fun, with impressive CGI effects that almost make you believe Optimus Prime, Megatron, and the rest of the 'bots are actually there. The human actors do a great job interacting with non-existent robots. Shia LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky, a high schooler who is looking to get his first car. Little does he know that his car is a transformer from the planet Cybertron, a member of the Autobots, who are looking to stop the Decepticons from taking over Earth. After we are introduced to LaBeouf and Megan Fox's characters, the robot fighting ensues.<br/><br/>The action sequences are great to look at. All the little details really matter here, and seeing the gears of the Transformers as they go from robot to vehicle mode, it's pretty damn good. The acting feels real, albeit with some bad dialogue here and there. But the real stars of the film are the Transformers themselves. Optimus Prime is voiced by Peter Cullen, who voiced him in the original cartoon in the 1980s.<br/><br/>There are some touching moments in the film, especially between Sam and Bumblebee, his car and guardian. When Bumblebee is captured by Sector 7, it almost brings a tear to my eye seeing Sam's reaction and trying to help Bee out.<br/><br/>The music of the movie is beautiful to listen to. Steve Jablonsky does a great job composing the music. You feel the emotion of what is going on in the scene through the music, like the aforementioned scene with Bee and Sam, and especially during some of the fight scenes where the music picks up.<br/><br/>All in all, Transformers is a solid film to watch, especially during the summer, with that summer feel it has to it. Whether you're a fan of Transformers, or just looking for a fun flick to watch, then give this one a try."
"echodaxx12","9","3","4","10 October 2011"," A Sci-Fi Masterpiece, The Best of the Trilogy
","Let me start by saying this film is the best in the Transformers trilogy, like most films in a series. This film set the standard for the films that followed it(Unfourtunately, the 2nd failed to meet these standards). <br/><br/>This film has what every summer blockbuster has; CGI, action, explosions,and romance. But, compared to other films like it, it has a good story, which I noticed was greatly criticized for having to much humans and not enough Transformers, which brings me to my first point. 1)The reason for humans and their deep involvement in the film is to acknowledge the fact that Transformers are on PLANET EARTH, which is the normal habitat for human beings, and if the events in this film were to happen, there would be a deep human involvement. 2)These criticisms are what brought films that some consider to be terrible because this films focused on the Transformers more and the humans less.<br/><br/>The run time is also a widely criticized element in the film. Some think 143 minutes is to long for a film with (supposedly) no or little story. 3)If this film were the appropriate run time for the lack of story it has been accused of having, there would be little room for the action which contributes to this films greatness.<br/><br/>Now,of course this film has it's flaws, but for me, their hard to point out. The major flaw I noticed was the highly unnecessary sexual humor, but this is to be expected in a summer blockbuster film. The second most noticeable (to me anyway)flaw was the main antagonists Megatrons late arrival in the film.<br/><br/>Let me say I am very nostalgic about this film. It brought me and my friends lots of good times.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is great with a somewhat predictable, yet somewhat surprising ending with Sam killing Megatron. If you haven't seen this film, I recommend you do,but remember, with all Transformers films, you need to know what to expect in order to like it. In Transformers, expect explosions, heavy CGI, incredible action, and a decent if not great story."
"gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","7","3","4","9 July 2011"," One of the greatest action sci-fi films ever made
","This live-action adaptation of the TV shows and the toy franchise tells the story about the battle between the autobots and the decepticons as they search for the AllSpark, a device so powerful that can turn mechanics into robots. When it lands on earth, Optimus Prime and the other autobots meet a boy named Sam Witwicky and seeks his help along with his girlfriend Mikaela to find the AllSpark and put an end to the decepticons once and for all.<br/><br/>I saw the trailers for this movie, but I have missed my chances of seeing it in theaters. So, I waited to get it on DVD and viola! I now have the movie and I was excited when it met my expectations.<br/><br/>Michael Bay did really well on his directing and the storyline was well-paced together. The cinematography and casting were great, even Shia Lebeouf and Megan Fox's performances were so good and they make a great screen couple. The Witwicky parents weren't given enough screen time, but I think they did pretty well with their comedic moments. The actors that voiced the autobots and the decepticons turned out to be great and they are just like the ones from the TV shows.<br/><br/>The humor was so hilarious, and the best humor part was the pee joke which I really laughed during the movie.<br/><br/>The action scenes were very darn good. I think that Michael Bay was a fan of action scenes from the TV show and did very well at shooting them just to make it look real.<br/><br/>The CGI effects from the Industrial Light and Magic company was that good and it fits well for the action sequences.<br/><br/>The music score was riveting and very cool and it gave some emotion in the whole movie.<br/><br/>The only problem that I do have with this movie is that it's dialog, while smart and witty, is sometimes cheesy, but that doesn't matter because this is a great science fiction action movie from Michael Bay and is way better than Pearl Harbor and the Bad Boys films.<br/><br/>4.5/5 stars"
"garrettthebeast7","10","3","4","7 July 2011"," Quite possibly the greatest adaptation I've ever seen!
","I was anxious to see this because I saw that Michael Bay was going to direct it but dang! Michael Bay actually pulled it off! He took one of my most cherished childhood memories and turned it into a big screen masterpiece! This was one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen with some of the most breath-taking special effects you've never seen before! I stood up and applauded the film when the credits rolled, as did two other people in the theater, because it doesn't disappoint. The film is not entirely true to the original cartoon series but it's enough to keep you entertained with great action, comedy, and spectacular special effects."
"doucet_derrick","9","3","4","6 July 2011"," Great Movie, funny, action, fair plot
","I thought the movie was amazing. It was what I expected. I wish it would have exceeded but it matched and I can't ask for much more. Fox seemed like a good fit, labeouf is Sam Whitwicky and Tyrese and Duhamel are a good couple of military heroes. I liked it. Bernie Mac added a good funny cameo, the action was there, and the plot made sense. It was similar yet didn't copy the cartoon which was good to see. Emotions are there for the human and autobots and the decepticons were well done. Could have bee better but good nonetheless. If you haven't seen it yet, you should it is worthy of a look and even maybe buying the DVD or blue ray. I am sure your kids will love it, and it will be enjoyable for you as well."
"bennyhagen","9","3","4","19 June 2011"," Looks incredible and has it's moments
","I am not sure how deep exactly a director is involved in the technical production of a movie of this scope, but whether it's him, whether it's the people working with him, someone on Bay's sets knows how to assure production quality. I usually do not give too much credit for how a movie generally looks and is made, as stuff for this can be learned and bought. But in this special case production value is so incredibly high that it emerges from its original place and becomes a separate art form. One might take stuff like this for granted, but just freeze the movie for a moment and try to sum up how many people have been working for countless hour on that frame to make it look like it does now, meaning not just the action parts but even the most simple scenes. Fortunately, all this reaches it's climax when it comes to the robots as the CGI applied here is just staggering. I recommend the biggest screen available to you, as the level of detail is mind blowing and has to be presented in the highest resolution possible for you to be able to get just a part of what is happening all together. Also, this provides the movie with a pretty high re-watch value, the scenes featuring the Transformers can be rewinded several times to discover new things happening on the screen every time.<br/><br/>Now while the rest is pretty forgettable I must admit, it kind of works for most of the time. Shia LeBoef might not be academy material, but the way he seems to be on drugs for the majority of the movie is kind of entertaining. Ms.Fox doesn't need to do anything for me, I'd give her any award she likes. The Bay-specific humor deliberately smashed in to make this family friendly borders at slapstick at times but I admit actually having fun with it now and then. Also it's full of plot holes and banal script writing mistakes but then again it has Megan Fox's ass.<br/><br/>Now Undoubtedly this is a Michael Bay vehicle and all this by itself could still be unwatchable, but the thing is, there are some unexpectedly good scenes and moments. I wouldn't have dared to hope for anything as dark and thrilling as the first scene with the decepticon attacking the military base, which was a genuine cinema moment for me, something I thought would have been extinguished by know. And though the movie never goes there again, with a few other moments and the transformation effects and Megan Fox's legs I am willing to forgive a lot of crap here. Even some of the stupid things that are severely effecting the movies quality which could have been easily avoided.<br/><br/>So the movie is called Transformers and this is exactly what you get and technically produced in the most awesome way imaginable. The rest, while banal at times is actually entertaining, so you know... whatever... for what it is: 9/10"

"ebiros2","10","3","4","21 June 2008"," Outrageous - super movie
","As far as seamless CG and human interaction goes, this movie scores 11 on a scale of 1-10. Also, the CG action of the robots are unlike anything seen in ANY action movies. Just for these two reasons, this movie is worth watching, but the plot is also great, and the characters are well fleshed out giving this movie the reality other sci-fi movies lacks. It's said that Steven Spielberg is a fan of Transformers, and it shows. You can feel the passion that went into this movie. Also, I think it's the best movie director Michael Bay has ever made. His style translates well for the action of the Transformers. The movie is pretty long (2hrs24min), but it's packed with one great scene to another. Thinking Transformers as kid stuff is wrong here. The movie is PG 13 rated, and there's intelligent plot that makes this not just a good Transformer movie, but a good sci-fi movie as well. It's difficult to imagine another movie with this much well thought out action to appear again anytime soon."
"adam_uk09","9","3","4","5 May 2008"," The Best Film Of 2007
","Transformers is a rare thing. A film totally dominated by special effects that completely works and works well. Jurassic Park was one of them and Spiderman was another.<br/><br/>Michael Bay pours his heart and soul into this film and in the process makes the best film of his to date. Steven Spielberg is also present to inject some of that well known sentimentality that we all know and love from his films to make it a little more realistic.<br/><br/>The transformers themselves are fully believable in their performances and definitely steal the show. Their glistening metal bodies compliment the subtlety of the actors voices perfectly.<br/><br/>Shia Le Beouf is once again on top form in his role, which is perhaps slightly thin on the ground, but interesting none the less. His comedic edge to the character he plays will appeal to most. Megan Foxx is also excellent as his love interest.<br/><br/>Overall, Transformers is an excellent summer blockbuster, brilliant special effects and an engaging storyline. You couldn't ask for much more.<br/><br/>A must watch."
"halobluecat","9","3","4","30 April 2008"," Way better then I expected!
","Transformers is an old and lovable Franchise first as a toy then a TV series in the 80's and 90's. I have been a fan of Transformers since I was a small child and I own the 1987 movie(I love it). I always thought a Live Action Transformers film would be a cool idea but would never live up to the original cartoon...but I was wrong.<br/><br/>Transformers was an epic movie for all ages, Transformers fan or not, and has a great blend of humor and action. Oh, the special effects in this movie are the best I have ever seen, PERIOD! When the transformation from vehicle to robot starts you can see every little gear move and go into place..Flawless! <br/><br/>One of the best things they did for this movie was bringing Peter Cullen in for the original voice of Optimus Prime. I remember that voice perfectly from the show and its just so refreshing to hear again.<br/><br/>The only Reason I did not give this movie a 10-10 was because the character development and interactions of the Decepticons was lame but I guess they can do more of that in the sequel. <br/><br/>9-10"

"Friday_Saturday","10","3","4","30 March 2008"," the most incredible summer movie EVER
","I first saw the title listed under Shia LaBeouf's name on this site about a year ago. All I knew about the Transformers was that they had thoroughly awesome team symbols and they turned into vehicles and that I was very inept at switching back and forth between the vehicle and the robot in the toys (I broke them and I still do.). That was about it. I only knew those because my brother got one or two about every Christmas. So I saw this movie under Shia Labeouf's movie listings in ""Pre-Production"", and thought ""Oh man...I sense a bad one. It's probably gonna be animated."" Then I forgot all about it.<br/><br/>A few months later, sitting in a movie theater (I think it was POTC 3...I can't remember, the preview was better than the movie if I forgot about it already.). Anyhoo, I think it was the scene with Scorponok and seeing Optimus that really sold me with ""OK...this looks cool!"" It also looked like there would be plenty of car chases & explosions, and there didn't look like there would be much kissing (which I was INSANELY happy about...I HATE long kiss scenes & sappy stuff...I admit I'm a girl, but action has more in it for me.) <br/><br/>I took my 7-year-old cousin to see it with me, and I never sit up front or in the median between the front and back sections (far-sighted) but i made an exception cuz this movie was so damn awesome. It was the MOST INCREDIBLE MOVIE EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!!! Scorponok is THE EXTREME BADASS ROBOT!!!<br/><br/>My siblings watched the Kid's Choice Awards on Nickelodeon last night, and I believe that the children and/or teens of America are idiots. Transformers lost to Alvin & the Chipmunks...HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?!?! <br/><br/>I'd give this movie WAAAAAY more than a 10, more like a 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 because this was perfectly cast, incredibly acted, and the SFX were INCREDIBLE! Go see this movie!!! NOW!!!"

This film is another one of my recent favorites. it doesn't matter if you are a fan of the old cartoons that came on Saturday mornings, or if you are new to the series altogether! You will enjoy this movie! Michael Bay has put out some of the best action movies of all time in my opinion. He definitely does not disappoint with Transformers. The graphics in this film were breathtaking. The seamless transition from computer generated objects to real life was just amazing.<br/><br/>The only thing bad about this series is having to wait it out for the next one!"

","This is a fantastic action/comic book style movie. Cybertron is a planet far away were a civil war rages on between Autobots and Decepticons. Soon this war is brought to earth and the action only gets better as it goes on. I was a passer by of the Transformers cartoon but was an avid fan of Beast Wars. I went to watch this film and came out happy it was action packed and had a great cast who play their own parts perfectly. Shia is fantastic as the confused boy who finds out his car is a alien. Megan is just as good as Shia's affection.<br/><br/>Now the robots.<br/><br/>Larger then life and incredible to look at, the robots my favourite being is Ironhide and Bumblebee while the decepticons are simply scary. Megatron is brought to life immediately by the sheer size of him, Hugo Weaving is menacing as always by proving the grim voice needed. Fantastic film to watch for the Summer (thats already gone)"

When I first heard Optimus Prime introduce himself I was brought back to my childhood. I have 2 brothers and no sisters so some times I had no choice but to ""join them"" because I couldn't ""beat them"". As a little girl I learned to love the same things they did so maybe I am a little different in that, most women might not enjoy this movie but I definitely did! My favorite vehicle (and the one I drive!) the Ford Mustang was in this movie. Chevy lovers definitely will be pleased as well because the Camaro makes a come back and even a Ford lover has to appreciate it. I am now a proud owner of this DVD and would definitely recommend this movie."
"luke-346","6","3","4","6 December 2007"," Spielberg's on board, be it ever so minimal! But it shows!!!
","Transformers is a film by Michael Bay, the same man behind such action spectacles as Armageddon, Pearl Harbour and The Rock, which is normally the kind of film I steer clear of. However, I decided to view this upon learning that this time out Bay had traded his producer of those three films, Jerry Bruckheimer, for the more acclaimed Steven Spielberg (arguably the auteur of the Hollywood Blockbuster) and it's probably a good thing that he did, because Transformers delivers.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I'm not that familiar with the original cartoon series, so I cannot comment on the films accuracy, but then if the film is meant to be an adaptation - how many adaptations are entirely accurate? I have read some critical reviews of this film and the majority seem to be disgusted at the representation of the Transformers - mainly due to their alteration from the original cartoon. I feel that the film doesn't aim to be a direct replication of a cartoon series, but that it aims to be a blockbuster in homage of a cartoon series and I believe this to be something it does very well. When Hollywood makes these films I am almost sure they have a checklist or a personal routine that the maker (usually the Producer) abides by. Constructing a blockbuster is an intricate process and when Spielberg is involved it is often perfected, Transformers contains many of the elements that are familiar with Spielberg's blockbusters and fantasy's including good old fashioned fighting, aliens, a geek, a computer nerd, a hot chick, a funny fat guy, fast cars, gadgets, an old explorer, secret military layers, secret government divisions, the President, Air Force One, explosions, goodies, baddies, a crack code, a hidden map, polished CGI and many more.<br/><br/>In an academic and purely filmic sense, the film is floored on nearly all levels, the acting is poor, the script is bad and there needs to be a lot more work done in post-production, but to attack a film like this would be like a Michelin Star rep attacking McDonald's cuisine  it would be mean and unfair. Films like this serve a purpose, and it is the achievement of that purpose that is carried out very well in Transformers."

"acumensch","1","12","25","25 August 2007"," American War Ideology
","If we define 'totalitarian regimes' as those which exercise propagandistic control over the values and interests of the ruled, then by this definition most Americans are living under a totalitarian regime. The 2007 film Transformers does not fall short of a militaristic call-to-arms. The conjuring up of post-911 imagery and the clearly modernist plot-purity of good vs. evil aligns this film with the goals of American military generals and Republican politicians. I watched the film in the Netherlands, and it seemed everyone in the audience noticed the film was radiating American military fantasies from the screen into the cineplex. The exhilaration of obscenity, the obscenity of obviousness, the obviousness of power, the power of simulation. It even included a clear recruitment message (which seemed ironic while watching it in a foreign country)--near the end the glorified American soldier, Josh Duhamel, turns to the main character, a sloppy teenager played by Shia LaBeouf, and says, ""You're a soldier now...."" A sappy orchestral chord fills the theater, as we apparently are to feel included in the act of 'becoming a US soldier' and compelled to join the Army Rangers to help the Autobots destroy the Decepticons in a galactic showdown with American accomplishment at the centerpiece.<br/><br/>America is the only country which gives you the opportunity to be so brutally naive about films like this. In fact, some of us know films like these are simply part of the militaristic education in America: of learning obedience to our patriarchal authorities, of developing a taste for military 'action', and the constant reassertion and justification of the American military mission on the geopolitical scene. But back in the States, no other American seems to notice the film's pungent ideological consequences. The users on IMDb who dislike the film can only point to plot flaws or technical mistakes, or a general distaste for CGI graphics. Others point out that it simply wasn't violent enough. When our culture is as inundated as it is, there really is no desire to adopt a critical stance on films that represent our own ideology. And in fact most don't notice. It may be that the truth of America can only be seen from outside the fishbowl, since only there will you discover the perfect immanence and simulation of these values. Americans, for our part, have no sense of simulation. We are simulation in its most immanent state, and have no language to describe it, since we are an isolated model that communicates mostly with itself.<br/><br/>As a result, just as Optimus Prime observed that humans were violent creatures, Americans are also the ideal material for an analysis of culturally-encouraged violence against other cultures. No more and no less than primitive societies were analyzed in their day. The same mythical and analytical excitement that made us look toward those societies today impels outsiders to look in the direction of America. With the same interest and the same prejudices."

","The truth is this film has little to do with the Transformers characters. It's a story about a BOY who befriends the girl of his dreams, and his car happens to be robot!

It's like having a DaVinci exhibition, and only showing a Boeing 747.<br/><br/>Progress is fine, Bumblebee could've been the new VW Beetle, no??? If Megatron can't transform into a hand gun -explain the cube?<br/><br/>Spielberg, What happened? You used to make GOOD films. Don't tell me you needed the money? Crap movie, but a good exercise in marketing.<br/><br/>This is a brainless movie, sad to say."

","Now while I do admire the 80's film for it's grand score and acting, but that does not make me look past it's countless animation errors, plot holes, continuity errors, and just plain WTF moments. The CGI animation on the transformers was astounding and the action scenes kept me on the edge of my seat. I felt the Sam and Mikela characters were unnecessary, but I loved the army guys as well as Maggie and Glen, as well as Keller. The Transformers themselves were voiced by actors such as Peter Cullen, Hugo Weaving, Jess Harnell, Robert Foxworth, Reno Wilson, Charlie Alder, Darius McCrary, Jimmie Wood, and Mark Ryan.<br/><br/>I do have to say it is a nice film, and has a nice plot and is nicely directed.<br/><br/>84/100"

","I am a casual Transformers fan. Not really into the toys but i love the various animated series from the original, to Beast Machines and even the more recent ones like Transformers Cybertron and Transformers Animated. I also collect the Transformers comics that started in 2005.<br/><br/>Skipping all the story synopsis and jumping straight into the review proper.<br/><br/>First off, this movie seemed to be a total re-imaging of the Transformers tale; From a rebooting of the transformers' origin to setting the main story in contemporary earth 2007.<br/><br/>The story and characterization is just as simplistic as in the original cartoon. The problem is, the producers decided to go with such a ""real world"" approach that this true-to-the-cartoon style of straight forward narrative and little character development does not mesh well.<br/><br/>I can live with the exceptional amount of screen time the human characters take up. Afterall, we are seeing the Transformers through their eyes, hence it is the human characters who would carry most of the story. I like this style of moving the narrative forward and of portraying the robots as fearsome, mysterious and out-of-this-world. Everything from their lines to their mannerisms help to emphasise their very ""alien"" nature. By not giving a full, clear body shot of any of the robots, it just adds to the sense of awe and mystery surrounding those aliens and allows for a good build up in the plot.<br/><br/>For the first time, we get to see the full ramifications of an alien robot war on earth. I love the script in portraying the various reactions to such a threat. From the higher end authorities, to the military down to the man on the street, all their reactions to a possible alien robot war are very realistically scripted from start to finish. There is some decent characterizations of Optimus Prime and Bumblebee. The yellow autobot, especially, develops his relationship with the main character Sam really well, reminiscent of some of the more heart warming Steven Spielberg films, to the point that broke my heart when Bumblebee got captured while trying to save Sam and tortured later.<br/><br/>However, halfway into the movie, all that build up and characterization comes crashing down and we are back in shallow territory.<br/><br/>Aside from Optimus and Bumblebee, none of the other characters, human or robot, get any character development at all. Everyone from Megatron to Jazz are one dimensional and bland. The humans characters shine in a few scenes with some witty humour thrown about and some excellent acting by Shia LaBeouf and John Turturro. It is the fun script and great lines that redeems the lack of character development in the main characters. But sometimes the funny stuff get a little out of hand and ends up becoming a huge distraction especially when we're in the middle of an intense, serious scene. <br/><br/>I was fine with the frantic camera movements and closeups in the fight scenes. It adds to the frenzied and raw feel of the battles and actually allows one to easily imagine being IN the movie and experiencing the all out action first hand. However, one or two scenes like that is fine. What is not fine is when every battle scene utilizes this filming style. Not only is it headache inducing but it shows a lack of creative variety on the part of the director.<br/><br/>Aiside from the simplistic, almost juvenile story, the lack of character development and some wonky camera work, my main complain with this movie is that, compared to the TV series, the animated movie and the comics, this live action movie is just mediocre. The lack of depth here was excruciating. <br/><br/>The CGI graphics were top of the line, but action and special effects alone do not make a good movie. It is sad that the two core principle foundations of movies aka the story and the characters, come close to being buried under all the explosions and visual eye candy.<br/><br/>This is not a good movie, but I'll admit that it is an entertaining movie when one wants to allow the brain some downtime for the next 2 hours. The few good points of this movie barely hold everything together but it is a passable effort. <br/><br/>7.5 out of 10. Round it up to 8"
"petersaarloos","8","4","6","11 June 2008"," It had it all.
","Great movie.<br/><br/>Although the plot and concept were actually quite a no-brainer, it pulled it off really well. The romance didn't feel too tacky, the emotional moments really felt emotional (which was a disappointment in, for example ""Iron Man""), the robots were of course awesome and the script was solid and funny. Top notch.<br/><br/>The high score mainly comes from the fact that it felt philosophical as well. It wasn't really that strongly intelligent, but it does put you to think. The end monologue by OP also felt really moving.<br/><br/>Altogether a great movie and I can't put my finger on why this movie has a 7.5 and a movie like iron man has an 8.3. When the quality of both movies is objectively viewed, I'd definitely switch the scores.<br/><br/>Anyway, definitely recommended. I hope they don't make a sequel. I usually feel they should go on with the concept, but this is just one story and it should remain that way. Keeps us guessing. They kinda ruined Pirates that way, if you ask me."

","This movie is about the cartoon ""Transformers"" that is a very popular TV series in the United States of America. I wasn't really interested in the cartoon but watching the movie makes you want to see the cartoon because this movie is AWESOME. The Autobots are going after something they need so that the Decepticons won't get it and destroy the world because it gives them much more power. The only problem is that Megatron was found frozen many years back in the North of the world so they are sort of experimenting on him. They all get in a big war in the middle of the movie that makes the movie even more exciting and the plot is very good."
"adrongardner","8","4","6","29 July 2007"," Just like Old Times
","I saw this in Orange on a digital screen on one of the early screenings and kept going back.<br/><br/>OK I'm 27 and long ago boxed up my transformers from childhood. But I had to see this movie. If you're like me, you remember Optimus Prime, the hero of heroes. Since Star Wars has come and gone, there are few articles of childhood left to see again on the big screen. Transformers is one of those toy marketing schemes that actually made interesting characters, and of course, sold a lot of toys.<br/><br/>I am highly skeptical of Michael Bay. Not only does he make crappy movies, but he has to destroy a nice car in the middle of it all. But here, I give the guy a pass.<br/><br/>I like to see my home state on the silver screen too. They filmed the ""Qatar"" scenes in Alamogordo, New Mexico. So about this movie...<br/><br/>I was entranced from beginning to end. The dialog was sometimes a little to rapid fire and nervous, poor megan fox had almost nothing to do, some characters were out of place and plotting weird, but in the end, the film is a winner.<br/><br/>The effects really do sell the film in every scene. Bumble Bee, Optimus, all of them are extremely well ""acted"" by the talented computer animators. There needs to be some kind of acting award besides special effects for this thing.<br/><br/>Yeah, megatron comes up out of nowhere. Lots of the plot make little sense, but hey I sat down and watched some old episodes on Youtube and found that i couldn't even follow what the hell was going on in the cartoon. I would say in the movie, they made an improvement with plotting.<br/><br/>The Decepticons are effectively menacing, especially when Barricade confronts Sam on the hood of a car. That one was actually pretty startling. I've had nightmares as a kid being chased by giant killer robots and yeah, this one got a little close. Enough of my freudian fears.<br/><br/>This movie delivered, it was superbly entertaining and very very well done. I don't quite acquit Michael bay for Pearl Harbor or destroying the Ferrari 355 in The ROCK, but here, he gets a pass. Can't wait for the multi disc DVD. Bring on the sequels."
"smoothiedudie","8","4","6","28 July 2007"," Michael Bay's best movie yet, and easily the most enjoyable movie of the summer.
","Michael Bay seems to have a certain philosophy when directing films, when in doubt, blow it up. This has gained him a mixed reputation as a director, some applause him for his ability to blockbusters, while other's think he is a shallow, untalented director.<br/><br/>So when it was announced that he would direct the big screen adaptation of a cartoon series which has a huge cult following, as you can imagine, the reaction was mixed. It is therefore could to see that he has defied expectations and made an extremely enjoyable film.<br/><br/>Lets get one thing straight first, this film is about robots fighting robots. It does not have any serious issues in the plot, any social commentary in the concept or any intense conversations. It is about robots fighting robots. Therefore, those with any sense should expect this to be fully loaded, brain-pumping and mind blowing as cinema should get. Bay gives us all this, and proves that he is one of people to go to in making kick-ass action movies. The set pieces are incredible, the CGI believable, and explosions breathtaking. Sometimes it seems a little too much, but when you 30ft robots firing missiles and toppling cars, you be foolish not to expect that.<br/><br/>Another great thing that helps the film is the comedy. Bay who is no stranger to the genre with films like Armageddon and Bad Boys I+II gives us some hilarious gags, which work great with the rest of the film. The scene in which the transformers search for the glasses at Sam (Shia LaBouef)'s house is a great example of slapstick, and keeps the film on the light tone which makes it so enjoyable. Shia LaBouef is terrific on-screen, and gives the film it's best performance. A natural comedian, he has a great blend of Woody Allen wit and Tom Hanks In-willing hero which makes him a very entertaining lead. Watch out for his scenes with John Torturro, as the two have great gravity on-screen."

","This movie is actually the best one in the genre (if you see '80s cartoons as a movie genre). It has a lot of funny moment, while the plot is being built up. It has very few of the original transformers (there are like 5 Autobots and 5 Decepticons) but they all have a personality and they really act accordingly (although Prime is a bit less static than wee remember him). The movie is a rock solid 8 out of 10. So why did I give it 9 out of 10? In the original movie (cartoon movie) there is a fight between Megatron and Optimus Prime, Prime says it's the final show down ""one shall walk, one shall fall"". I really loved that and this new movie honors that. Like the little bumblebee in the windscreen of Bumblebee, the ""more than meets the eye"" theme is worked into the movie and the only thing they neglected is to put (a new version of) the old theme in with the end titles. Maybe in the next one ;)"

","After the ultimate failure with the dub of the so called ""Unicron Trilogy"" (Armada, Energon & Cybertron) it looked like that Transformers was going downhill completely. But...Our darkest hour had come to light ^_^ I heard at around late 2003 that there were plans to make a live action movie of the Transformers, at first it was considered a rumour around some time in 2004 but thankfully...It happened.<br/><br/>After waiting for several few years of waiting for a Movie of TF's to be made, watching trailers and TV spots and waiting and waiting for the movie to hit the big screen. Finally in 2007, the movie came! I was just speechless at what I saw...it was a freakin masterpiece and brought back the true spirit of the Transformers into this epic movie! Also, with much pleading from the fans, Peter Cullen (The voice of Generation one Optimus Prime) came back to play the role of Optimus prime which saved this movie from completely going down the toilet.<br/><br/>Still, there were some problems that die-hard TF fans had problems coping with. The designs were kinda more alien and some people hated them, mainly Megatron's design...Never the less, the film pretty much got people loving and hating it.<br/><br/>Myself I loved it! Wonderful acting from both Machine and human (Even though the humans pretty much dominated the roles of the TFs in this movie) Dare I say it, Thank you Micheal Bay for making all this possible, Perhaps you don't suck being a director after all.<br/><br/>Bottom line...Great, Fantastic, Wonderful Movie! a real treat for Transformers fans and even on those who are getting started on Transformers!

","I watched this cartoon faithfully as a kid when it first aired in the 80's. In doing so I created my own world for these robots in disguise in my head that the cartoon could not compete with. I saw Tron for a dollar at a run down single screen theater around the same time. I wanted my Transformers on the big screen like Tron. My point is I loved the concept of Transformers but didn't like the way it was handled in either the series or the eventual animated movie that followed. It frustrated me to no end that this concept wasn't being handled right and at the time I was only 8. I do not cling to the idea of this fan boy nostalgia that so many die hard Transformers have I do however respect it. The idea of a big screen live action film has become somewhat of an urban legend and up until about three years ago I was convinced it was going to remain just that a myth. Heading into the theater opening day to see Bays Transformers I was ready for the worst but would have been more than satisfied to see big robots fighting if all else failed and I knew it would thus with my expectations lowered I braced for the worst. Within a 1/2 hour of watching Transformers I felt something stirring and moving inside of me like I have never felt. I loved every part of this movie form top to bottom. Every missed punchline. Every amazing cg detail. Every person who graced the screen. Every word spoken. Every error. Every flaw. This is exactly how I envisioned it in my little head 20 years ago. Better even. Transformers rocked me to my very foundation. This feels cliché to me considering how critical I am when it comes to my viewing experiences. So its not easy to say at all. I am proud however to be so head over heels over something so superficial. I do not care. Transformers 07 is the greatest cinematic achievement I have ever witnessed. I saw this movie back to back twice in less than 24 hours. I will see it as many more times as my feeble little head can handle while its still in the theaters. Perfect."

They did a wonderful job of keeping it true to the cartoon incarnation while still giving it the modern feel and making it enjoyable for more than just the generation of us who used to watch it when we were young. I was blown away that it seemed to be over so fast. It did not feel like 2½ hours. I almost hope they don't do a sequel because they will have a very difficult time making it better than this one was. There are very few movies that I have seen that were able to give me goosebumps as many times as this one did, not out of fear but out of awe.

","Transformers is a walk down nostalgia lane for some of the 20-30 Generation who grew up when these toys exploded onto the market. Now, decades later, the series has come back again in real time.<br/><br/>And it has been worth the wait.<br/><br/>The plot basically revolves around a boy and a girl who buys a Camaro unbeknowst that it has in fact got the ability to turn into a robot. The robot, Bumblebee, protects them as the boy holds the key to finding the Allspark, a powerful energy source that the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, want. Unfortunately, there are others who want it too, namely the evil Decipticons, led by Megatron, who begin to pursue, wiping out lots of Earth's communication in order to prepare for a full-scale assault.<br/><br/>The plot is not original by any means of the imagination, and parallels can be seen with a lot of other Michael Bay films, particularly in the build up. However the transformers are simply awesome. The effects are truly incredible and you really get caught up as you see the Autobots 'roll out', or the Decepticons lay waste to, well basically everything. The script also manages to fill in a good sense of humour which is sometimes a little hit-and-miss but all the same it's there.<br/><br/>This is a truly cool movie, with some great lines and some awesome special effects that are perhaps the most stunning since Jurassic Park wowed us a decade ago. With two sequels to go, I just hope they can keep it up."

"jedi-jones","8","4","6","6 July 2007"," Humanity not Lost in Transformers
","As a non-Transformer fan...a non-viewer of the cartoons, a non-reader of the comics, and a non-collector of the toys...I wasn't planning to see the movie until recently. The stylish trailer shots of giant robots in battle got me interested. I also had an inkling that Michael Bay would give this one his all, because after The Island he would know his career couldn't afford another flop. And after seeing Pirates 3 and Spidey 3 not live up to expectations, I figured the law of averages was in favor of Transformers being the best sci-fi action epic of the year.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed. In fact I was pleasantly surprised at how successful the movie was with its human characters and how much humor it found at all levels of its story. It is so, so difficult for a sci-fi film like this to pull off real genuine, gut-busting humor without descending into camp or disrespect. Part of that is because the filmmakers have to be really brave to try for laughs when they're already afraid the audience will laugh at unconvincing effects or unbelievable story lines. This movie goes on a short list with Superman, Ghostbusters, and Men in Black as one of the funniest sci-fi action films ever made. Shia LaBeouf in both comedic and dramatic scenes was a wonderful asset here. My faith in Spielberg having made the right choice casting him in Indy 4 was given real credence here.<br/><br/>If the movie had one major weakness it was that the villains don't get the development the humans and heroes do. Aside from Scorponok's awesome desert battle and perhaps a bit too much of the little Gremlin-bot's antics we don't get to see the villains display much personality. I think Megatron had less screen time than the Gremlin-bot. That weakens the drama of the final battle because it seems like the Autobots are just fighting mindless machines, ones that we don't quite understand the full capabilities and motivations of. I think we needed more scenes of the Decepticons planning and plotting together to parallel the scenes of the Autobots meeting and introducing each other. And we needed at least one scene where Megatron demonstrates a seriously bad-ass show of force BEFORE he starts fighting the good guys, a la Magneto's bridge attack in X3 or just about everything General Zod does in Superman 2 before the Metropolis battle. Speaking of missed opportunities, I'm not sure why you take us to a major national landmark in a movie like this unless you intend to blow it up.<br/><br/>Other than the whole enterprise sort of unraveling in a final battle that is more dramatically and visually choppy than anything that came before it, this movie was full of pure entertainment. I loved the Herbie-esquire chemistry between Bumblebee and the kids. I had fun with the Christine-esquire suspense when the cars began showing their threatening side and all of the zippy car chases that followed. I enjoyed Optimus Prime's heroic Jor-el-esquire speeches about the good in humanity. I thought Voight as the Rumsfeld character and Turturro as the shadow government guy added solid acting presence and weight to the movie. I liked the human comedy of Shia's romantic and family problems, the geeky in-joke computer references, and the giant robot-slapstick comedy, which I still think was perhaps the movie's most impressive and unlikely achievement. And I thought the transformation effects had all the necessary cool factor. One bad moment, I didn't like the explanation for the origin of earth's technology. That was unnecessary plot overkill and too Terminator-esquire. And Bernie Mac's cameo only served to illustrate how much better the movie's subtler and more unexpected attempts at comedy were.<br/><br/>I think this movie will deservedly earn its place as the #1 box-office smash of the year, besting Spider-Man 3's $335 million gross. It may also have earned a special place in cinema history for crediting both a ""Product Placement Coordinator"" and a ""Military Adviser,"" in that order. Now I look forward to a sequel where I hope the robots, especially the villains, earn more screen time, dialogue, and character development. I think we're ready for that now that we humans have made a successful transition into the robot world by virtue of this introductory movie.

","It is no doubt the best movie of year 2007. Maybe it is a bit subjective to draw a conclusion like this, but as a TF mania I was really shocked when I saw my dream of childhood was realized on the screen. Though I own some delicate TF toys but it was really a different feeling to see them speaking moving and fighting like human being. The Optimus Prime in this movie was so cute that I am now considering that the figure of OP in 80's cartoon was a little countrified. Thank you Michael Bay and thank you Stephen Spielberg, you did not let me down after anxiety waiting of more than one year. Now the only thing for me to do is just waiting for the coming of it's DVD set."
"knutsindre","8","4","6","6 July 2007"," Despite it's flaws, a stellar movie
","I must confess I did not feel much smarter leaving the cinema yesterday evening, but despite this, the rush the movie gave by pure action and spectacle was more than enough to keep me not just interested, but excited about the movie for it's 144 minutes, craving more at the end.<br/><br/>Script wise, the movies may not be worthy of a Nobel price, but succeeds greatly in transforming the original material from the series into a working movie. Clichés are however to many for a European audience to handle very well. The movie also spots loads of great humor, something which magically blends with what is probably the main feature of the movies: it's spectacular to watch.<br/><br/>In terms of special effects, Transformers is beyond state-of-the-art. It literally shines, and the action sequences are incredibly well pulled off. The Autobots also look amazing, despite some weird changes in their size from time to time. Also, the sounds works very well, and nowhere better than in the voice of Optimus Prime, which for some reason gives the robot a character unlike any computer-created actor I've ever seen seen.<br/><br/>The movie is quite simply a great experience. It mixes humor with amazing visuals, giving you a rush that screams for a sequel.<br/><br/>If they manage to make the inevitable sequel carry the same level of action, but spiced with more depth in the story, this could be the beginning of something truly great."

","Whenever I hear about a movie getting so much hype and attention, I have a feeling it is going to be bad. I figure the vast majority of the country is made up of idiots, so I will probably be wasting my time seeing a movie that has been so highly promoted as ""the best action movie ever and so awesome"". With that said, since we are Netflix members I decided to go ahead and add it to my list. It just came in and we made the mistake of actually watching it. My husband got up halfway through the movie and did not return. I decided to stick it out, hoping it might get better. But congratulations American citizens, you did not let me down! I can continue feeling as I do about you. <br/><br/>The only thing I am going to ask about this over-the-top unbelievable plot line is: If Shia's grandfather went to the Arctic Circle and died, how in the world could he have passed on his ""secret map glasses""? Does anyone else have a problem with that?!"
"tieman64","Null","10","20","10 September 2007"," The Citizen Kane of camera shake
","Michael Bay directs ""Transformers"", a film which takes the reactive camera work of Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" and lathers it in feces. Spielberg's thinking at the time was that CGI special effects are no longer special. You now have to mask your CGI so as to give your film a sense of realism or even menace. This is nothing new, most ""good special effects"" subvert their own ""specialness"", playing themselves down.<br/><br/>But ""Transformers"" milks this trend to death. Bay's camera is constantly ducking, diving, hiding from CGI, catching fleeting glimpses of action and never seeing anything coherently. People complain that none of his robots are clearly framed. That none have distinct or memorable features. That they're all poorly and unimaginatively conceived. But what's the point when Bay's camera doesn't intended to watch them in the first place? Combine this scatter-shot camera-work with Bays scatter-shot storytelling and you have one pretty stupid movie.<br/><br/>Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" was released in 2005, and now here in 2007 we have an onslaught of similarly shot Spielbergian crap. The 2 year gap between ""War of the Worlds (a Spielberg directed alien invasion movie; brilliantly shot, if you ignore all the xenophobic, ""terrorists living under our cities"" 9/11 baiting) and stuff like ""Transformers"" (a Spielberg produced alien invasion movie that uses your eyeballs as a toilet) is what I call the Hollywood/Spielberg gap.<br/><br/>Currently this gap is 2 years. The previous record was the three year period between ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". I doubt the gap can get any smaller, as it takes roughly a year to get a big budget film out of pre-production.<br/><br/>In the market place, rival companies likewise have a similar gap between products, commodities reverse engineered, trends capitalised upon, rebuilt and renamed. Spielberg makes big money so people copy. And of course Bay's essentially Spielberg on speed, pushing the former's set-piece cinema to post-narrative hell. Bay's the ugly bridge between post-cinema and the blip-time of cyberspace, offering up the schizoid incoherence of mass-multiplayer mayhem to a giddy public too high and self excited to string together a thought. A Spielberg for alpha males, Bay's hated largely because his demographic doesn't pound defensive buttons on keyboards or get their geek out on digital forums. While Spielberg appeals to the quiet, introspective, curious, cautious, fantasy loving mommas boy, Bay appeals to the testosterone fuelled jock and his woman who just wants a quick testosterone fix and just want to see crap blow up good. Unsurprisingly, Bay's films make BILLIONS of dollars and are seen by millions of people REPEATEDLY. Interestingly, Bay's most feminine film (THE ISLAND) raked in no money. <br/><br/>4/10 - Boring despite its rapid-fire aesthetic. The best thing you can say about guys like Bay and Emmerich are that their films don't ever pretend to be anything other than wreckage, which makes them far less harmful than the world's Spielbergs and Camerons. See the original, animated ""Transformers The Movie"" instead, which, believe it or not, starred Orson Welles and Leonard Nimoy."
"Vic_max","Null","10","20","13 July 2007"," A movie about teens ... and for teens ...
","I'm a big sci-fi movie fan, so this was a must-see movie. However, the cartoon-like effects and ""everybody is a teenager"" cast was a little too much for me. This was an excellent idea for a movie, but ended up being more like a 2.5 hour Saturday morning cartoon.<br/><br/>The movie has a fantastic storyline. It's basically about alien robots that are at war with each other and are simultaneously searching for a lost artifact of their civilization. How cool is that? Unfortunately, it wasn't executed very well. <br/><br/>Aside from minor plot-hole issues and endless brand-name product placement (more than I've ever seen in any movie), there were two main problems.<br/><br/>First, all the critical roles are teenagers. Literally. I'm not just talking about the actors, but rather the literal ages of the characters in the movie. The top code-crackers at the Dept. of Defense are teenagers ... the critical characters calling the shots for all of mankind are teenagers ... the Transformers all prefer to communicate with teenagers. You get the picture. Sorry - it's just a little too crazy.<br/><br/>Secondly, the effects were not very good. Much of the time, the Transformer scenes looked like cartoons. I would have gladly settled for fewer, but more realistic, special effects. I was willing to let it go in the beginning, but then the cartoon effects became so common-place that it became really annoying.<br/><br/>If you're in the teenage demographic and a very forgiving sci-fi fan, you may really like this movie. For everyone else, this may end up being a let-down. Keep your expectations minimal."

","The guys in the audience at my screening were practically ejaculating in their seats. This was VERY exciting for them. <br/><br/>For me (middle-aged woman), eh. Not so much.<br/><br/>(Look at all those 10 star reviews on here. They're all written by these guys.)<br/><br/>See there's this 17 year old boy who has a crush on a girl in his class. Who appears to be 30 and a supermodel. When she finds out he's got a car that's an alien robot, she's all over him. (Yes, it's all about boy fantasies.) <br/><br/>Keep your little kids (or anyone nightmare-prone) FAR away from this film! A LOT of nightmarish images. Nice people and little kids have very scary pointy metallic objects reaching for them. Or batting them around. (I'm pretty sure a lot of people were killed -- but they glossed over that quickly.) <br/><br/>Even tho I'd never seen a Transformer cartoon or toy or whatever the frick these things are, I was able to grasp the plot easily. But the movie just wore me down.<br/><br/>These huge piles of garbage (or whatever the frick they are) were hard to wrap my eyes around. When they stood up and moved they were impressive (frightening even). But when they spoke, they just seemed dorky.<br/><br/>The movie whip-sawed between goofy comedy and terrifying action movie. Seems to be a mish-mash of styles. It didn't have an even tone. (And yes, I understand about comic relief.) The movie just seemed cobbled together from a lot of different parts -- like the creatures.<br/><br/>Around 3/4 of the way thru, I got tired of big things whamming each other and shut my eyes for a few moments. Open my eyes: Still going on. And on and on.<br/><br/>I couldn't wait for it to be over. At the end of the movie I was headachy and slightly nauseous.<br/><br/>But the guys were jumping in the air. Outside they were peeling out in their over-sized trucks way too fast. (""Look at me! I'm a Transformer!"")<br/><br/>Ah. Boys and their toys.<br/><br/>If you're a male in real or prolonged adolescence this will probably be the high point of your life.<br/><br/>But if you're anyone else, I suggest you find something else in the cineplex to see and let the boys have this one all to themselves."

","Please, do not go see this movie.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the Transformers television show, or the original movie, you will be overwhelmingly disappointed.<br/><br/>The title of this movie should have been ""Sam Witwicky"" (the main character) because that was what the movie was about. It was not about the Transformers at all.<br/><br/>THE BAD: <br/><br/>-The first problem is that this movie was about humans, not transformers. In fact you don't really meet any transformers until 45 minutes into the movie, and when you do, they don't talk. The movie is about an awkward teenager, not Transformers. There are only a handful of transformers in the movie. (4 autobots, and about 5 decepticons)<br/><br/>-You don't get to know the transformers at all (autobots, or decepticons) They are introduced, by name only, and they give you a 10 second explanation of their individual jobs. They don't really have any lines, you don't get to know their personalities, and you don't see much of them in general. (I understand that there was a tremendous amount of cost and effort put into creating the actual transformers, and live action people are easier to shoot.....but come on. The movie is supposed to be about the Transformers.) -obnoxious product placement (Chevy, GMC, and Burger King just to name a few). These were shameless plugs that got annoying after a while.<br/><br/>-The ""comic relief."" It's an action movie, stop trying to make the audience laugh with stupid dialogue, and slap-stickey nonsense. It's frustrating when the writers are clearly trying to appeal to the 10-15 year old PG audience....<br/><br/>-Character development. At the end of the film, you'll know more about Sam's parents than you know about most of the main characters. They do not develop characters at all, and furthermore they had a few characters that served no purpose at all.<br/><br/>-Complete lack of nostalgia. If you're expecting to see some things that remind you of growing up with the Transformers TV show, you will be disappointed. Aside from the voice of O.P. nothing is similar.<br/><br/>THE GOOD: <br/><br/>-Best CGI/live action integration yet. This movie finally pulls off seamless CGI. It was beautiful. Just wait kids, now that they know how to do CGI properly, George Lucas will probably re-make Star Wars again...) -They got the original guy to do the voice of Optimus Prime. Awesome.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: If you're out to see a mediocre action movie laden with poorly written dialogue, and bad ""humor,"" then go for it.<br/><br/>If you're looking for some connection to a fantastic show from your childhood, don't waste your time.<br/><br/>If you want to see how CGI should look from now on, take the time, but be prepared for an altogether awful movie."

","I don't hate Michael Bay, or Spielberg, or any of the money hungry ignorant contributers to this film. I do however resent being made physically ill. The acting, the script, and especially the music... it all made me feel violated in some way. Imagine throwing up blood in the shower, that's where this film takes you, it's a special place.<br/><br/>It's poor at best. I went to the cinema expecting the worst, in hope that i wouldn't hate it as much after I'd seen it. The truth is, it's really, really, really, really, bad. An insult to anything cool, cultural, imaginative and honest. I am extremely disappointed that the original concept, story and characters were butchered with total disregard, but putting that aside (and i really tried), it is a genuinely bad film.<br/><br/>Don't watch it. The people giving this film a positive review must like really shiny things, poorly timed and arranged music that doesn't fit the images, and thin plots riddled with faults. Action films are fine, this is a cringing attempt at a Disney-esquire, teen romance, sci-fi flick that fails everywhere.

"nomatterhowminor","2","11","23","4 November 2007"," One word - LAME
","I went into watching this with the highest of expectations. That might have been my problem. Admittedly, I didn't watch the show as a child, I just played with the toys. That said, I think that if I HAD watched the show, I STILL would have hated this movie. There were so many things about it that bothered me: 1. There were scenes at the beginning that were good and funny but they were too long (when they are looking for the glasses, when they were at the car dealership and got Bumblebee) so by the end I was bored. Editing is a wonderful thing. 2. Speaking of editing, Michael Bay has a way of editing things that just makes you wanna throw things at his head if you ever meet him. There were parts when a transformer was transforming and there were things going on around him that were important, but the camera was too close to the transformer so you couldn't see what was happening around him. Michael did the same thing in Armagedden. Thousands of close-up shots of things transforming, being blown up, getting smashed, all back to back so the audience doesn't know what is transforming, being blown up, or getting smashed. 3. The casting was a joke. I liked Shia, don't get me wrong, but everyone else could have been re-casted and it probably would have made a huge difference. 4. The music felt like it was out of place. This is a movie ultimately about cartoon characters so why recycle music from Armageddon and Pearl Harbor, which was ultimately about the triumph of the American Spirit? Why recycle music from any movie? 5. There were more but I'll end with this one because it's my biggest pet-peeve. I am buying the fact that there are giant CGI robots fighting each other. I understand it because the movie is called Transformers, so it's about transformers. For me to believe something that isn't real, like robots from another planet came to this planet for some reason, everything else about this movie has to be believable. So when the only person on earth who can figure out what that code was that the little transformer was using, is a guy who lives with his mom and they figure it out on his Mac, I have one word...Stupid! If at the end there is an epic battle where there are these huge robots fighting on a street, with buildings on both sides, they are throwing cars, stepping everywhere and shooting things, and all these people are just standing around and watching it...Stupid...beyond stupid...beyond-my-comprehension stupid!<br/><br/>If you liked this movie, you probably liked The Fast and the Furious and Meet the Folkers. You probably like Nickleback and Hinder. You probably don't like going to art museums or reading novels. If you fit those descriptions, get some culture will you? For the sake of Humankind? Please?"
"psypeterson","4","14","31","11 July 2007"," Michael Bay is the Uwe Boll of Action Movies
","I will start this with an honest statement; I got more than I expected when I saw this movie, and I believe this is Michael Bay's best film to date.<br/><br/>However; saying this does not mean this movie was any good.<br/><br/>I'm not going to re-hash what was already said by others, but I will point out my two biggest gripes with this movie: <br/><br/>1. My Second Biggest Gripe: The dialogue in this movie was, at times, bloody hideous. Overacting, cheesy one-liners, and bountiful supplies of obvious statements abound as it seems Bay is trying to fill in gaps of time. Maybe we would rather a shorter movie than have our time wasted with useless characters with worse dialogue. Hey, remember the kid who played that nerd from Buffy? Remember when he had about three crappy lines, and then disappeared inexplicably from the movie forever? Yeah, me neither.<br/><br/>2. My Biggest Gripe: The Transformers were not the subject of the movie. Instead, we focus on the human players and their worldly struggles with surviving in the Middle East, getting the girl, hacking the code, proving their worth, and generally just mucking around and taking the focus away from where it really belongs: the Transformers themselves. The Autobots weren't even introduced until half-way through the movie, and even then they are limited script-wise to either some long-winded tirade by Prime,or some down right awful one-liners which are sometimes even worse than the dialogue from the cartoon itself (coming from the age of Thunder Cats and Visionaries, I think most of you '80s 'toons fans know what I'm talking about).<br/><br/>All and all, I enjoyed the movie, but only because the action sequences were pretty keen, in my opinion. I like a good destruction-fest, and don't even need a real movie around one for me to enjoy it (which is a good thing, because there wasn't much real movie in Transformers anyway).<br/><br/>EDIT: After watching this crap-fest for a second and third time, I have lowered my score from 6 out of 10 to 4 out of 10. Why? The horrible, horrible plot holes. I mean, come on, David Lynch has made movies with more coherent plot than this garbage."

Mixing dying US soldiers in the desert with utter nonsense in terms of warfare, technology, command procedures, and most of all, respect and realism, without being ironic or attempting to carry any message is even an outrage (and I'm not even American). Hell, I loved the funny stereotypes of ""True Lies"", enjoyed the nonsense way of fighting in ""starship troopers"", I stood up and cheered when the president lead the F18 attack in the patriotic overkill of independence day, I fought with infantry (and cavalry) in ""war of the worlds"", I ducked ricochets in the streets of Mogadishu when our black hawk went down and even cried like a baby when gandalf arrived with the rohirrim at helm's clam.

","I was a fan of the cartoons. I'm a lover of action movies. This movie is simply awful; and I like Michael Bay's 'The Island' The good; CGI is clearly reaching incredible complexity, the transformations are simply mind bending. However, they are few and far between, and simply do not make for a 'good movie'. Any movie can have 5 minutes of transformations, but you still need to fill the other 2 hours with content.<br/><br/>The bad; everything else. The action scenes are way too close, too fast, too blurry, too loud, without any rhyme or reason. Whenever you think you are about to see something cool, it cuts away to the irrelevant human story that feels tacked on.<br/><br/>The autobots are mere shadows of their former selves. The once intelligent ironhide is reduced to a trigger-happy moron. Optimus Prime is a single-minded brute who often makes clumsy mistakes. Jazz is just a rap-artist break dancer in disguise. This is just awful, awful stuff.<br/><br/>The human 'story' is not a story at all. It cuts between a few different stories, and we don't care about any of them. Are human stories bad? No, not at all, in fact that is what this movie needed; a good human story. However, Sam the adolescent moron is hardly captivating, the untouchable soldier is simply not compelling, and the government hackers remind me of all those awful matrix/swordfish hackers that are just a joke.<br/><br/>Here's how this movie should have 'rolled'. We should be introduced to cybertron, and the beginnings of the war. Start with a big battle scene. We make our way to earth. War continues. Human casualties cause a single person/group to hate the transformers and wage war on them. The autobots, under attack by the humans, convince the humans they are good by saving the humans from the decepticons. Autobots and humans team up to beat decepticons. Big final battle with all the decepticons vs. all the autobots. The end. Now, if you've seen the movie, a lot of those points may seem like what happened in the movie; but if you remember all the added garbage, like the awkward parents scene, the autobots hiding in the suburbs, the stupid government base nonsense and hacker garbage...you know my version would be a far better paced movie.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time. thewaythetruth.com"

","This is for those old school Transformer ""Fans"" who actually liked Bay's horrid film version.<br/><br/>Before that, read the Premise of the 80's cartoon.<br/><br/>The Transformers are a race of intelligent machines from a war-torn planet that has had its resources depleted by war. The Autobots seek out a planet that is rich in energy sources so they can replenish Cybertron. The Decepticons follow them. Both factions crash land on Earth, which is rich in natural resources that can be converted into Energeon Cubes that are consumable by Transformers. So, the Autobots unwittingly led the Decepticons to a new planet of innocent life (humans) and have unknowingly carried their war to Earth. Optimus feels guilty but realizes that the Autobots must defeat the Decepticons lest Megatron uses Earth's rich energy to rule Earth, Cybertron and beyond. <br/><br/>Now, that was the premise of the cartoon, made for a bunch of 6-year-olds. What's the plot of the movie? Everyone has to get a mystical cube that can make Transformers, because somehow making Transformers is the key to ruling the Universe. In order to get the cube, the Transformers must track down a pair of glasses with a map to the cube imprinted on the lenses. This is one of the most MISSED OPPORTUNITIES in movie making! Wouldn't the original cartoon idea be more relevant today anyway? A war in another land for energy. Gee, where have I seen that before? How the hell is a kids cartoon richer & deeper than a live-action Hollywood motion picture?<br/><br/>I want you to ask yourself these questions below. <br/><br/>DO YOU THINK IT'S GOOD THAT<br/><br/>Cybertron is destroyed? This destroys the entire concept of TF. Plus this gave the excuse to introduce more characters!<br/><br/>Megatron doesn't do anything until the end? He is not threatening in any way, cause he's not around until the last 20 min of a 2.5 hr movie! He is frozen that entire time!<br/><br/>Starscream doesn't show up until 2 hours in to the movie? Why couldn't SS destroy the base at the beginning of the movie. Or something to give him more of a role. Instead they use throwaway guys or guys they made up.<br/><br/>The Prime / Megatron fight takes place primarily off screen? We wait 2.5 hours to see them to fight, then we get quick edits of multiple fights that we cant make out?<br/><br/>Prime is defeated by Megatron off screen and then Sam defeats Megatron? We cut back to the fight and Prime is down and Megatron is about to win? How did MT get the upper hand? Prime doesn't even save the day in HIS OWN MOVIE!<br/><br/>Prime says his immortal movie quote ""One shall stand, one shall fall."" Off screen!!!!!<br/><br/>Bumble bee cannot speak? He is one of the fave characters and the liaison between Sam and the TF's but cannot speak? Ratchet repairs his legs & speech at the end in 1 sec but couldn't fix his speech for 100yrs or whatever it was?<br/><br/>Megatron and Starscream look the same? People say if you look closely you can tell. Well how many times am I gonna see this movie before I can tell who is who? I didn't have to watch closely in any other movies to tell characters apart?<br/><br/>Soundwave is not in the movie?<br/><br/>Sam is not called Spike? Why didn't they make Sam's ebay name spike101 instead of ladiesman?<br/><br/>Bumble bee pees on someone?<br/><br/>We didn't see Bumble bee and Barricade fight? They are chasing each other and then camera pans away to Sam & Girl fighting a crappy looking robotic gremlin called ""Frenzy"". The camera cuts back to BB and he is standing in a pose over barricade? We don't know how BB defeated him?<br/><br/>Prime is clumsy and says ""my bad""? Prime is the leader of the autobots, he shouldn't be clumsy and stupid. They hide around the corner at Sam's house instead of just going on the street and transforming to cars. They were studying humanity they said, for x years and don't get that? Prime should be awe inspiring, not the puppet of a script that molds his personality to whatever the individual scene demands (he makes a rousing speech about humanity here, he clumsily steps on a fountain there, etc.). Heck, for that matter, no character should be written like that. That's not how you write scripts! <br/><br/>The TF's have no personalities? They are not characters, they are big robots that fight. Even the Ninja turtles are different characters.<br/><br/>A mountain dew machine becomes a TF? Bay didn't like the original TF because he said it was a toy commercial, but they are doing a commercial for Ford, Mountain Dew and Nokia phones. Not to mention TOYS which are all over every toy department in every store.<br/><br/>Devastator is not a combiner? He's just a big stupid vehicle that gets destroyed in 1 sec. I don't even remember how he died.<br/><br/>There are much more problems with the movie than that, but I mean these are some big basic ones. I don't think I'm nit picking here, these are legitimate questions to ask yourself.<br/><br/>Even if you DON'T compare it to the original TF (not sure why you wouldn't compare it, since the movie is called TF, but whatever) the movie still sucks. You cant see the action, the final fight is a let down, and there's too much comedy. They don't take anything seriously anymore."

Sure, there are pretty girls, but they are acting as if robots are humans. The acting in this movie is a huge letdown. It's as if Disney has made one single movie that combines the terrible features of all of their movies, added robots, and released it.<br/><br/>If you enjoy comic books, Transformers type stuff, you may be interested to see how it is depicted in a film once more, but don't get too excited.<br/><br/>If you liked The Matrix, this movie may not be for you, the robots look just like robots, yet the movie asks you to look at them as humans, and this is what bugs me. They have cheesy deep voices, and this film is full of over-used robot humor.<br/><br/>After seeing this film, I almost feel like everyone in the movie was a robot, they all acted as if they had no emotions whatsoever, and no touch with humanity. Even the main character is so see-through that it makes the whole film feel like a joke to me.<br/><br/>Towards the end there are so many inconsistencies that it would take a lot of alcohol not to notice them. Just an example (NOT A SPOILER): A main character states something to the effect of ""if those were our planes they wouldn't fly lower than the buildings"". 5 minutes later, their planes are flying just a couple hundred feet over the ground in a big city.<br/><br/>It's things like this that could easily be fixed, but absolutely ruin the movie for all of us.

","Despite Michael Bay's numbingly loud and macho direction, he seemed a good fit for presenting this alternate vision based on the 80's toy superstars. Yes, all the trappings of a typical Bay film are present...The pretentious camera-work, embarrassing acting, laughable script, and visual overkill all remain in spades with this spiritual successor to Independence Day, yet somehow the movie remains watchable until the end. Mainly this is due to the unsung heroes of movies like these: the computer animators. Here they are allowed to reach new heights with some outstanding point-of-view renderings as these gigantic robots battle for supremacy. In what is this year's most explosive, debris-laden sequencing, these CGI artist's elevate the formulaic and exploitative idea and turn it into a profound tech demo. While the actual Transformers themselves feel more manipulated into a petty human-based script then what this adaptation should have called for, the presence of lead Shia LaBeouf considerably helps alleviate so much dead weight supplied by the rest of the flesh-based cast."

","So, i saw Transformers last night. I went in armed only with fond, if vague memories of the cartoon when I was 5, but left sorely disappointed. The single thought I had most throughout the film was, what was the point in that? And I don't mean in the sense of over-the-top fights or visuals or anything, i mean in the sense of scenes and dialogue which either serves no purpose or leaves you cringing in your seat. For example - a hacker who is supposedly better than the Pentagon and NSA combined decides to 'hotwire' a computer. Or, witness the clumsiest attempt at political satire I have ever witnessed - the President with his feet on the desk in red socks asking for a ding-dong, or the shady official betting his 'ridiculously-oversized government salary' on it. There were some plus points about this film. The acting, in particular Shia LeBouef (sp?), was pretty good, while the VFX were simply stunning, easily the best I've seen. The combat sequences were also pretty good overall. But Michael Bay is simply the most inept filmmaker in the world; nay, in history. OK, maybe Im being a little strong but the whole film from start to finish just felt disjointed, as if he didn't really know what he was doing. He has succeeded in wasting a decent script, a good cast, and some breathtaking effects - it beggars belief that Steven Spielberg didn't either rectify things, or pull out. A waste of potential, and a big disappointment."
"davideo-2","4","13","29","29 July 2007"," Long-awaited but disappointing live action Transformers adventure
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Geeky Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) lives with his parents and has an impossible crush on a pretty girl at his school named Mikaela (Megan Fox.) But it's not all bad as his father is treating him to his first ever car- unfortunately it's a seemingly junky old Volkswagon. But unbeknownst to Sam, it's just one of the Autobots- good 'transformers', lead by Optimus Prime, that have landed on earth for a showdown with the bad 'transformers'- the decepticons, lead by the evil Megatron, for a showdown that has been brewing for centuries.<br/><br/>As soon as I saw those Citroen car adverts with the car that transforms into a dancing robot, I sat there and thought 'if they can do that for an advert, they could surely make a live action movie of the Transformers', most likely my favourite boyhood kids show. Sure, many people cynically shrugged it off as a cheap marketing gimmick to sell toys, but I loved watching the TV shows and collecting the clever toys that transformed into robots from fire engines, cars, tanks, and many other things. And now many years later it's finally here...<br/><br/>Unfortunately it's a very flawed film with more going against it than going for it. It gets better towards the end (getting a trend for Summer blockbusters???) but for the first half we have to endure a clunky script, with banal dialogue and a flimsy story that gives hardly any explanation for who's doing what to whom. If Michael Bay's going to make a habit of making these big films that stretch well over two hours (i.e. this, Bad Boys II) then he needs to at least give the script and the plot a bit more zest and vitality than this.<br/><br/>You have to wait a while for them, but when the Autobots do arrive on the scene, they're quite a sight to behold. Optimus Prime is very impressive, colourful and transforms marvellously. They also do Jazz, Ironhide, Bumblebee and another one. They surpassed themselves there, as it must have taken a lot of hard work just to bring Optimus to life so brilliantly. The Decepticons are less impressive, though. They're all very grey and all look rather samey. There's not much depth in the Autobots, either, but they're especially lifeless. I mean, Starscream was such a major part of the TV show, and it was always a big part of the story watching the power struggle between him and Megatron for leadership of the Decepticons. Here he's just an insignificant support character who stands there and lets Megatron berate him (""...you disappoint me as always Starscream!!!"") which the TV Starscream would never have took.<br/><br/>The writers have put a lot of emphasis on humour, too. Not a bad thing, of course, but it does get in the way of the story a little sometimes. It's mostly to do with crude sexual inneuendo as well. The 12A certificate wasn't all down to the violence! <br/><br/>It could have been worse, I suppose, but for a large part of it, this just felt like a rather soulless and careless long awaited live action version of a show I used to really love. **"

When they actually happened, the ""camera"" for the robot fights was jerky and up close for the most part.<br/><br/>There were barely any transformers for the first damn hour of the movie, and the interaction between the main character and his love interest was just painstakingly retarded.

I would like to point out the tremendously unrealistic ""British accent"" of Rachael Taylor (Maggie Madsen), a sort of mix between talentless acting and parody.<br/><br/>The stench of rotten ""politically correctness"", distributed homogeneously in dialogues, casting and plot, is only equaled by the cheesy humour that can perhaps extract a blank smile from participants at the Special Olympics.<br/><br/>The special effects are good, the only good part of the movie, but they also tend to become boring, in a flat and predictable way, just after the first few minutes, too feeble to sustain as a compensation the terrible ugliness of everything else.<br/><br/>The movie is not a complete waste of time though.

","I had gone to see Michael Bay's treatment of Transformers with two things in mind. The first was to expect a no-holds-barred action adventure with Bayish cliché's galore and the second was some respect for its source material (namely hardly any plot or decent acting, just big ass robots kicking ten tin cans or crap out of one another). Now, I have not been disappointed. This film gave me everything I expected from a Transformers film directed by said-Bay. Running at nearly 2½ hours Transformers delivers its content fast, hard, loud and hilariously in places.<br/><br/>The return of original Optimus Prime voice actor, Peter Cullen, is a welcome sound to the nostalgic ears and to see the old Gen1 Transformers dukeing it out in spectacular CGI and live action is brilliant.<br/><br/>My only little problems with the film were Megan Fox's character, who I could not care less for (just a nice piece of eye candy for us fella's). Other concerns were with its running time with hardly any development in Transformer character was rather irritating and the typical token black guy who has to talk crap all the time is getting a little tiresome with films now-a-days.<br/><br/>I suppose my hopes for the next Transformers film would be to get a new director (Bay's first films are good but sequels don't always agree with this man), more Transformers and more of their characteristics  particularly Starscream's desire for power over the Decepticons  and less about the humans, they're developed enough thankyou."

This sets the plot up for the sequel(s). Hugo Weaving did an impressive job of Megatron. Peter Cullen hasn't lost his touch and was brilliant at Optimus Prime.

","What is this ""Transformers?"" If you grew up in 1980s, especially if you were a male, the answer would have been part of your daily knowledge. This reviewer grew up in the 1990s, so even though the ""Transformers"" phenomenon was not as powerful as it was in the 1980s, this reviewer still remembers watching the many reruns on ""Cartoon Network."" Nonetheless, this reviewer remembers watching the reruns of the television show, along with many other ones from that era. The question will be asked: will fans of the television show like the movie? Will it appeal to the non-fans as well? The answer to those questions is an absolute yes.<br/><br/>Sam Witwicky buys his first car, but, to his surprise, that car was actually Bumblebee, a member of the Autobots, disguised as a Camaro. Through Bumblebee, Sam discovers the secrets about the mysterious ""Allspark,"" a cube that gives machines the gift of life, and the war that is going on between Autobots and Decepticons. Unfortunately, Bumblebee is not the only Transformer to have landed on earth. In Qatar, there was an attack on the US military base, but those attacks were not from any particular human terrorist but two Decepticons. In addition, two other Decepticons attacked Sam and his girlfriend, Mikaela. These Decepticons want the Allspark for their own needs greedy needs, while the Autobots want to destroy it because of its corruptive power. With more and more Decepticons appearing, Bumblebee sends a message for other Autobots to come to Earth. Now the war hits the Earth and it is up to Sam, with the help of the Autobots, to ensure humanities survival.<br/><br/>The special effects, created by Industrial Lights and Magic (ILM), and fight scenes were phenomenal. Every time one of them did their transformations, your jaw will literally hit the floor. Special effects have been amazing over the years, but you have not felt this overwhelmed since seeing the Dinosaurs in ""Jurassic Park."" Never once did you feel that it was computer generated. It is consistently action packed, and never once during its 144 minutes does it feel boring. Sure there is at times, when the trademark ""shaky"" cam came into play, making it very difficult to tell what was going on, but there is also times where they would slow down the fights to show you the most important scenes.<br/><br/>There are many references to the cartoon series. Some lines from the original cartoon series are quoted in this. The great Peter Cullen, who was the voice of Optimus in the animated series, voices Optimus Prime in this one too. They do make little tiny tweaks to the designs of the characters, for a more modern look, but it would have looked extremely cheesy if it was left unaltered. If you were a fan of the series, you are going to love the references.<br/><br/>Besides the action, special effects, and many references to the cartoon series, the humor was surprisingly well done. It is surprising how much humor is actually there and even more surprising how much it works. There are some parts where the audiences, and this reviewer, are laughing so hard that you could not even hear what the characters are saying after words. Warning to parents: some of the most humorous scenes are very adult, so if you do not want to explain to your young children some awkward things, do not show them this movie.<br/><br/>The acting is nothing special, but it does the job. The most impressive is Shia LeBeouf as Sam. This role really showed that he can do big budget lead roles, a big step up from his days as Lewis Stevens in ""Even Stevens."" Megan Fox is in this for nothing else but eye candy. Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel are in this film, but as expected, do not do anything for their roles but play Soldiers. Anthony Anderson and Bernie Mac bring great comedic relief. Peter Cullen shows off his iconic voice as Optimus Prime. John Voight is a great president too!<br/><br/>In conclusion, go see ""Transformers"" because it is an awesome action movie. Fans of the series are going to love it and the casual fans are going to love it as well. As a fan of the show, this is everything expected, and much more. You should see it as soon as you can to get the full effect. The audience, this reviewer saw it with, loved it. There were many laughs at appropriate times, lots of cheering for great action scenes and the appearances of popular characters like Megatron or Optimus and a big applause at the end credits. It just made the film so much more enjoyable, and that is why you see a big budget ""Transformers"" movie. It is not ""The Godfather,"" nor should the audience pretend it was. ""Transformers"" is a movie to have fun viewing, and boy is it!"

In nearly every sequence, all you can see is, ""Oh, there's a mass of metal."" If Bay would have cut the hackers, and trimmed the some of the awkward character sequences this would be a fine 1 3/4 hour film with some nicely fleshed out Transformers, with more than 4 lines to differentiate explain why the Autobots were not jerks, and that the Decepticons were.<br/><br/>Also, the lips do look weird."

","So what's wrong with Transformers?... An easier question is what isn't wrong with Transformers. Let's see Shia Labeouf's performance is wonderfully appealing and he's starting to look more attractive. Megan Fox is pretty to look at. And the spfx are good the first time they happen. That's about it. Now what's wrong with it. I'm not a fan of the cartoon nor have I watched therefore I can not speak for that group of people. No story. Loud. Obnoxious. Dumb. Directionless. Boring. Bad Acting. Bad cinematography. Bad casting. Actually reduces your brain capacity after watching. Very little entertainment value. Painfully repetitive. Yep well that's about it. Transformers certainly isn't the worst film I've seen but it's definitely one of the worst. It's dreadfully loud and obnoxious. I left with a horrible headache and found the movie to be painfully stupid. I didn't really understand what was going on and really couldn't see anything because of the chaotic Blair Witch style cinematography. Except for those now ridiculous Michael Bay slow motion shots and pan outs. This is quite possibly the dorkiest film ever made and you have any bit of coolness to you, you'll run for the exits. Transformers is a cinematic junkyard..."

","I'm big fan of the transformers(animation from 1986) but after watching this film I didn't know if I should cry or laugh. <br/><br/>This pseudo movie is a typical American production, the less sense you get it is better for you. Story is very flat and I've a feeling that the authors are trying to imply the ""american way of life"". If you are looking for a cheap senseless entertainment or you have too much time, the movie is for you. You will get very big amount of special effects with very poor acting and bad movie sound.

","What can I say? Okay me me rephrase that, what can I say nice? The actors aren't bad. The CGI looks okay...in the trailer.<br/><br/>Soulless unfunny big screen live action disaster based on the cartoon series. Michael Bay rapes the American public once again.<br/><br/>This is awful.<br/><br/>How bad? My dad fell asleep and I kept moaning this is awful this is awful.<br/><br/>I think one reviewer claimed something about this being a sign of the Apocalypse. I believe him. This is proof that most people want form over content and bread and circus' over anything meaningful.<br/><br/>The plot is something like the Decepticons trying to find a cosmic cube or spark or something so they can rule the world. The Autobots- who mostly don't show up until an hour in are also trying to find it but to protect man kind. I don't know, I don't care.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong this is well made trash. It looks good, even if the CGI is never fully integrated into the film. Yet again we have these cool looking effects that seem unconnected with the people. Why are effects getting worse and worse? 200 million dollars and you can tell that the transformers are not with the people.<br/><br/>The problems mostly lie in the script. First off the movie is wildly silly, even the parts that are not suppose to be ""funny"". What can I say its so over the top as to be laughable. The comedy is dumb in a TV sitcom sort of way.Then again this is coming from a TV cartoon so it makes perfect sense. Worse a good many of the actors mug and play their roles for laughs for much of the early parts of the film so that when it comes time to be serious you don't believe them. There is no tension because you don't believe there is any real danger...or anything that is connected to reality. I never once believed this was real-or possible. No one acted nor did the plot spin out in anything other than the sort of reality found on second rate TV shows or movies.<br/><br/>I think the choices to play to the fans and keep things close to the TV show-using some of the voices hurt the believability of much of the film. Sure the scorpion thing looks cool and a few others seem plausible, but Optimus Prime just looks really stupid when placed in the real world.<br/><br/>and yet its well made. On some technical level this is a ""good"" movie. Not good enough to recommend it...but good on some scale of proficiency.<br/><br/>I'm at a loss for words-really.<br/><br/>What a waste this is. Its just an incredibly stupid movie."

","Transformers is a story with great potential. The sad part about it is that the only attempt to exploit this capacity is using incredible computer graphics.<br/><br/>I just wonder, why if you invest so much in having such great animations of the Transformers then why don't do the same to get a hold of great actors that won't spoil the work of the computer engineers? The actors might get away with their cheesy and fake acting given that this movie is somewhat targeted towards a young pg-13 audience. However, it wasn't the actors' poor performance what didn't let me enjoy the movie but the obvious insertion of General Motors and US Military advertisements.<br/><br/>I got exhausted of counting scenes of the different GM brands getting thrown at my face. But it seems the guys at Fint weren't satisfied with all this visuals and shots of (even) one of their dealers; they also had to include in the script comments about how something so complex (as a Transformer) had to be Japanese to later on transform into a Chevrolet.<br/><br/>For God's sake, if I ever wanted to see some kind of complex robot transform into a car it definitively won't be a Pontiac! Didn't Mr. Bay know about Ferraris, Hummers, and other more fitted vehicles for this type of movie? Lines like ""You can bet my ridiculous government salary."" makes the effort to make the US Military job attractive so evident.<br/><br/>I think we all pay to go to the movies to be entertained not to sit and watch an almost 3 hour-long universal studios like ride advertisement.<br/><br/>Clearly a couple of Thank You For Smoking-Style lobbyists passed by Hollywood in an effort to increase some car sales, soldiers and maybe direct some traffic to the slowly dying website, eBay."

"foOki","5","11","24","1 July 2007"," An OK movie..
","I think I must've been watching a different movie to the one everyone else has reviewed here... <br/><br/>Sure, it doesn't have to be the same storyline as the original, but did it have to be so overly simplified? How could a kid's cartoon (and comic book series) actually have more depth than a movie (I know its Michael Bay, but still..)?? The whole point of the series was the character development of the Transformers (hence the name) with the human characters secondary. In this movie, the Transformers were secondary and not even introduced until half way through as actual characters. It had every cliché the writers thought they could put in there. You know, nerd boy has cool rebellious girl fall for him while saving the world.. actually, the movie seemed to place more emphasis on this plot device than the actual invasion. There have been many cliché movies, but at least they don't feel as corny. Which leads me to the human characters (in this case, the main characters). None of them were interesting and all felt very one dimensional. There were a lot of human characters (more than robots) and all seemed trivial. While the whole point of 'robots in disguise' or 'more than meets the eye' is that the Transformers are fighting their war whilst trying not to be noticed.. not attacking anyone they can, and having wars in the middle of the city ala Godzilla. <br/><br/>A point of major contention on the internet before the release of this movie seemed to be the designs of the Transformers. I decided to reserve my judgement until I saw the movie.. Unlike the story, the character designs in this movie were so overly complicated. Sure, the 80's designs can be updated, but not completely changed to the point of being unrecognisable and indistinguishable between each other. The original characters were easy to pick apart (simple and effective colour schemes and face designs) without having to hear their voices. Instead, all I saw was an ugly mash of grey wires and metal blending on the screen most of the time. The vehicles may have looked good, but not the robots. Actually, most of the faces reminded me of the robot from 'Short Circuit'.. They definitely didn't feel Japanese designed and again made the Transformers feel secondary.<br/><br/>And finally, the product placement got pretty annoying. Its bad enough to see the same brands over and over again, but even worse to hear constant references to products.<br/><br/>So, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I didn't find this to be a great movie, or even a good summer blockbuster. Its an OK movie (that has an OK action sequence at the end) but little or no character development of the Transformers, boring human characters, boring designs and little in common with the original series aside from the names. Stick to the cartoon, or watch Die Hard if you want action.."
"visitken","6","11","24","28 June 2007"," Typical Michael Bay
","Gotta hand it to Michael Bay, he really knows how to deliver in typical ""Bay"" fashion. Left the screening here in Bangkok a half hour ago and I feel exactly the same way I did after watching The Island, The Rock, Armageddon and Pearl Harbor for the first time -- fulfilled but empty. Bad Boys actually had good character development compared to his later big budget flicks.<br/><br/>Anthony Anderson was totally useless here, still wondering why Bay brought him on. Voight started off well but then began to remind me of his Manchurian Candidate character, and soon after that seemed to slip into his Bill Biscane ala Baby Geniuses 2 shtick. Maybe it was just me, Voight's character became irrelevant halfway through this two-hour plus CGI fest. I was actually surprised by Megan Fox, she did a very passable job while LaBeouf was good as usual, nothing great here though. And the usually brilliant John Turturro was a bad choice to play the deadpan secret agent, it was hard to take him seriously in this role. The character was obviously a caricature but Turturro played it up too much, methinks.<br/><br/>If you like Bay, you won't be disappointed. Over the top action, good looking girls, unbelievable CGI, even a younger Michael Biehn, played by Josh Duhamel. I know the original series well and I didn't care so much that Bumblebee wasn't a Bug, but the GM product placements were too obvious and overdone. And finally let me say that the storyline left much to be desired. How many times do we have to sit through the long-lost-whatchamacallit- has-been-located- whoever-finds-it-first- rules-the-world plot??? Puh-leeze. It was like another Jon Voight masterpiece, National Treasure, except even less believable.<br/><br/>Overall thought, a must see for CGI, robot and Bay fans alike."
"DetroitDaveBrown","6","30","80","5 July 2007"," You've got to be kidding me...
","SPOILER: I can't believe the ranking this movie has gotten so far on IMDb. First off the good things: the special effects are great, without a doubt. The comedy in this movie is also great, until it turns to cheese. Shia LeBeouf is great. Unfortunately that's it. The plot is riddled with holes - check out the ""Goofs"" to see just some. There were superfluous characters - Anthony Anderson. Characters were unbelievably weird for no reason - John Tuturro. The soldiers acted absurdly - why would Sergeant Lennox charge the Decepticons with a hand-held weapon when he just called in an air strike. The Transformers went from near indestructible in the beginning of the movie, to Bumblebee getting caught with a net, back to being nearly indestructible (Ironhide at the end battle). Also, I know it's a little more visually pleasing to have the transformers be giants, but how exactly does a camero turn into a two-story robot or Frenzy turning into a boom-box and then a tiny cell phone? And even while the special effects were great, the cinematography was so shaky and close-up that you couldn't even tell what was happening when the Transformers were fighting. Also, I understand that you want to do a little tribute to the original Transformers cartoon and movie, but did ALL the dialog between Optimus and Megatron have to be so cheesy? Michael Bay dropped the ball on this one. In fact, I'm changing my vote to a 5/10, and that's being generous."
"ccthemovieman-1","6","9","19","10 October 2008"," Robots - Thumbs Up; People - Thumbs Down
","I went into this film not knowing much ""Transformers,"" only that they were some toy robots you could re-assemble into other things, like trucks. When they were popular in the '80s, I was not a young kid who cared, being past that age-wise, so I had no preconceived notions about this story.<br/><br/>What I found, on the positive end, was a goofy story but a great visual and audio movie, one that I heartily recommend you see on Blu-Ray high-definition, if you have the equipment. You will be blown away by the sharpness of the picture, one of the best BDs I've seen so far.<br/><br/>The other highlight to me was the special-effects. These ""transformers,"" aliens who could change shape from cars and trucks into giant robots, was jaw-dropping at times. True, the action was overdone in the last hour, but that's normal for a modern-day action film. Most of it was fun to watch. I preferred the second half of this film, anyway.<br/><br/>While it was fun to watch, this movie was not fun to hear, meaning the dialogue, which was extremely annoying, mainly in the first half of the film. Maybe if I was a lot younger I could have enjoyed Shia LeBeouf's wisecracking lead character, ""Sam Witwicky,"" but he was too smug, too obnoxious for me. So were the other ""good-guy"" characters in this story, who were all young, edgy and loud stereotypes. You know, grubby-looking 17-20 years old people who all know more about computers and science than anyone else older than them. It's very offensive to anyone over 25 watching this film.<br/><br/>Speaking of stereotypes, the worst was the portrayal of every adult in this movie except one (Jon Voight's Defense Secretary character, who was fine). Everyone else in any position of authority was made to look stupid and totally idiotic. Filmmakers have been doing this since the '60s. There is no one Liberals despise more than a military figure or someone in the government (if they are Conservative.) Voight must have insisted his role was not going to be like the others. If you doubt this, just check out John Turturro's ""Agent Simmons."" It's ludicrous.<br/><br/>The worst - the most insulting of all people in this film - was Sam's mother. In one of her scenes, this woman's dialog might be the most disgustingly-unfunny segments I've ever seen on film and total insult to any viewer with any intelligence. It was at that point, I almost junked the DVD and returned it to the store. However, I hung with it and the last 50 minutes was enjoyable and free of most of that stupidity.<br/><br/>I was reminded of one thing: director/writer Michael Bay has a resume of overwrought, intelligence-insulting films like this one. He did ""The Island,"" ""Bad Boys I and II,"" ""Pearl Harbor"" (when the Japanese were made to look like the good guys), ""The Rock,"" etc. Thus, I will be very wary of watching one of his films again or anything written by Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzman, who wrote the screenplay. Then again, I have to admit the action scenes in here were pretty awesome and I really did enjoy the last hour or so. I guess you take the good with the bad."
"lstrawser","3","9","19","22 October 2007"," The coolest commercial I have ever seen...
","I have to say that I watched this movie out of curiosity, people have been raving about it since it hit theaters and now that it is on DVD I decided to give it a go... No amount of spit and polish can hide the fact that Transformers is pure garbage. So let me start with the high points. The CGI is beautiful. I have experience with 3D modeling and animation and must say that my mind was blown by all of the beautiful transformation sequences and details in each robot. The team behind Transformers will surely get the Oscar for best special effects and deservingly so. The rest of the movie is mediocre at best... The foundation of any decent movie is its screenplay and this movie is a compilation of stupid character archetypes, clichés and failed attempts at humor that reinforce the summer movie money whoring feel. Slightly nerdy, doesn't quite fit in protagonist: CHECK. Sexy, slightly snobbish girl who needs to be won over by protagonist: CHECK. Life altering encounter with object that alters the ordinary world: CHECK. Source of conflict found in one all powerful artifact: CHECK. The dialogue is riddled with goofy lines that have come to be expected in crappy movies based on comic books and any theme is an afterthought since Michael Bay's only concern is filling every frame with things that go boom and special effects. Bay is what I fear most, an anti-artist out to make millions for movie studios every summer. His movies are empty and formulaic and aimed at the masses for maximum monetary return. He undoes the work of so many great filmmakers that has come before him by allowing audiences to escape into a ridiculous world where they are in no way thrust into cognition. Have Bergman, Fellini, Truffaut, Bunuel, De Sica and Kurosawa's work been for nothing? Literature, cinema, and music are artistic arenas and as such all entries into these forums should be judged on their artistic merit. Period. My biggest grievance is the fact that this film felt like a 143 minute commercial. Not since The Wizard have I seen a film that promotes a product so well. After watching I felt like I was being begged to buy a General Motors vehicle and joined the armed forces. It was disgusting. Performances are mediocre but it is really a moot point considering that the actors really didn't need to convey much, act surprised here, awkward there, courageous at the end... The usual. I beg anyone who has any respect for cinema to avoid this film and indulge in something of substance... To anyone who enjoyed this I implore you to take some time to try and enjoy something less commercial..."

","OK first off, Im a huge fan of The Transformers Animated Movie from way back and the Series was pretty good and I watched most of them. But still love the Animated Movie and Im 35 now. I went into Transformers with much of an open mind that it would at least be somewhat nostalgic. And other than a few words that Optimus Prime spoke ""One shall stand. One Shall Fall."" I couldn't stand to sit to the end of the movie. The Transformers were ugly, extremely bulky and fake looking. They weren't streamlined at all which made them look even more absurd when they were dancing around like kung fu masters. And gliding on the Freeway, even though they had no wheels on their feet. Its like they were just ghosts. All of the combat looked like it was happening on a whole different layer than the scenery it was attached to. Even though rockets and bullets are flying everywhere. THere didn't seem to be much of it affecting the enviorment at all other than a few specific obstacles. The Autobots, maybe 6 of them in all. Had very little Personality at all, unlike the old series. The Decepticons had NO personality period other than Megatron who was only in the movie a few minutes and barely spoke a word other than to utter a few memorable lines from the old movie but said with much less Flair or Conviction. Often when an Autobot would speak it seems to come from speakers outside of them, rather than from the autobots. Which of course they are, but it shouldn't seem so, like any actors. Its like they were terribly dubbed with soundbites from the old movie, but slowed down and more automated. The little robots were clunky bug type things not at all like some of the old guys that would pop out of Soundwave. Of course there's no Soundwave this time. The plot was HORRIBLE! Every time the human kid spoke, I just wanted someone to squash his head. His Hot girlfriend was far better than him who was serious all the time and seemed to understand what was going on better than him. This movie is so goofy, its laughable. And Im saying that based on the Old Animated Movie which was 10 times more serious and complex and made a hell of a lot more sense. This is the worst looking movie by Michael Bay so far. It was like a computer game with really bad graphics. But Im sure those interested will see for themselves, its hard to resist. But prepare to sit in Horror at how little thought and consideration of the True Transformers, went into this pile of overblown Rock Em Sock Em Robots."
"cautious_critic","2","9","19","11 July 2007"," Transformed into a huge mess
","I sometimes wonder if people really do hate Michael Bay. I know there are those who would like to hang him upside-down by his toes from a tree limb and beat him silly with sticks. I never knew what the big deal was. I enjoyed ""The Rock""; a guilty pleasure of mine. I also enjoyed ""The Island"". It was when I saw ""Transformers"" that I understood what everyone was talking about. Only now does that line from a song in ""Team America: World Police"": ""why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies?"" make sense to me. In a word, ""Transformers"" is a mess and it may be Bay's fault.<br/><br/>This film may have been an excuse to blow up and destroy as many things as possible. And they succeeded. I don't know if there was a building or a house or vehicle that wasn't crushed under the large feet of these mechanical behemoths. Probably because the camera was moving so fast and so choppy that I couldn't see what was going on. You might as well have put me in a washer for two and half hours and ask me to explain my surroundings while I was inside.<br/><br/>The screenplay didn't help either. Robots exchanging lines like ""One will stand. One will fall"", ""Do you wanna piece of me?"" ""No, I want two"" and ""Oh s*it"" make the film more and more unbearable. The film's main protagonist, Sam ""Spike"" (he's never called Spike in the film) Witwicky, asks the Transformers how they learned to speak. ""From the World Wide Web"" answers an Autobot. That's good, hopefully they're catching up on recent world events as well. A scene where the Autobots hide from Sam's parents around their house goes from sightly funny to irritating and the Decepticons (the bad guys) don't kill nearly enough humans as they had intended (the entire race).<br/><br/>The only thing that may have held this movie together is the ever-popular, and possibly best young leading-man newcomer, Shia LaBeouf. His delivery of some of his lines provide a somewhat comic relief to the growing intolerability of the pace. Although his repeated lines of ""No no no no"" as his situation worsens gets older and older, there is still that hint of realism since the film itself seems so fake.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a summer blockbuster ""Transformers"" has what you're looking for. You'll definitely get all the bangs, booms, and explosions for your buck. But if you're looking for something at least entertaining, why not try the theater next door and peek in on a guy named John McClane.<br/><br/>Review by Glenn D. Harvey"

Military might and efficiency plus zero body count (wait, did someone die in this movie?) as opposed to the grim and harsh reality of countless deaths daily in this current war and pretty well every other war that's ever happened.

","I like Spielberg and Bay, really. From the first time I heard that Transformers were hitting through the wide-screen, I was thrilled. With the satisfying trailers announced weekly, my appetite was growing because I liked to watch Transformers each week when I was 10 years old. It was one of my favorites such as He-Man, Voltron, Robotech and so on, and I used to have a big picture of ""Optimus Prime"" on my wall.<br/><br/>The time I first heard that the movie was due to 2007, I really had my doubts about it because I was wondering how they would carry this plot to an actual movie. I saw it on Saturday night, and I have to admit that it was truly disappointing. As I get into the theater I had my first impression by seeing 10 year old crawling on the seats. Then the movie started and I was about to go and get my 15 YTL's back. The movie was only offering teen-trash to people. Of course I was not expecting an Oscar nominee and just wanted to see expensive special fx. But, the filmmakers should be aware that it just shouldn't be the only reason to attract the audience. If they are spending 100 millions of dollars for the effects, they should at least keep their 1-2 million for a descent screen writing. I mean the movie was really poor on the plot. OK lots of aliens are coming from outside the planet and they are fighting. That's it???. Give me a break... After JP, the movie industry has turned into a rich PC game demo and now everyone is doing movies according to the developing computer technology. But is that enough? If you are 10-12 years old or just want to free your mind without thinking about the plot of the movie, I can recommend this action flick. It presents you lots of explosions, good sound effects, lovely people (tx to newly introduced Megan Fox), stupid sexual jokes (for 8 year old) and that's it. But if not, I would bet that you'll be begging to the pay-box to get your money back.<br/><br/>3 out of 10"

He even has a collection of transformers. At any rate, the sexual content in the movie alienated him and diminished his enjoyment of the movie. I guess they only care about the people who were 9 ten years ago.<br/><br/>I found the movie really lacking in key areas such as writing and acting. The dialog was terrible. The special effects were about the only thing that were good.

Sector 7 realizes that Spike has information about the transformers and tracks them down -- Optimus busts them up for a second, but Sector 7 captures Bumblebee and the entire team.<br/><br/>At Hoover Dam, Sam blackmails Sector 7 into releasing him, Megan Fox, and the whole team in exchange for explaining the story of the transformers. Megatron comes to life, starts busting up the place, about 3 minutes of very hard to see fighting between Megatron and Optimus Prime.<br/><br/>Not going into too much detail, the ending very much leaves open the possibility of a part 2.<br/><br/>In general, the plot moved way too fast, and revolved too heavily on Sam vs. revolving around the Transformers. Most of the transformers don't even come out until the last 20-30 mins of the movie. Part 2 needs to have a lot more emphasis on the robots themselves."

","I'm sick and tired of Hollywood pushing trash on the plate of the American people and expecting us to pay to eat it all up. That's the case with Transformers. The Hype far outmatched the crappy movie itself. It features nothing but ridiculous action set pieces and horribly fake looking CGI robots. There's NOTHING to enjoy because the CGI is just that bad.<br/><br/>Why does anyone think the butt ugly CGI looks anything but fake? The robots themselves don't react well with their environment. You never, not for one single moment, believe the wild and silly things seen on screen. Nothing carries any weight and nothing feels even remotely believable. (Even if you're eight years old and believe what you see, why fire guns at them? Firing tiny metal at giant robots is akin to hurling ground hamburger at human beings) This mess of a movie will make good money right off the bat (unfortunately) but word of mouth will kill it fast. Mark this comment down."
"Totencough","3","19","48","8 July 2007"," Transformers - Anything but.
","Let's get one thing straight: this movie was dreadful. It's best summed up by this: Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox, there to look good in some dramatic pose, extreme lighting, and a disappointing absence of Transformers. All they had to do was make a movie with Transformers fighting each other. Instead, they had to complicate it with technical drivel, completely unnecessary characters, and retarded justification sequences which left you wondering how writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman got through life without getting beat up around every corner. Michael Bay can make an action flick, and that's all he had to do here. Instead, he tried to complicate things. When this is a movie called Transformers and there are hour long gaps between transformer on transformer action, you know you have a real problem.<br/><br/>The CG in this movie was amazing... when it was on screen. Literally one hour passed before we saw the first transformer battle (albeit was awesome) and almost another hour before the final sequence. When people say it's a 2 and a half hour trailer for ILM, they are sorely mistaken. This was a 25 minute trailer for ILM pasted into a drearily dull and pointless story. Another problem with the CG was the complication of robot design, coupled with the ambiguity of color and design from all the other robots and a constantly tight camera shot, made it impossible to distinguish between how many transformers were on screen or who was fighting who. Only after the battle do you know who you're rooting for.<br/><br/>The script was terrible. The lines were gag-reflex bad, and the story, if observed with any sort of intelligence, was a wasteful tack-on with no thought put in.<br/><br/>Also a huge disappointment was the acting. Shia LaBeouf, Jon Voight, John Turturro- these actors have all shown us some great performances in the past, which only contributes to the argument that this script and direction were atrocious. The delivery on the already poor lines brought me out of the experience every time someone opened there mouth. But the worst part is most of the humans featured in this film didn't even need to exist. The ""new guys"" that were brought in to isolate the hack the stupid monkey terminator (I'll come back to him later) were some of the stiffest acting of this year, and they didn't even need to be there. At all.<br/><br/>The absolute worst aspect of the movie was the monkey/boom box transformer. Or so they made him to be. That was no transformer. It was written and animated like a bad droid from Episode 1, and I don't see how anyone could have been fooled by the disguise. His part in the story was far too crucial, and his on-screen time compared to characters Optimus Prime and Megatron was so incredibly disappointing, I thought George Lucas was a pinch director for much of the movie.<br/><br/>About the only sight-gag I found to be humorous was a dangling decoration in Bumblebee's car saying ""Bee-otch"". The humor was shallow, and at it's best got me chuckling.<br/><br/>It was such a relief after an hour, to see the first real battle, and I was so engaged the moment it happened. The first fight was between Bumblebee as a Camaro, and Barricade as a police interceptor. Though it kind of bothered me that he had such a tricked-out police car, really, it didn't matter. This fight was cool, and actually had worth to it. Likewise, the last 20 minutes of the movie were engaging, and the human aspect went from bad to just okay (a sequence between LaBeouf and Fox was very out-of-no where, but it was totally a Bay moment). When the film's subjects, transformers, were on screen, it was the right movie. Too bad they were only on for about 10% of the time...<br/><br/>Honestly, this is the first movie I have ever wanted to walk out in. I didn't care about the story at all, after about 10 minutes, I couldn't even care about sticking around for the action, if it ever came. I also seem to be the only one who feels this way, and I am deeply saddened to all who were brainwashed by Michael Bay and his stranglehold. Please listen to reason, and wait for this to rent. When you only have to spend about a dollar a piece on the thing.<br/><br/>A final note, this is not a kids movie, like the new TMNT. If you are looking for a kids movie, turn back now. The story is too convoluted, the action is few and far between, and the subject matter and action are just plain not suited for children."

","When the father of the teenager Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) gives an old Camaro to him, he has a chance to give a ride to his schoolmate Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) and participate of an ancient war of robots on planet Earth. His car is actually the Autobot Bumblebee, leaded by Optimus Prime, and they are in war against the evil Deceptions, leaded by Megatron. Both races are seeking the cube Allspark with opposite intentions: the Autobots intend to protect the human beings, while the Deceptions want to destroy them.<br/><br/>I found ""Transformers"" a very disappointing movie. With a huge budget, full of special effects, the shallow story is very weak, the screenplay is awful and the scenes supposed to be funny are indeed very silly. There are characters and scenes simply ridiculous, like for example the hacker that Sam calls ""friend"", with the most stupid attitudes and behavior. The robots are very similar and it is difficult to identify who is good and who is evil. The director seems to believe that explosions plus explosions is equal to a good movie, but it is not. My vote is six.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Transformers"""
"Silent_Abstraction","Null","10","22","6 August 2007"," Does the entertainment outweigh the neural damage?
","I'm a person who likes bad movies. I like good movies, too, but I often like the bad ones better. Why is that, silly me? Because they're entertaining. Self-building truck-shaped giant robots from outer space? Searching for some cuboid McGuffin to save the world? Fighting robots, exploding robots, cursing robots, robots urinating motor oil on people? Bring 'em on. But please make sure that I will have a good time with them.<br/><br/>Which is exactly what I didn't have with ""Transformers"". Maybe I'm getting too old for the kids' stuff, or I need to adjust my Ritalin level. But watching this was very much unlike watching a popcorn movie, it was more like having my brain replaced by popcorn, by people who happily assume that I don't have much of a brain to begin with.<br/><br/>The major problem is not that the movie is so heartbreakingly dumb. (Dumb in a way that makes you slap your head at times). Indeed, some scenes are so inane that the next ""Scary Movie"" film will have a hard time spoofing them (the scene where the two photos are compared -- indescribable; and the Camaro has its own in-built car wash?). The major problem for me was that it was all so annoying. The action pieces were visually uninterpretable, the robots were moving too fast for my poor visual cortex, the explosions didn't stop before the next ones started. It was simply too much for that 35-year-old brain of mine.<br/><br/>So even as an audiovisual trip, is it even entertaining? At least not for me. There was no story except for the absolute necessary, the bleached-out skeleton of a plot. There were endless military clichés. There were Jon Voight and John Turturro embarrassing themselves. There was no humor except the unintentional sort (the other one didn't work). The action scenes were undramatic and uninvolving. The love story was generic and flat. Worst: There's real and present danger of a sequel.<br/><br/>Looking at the professional reviews on ""Rotten Tomatoes"", I'm surprised that many critics treat this cinematic bomb so tenderly. Maybe it was too expensive to have an independent press?"

The autobots were pathetic. Some of the more noble of the autobots were reduced to little more than clowns and cannon fodder. I went hoping to see a movie about Transformers but what I got was a movie about people with a few robots thrown in. Words cannot express my dislike for Michael Bay.

"basrutten","4","7","14","8 January 2008"," Just because it's about toys doesn't mean it has to be this kiddy
","Good action movies in my opinion have three things: good action (duh), great characters, and great humor. ""Transformers"", Michael Bay's latest lackluster effort, does a decent job in the action department but fails miserably at the other two aspects.<br/><br/>I say ""decent"" job for in all honesty the action here is competent, but nothing you haven't seen before. The transformers themselves look nice, and the explosions even look very nice (explosions are probably the one thing Michael Bay is really good at), but the action sequences are all by the numbers.<br/><br/>Also, the characters are so poorly worked out that it's hard to care about them at all, and it's painfully obvious any way that this movie is gonna play it perfectly safe and not kill of any main characters. These factors combined kill any suspense there might have been, reducing most of the action to just pretty pictures that leave you totally cold.<br/><br/>Everything else about this movie is pretty much bogus too. First, there are the constant attempts at humor. Humor is an essential element of an action movie, but the jokes here are so lame that they probably won't even make a ten year old smile.<br/><br/>Secondly, there's the horrible dialog. Just about every line that is not a failed attempt at humor is some kind of overblown hollow heroic phrase or something that's perfectly obvious (""Look, here comes the tank decepticon again"").<br/><br/>Oh, and since this is a Michael Bay movie, it's also full or false sentiment and bombast. Whenever something remotely dramatic or meaningful happens, everything goes to slow motion and the music swells to sickening levels. Meanwhile, the audience does not care one way or another.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a movie with plenty of explosions that lacks any kind of heart, humor, or wit. Look no further. If you actually want something you can enjoy for 2 hours and 15 minutes, stay way clear.<br/><br/>** out of *****"
"Kefrif","4","7","14","9 October 2007"," Nope.
","This a film where the parts are not worth the sum of the whole. You don't see the Autobots until 1hr. into the film. It has a whole host of highly unnecessary sub plots, and the acting is atrocious on almost all counts (except for Michael O Neill who is quite believable, but seems to be in another film altogether). Shia Laboeuf comes off as a dumb version of Woody Allen's neurotic character, what with the stuttering and panicking. The character doesn't fit at all, although I'm sure he tried.<br/><br/>There are plot holes and character deficiencies the size of meteors. The robots are outside the Witwicky residence 5 ft through open windows away from people. No one hears them talking. It turns from day to night in the beginning battle in about 20 seconds. The defence and phone network for the entire planet is knocked out, which would cause panic - yet nothing is mentioned. Where do the robots get their ammunition from? I am a kid who grew up with the Transformers in the 1980's, and from then until now have also been a way great movie fan. This film betrays the both of my childhood joys. I don't mind the fact that the robots were changed for the movie. Their designs are easily the best thing about the film. I don't even think Michael Bay is entirely to blame for this fiasco. Its the guys who wrote it. The subject has a fully formed mythology that could have easily benefited from a proper retelling - instead we are given a teen picture with no cohesive narrative, and no sympathetic characters...<br/><br/>Nope - this is a screw up and no mistake. I would hold out hopes for Transformers 2, but I have my doubts unless someone pulls a Godfather style sequel to this dirge. Giving it 2 more stars than it desrves because its Transformers. And regardless of this they were the most inventive toy ever created."

However I went along hoping to be surprised by something new....I wasn't. The first 15 minutes is quite good with the attack on the air base and the soldiers and Pentagon trying to figure out what these hostile robots are all about.<br/><br/>However things go all downhill from there. The final 2 plus hours boil down into geeky boy trying to get laid by impressing tarty girl (who is obviously in the film far more for her look than her acting ability) getting caught up in some robot war simply because his great grandfather accidentally discovered one of these things in the antarctic ages ago.Toss in a few fed guys who don't know who's side they are on, a few soldiers who are always in the wrong place at the wrong time, and of course the cute geeky computer nerd girl and a fat black guy for comic relief and you have one hell of a rotten film.<br/><br/>The cgi was OK but to be honest since the last hour of the film is all shot at break neck speed and very close to the action I coudn't tell the bad bots from the good ones. Anyway after a very looooong battle sequence the goodies win for no particular reason, the geeky guy gets the tarty girl and all the others simply vanish never to be seen again.<br/><br/>A great film if you are 15 with raging hormones and only think about hot cars and girls, otherwise don't bother."

"kctotal","9","5","9","3 August 2007"," Action, Humour.......and More Action
","Transformers Finally a non-sequel!!! It's not that this year's sequels weren't good, but you have to admit that the vast number of franchises was getting stale. In comes Transformers with as much hype to fill in the entire world's theatres, and whilst this film is not for girls, it is one hell of a ride for fans of the original animated series and even to those who didn't know who the hell Meagatron was!<br/><br/>In Qatar the American military forces, are attacked by a mysterious and unknown force, which leaves many dead with the sole exceptions of Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and his team. Meanwhile, back in the ""normal"" world, luckless Sam gets his first car, which incidentally turns out to be an autobot with the name Bumblebee. Eager to impress high-school hottie Mikela, Sam offers her a ride, but when things start to go wrong and Sam is attacked by one of the Deceptions, Sam and Mikela must put aside their prejudices and work alongside the Autobots led by the legendary Optimus Prime in an epic battle against the Deceptions under the commands of the menacing Megatron.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting any superb acting turns from this movie, but I was surprised to find that the film sported many good performances. Shia LeBeouf is an excellent choice for the role of Sam WitWicky, giving a performance bustling with charisma and crackling with energy. He has been rightly tagged as Hollywood's next big thing! Megan Fox is a newcomer, but even though when she was on screen, her acting skills were the last thing I was thinking about. Still, her character is ruddy brilliant, and Michael Bay gad already used this technique with Scalett Johannsen on The Island. Josh Duhamel isn't bad either, even though his problems and inner conflict are hardly hinted at. Jon Voigt's character is unnecessary and is in my opinion miscast as his role should have gone to a younger, more menacing actor. But overall, this is a very good haul, with the young leads obviously standing out.<br/><br/>The screenplay is decent, and the dialogue is classic Michael Bay. What bothers me is that when important topics are raised these are drained by an explosion or any other form of noisy distraction. Pity though! Also the film is unbelievably humorous, and whilst most of its humour is dark, the jokes centre on awkwardness and embarrassment instead of the usual slapstick humour. The film also goes around the usual boy meets girl fun, and this played quite well, with LeBeouf easily making us sympathize with him.<br/><br/>The special effects are unprecedented, and this is because it is much more difficult to use special effects with robots which are huge and made up of a good many things, than with let's say Spiderman. The effects are put to good use, but they never take complete control. Megatron is obviously the film's tour-de-force and the Autobots are similarly good, even though the voice acting could've been far better. Still, their ridiculousness had me roaring with laughter! The final battle is epic, but it's a little to.busyto truly stand out. Mini battles happen within the big battle which causes confusion.<br/><br/>Verdict If treated as a comedy, this film will go down in film history books, as an action movie, it is the mother of all, but as the best film of the year, it needs more drama to go down with the brilliant humour and action."

"raymondolicious","10","5","9","30 July 2007"," Are all the critics fans of the original?
","From reading through these reviews, the guys or girls (pretty sure they're guys? seem to be more miffed about the fact that back story and original characters weren't stuck to, and that the 'writers' are at fault and therefore this is a bad film. But this isn't a bad film! It's a great summer blockbuster, exactly what it was written to be and it has been produced, directed and marketed in exactly the same way.<br/><br/>However, most people when they go to the cinema, like myself, go there to enjoy what they are seeing, not to sit there thinking ""well this is a bit like Michael Bay's other films..."" - I'm by no means a fan of Michal Bay, not by a long shot. I could even criticise him for gratuitous shots of the military in action, however I found all of that quite interesting and admittedly a little bit scary. I'm referring to the processes of communication that go from 'order' to 'action' that were shown during the military involvement not the more Top-Gun esquire shots of men running to fighter jets in slow motion.<br/><br/>I think it's quite clear from the trailers that the film isn't a dark science fiction piece, a commentary on the fear of technology in a dark futuristic utopia. It's grounding is in the action, the battle, and the destruction potentially at stake. I'm so pleased I didn't read any reviews before seeing the film, and I advise anyone else, as objectively as possible as I'm not a huge fan of the franchise and never was, to go and see the film and make your own opinion. I haven't been that entertained in a cinema screen since 1999, with the visual treat that was 'the Matrix.' The characters are faultless as they make up much of the plot, and their interventions make it more interesting, but I'm not going to say too much on that because it depends on what films you usually go and see, but I didn't see too many clichés and there weren't moments where you find yourself cringing at how corny it was, if anything there are moments that will probably surprise you, and keep you hooked throughout the duration. There was just enough development of the robots on both sides that meant it wasn't exhaustive or too much for those who aren't fans of the original franchise to keep up.<br/><br/>Oh and anyone who criticises the graphics or visuals of the film, are talking rubbish. Like I say... Transformers is the next revolution akin to how the Matrix changed things before the new century. For fans or critics who are complaining because they are nit-picking about human involvement during the fighting, or because of sub-plots, or humorous elements that weren't instigated by the robots... try and think of the film as a disaster movie, except it's not a natural disaster per Se, it's giant robot aliens who are having a big fight here on Earth. Had they been fighting anywhere else would it be as entertaining? No, it would not, and no one would care unless they were a fan of the original and sadly, in terms of how many people the makers want to see the film, they're trying to branch out to people like me, in the majority, who no doubt will enjoy it too!"

I suppose they have updated some of the vehicles to be more modern, after all this film is being paired with massive marketing and merchandising schemes which will be aimed at today's young kids and teens. The film itself was excellent. The opening sequence is a blinder and there is somewhat of a wait to see Prime, which in my opinion is the main Transformer. The special effects are slick and very impressive. The transformers transforming are great to watch ( just like the Citroen ads)but I do think they should have included the transforming noise from the original cartoon! Prime sounds like the original, which is good, and they have kept some of the original phrases, like, ""Autobots move out!""... although I was a bit disappointed not to hear, ""Autobots Transform!"". The storyline is pretty good. It is kept simple and easy to follow which is good as the film isn't one that is supposed to provoke much thought, but to be action packed and entertaining - which it definitely is. They have included a certain element of humour, which surprisingly goes down very well as the timing is spot on. If you grew up with the cartoon I think you will really enjoy this adaptation, even though it slightly strays from the original characters, and I think todays kids will love this too. I would definitely recommend it. This will undoubtedly be my favourite film of the year."

","I'm a Transformers fan from way back. That immediately puts me in an awkward position for judging the new film - no matter what, I'm going to hold it up against the almost mythic standard of the old series as seen through the eyes of an adoring child. But considering that the film was obviously meant to cash in on that glassy-eyed nostalgia, I think it's a fair trade.<br/><br/>So here we go. The Transformers did not, as feared, look hideously deranged or disfigured. They weren't quite the boxy and familiar-faced robots of memory, but they were mostly recognizable. Colours were toned down, which is good in that some Transformers had some truly hideous combinations, but also bad in that it meant I often had to hazard vague guesses as to who was doing what. The Decepticons were very non-entity villains, which was disappointing, and I often found myself confusedly scratching my head and wondering where Starscream's wealth of personality was.<br/><br/>The biggest strike against the film was probably the amount of time spent with the 'fleshlings'. It wasn't even done very coherently. Scenes would change with all the fluidity of an unexpected bus stop, or else drag on to the point where I found myself wishing an Autobot would accidentally trip and squish them all. I felt like I was being ripped off during those scenes - after all, I didn't fork out my cash to watch an awkward teenage romance, a stirring tale about the bond between American soldiers, or some dull government drama. I paid to see the giant robots! And not only see them (or the occasional glimpse of them between the indecipherable transformation scenes and the large explosions) but to hear them, too. One of the appeals of Transformers in my opinion was that it didn't star the humans. This movie has it pretty much reversed.<br/><br/>Still, that's not to say that the movie was all bad. A lot of it was helped along by having Optimus' original voice actor, and some things, like Bumblebee's personality, were quite accurate. The special effects and explosions were cool, but they mostly are these days, so that doesn't really count for much with me anymore. When I heard how much time they spent on getting the complicated new designs for the Autobots and Decepticons to transform, I found myself wondering why they didn't just go with something simpler that would have allowed for more screen-time with them. It's not like their efforts yielded the result of more spectacular transformations. The sequences were almost impossible to decipher, and frankly the new designs had an exposed look to them that made me think they'd all run out half-dressed.<br/><br/>There are a few factors that stand in the movie's favor. Seeing the Autobots in live-action was very cool, and the Decepticons were appropriately frightening in their aggressiveness and disregard for human life. I found myself drinking in the scenes that actually did contain Transformers, and while most of the jokes were cheesy, there were a few funny moments that had me genuinely amused. The film managed to evoke my worry for the well-being of its non-human stars, and there was nothing particularly offensive to old-time fans. I give it a 5/10, half points for having cool Transformers but very annoying humans."

Definitely a must see. Lots of great moments and funny lines. The actors did a wonderful job except for Megan Fox...she just seemed like she was there taking up space and to look good which of course she did. Although she did redeem herself a bit in one sequence w/ Bumble Bee...I was very happy to see that. I know all the males in the room were oogling her.

I am so happy after all of the disappointing summer movies we've had so far (Pirates 3, Spiderman 3) that they finally gave us a good one. This movie is even better than the trailer makes it out to be! <br/><br/>I know there are a small minority of people who are bashing this film for being cheesy and having lame dialogue, but give me a break! Its a summer action flick! Almost every summer blockbuster is like that. The summer movies are the ones that we shut off our brains and get blown away by the special effects and hardcore action. Michael Bay has never really been one for sophisticated dialogue (but it doesn't matter!) and as far as the cheese factor goes... IT WAS MADE FROM A SERIES OF CHILDREN'S TOYS!!! What did you expect!? These movies aren't about academy awards! Transformers is straight up entertaining. Which is what summer blockbusters are all about. It has great action throughout and offers plenty of laughs. Thankfully, it doesn't take itself too seriously, the people who made Transformers knew it was a cheesy idea and they had fun with it. This is the movie of the summer that you can't miss!!! <br/><br/>10 out of 10!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br/><br/>(The new Die Hard movie was really good too, but Transformers is definitely better)"

","This is what a fun, entertaining, over-the-top, two hours (2:24) at the movies should be like. Bombastic? Yes. Cheesy? Of course. This movie is based on a cartoon and a bunch of toys - it's FUN. Shia La Beouf is great. The rest of the cast is very good. Who cares about the goofs (they are always fun to detect anyways). The soundtrack is powerful, and the rest of the audio is superb. The humor is lighthearted, and yet the battle scenes are wicked. Every time the robots transform I could hear gasps from the audience. The sound they make during their transforming has elements from the cartoon, just like the transporters in the Star Trek movies resembled the TV Series. Very cool. See it. Enjoy it. Laugh and cheer with it."

","This movie is AWESOME! By far the Best Movie I have seen in a long time..Everything I would expect, except for a few small pieces, but seeing as though it has already been approved for a sequel...that means Michael Bay has a chance to redeem himself with the small things (i.e. noise when transforming, more characters, more scenes for the Decepticons) I just knew I was gonna see, Starscream and SOUNDWAVE..those were Megatrons Closest people...Maybe next time...<br/><br/>Starscream did have a sweet scene, short but it was sweet in his battle in the air where he was transforming in the air...that was sweet...the highway scene with Prime was sweet too...I forgot all about his Flaming Sword! However, I have read tons of great reviews, and I concur with all of them..I am a bit perplexed by the Negative ones though because If i recall the cartoon, there were no Oscar performances..the acting was bad...and it was all about the Transformers battling each other with the humans helping the Autobots and the cartoon also had its comedy relief in Jazz, the humans and others...it seemed exactly as i remember it...I am not sure what the harsh critics were expecting but clearly, they had unrealistic expectations...I can honestly say that I had almost every transformer my parents could afford to get me in my youth and i had A LOT! I am Very Avid follower, even when they tried to bring it back on Cartoon Network in the US. I was overly Satisfied with the movie..makes you feel good all over again!!!

One of my sons has pass away a few years ago and the movie brought back fond memories of him.

Whats not very nice that the officers take Sam Witwicky and her girl friend Mikaela Banes. Whats stupid when some woman sitting on a chair was holding her middle finger up.

","This is literally one of the best movies I have ever seen. I was skeptical when the initial announcement to produce this movie was made, and I was especially skeptical with all the hype surrounding the release. However, this is one of the few cases where the movie not only lives up to the hype, but surpasses it. Even non-transformer fans will enjoy this movie. I was especially impressed with the special effects. It really seemed like there were robots acting alongside the actors and actresses. Michael Bay did a great job in conveying emotion into all of the characters in their mannerisms and appearance. You bonded with the Autobots and feared the Decepticons."
"davulture","10","5","9","5 July 2007"," Probably the Best Summer Movie So Far
","Let me start off by saying I personally had a good time watching Transformers but I can understand why people hate the movie. Either your a fan of the show or you pretty much don't get it. The story is about a boy named Sam Witwicky who gets an old battered car from a car dealership that turns out to be an Alien. Now there are two types of aliens the Autobots and Decepticons, The Autobots are good and are looking for a box that holds the key to war and try to destroy it while the Decepticons try use the box to gain more power. Along this story we get to see the famous characters Optimus Prime and Megatron. The fight sequences are surreal and the animation is as close as possible to bringing the cartoon to life. The film did feel like a version of Independence Day but the mind-blowing action make it a must see. This movie isn't trying to be Citizen Kane. In a summer with movies that feel to succeed, Transformers offers something new. If you can't stand traces of comedy, constant transformations, and of course fast paced action then this isn't the movie for you. Otherwise you'll definitely enjoy it."

Yes, the effects are great, but frankly, if you've seen the preview or even a commercial for this movie, then you've seen the best part. This movie was a waste of however many millions of dollars it took to make it, a waste of a decent young actor (Shia Labeouf), a waste of decent special effects and the fact that the greatest film-maker of all time (Spielberg - NOT Michael Bay) is attached to this film in any way is a tragedy.

"EnderEd","4","8","17","8 July 2007"," I was bored
","This is a great example of a film that suffered at the editor's hands. They could have cut out about 45 minutes and made this a 7 star film. The last half hour, all that ran through my head was, ""C'mon already."" Special effects-- Yes, there are plenty. But the transformations of the transformers, as well as the fight scenes, are all blurred and framed with jittery or unsee-able distances. By the time you see the third transform, you've seen them all. The best scenes, IMO, happened in the first 1/2 hour.<br/><br/>Characterization-- For the most part, tedious. You have Hollywood's versions of the typical hormone-packed high school dweeb trying to win the hot chick (played by Shia LaBeouf with no little amount of over-acting). You have his clueless, manipulable, imbecile parents who care mostly about their lawn. You have high ranking befuddled government officials (although Jon Voight does the part as much justice as can be done). You have a super-secret service contingency, filled with unlikeable, smarmy characters (headed by John Turturro who is the most mis-cast in all this movie). On the positive side, Duhamel does a good job maintaining a sense of coherency representing the US fighting soldiers. The highlight was Bernie Mac's cameo as a used-car salesman.<br/><br/>Plot-- Plenty of it, with good aliens vs evil aliens, and humans doing their best to help out (although I couldn't help but feel it would have gone better for the good guys if the humans just got out of the way). You can pretty much guess what's going to happen after the first 15 minutes, so you're left to just sit there and watch it unravel, through the thin dialog and in-your-face effects.<br/><br/>All in all, got a few smiles and chuckles, but unlike War of the Worlds, I couldn't wait for this film to finally end."

","Top 10 reasons to hate this movie:<br/><br/>1. Too much product placement. But I must digress; the Transformers going into Warrior-Mode (Bipedal movement) broke up the 2 hour-long car commercial.<br/><br/>2. Poor acting. ""THIS IS A DEFCON-5 SITUATION!"" ""You need to move past Fourier transforms and start thinking quantum mechanics."" ""What's crackin', little bitches?"" <br/><br/>3. I was promised good Transformer character development and continuity with G1 and beyond. Nope. Bumblebee was supposed to die. He was cute, cuddly, and pathetic, but he never died. Optimus Prime was supposed to die. Scorponok was portrayed as a sneaky, insect-like, insidious alien. 20 years of transformer character and background story chucked out the window.<br/><br/>4. The only decepticon that seemed truly evil was Megatron. The decepticons were purely tools for moving along the plot; they were bereft of any true evil. <br/><br/>5. The Transformers look terrible. ""Realism"" isn't a valid excuse as they look like a costumed man covered in adhesive rolled around in a junkyard as metal scraps stuck to him. They are too cluttered. Optimus Prime has eyelids. Why?<br/><br/>6. Armageddon music in random scenes. WTF?<br/><br/>7. Optimus gets his ass handed to him by Megatron. Massive letdown to audiences.<br/><br/>8. Hugo Weaving was the voice of megatron. But he wasn't. It was covered by bass here, treble there, digital modification and normalizing. What was left was a voice that modulated, but lost all emotion, whether evil or infuriated. See: V for Vendetta. See also: The Matrix.<br/><br/>9. Human able to single-handedly bring down Decepticon with the use of small-arms. This notion is silly. <br/><br/>10. Megatron appearing to be a mass of twisted aluminum foil that turns into a random alien jet. What about a big cannon? Is that just not cool enough?<br/><br/>The original Transformers story was excellent, as characters were developed properly, there was good focus on each transformer and there was a wealth of comedy, tragedy, betrayal, and action. This movie does not offer any of this, besides a little comedy and too much action.<br/><br/>Some scenes were rather enjoyable, such as Starscream's dogfight with earth pilots, the scene with the mountain dew bot (the Cadillac SUV was a little over the top), the final fight sequence. <br/><br/>Its a good movie if you have no love for G1 and just want to see some brainless violence and explosions. If you liked Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, and The Rock, this movie deliver on the same mediocre level. <br/><br/>I hate you, Michael Bay."

The editor must have been drunk, the movie skips from unconnected scene to unconnected scene. There are so many holes in the story line I gave up on the story and just decided to watch the animation.

","I really didn't expect too much, I mean, watching the cartoon series today makes me cringe. But boy is 'Transformers' one bad movie.<br/><br/>Action flicks seldom care about good stories, plots and screenplay. But most action flicks don't pretend to. This one, however, appears to have been four hours long, before they cut it to two and a half. It introduces about three dozen characters and just as many mini subplots, all of which are unnecessary, meaningless and stupid. Then they throw in so many bad clichés, I didn't know if it was a really bad satire or just reeeeeeaaaaalllly bad. The characters are two dimensional and the girls were obviously picked for looks alone.<br/><br/>The only thing the movie could have going for it, would be the action. But no, not really, no. Visual and Special effects have reached the point of near perfection a couple of years ago, and between 'The Matrix' and 'The Lord of the Rings' there's not much left to impress by simply rendering it and showing off the with the coding work of a couple of nerds. The direction of the action is substandard. Most of it is simply having things blow up or chases. Nothing we haven't seen better in so many movies before.<br/><br/>So with a sh*tty screenplay and boring action, the only thing that movie has going for it, is the acting of Shia what's his name. I really liked him, I think he's gonna be entertaining in lots of better movies yet to come."

","OK, I grew up with Transformers and G.I. Joe like many of you who have come here after having seen the movie or checking to see what others say about it. I was a HUGE fan of the series in the 80's and collected many of the figures (which I wish I still had so I could sell em on Ebay) Anyways, this movie didn't do it for me at all. So many plot holes, bad acting by the ""hot chick"", visual inconsistencies, and more. Ack !! I knew it was going to be a bit cheesy but, for the love of God, come on !! Robots from outer space coming to Earth and then going on a mission to track down a kid from Ebay ???? I can take a lot but that is just over the top for me even for a Bay movie. The special effects were pretty decent (though they did realize speed of motion allows you to skimp on some real detail) which is why I gave it the 4 out of 10 vote but the plot was just not there. I know I know, someone will undoubtedly say ""Like you could write a better one"" so I say, yes, I could. How about the Decepticons try and take over Cybertron, fail and decide to come to Earth to create their own planet... the Autobots take chase, follow them here, and try to stop them from destroying the humans and creating a Decepticon utopia. Good enough ? Maybe not but much better than what we were handed which was little more than a 2 hour long car commercial / Ebay promo.

"grondiespam","3","33","96","5 July 2007"," If a good action movie is football, Transformers is flag football.
","I knew that Transformers would be trite and hammy, that's OK. What I didn't know is that it would be an embarrassing caricature of everything bad we've come to expect from a Michael Bay film. I was ready to walk out after about 30 minutes because it became abundantly clear that the story wouldn't build up any steam until the last possible moment. Sure enough, the movie doesn't get on with business until the 90 minute mark.<br/><br/>The unsteady pacing reminded me of Jurassic Park. There's a dumb MacGuffin (in this case, a powerful cube) that keeps everybody stumbling around, slack jawed. Every 15 minutes or so a set brief piece jumps out of the bushes to shock the audience, then things shift back into 1st gear.<br/><br/>It's a frustrating movie to watch. The robots are amazing, but they barely have screen time that doesn't involve them fighting or pussy-footing around whatever the humans are up to. We never really care about what motivates the Autobots, because they don't share it with us. They just jump from one crisis to the next, all the while trying to go undetected like Mr. Snuffalopogus. Nothing ever makes a lick of sense, the action is impossible to follow, and after a while you just give up and stare blankly while people and robots scramble around trying to accomplish seemingly arbitrary tasks that change from minute to minute.<br/><br/>If this movie was directed by Paul Verhoeven (Robocop, Starship Troopers, Basic Instinct) we would have had delightfully one-dimensional charters taking a back seat to robots kicking the crap out of each other. Instead we get Michael Bay's melodramatic ""Sweet Valley High Marine Corps"" vision of the world which attempts to cheaply pull on our heartstrings at every given opportunity wile at the same time cramming in jillions of set pieces featuring exploding explosions and non sequiturs that can be explained away by jerky camera work.<br/><br/>With the amazing production design you'd think that it would have been easy to make Transformers into good popcorn fun. Instead it fees like work. The set pieces are clumsy, and never build to a point where we feel any sense of danger or tension. If a good action movie is football, Transformers is flag football."

","The US secretary of defence calls together all experts at his disposal to try and decode a signal that will reveal who just wiped out a military base in Qatar in an attempt to hack into the central computer network. Had they known that a small group of survivors had made it out led by Captain Lennox, they would have known that the attack was a helicopter that changed into a robot and used devastating weapons to destroy everything. Meanwhile, back in the US, nobody officially knows anything so the fact that high school student Sam Witwicky believes his second hand car has a mind of its own, gets him nothing but trouble. But could he be a bigger piece in the puzzle than anyone knows?<br/><br/>In the middle of a disappointing summer for blockbusters, I must admit that Transformers went from being one I was planning to see, to become yet another film that I had no desire to rush to be disappointed by. However my girlfriend took me along and I suppose it helped that really nothing about the film suggested that I should expect anything from it. With this in mind I found it mildly entertaining in a simple-minded and noisy way, but this is very different from saying it is a ""good"" film.<br/><br/>I sort of fall in a strange place in regards viewing the film because technically I should be a massive fan and very touchy over the details. I loved the toys as a child and got the weekly comic until it finished in the UK at issue 300-something but then on the other hand I really have few affectionate memories of them (and all the possessions are gone!). To a point I did think ""well, that's wrong"" here and there but really I didn't care that much. What bothered me more were the countless weaknesses in areas I would associate with storytelling and film-making rather than the details of a fictional race of robots. First I suppose I should give credit to the effects, because this is what the film is all about. They are excellent and they were so convincingly real that I never found myself looking for the joins. The scale of them does mean it all gets a bit frantic at times and too often I lost track of what was happening.<br/><br/>Too often though, the action didn't engage because I just didn't really care about the characters  human or not. This problem is nothing that any extra money spent on effects can solve because it comes from the writing, the acting and the total delivery of the film; I am finding it more and more  too many films are doing whatever effects allow them, rather than letting the film dictate the effects to be used. Anyway, the script is full of clunky dialogue and has all the narrative logic of a drunken argument after closing time. It is best not to ask too much about the importance of Witwicky etc because it has all the strength of wet tissue paper, obviously hoping that action will help cover up all the cracks.<br/><br/>The dialogue is just as poor and nobody really comes off talking like a normal person. Of course with such a lacklustre collection of performances, it doesn't really matter so much what words they have to say. LaBeouf is so-so while Fox has a good body and a very impressive tan  neither of them would make me see one of her films again but I suppose pretty young actresses will never want for work (well, so long as everything is as tight as it is at age 21 I guess). Duhamel is bland and even Tyrese lacks spark. Voight and Turturro are both weak and seem even worse due to both of them having been much better than this. The voice work from Cullen, Ryan and others is a nice touch and mostly avoids being corny. The actors aren't helped by the messy direction from Bay. On one hand he is delivering a silly comedy, on the other it is an all-out action movie with a budget that could fund a small country. The comedy is more daft than funny and the romance side is just plain dumb. Action is delivered with a typical lack of restraint and lack of understanding for what makes engaging action  so instead we get the usual grand music and sweeping camera shots.<br/><br/>Overall then, the film has loads of noise and lots of money right up there on the screen.

","I remember the cartoons from the 80's and they were not particularly good compared to say Battle of the Planets. The cartoon was basically about shifting units of toys. The toys themselves looked pretty good. Like He-Man and others of that ilk it was all about being bright and flashy with nothing to engage young minds. I watched this film on Film4 at 9pm. Why they chose this time to show, what is basically a children's film is beyond me. <br/><br/>The humour was stale and dragged out and schoolboy level. I love action movies, but this was by the numbers Hollywood pap. Lots of bang for your buck, but no story to speak of. Dire. This movie sums up what is wrong with Hollywood action movies these days. Too much reliance on special effects and hardly any story. Now I know why people groan when they hear a movie is being directed by Michael Bay."

Megan Fox, protégé to the Jennifer Connelly School of Dull Acting, could have been a major factor in my dislike of this movie as well. This, of course, would come into conflict with her acting credentials of breasts, a revealing shirt and close-ups of said-breasts. Perhaps it was the pretentious score attempting to be poignant or sound like ""Batman Begins."" The stereotypical voice of Transformer ""Jazz"" could have provided ample reason for my utter dislike of this ""blockbuster.""

","As much as I enjoy Michael Bay and other action films, this truly disappointed me. <br/><br/>I work in Showcase Cinemas, and every person who went to see it told me it was 'Best Film Of The Year', '5 STARS!', 'Action Packed and Thrilling'. Whereas i must have sneezed out more interesting substances than this film. It left me bored and clock-watching for the first hour, and when they finally got round to the better bits I was yawning incessantly. The special effects were of a higher quality than most, but they could have been improved marginally. The camera-work was shaky and trembling to the point where I thought the cameraman must have been doing something else with his hands, and at points was so shaky you wouldn't be able to focus. Zooms in and out were overdone and again, shakier than a builders drill. Shia LaBeauf(?) is a good actor, and I have enjoyed his previous work/am looking forward to the future films, but the script writing was slow, predictable and wooden. His female co-star was blatantly hired for something OTHER than acting, as she was blank and emotionless throughout the film. Rating this film 3 out of ten is a good rating, as I have seen worse films, but I have seen thousands more that are much better.<br/><br/>I have had such abuse for my opinion from people, some of which haven't even SEEN the dire film yet. And my point was proved when I ran into one of them on my way to see Evan Almightly and they agreed wholeheartedly it is a atrocious film. It is grainy and shaky, with a severe disregard to the previous cartoons and the film to such an extent that it almost appeared to be MOCKING the earlier TF work and going NER NER NEE NER NER LOOK HOW S**T WE MADE YOU. It was almost satirical and ironic in that it was just so AWFUL. I truly can't see how anyone could enjoy this. <br/><br/>Oh, and the lubricating innuendos and the masturbation scenes? one three-year-old had a minor giggle. That was it. I mean, come on.

","I will not give you the plot as I am sure, by now most people know what it is about. Many critics have said that this film is only for teenage boys. That is correct as this film ticks all the right boxes. Hot chicks, computers, special effects, clanging metal, and of course the stars of the show : The Transformers. But strangely, this film gives you so much more than all of that once you have opened your mind. I went in not knowing what to expect. My boyfriend loved Transformers as a young boy so he was probably always going to love it. But for me, it was all new. Boy was I blown away. From the humour (yes,humour) courtesy of leading man/boy Shia Lebeouf's character Sam, to the absolutely mind boggling special effects and the well paced nature of the film. Transformers never leaves you bored, there is always something going on. And there are plenty of laughs along the way. Along with the obligatory lump in the throat moment courtesy of Spielberg. Each actor is perfectly cast, particularly Lebeouf (Sam Witwicky)and Jon Voight's portrayal of the Defence Secretary. But like I said before, the real stars are the Transformers. As Spielberg has done before with CGI animated characters, he made them not only real but almost human in their personality, humour and abilities. You can't help but love them all. I am purely talking about the Autobots of course. Because the Decepticons are bad guys! But even they are fantastic characters. My only moan is that they weren't shown more! The special effects are truly spectacular, so spectacular that at times, it is hard to keep up with what is going on, on screen. I will not spoil it for you but the way they transform from vehicles into a fully fledged combatant is absolutely awesome. So to sum up, don't listen to the critics, go the film with an open mind and go with the incentive to have a total couple of hours escapism. And you never know, you might just love it. And that goes for us girls too!"

Unfortunately everything else (with the exception of a couple of randomly used names) had changed.<br/><br/>The story was overly simplistic, ugly, and made no sense, and the Transformers were overly complicated, ugly, and made no sense.<br/><br/>The robots all look the same, and there was no character development, which is a pity because it was the individuality of the characters that made the original concept so enjoyable. <br/><br/>The design of the robots themselves bore no relation to the much loved look of the originals. One robot, who I think was meant to be Frenzy, looked more like some kind of stainless steel multiple egg whisking contraption than the stocky humanoid warrior of yore. There was also some kind of giant scorpion robot that I don't think was ever properly explained. Megatron, the iconic bucket headed leader of the Decepticons is now an indistinguishable metal mess.<br/><br/>There are so many human characters in this film that I think they're each given approximately 30 seconds of screen time to tell their stories. The soldiers? Pointless. The computer geeks? Unnecessary. The Secretary of Defence? Waste of a good actor. <br/><br/>A terrible film. Could've been good. But then, so could've Pearl Harbour."

I waited it out in the hope the expected climactic fight scenes might compensate, but then they were too fast and confused to make any sense - in many places it was impossible to distinguish the combatants. I'm not expecting realism in a film about transforming robots based on kids' toys, but that's not an excuse to get even the simplest basics wrong.<br/><br/>I didn't expect much after early reviews, but I was hoping to at least see a passable check-brain-at-door action movie. *sigh* I'll know better than to see another Michael Bay movie in future."

"pinkliz41","8","4","7","31 July 2007"," An ultimate visual and action packed thrill ride.
","A visual treat for everyone and very very enjoyable. Michael Bay has brought back cinema audiences down to an amazing action packed experience through his latest cinema flick Transformers. From executive producer Steven Spielberg, Transformers enters you into a whole new way of cinema, creating dazzling special effects, a cool-ice story line and normal and interesting down to earth characters.<br/><br/>Two types of robots: the autobots, led by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons who are led by the dark Megatron, both take their battle to earth in search of the Allspark, a mystical block in which anyone who possesses it would gain ultimate power. When on earth, the autobots and the decepticons all hide in every day form from cars and trucks to aeroplanes, all of which are in search for the Allspark. Soon after, the fate of the earth rests in the hands of young and chatty teenager Sam Witwicky(Shia LaBeouf) who's great grandfather found an ancient discovery in 1850, finding the decepticon leader Megatron frozen and captivated deep under the arctic circle. Soon after his discovery he is killed by Megatron through his awakening, and leaving the only key item of the whereabouts of the Allspark. Which is in Sam's great grandfathers glasses, which give the location of the infamous all spark.<br/><br/>This is just the background of the movie giving only minor spoilers instead of writing out the whole story which gives major spoilers for the people out their waiting to go and see it. Which i thoroughly recommend you do. With its sections of bright comedy and state of the art technology, bringing to life the huge CGI autobots and decepticons and blending a swell motivating story with its all round edge of your seat action. This to me making this movie a no doubt hit of the summer and certainly revving up a few Oscars- special effects and possibly in my opinion a best director statuette. But we will have to wait and see, but don't hinder or be put of by the idea that Transformers is a childish movie cause its not. Its simply AMAZING."

","Well, Shia LeBeouf has out-classed the majority of young male actors in Hollywood this year already. He brings a new lease of life to the classic film scenario 'Geek Gets Gorgeous Girl'. He begins the film as bit of a loser, he stumbles over his own words and basically just makes an ass of himself - but as the film progresses, he portrays (excellently I might add) his characters' (Sam Witwicky) maturation and adaption to the whole 'he has to save the world' situation.<br/><br/>Megan Fox, who plays Mikaela, is also outstanding as the hot, cheerleader type who we eventually learn #SPOILER# has a criminal record and is a pretty damn good car mechanic!<br/><br/>Some cameo appearances from Bernie Mac and Anthony Anderson also keep the films' one liners going while the CGI action scenes are giving you chance for a breather.... ....and on that note, the CGI (Computer Generated Imagery for all you oldies!) is absolutely outstanding. #SPOILER# The chase scene involving Starscream and Optimus Prime is just amazing, and, seeing as it IS Michael Bay, no doubt expensive!! The transforming of the robots is also quite fascinating (if not true to the original series), instead of just jerky motions and everything clicking into place, Bay went for a more fluid, almost liquid transition, which I think really worked. <br/><br/>And also, one more thing about the film, if you like GMC Motors cars....you won't be disappointed!! A definite must for anybody even remotely interested in Transformers / action movies / Michael Bay style explosions.<br/><br/>And it has also been left open for a sequel #SPOILER# 2 more have actually been signed on for by Shia and Megan, Bay has yet to agree saying he would love to do it and has 'huge ideas which he couldn't use for this film' (can you believe it was because of BUDGET COSTS!!!!). One of his ideas is an aircraft carrier transformer (???) and will probably introduce either Contructicons or Dinobots in the next film."
"Chris_Halpin","10","4","7","24 July 2007"," Brilliant.
","WARNING, SPOILERS CONTAINED WITHIN.<br/><br/>Very much in the spirit of the original, and my observation is that the prime audience is people like myself who grew up on the Transformers. Almost everyone left the cinema with big grins on their faces (the only ones who didn't were the few ladies who had clearly been dragged by their significant other), I haven't seen such a contented cinema audience in such a long time.<br/><br/>I was surprised at the amount of comedy in the film as well, but it was well done comedy that didn't detract from the overall experience. There was some excellent comedic timing so it all worked rather splendidly, and they knocked the comedy on the head at the mid point when things started to get serious.<br/><br/>The CGI and action scenes are simply superb, second to none. The US armed forces in particular seem to have worked very hard with the cast and crew to make this a memorable film as well, I don't think I recall an action movie with such a large military involvement. That said there isn't an overuse of CG and it never comes across and being ladled on too thickly like a lot of recent films.<br/><br/>The autobots are just delightful, they've been characterised wonderfully. There are a few snippets of dialogue that will make anyone who grew up on the Transformers have a nostalgic giggle of delight. Peter Cullen's voice acting really makes Prime stand head and shoulders above the rest, although Megatron is superbly voiced. Starscream is actually fairly menacing rather than being all whiny and nasal, one of the only critiques I can level is that some of the decepticons all seem a bit ""samey"", almost like Stormtrooper syndrome. When the action kicks off it's hard to tell who's who whereas the autobots are all bright and colourful so it's easy to tell.<br/><br/>The movie ties up most of it's loose ends but sets the scene for the next film. My only major concern is that those who haven't really got an inkling about Transformers will miss a lot of the ""feeling"" of the film, but then I suppose you pay your money and take your chances.<br/><br/>Incidentally there is a glimmer of a love story but it's all hinted at and never really gets pushed to center stage. Although the movie has to kick off by focusing on Sam the movie is all about the Transformers, they really do take center stage when the scene setting has all been done. No gripes from me to be honest. In fact the love story is quite often used as the butt of the jokes, which suits me fine. One of my main concerns was that there would be a major love story arc messing up the ass kickery.<br/><br/>As a film I'd give it a definite 8.5-9 / 10. Because of the subject matter I'll plump for 10/10 because I'm hopelessly biased."

Bumblebee plays a very important role in the movie and his character was cool. Michael Bay made you feel attached to Bumblebee.

Megatron was pure destruction and the fight between him and Prime was wicked...pure mayhem and destruction in the city. Oh yeah..look out for when any of the robots transform in mid-movement....damn awesome!!! I don't really root for bad guys..but honestly..Starscream and Blackout were just cool.

","This movie has been the most enjoyable movie of the year for me. I'm a fan of Transformers, but this movie is good for non-fans as well. It's not a Kurosawa or Scorsese movie, nor will it win best picture. But unlike a lot of movies, it's entertaining, surprisingly smart, and has memorable characters, and a better sense of comedy than most 'comedies'. As for the special effects, a lot has already been said about them, so I won't waste time praising them. What delighted me the most about this film was how the characters were treated as characters, not flashy effects, particularly Optimus Prime and Bumblebee. Probably the only complaint I have is the lack of dialog from most of the Decepticons. But then again considering the fact that they are war machines and have a shoot first and ask questions later policy, that can be somewhat forgiven given how the story developed. Hugo Weaving made a really menacing Megatron for the film, Bumblebee made my Ford-devoted girlfriend grow a soft spot for Camaros. The real icing on the cake for the film however is Peter Cullen returning to voice Optimus Prime for the first time since the original series. You can tell by his vocal performance that he was happy to be voicing the character again, and not just doing it for the money. I've seen this film 3 times in the first 3 weeks of release, and cannot wait for it to come out on DVD later this year. Far and away better than Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End, this film deserves to be the king of Summer 2007."

""The car picks the driver"", right? Optimus Prime and his team comes into play by meteor shower, and everyone's like WOWEEWA. The Decepticons were the first to be seen in a major battle in the beginning of the movie as an ""unidentifyed copter"" in a navy base.

It's definitely worth seeing on the big screen, but if you don't know anything about the Transformers story you may well end up confused. Having seen the cartoons as a kid I had an idea of what to expect, and I wasn't disappointed. The 2 and a half hour running time flew by, and I could happily have sat there for another hour. The robot characters aren't built up, they are very briefly introduced (bumblebee aside) before beating the crap out of each other, and I would have enjoyed a little more of a back story with them. <br/><br/>The special effects are fantastic, as I'm sure most have said, but I did think the story line was pants. I don't think this is a film to go and see if you want more than great action, explosions and fights. <br/><br/>I have one real problem, and that is the size of Sam's great grandfathers glasses. He must have had a HUGE head, the glasses are bigger than Sam when Prime picks them up! No wonder Sam's great grandfather died before he could tell anyone about Megatron, the weight of his head would have done him in!"

"kgbellinger24","9","4","7","18 July 2007"," Flashy Entertainment wins Summer 07
","After seeing the most anticipated movie of Summer 07, which was the corny Spiderman 3, and seeing Shrek 3 crumble, and Pirates getting lost in its subplots, the summer of 07 looked bleak when 4 months ago it had an all-star lineup. Then came the hilarious Knocked Up, a dismal and even cornier Fantastic Four 2, and a cliché Oceans 13. Then, it was time for the Independence Day Openers where Ratatouille cooked up a raving reviews. Finally, Transformers was released which exceeded my weary expectations and millions of others. <br/><br/>The movie has the most simple, easy and cliché plot set up where two robotic races fight on earth in search of a higher power that a human unknowingly possesses. The plot is stupid, but it worked. Summer blockbusters since the mid 90's have had gaping plot holes, lapses and corny dialogue that critics sensationalize and zoom in on in their reviews. One could argue, that in almost every summer blockbuster the people's grade always is higher than the critics. However, I am fan of most of those blockbuster movies, I even enjoyed Armageddon. The story again is childish, but thats its purpose and the movie has a keen awareness of that, which gives respect to the eclectic viewer. Some critics call this set up garbage, which it is but most viewers ironically find the beauty in that garbage. <br/><br/>The entire movie is pure, flashy, loud, intense entertainment. In fact, what critics seem dumbfounded on is, that is the contemporary definition of entertainment, loud, flashy, intense. (Think theme parks). Transformers is a roller coaster thrill ride that has immensely long lines of eager viewers waiting to experience it. Critics are baffled by the worlds taste of entertainment and disappointed in this, making them somewhat pompous but paradoxically sincere. The movie ultimately has no dull moments unlike in Pirates 3 where many were abundant. The movie's pacing is what keeps the viewer distracted from its corniness. The editing is top-notch where the viewer is given not many chances to see the action from a stationary pov. Though, I and many others like that flashy and quick editing, which takes away any dullness and sharpens the entertainment. This is in no way tailored for people who don't like frenetic shots, or quick in yo face visuals. This movie is tailored for thrill-seekers and it is one of the best. <br/><br/>Shia Labeouf, a fast and rising genuine actor, like many people have said is the glue of the film. His performance makes everything seem real, his performance pays respect to the audience which gives his character dignity. His relationship with his car, is the aspect of the movie that drew me in. A guys relationship with his car has its special overtones that are found in this movie. At the end of the movie I shockingly found myself caring for Bumblebee and Sam. This relationship in the movie subtlety brought partially profound human emotion to the table, something usually absent from blockbusters shallow and ""convenient"" emotion.<br/><br/>The Visual/Special/Sound/Bay effects polished and polished this movie, until it became a beacon for pure eye candy. The photo-realistic robots battling out amongst humans is breathtaking. The transformations are so cool. The Transformers themselves I found a little on the dumb side, but what i think many missed is that the Transformers are almost mirroring society. Though stereotypical it is what it is, most people are hypocrites when they so adamantly state stereotypes are bad, when they are typing every day. The Transformers, basically picked up and were influenced by the media and entertainment side of society according to the script. Very clever aspect of the screenplay. <br/><br/>Despite its shortcomings in plot, weak supporting human characters, the movie transforms these weaknesses into pure entertainment. This is the next Pirates. Hopefully its sequel wont parallel the Pirates sequels. <br/><br/>8.5/10 cause IMDb needs to get a better grading system."

","Okay, that was kinda lame...<br/><br/>Anywho, in my particular tradition of knowing that you already know what the movie is about I will spare you all yet another long and drawn out rehashing of what the movie was about and tell you all what I thought...<br/><br/>Besides, that's what the plot/synopsis link is for...<br/><br/>Moving on... I liked it... I liked a lot to tell you the truth.<br/><br/>Many people knock Michael Bay. I really don't understand why. Before I even knew who Bay was, I have enjoyed his movies...<br/><br/>See, when it comes to taking a cartoon and/or comic book and making it into a large scale movie there is a little thing that takes place called dramatic license. Way to many fan boys simply can't comprehend it, and usually whine about stupid things like ""Oh Megatron didn't look like Megatron"", or ""Soundwave didn't look like Soundwave"", or ""There was no All-Spark"", or ""Bumble-Bee wasn't a Camaro, and was a yellow bug instead"", and let's not forget ""it didn't even sound like Starscream"", or how about ""Devestator wasn't a tank, he was a Constructacon"".<br/><br/>Yeah, well robots don't bend like the do in cartoons either...<br/><br/>Some dramatic license can be bad, like the debacle that was Spider-Man III, but don't get me started on that one... At least not here...<br/><br/>Either way, to answer all those gripes, Megatron would have looked absolutely ridiculous as a handgun/cannon. When was the last time you actually saw/owned a boom box? The all spark didn't replace energon, it was something entirely different, and you have to admit a Volkswagen bug, at least in this case, has no menacing bad @$$ qualities as say a Chevy Camaro...<br/><br/>Although they did kinda over do the whole GMC plug...<br/><br/>A whiny tenor voiced Starscream would have been annoying in five minutes, and as far as Devesator went, well if you are really so upset over that then there really isn't much that can be said that isn't painfully obvious...<br/><br/>Okay, so how was the movie? The movie was good. It was of course action packed. Eye Candy GALORE! But then again for this type of movie, you don't really go for deep meaningful character development, or in depth philosophical enlightenment...<br/><br/>That's like going to see Star Wars for the dialog. No one in their right mind would want to see Star Wars for the god-awful dialogue that Lucas somehow managed to cobble together. You go because you want to see epic Light Saber Battles. Same difference here.<br/><br/>We want to see massive robots kicking the tar out of each other, making that cool ""eh ah oo"" sound that they make when they transform.<br/><br/>At times the camera's were a little too in your face. A little too fast perhaps as well. At times it was somewhat hard to comprehend the action; you knew it was going on, but at the same time it looked jumbled and messy.<br/><br/>Another critique I have, and this is going to sound odd, is the choice of voicing for Optimus Prime. I know, I know, using Peter Cullen because he was the original was like a dream of dampness to many, but at the same time Optimus sounded a bit old, and understandably so. I personally felt that Hugo Weaving who voiced Megatron would have sounded perfect for this Optimus Prime. But that's just me.<br/><br/>Megatron, in this movie almost acted, sounded, and just a little bit even looked more like Galvatron then anything else... Which was kinda cool.<br/><br/>Which in that case, what they could've done would have been to call up Leonard Nimoy (who still has a great voice, and sounds much as he did when he voiced Galvatron) and had him voice Megatron and have Hugo Weaving do Optimus. At least that way the bad guy would be gravely and hard while the good guy would be a bit more smoother... But again, nothing that would make me change my opinion of the film...<br/><br/>In the end, it was a pretty cool movie with lot's of pretty colors, and well done cgi, (and maybe perhaps some left over Episode One sound effects). Had a simple to the point story, and left me with happy thoughts...<br/><br/>...doom doom dooooom the end...<br/><br/>October 21, 2007<br/><br/>*The DVD Review*<br/><br/>So ""x"" amount of time has passed and the movie that was in theaters in now finally on film. i, having enjoyed this enough to actually buy it on DVD, decided that perhaps it would be an interesting thing to write about any other thoughts that may have come up in my second viewing of this film.<br/><br/>Movies often times seem different the second time around.<br/><br/>My general reaction is still pretty much the same. it's a pretty good flick. the gmc plugging was just as annoying, and the movies effects and action sequences were more then enough for me to forget about it.<br/><br/>I made a comment above that i would like to retract however, and that was about optimus prime sounding a bit too old. in my second viewing of this film i found nothing that sounded dated whatsoever. peter Cullen was a good choice to rehash optimus. i still think that they could have easily gotten away with using Leonard nimoy as mega tron, but perhaps that will be something for the sequels...<br/><br/>One last thing that i can say before i sign off, is that the choice of music was too distracting. battle for honor and humanity, by tomoyasu hotei (i think i spelled that right, but just in case the ""kill bill"" theme), and the linkin park end song are simply to popular to be used effectively for a movie. soundtracks ought to have original music for the movie, or at the very least music that isn't all that popular."
"boothstr96","10","4","7","13 July 2007"," MOre than meets the eye (fo real)
","Every single thing (except for one) about this movie.. was fantastic. From amazing action to stunning visuals, to ear splitting great sound, Trnasformers was the only summer blockbuster to live up to its hype. When you have movies like SP3 or Pirates that simply did not fully cut the deal, Transformers does. The only problem with this movie is the humor (in some parts). Some of the humor is great, but when there is a serious, basa**, action sequence and you have the robots shoutin out jokes, it makes the serious scenes seem a bit like a joke. Anyways, I have always been a big fan of Transformers, and i must say that this stuck to the cartoon storyline very well and opened up the possibility of future sequels. The voices of the robots were amazing and the sounds used were as well. Seriously, the sound could make the movie in its own. I recommend seeing this more than once for pure entertainment because it does not led up the whole way!!!"
"Phade_x","10","4","7","13 July 2007"," Great movie!!!!!
","To begin with.. i am a girl and i loved this movie. It's great.<br/><br/>When i first heard that Transformers was going to become a movie i thought that this was going to be another disappointing movie. Recently i was kind of disappointed about many movies and i thought that this one wasn't going to be much different from the rest given the story.Frankly i thought that it was going to be a childish movie about some stupid robots.<br/><br/>I couldn't be more wrong.<br/><br/>When my brother introduced me to the trailer i started thinking that maybe this movie was worth seeing, even if it' s only for the special effects,but when i came out from the cinema i was totally amazed..... this movie is great!!!!!The director of the movie did an amazing job the movie turned out to be more that I would dream of.<br/><br/>In conclusion i would like for people to go to this movie open minded, not have any prejudice and not label it as a robot movie or a childish movie because this movie is really worth seeing."
"VGrevolution","10","4","7","12 July 2007"," Brnging in both old and new fans. This Transformer movie is a winner
","After Transformers was announced for the big screen, the Transformers fan base became a buzz about what it would be like. Would it trounce their childhoods like so many other movies have? Or would it be a carbon copy of the original series right down to the story and Boxformer design? Well, I am happy to announce that it was neither of those. Michael Bay has pulled off something truly special in this new film; he managed to imagine Transformers for a new generation while maintaining many of the elements that hardcore fans will eat up. Make no mistake about this, this is not your old G1 Transformers, but at the same time, it manages to pay homage to it in many ways that will make you smile.<br/><br/>A burning question in your mind is how is the CGI? To put it as clearly as possible, they are gorgeous. Taking into account that Transformers, when compared to other action focused blockbusters such as Spider-man 3 and Pirates of the Caribbean, it had roughly half the budget, which makes Michael Bay's use of the CGI even more stunning. The CGI makes the Transformers come to life in this movie, complete with moving parts made even more amazing by the almost seamless interaction between themselves and humans. At times, you can really believe that the Transformers are really interacting with human beings. Perhaps one of the most stunning features of the CGI is the believable transformation sequences, which gets rid of the goofy inconsistency from the original film in which the Transformers could change into something that is drastically smaller than their robot forms. Now you can almost see how the Transformers change into a vehicle and back to their robot form piece by piece. The only unfortunate part of the visuals is that at times it appears that budget constraints were hidden through shaky and limited camera views of the Transformers. Luckily, for the most part, you don't notice this, and at times it even creates an exciting scene.<br/><br/>What would these Transformers be without actors, including a competent voice cast? To put it clearly, it would be one drab movie. Thankfully, Transformers manages to have a great cast of both human actors and a brilliant voice cast. The main character, Sam (played by Shia Labeouf), is a surprisingly interesting character that we actually have fun getting to know. Labeouf really adds to the magic of this movie by his interaction, not only with other human characters but also with the Transformers that he interacts with in a believable and engaging way.<br/><br/>Onto the Autobots and Decepticons. All I can say about them is that I was very impressed, but yet disappointed at the same time. Peter Cullen does an amazing job as Optimus, and the emotion you get from his voice work is top notch and I cannot imagine anyone doing it any better. The other Autobots had great voice castings, but sadly, they were underutilized and did not say much (though when they did it was usually good!). On the Decepticon side, Megatron and Frenzy did most of the speaking (Frenzy spoke in another language), with little dialog coming from everyone else. For those that were worried about Megatron's voice, don't be, because the voice fits perfectly with his new, almost frightening look and it plays well off of Peter Cullen. It is just too bad that he did not have more lines.<br/><br/>Enough with the behind the scenes things like CGI and talent, what was the movie like? This movie is a thrill ride from beginning to end, and I can almost guarantee that there will be a moment where you will go ""Whoa"" (hopefully in a more dramatic voice than Neo in the Matrix). Michael Bay has crafted some of the most spectacular action scenes of all time, and shows that he has the artistic talent it takes when it comes to action, with some action sequences never before seen on the big screen. In fact, there is so much going on that you will miss some of it and you will probably have to go see the movie again. The robot battles are epic for the most part (despite a disappointing Megatron vs. Optimus final battle), and your adrenaline will be pumping, to say the least. To help provide some much needed change of pace, the movie has its share of humor, some of which is low brow, but at the same time it provides a fun laugh. What makes the movie so good is that it never takes itself too seriously, yet at the same time it manages to suck you into things with the visuals.<br/><br/>This movie is one of the best action movies around and it is truly a great movie within the genre. This is due to a combination of characters, expertly shot action sequences, CGI, humorous dialog, and a roller-coaster ride when it comes to emotions. Hardcore fans of Transformers will find enough familiarities with the movie that they should appreciate it, while new fans will find an experience like no other one out there. This is a cartoon to movie adaptation done right, and Michael Bay should be applauded for accomplishing this. Transformers was not easy to adapt without getting into the realm of B movie territory, or on the flip side, making it into something that definitely is not Transformers. He managed to find a fine balance between these two sides of the fence and created a thrill ride that sucks the audience in and won't let go. I have no doubt the cheers I heard at the end of this film is not limited to my area. But that is true that for most who see this movie and are looking for a movie that is well made and above all else, fun. So make plans to see this film and ROLL OUT to your local movie theater right away!"

","when the original cartoon came out in the early 80's i was just reaching that age where it wasn't ""cool"" to watch cartoons anymore. a few friends had the toys & i did like those... but as far as knowing anything about them, i was clueless (other than their names). you could say i had really low expectations of this movie... figured it'd be another over the top, blotched attempt at the cartoon to live action movie process.<br/><br/>with that said - this movie rules! there were a few scenes/dialog that could have been left out but what ""blockbuster summer movie"" doesn't? however, there are way too many good things to say about this movie... the animation is flawless & i mean flawless! star wars was just practice for industrial light & magic... they've outdone themselves with this movie.<br/><br/>i cant wait to see part 2."
"jagpal21","10","4","7","8 July 2007"," Absolutely Fantastic
","Let me first and foremost say that Michael Bay is fantastic movie director. If we didn't have people like him, going to the movies would be very very boring. I finally got to see Transformers and I was definitely not disappointed, it had everything what i wanted from the movie. Great Humor, Great Action, Great directing..... Praise Michael Bay. I have been following this movie since the beginning of 2006 and I must say that it ended up being very very good. This movie is way way better then Spider-man 3 and POTC 3 and even though these movies had bigger budgets (SP3= 258million and POTC3= $300 million) they never managed to give the same kick as Transformers, which had a budget of $147 million.<br/><br/>And I'm sure that Transformers will make a lot of money, and it deserves it. Now we have to wait for Transformers 2 which probably will be released in 2009. The same year that AVATAR will be released."
"seaaggie82","8","4","7","8 July 2007"," Good Film despite being a plug for GM and the Air Force
","I came away pleasantly surprised. To think that the first time I heard about this movie was in Clerks 2 and, thanks to being on a naval ship stationed in Japan, I saw absolutely no advertisements, I went in figuring I could chalk this one up as another sub-par cartoon to movie adaptation.<br/><br/>However, it was quite good. The action scenes were intense and kept you on the edge of your seat just as you'd expect from Michael Bay, the CGI, as pointed out by so many other reviewers, was fantastic and made the movie I saw the night before, FF2:Rise of the Silver Surfer, look sub-par. It had just the right dosage of comedy, and thanks to premium casting, the acting stays afloat.<br/><br/>As a casual fan of the cartoon series I watched as a child, I was OK with the changes made in order to modernize the film, such as the notorious Bumble Bee VW Beetle to Camaro decision, and obviously Starscream couldn't fly around as a F-15 anymore and expect to blend in with F-22s. The majority of the changes were do to the fact that GM spent a lot of money on product placement and it shows. Die hard fans will probably be annoyed by this, but the casual movie goer won't know the difference. Just hope that you don't pass a dealership on the way home.<br/><br/>The military accuracy was by far the best I've seen in a movie of the genre, (with its usual movie polish of course) and can be attributed to the Air Force giving a substantial amount of participation in this flick. Although at times I couldn't help but feel I was watching a recruitment video. Still, it made for great cinematography of real aircraft, and when I returned to my ship after the movie, I kept waiting for the MH-53 on our flight deck to transform into a 50 foot robot.<br/><br/>I had a few minor nit-picks I won't bother to get into here, but the main one was the lack of closure on a few characters like Maggie, Glenn or any of the other main Air Force guys other than Captain Lennox. In fact the only characters that get any real closure is Sam and the Autobots.<br/><br/>Despite that, its ultimately a great film for a fun night at the movies. The Aussies seemed to enjoy it at the theater in Townsville, Queensland, so I'd expect than movie goers outside the US should feel the same way. <br/><br/>I can only hope that the sequel is done with the same panache as this film."
"THX712517","10","4","7","6 July 2007"," Simply incredible
","I loved G1 when it was on the air, and had all the toys. I was afraid that Michael Bay would screw this up, but (aside from a shaky camera) it was incredible. Granted I spent more time focusing on Optimus Prime and the other Autobots and Decepticons than the humans, but that's the whole point of the movie, right? It's Transformers, not fleshy bags of mostly water.<br/><br/>The theater cheered when Prime appeared, and for the other Autobots as well. Megatron was menacing. Barricade was an awesome character, and played well off of Bumblebee. It's not Schindler's List, but it was never meant to be. Go to this movie with the intent of enjoying yourself, and you won't be disappointed!"

","I've grown up loving ""The Transformers."" It was 1986 and everyday I'd come home from the third grade and sit in my school clothes and watch twenty-two minutes of every episode of third season of ""The Transformers."" Even without Optimus Prime that very last season, my all-time favorite Transformer and toy, I was enthralled and engrossed and loved every minute of it.<br/><br/>""The Transformers"" have stayed with me. Optimus Prime remains one my heroes, as well as Bumblebee and Jazz. They are still real to me. They always were.<br/><br/>So, when I see some of my childhood heroes realized on the big screen, alive and well and in real life, to say I was floored would be an understatement. To say I didn't cry when I saw that semi-tractor trailer transform into a thirty-foot tall robot and hear Peter Cullen's baritone voice booming out of it would be nothing less than a lie.<br/><br/>Filmmaker Michael Bay has made his masterpiece and it's called ""Transformers."" And that's whats so damn weird, because in reality, this film is an adaptation of a late animated series and a stalwart toy line. It's not an original idea, and maybe that made it easier for Bay. Whatever the case, he, along with two very talented screenwriters, and Industrial Light & Magic, gave me, and so many other fans, old and young, our Transformers.<br/><br/>I'm really just too emotional to give a good, solid synopsis-filled review. Maybe I will someday, but after seeing ""Transformers"" twice, I can't sit here and write, ""Well, this happened next, and then this actor portrayed his character well, and blah, blah, blah."" I can't do it.<br/><br/>At the end the end of the day, I saw a live-action ""Transformers"" movie. I saw Optimus Prime living and breathing (or the Cybertronian equivalent), I saw Starscream fail Megatron, and I saw Prime and Megatron fight to the death. I heard that glorious transforming noise, and well, I just can't say enough about Mr. Cullen's voice work. He's a god among men, especially men my age.<br/><br/>His Optimus Prime, as it was twenty-plus years ago, is still the heart and soul of everything ""The Transformers"" stood for then and now. As I've left the theater for the second of probably several more times, it hits me every time, ""Now I know why Optimus Prime is still my hero."" He just is...<br/><br/>Now, many will not like this film, fans and non-fans alike. And that's fine, I don't expect everyone to like ""Transformers."" It may not be everybody's cup of tea. But, for me, it was pretty much exactly what I had hoped for...and leaves me wanting more, much, more than meets the eye. <br/><br/>Sorry, had to do it.<br/><br/>Highest recommendation!"

","Well well well, I am definitely one of millions and millions of Transformers fans all over the world who grew up watching the cartoon... so when i first found out about this movie at one of our local forums, i was very excited and from time to time, i would visit websites to catch the latest trailers...<br/><br/>So when this movie was released last week, i jumped at the chance to catch the movie asap and boy oh boy, it really did not disappoint me at all... personally, i find that the movie was very well paced, if you read some of the feedbacks, you'd read that the scenes was shown at one place and then jump to another place but to me, it's necessary since this event is happening all over the place. The storyline was more or less expected but that doesn't bother me at all. Afterall, who else doesn't know that Autobots are the good guys and Decepticons are the bad ones, and duh, as usual fighting to control the world or universe blah blah blah... but what impresses me here are the special effects. It really blew me away, CGIs ain't really what it used to be 10 years back and gosh, they robots do really looked very real !!! And I totally love the design of the robots 101%, i couldn't imagine if they stick to the original design of the 80s...<br/><br/>And talk about character, well in this movie i guess the character i feel the most for is definitely bumblebee... i do feel sad when bumblebee got injured at the end of the movie fight scene and also when bumblebee was captured earlier in the film. So i could not understand when i read from one of the earlier reviews before I watched the movie, that the robots are rather mechanical and there's not much soul in them... i totally disagree with this, heck if they replace the robot design with a skin covering them, you would actually believe that the robots are like humans...I'm talking more on autobots here...for decepticons, well, they are suppose to be evil but then they don't have much screen time anyway... probably the movie should have been longer so some time can be used to introduce the decepticons robots better...<br/><br/>All in all, this is a very enjoyable film and definitely a must see movie for 2007. I can't wait for the sequels to be out but at the mean time, I'll consider watching this movie for the 2nd time. Oh yeah, the actions are fast and intense, so don't even blink or look elsewhere, otherwise, you'll totally missed out on the actions... heh ..."
"cdfeatherstone","10","4","7","5 July 2007"," Michael Bay could direct 100 Armageddons...wouldn't matter because transformers is a masterpiece...
","Let me begin by saying this: To all of you who never saw the original 1987 animated version (I personally watched it upwards of 200 times as a child) or watched the series as a kid, you will not fully understand how awesome this movie is to those of us who did. Even if you liked it, even if your about to give this a 10 out of 10 like I did, you will still not completely grasp what Michael Bay has done here. He has perfectly mastered my childhood in a two hour movie. Bumblebee: perfect, the second he started talking like he did in that original version I was hooked (not that I hadn't been since seeing the first previews leek out months and months ago); Optimus Prime and his ""corny lines"": Couldn't have been better, they completely captured the good versus evil battle that is transformers, I was practically screaming the lines sitting there; Megatron's ability to still send shivers down my spine: Better than any horror movie I've ever seen...period.<br/><br/>I could go on but I only get 1,000 words here and I want to give credit where credit is due. Anyone working on those special effects, you couldn't have made that an more real, it was stunning and left me gaping the entire time. Michael Bay, I don't care how many terrible movies you might have done, this one was (in the words of Vince Vaughn in ""Swingers"") MONEY BABY! Go direct 100 more Armageddons, you'll still be high on my list. Shia Labeouf, Megan Fox, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese, Anthony Anderson, John Voight, John Turturro and everyone else on down to the extras, THANK YOU! You made a 20 year old guy transform back into a five year old kid tonight in that movie theater. As good as Prime, Bumblebee, Megatron, Starscream and the rest of the crew were, the movie wouldn't have been s*** without the live actors being as good as the were. Shia Labeouf is a sure thing Hollywood, look out for this kid.<br/><br/>On an end note, as a transformers purist (yes I even saw the animated sequel countless times) I can't see how any of you fellow fans-from-birth can have a problem with this movie. They hit the nail on the head in every way imaginable. I thought Peter Jackson performed the greatest feat in movies by doing the greatest trilogy ever made, hands down, while sticking to the LOTR plot line as best he could. This single achievement comes incredibly close and for being just one movie, instead of one out of three, it gets my nod as my personal favorite. I'll tell anyone whose willing to listen that you need to see this movie. Not on your television, not on your 60"" plasma or your projector with surround sound. Go to your local movie theater grab some popcorn (actually scratch that, bring your own), sit down and enjoy. You won't leave disappointed, trust me."
"DaTDawgg","10","4","7","5 July 2007"," Get what you paid for
","I was excited for Transformers to come out after watching all the previews for it online. After I saw it Monday night, I went out and saw it Tuesday again. I'm not typically one to see a movie in the theater multiple times, but I think Transformers is one of those movies where two viewings does it justice.<br/><br/>The first time I came into the movie expecting ferocious, giant robot-on-robot violence. I know Michael Bay's track record (I completely avoided ""Pearl Harbor"" and didn't like ""The Island""), so I wasn't expecting much else. After seeing it, my taste for explosions, destruction, and violence was fulfilled (as expected), but the non-robot parts of the movie were entertaining as well. I've been consistently impressed by Shia LaBoeuf and the parents, John Turturro, Bernie Mac, and Anthony Anderson all keep your attention between Autobot-Decepticon battle scenes.<br/><br/>The main reason why seeing the movie a second time is so that you can get a second look at the action scenes. The first time I saw it I was positively floored by them; the way the CGI interacts with the environment is stunning. When I saw it the second time, the adrenaline rush was a bit less so I could actually pay attention to what was going on during the battle scenes.<br/><br/>This movie won't win any acting or writing Oscars (the story is simple and the romantic and family subplots are cute, but not deep or extremely engaging), but if you come into this movie expecting the right thing, you will get your money's worth.<br/><br/>9/10"

It was a nonstop action flick that left your heart still beating after you left the theater. This movie has officially moved to my favorite movie list, and I've only seen it once. Even if you've never watched the TV show, you will have no trouble watching this movie. It is kid appropriate (the only non kid parts are somewhat scary or when people die at the hand of the Decepticon)], but it is also an exciting adult movie. It had it's humor in the movie, making it a laugh-out-loud flick, before changing into the exciting fight scenes. I thought that it was a lot better than Spiderman 3, and a lot more exciting than Pirates of the Carrabein 3. (too long and predictable) I definitely believe that it was the best movie of the season, and probably the year. If you liked movies like IRON MAN (cartoon) or FAST AND FURIOUS or any sort of earth threatening movie where the human race is in the hands of one or two people, than you'll LOVE this movie. I give my humblest regards to the producers, and *hIgHlEy* recommend it."

","Best movie of 2007 is a bit of a drastic title to give a film -- especially when 2007 hasn't even ended yet -- but nothing, in my opinion, has matched Transformers, and I don't anticipate anything coming that close for a long time.<br/><br/>I have some things I have to admit right away. Growing up, I was never a Transformers fan. Now, I must have watched at least ONE episode because I went into the theater knowing exactly who Megatron and Optimus Prime were (Of course, that could have just been because of good advertising). Secondly, I've never been a fan of sci-fi and/or action movies. But in the same way that Taylor Swift won me over to country by her sweet melodies, Transformers stole my heart.<br/><br/>It's a movie that I don't think anybody will be disappointed with. As little as possible CGI was used, but what CGI WAS used meshed VERY well with the live action. The characters were very well developed. Of every moment of every second, I was on the edge of my seat. Hell, I think that even despite the mild sexual humor and swearing that was used, EVERYBODY could enjoy this film.<br/><br/>All in all, a lot of films these days are half-assed. They are good ideas put into good scripts that produce good movies. GOOD. Not GREAT. Transformers, on the other hand, was FANTASTIC. GREAT JOB!"

","I hold one man responsible. He has directed everything from a man commuting to work being terrorized by a ghostly-demonic, semi-truck; to the life and trials of a young black woman; to, quite possibly, the greatest, most intimate, most stunning, war motion picture ever presented to an audience. <br/><br/>In my mind, I will no longer think of him as a director.<br/><br/>Steven Spielrock, I mean Steven Spielberg, should be referred to as a master filmmaker.<br/><br/>Imagine, for a moment, having done so very much as a storyteller. But, there's a catch: YOU LOVE MOVIES as much as the next rabid, movie-going mutant. So, an idea has landed in your lap about a dormant franchise of warring, ""robot-sapiens"" that screams to be made into a blockbusting, popcorn enabling, epic of action science-fiction. This is probably the most elaborate and complex production since Matrix: Revolutions AND your directorial schedule is chock FULL for at least the next two and a half years. What do you do? Seriously, what do you do?<br/><br/>First. You hire a director that has a ""third eye"" capable of filming dazzling and amazing sequences of controlled chaos, but some say he has weaknesses. Then, You grab a great editor He has worked with because this person is capable of converting the director's controlled chaos into jaw-dropping, eye-popping, action sequences, Plural. Second. You gather a cast that can drive the elements of the story (especially comedy) that need to be carried very well to the end of the story. You also put the best people that you have worked with in key departments like, Production Management, Set Decoration and Art Direction. 'Cause you still gotta keep the largest automaker on the planet happy with their product placement throughout the movie, right?<br/><br/>And last but, ABSOLUTELY Not least; you hire not one but two, TWO visual effects supervisors.

","This monstrosity is a shocking example of everything that's wrong with the Hollywood movie making system: Brainless tripe,concocted in an effort to make as much money as possible from as wide an audience scope as available. Michael Bay takes the helm for another one of his bottom of the barrel stinkers. Who's hiring this guy anyway? Did he even go to film school? This film is constantly shown on satellite and cable movie channels, and I love to watch it just to view shocking displays of film production blunders. Sure there's great CGI (SNORE........) but no intelligence what-so-ever. It's just brainless!!<br/><br/>I grew up in the 1980s on the Transformer cartoons and action figures. I was saddened and offended by the interpretation of the Transformer brand name. This movie is more about shallow stereotypical human characters than it is about Transformers. What an insult to the Transformers! And to my intelligence. The script is mind numbing and embarrassing. The cinematography is comprised of, seemingly, all extreme close-up shots. What was Bay thinking? Move the camera back man! What the f**k is wrong with you Bay. This movie is another reason why I shouldn't leave my home ever again. DISGUSTING!"
"Torgo_Approves","2","7","15","14 January 2008"," An abomination.
","Who'da thunk? Michael Bay has created a film that bores, insults your intelligence, hurts your eardrums and gives you a headache... and all it asks for in return is three hours of your time! I'd be less angry if it was a simple Point A to Point B action movie, because it obviously never tries to be anything more than mindless high budget crap for the lowest common denominator. But it's not a simple Point A to Point B action movie, rather a schizophrenic mess whose main plot is only revealed after two hours of hilarious I'm-an-awkward-teen comedy and introductions of 1-dimensional side characters with annoying accents.<br/><br/>You gotta respect that Bay fellow. He's managed to build a lucrative, long-lasting career in the movie biz despite having no directing talent whatsoever. People say his films are just for fun, yet I've never seen a movie of his which didn't give me epileptic seizures, make my blood boil and bore me with a 2 hour plus running time. I simply can't enjoy this man's creations no matter how I approach them.<br/><br/>Don't let the title fool you; this has nothing to do with cool robots. In fact this film has nothing to do with anything. It's just another meaningless collection of stylized shots of sunsets, gunfire and tumbling cars set to swelling patriotic music for Bay to masturbate over. I feel bad for John Turturro, who's probably still trying to cleanse his body from the filth of this script.<br/><br/>""Transformers"" is not intended for intelligent life from any planet. Don't see this, because there's nothing more here than meets the eye. Horrible.<br/><br/>2/10"
"Stampsfightclub","4","7","15","8 January 2008"," Visually stunning, but with no plot, its nothing
","This critically acclaimed fantasy action film from director Michael Bay brings special graphics to a new level with visually stunning scenes involving transforming robots who have arrived on earth in order to settle a dispute. It's the Autobots and Decepticons who have crash-landed and are here to fight for what is theirs.<br/><br/>Unfortunately as good and as impressive as the graphics are, the 2007 summer hit fails to capitalise on its effects with a thin plot and exceptionally poor dialogue. Shia LaBeouf (Even Stevens) gives an average performance as the geeky teenager who wants to impress the attractive Megan Fox, but both are soon wrapped up in the robot war.<br/><br/>It's a film which dollops a heavy amount of information about another world on top of you with no depth and feeling to it. Jokes are predictable and the Autobots can be very childish and annoying at frequent points. The ending is ridiculous as its one of those lets all unite and fight and save the day scenarios.<br/><br/>The film however gets to an interesting start with mystery and a new look on the Sci-Fi genre with the robots coming from another planet and all that but like so many other films these days, focuses too much upon the graphics and not enough depth to the plot to make it a poor and predictable fantasy action film."

","It's like a five-year-old wrote a script while playing with the toys...and somebody made a movie out of it. <br/><br/>I know Transformers isn't supposed to be a mental exercise of any kind, but this is ridiculous. It is, in fact, an insult. It puts Lost World to shame in terms of its brains to fluff ratio. I have no idea what the humans are even DOING in this move except from being stomped mercilessly. Why would intelligent devices (or, rather, intelligence that can morph itself INTO devices...huh?) which can turn themselves from a 10-foot long car or 1 foot long radio into 2 story buildings even TALK to the little ants, much less RELATE to them? That last sentence touches on another thing this movie tosses out the window: conservation of matter. Might as well talk about that, too. At one point a kid is handed a block that has been shrunk down from a four-story building-sized piece of metal which crashed into the earth's surface...whenever. So, something that once was large and heavy enough to plow its way through rock can now be handled by a 17 year-old. This cube is apparently the most important thing in the universe, to boot. So, why is it handed to a boy. Because the 5-year-old who is dreaming of playing with REAL transformers said so. And, of course, the government was aware all along that the robots were coming because THEY ALREADY HAD ONE FROZEN, and all of our 20th century technology is the result of what we've learned from it and the laser that can turn a cell phone into a mindless killing/transforming being. I am getting dizzy just writing this... Now, if a robot can be frozen still...HOW DID THEY GET TO EARTH? space is cold!!!!!! You could go on and on...but what's the point? Fact is, this flick is porn, a bunch of contextless CGI ejaculations."
"mentalcritic","2","7","15","31 October 2007"," Quite a lot less than meets the eye, actually...
","It seems Transformers splits viewers firmly down the middle, with people either denouncing it as a lot of crap or saying they loved it. I do not denounce people because they have an opinion, not unless they want to tell me I am diseased and incapable because I was born different to the expected norm anyway, but this... film... goes beyond the limit of bad writing. Hence, when a defender of this film tells me that the sky is blue, I will ask someone else for their opinion. You see, I was a hyperlexic child in 1986 (that means I had a wider vocabulary when I was in elementary school than most people have when they enter tertiary education). Hence, I not only enjoyed The Transformers, the real Transformers, I could have explained to you in very lucid terms why the physics of their abilities are not only impossible but, in light of feasibility on a planet that is not blessed with a literally infinite power source, completely ridiculous. Why do I say all that? It is very simple. This film does not just insult my intelligence, it assumes that I am like my onetime elementary school teachers and have none.<br/><br/>Like all the truly bad films, there are moments when you start to just care about some of the characters. The soldiers who first meet one of the titular robots are likable, genuinely interesting guys. The teenagers that the film spends the majority of its time following, on the other hand, are the most insipid and annoying pieces of human filth it has been my displeasure to watch. In contrast to the Spike, Chip, or Sparkplug that gave the audience an element to relate to in the real Transformers, the Sam, Mikaela, and Maggie that pollute this abortion of an adaptation slow down the interest factor to a halt. It is one thing to make a film about a war between disparate factions of intelligent robots uninteresting. It is another altogether to make the human factor so monotonous and cliché that even the moments of interaction between people are boring. The ""oh my god I do not know how to talk to another human being because it is feminine"" act is so 1950s, guys.<br/><br/>Adding to the misery are the action sequences. Yes, the parts of the film that are meant to give relief from the monotony of the dialogue or the who-cares tepidness of the human characters actually bring the most pain. This is because director Michael Bay, like all directors who do not know how to make an action film interesting when all else has failed, resorts to the tried and tired method of making sure the audience cannot see what the hell is going on. Michael Bay, if you are out there and can read this, I promise you that if we ever meet, I am going to make you feel as dazed and nauseous as your piece of crap film has made me. I will sign a contract to do so in blood if you want commitment. Bay should really have trusted his original instinct, as he has made nothing more than a stupid toy film. Put simply, I did not just hate this film. I turned it off feeling like Bay had just shaken his ding-dong at me for two hours.<br/><br/>And what of the characters we were bracing ourselves to see on film? Well, Bumblebee is the one we get to see first, so let us deal with him. Put simply, Bumblebee's function in the real Transformers was to demonstrate that size alone does not make a person worthy. In spite of being not much bigger than your average Human, he often steered his fellow Autobots out of danger when it was really needed. Or rescued the human element. Take your pick. But in Michael Bay's conception of the world, everyone who is worth anything is at least 6'7"" and weighs 250 pounds, minimum. Do not try telling him Albert Einstein was a mere 5'9"", it will fall on deaf ears. And it gets worse from there. The real Optimus Prime was a leader because of several things. One, he was as intelligent as he was large (that's right, Michael, intelligence counts for A LOT in battle). Two, he was unafraid to serve the greater good, even if it came at the cost of his own life. Three, he led by example. Four, he led by example. Five, he led by example. Six, well, you get the idea.<br/><br/>When you add all these things together, you find they contradict the very nature of the robots Michael Bay presents to us and asks us to believe are the Transformers. Optimus Prime in this film cannot even take one of his human wards to retrieve a vital element of their mission without crushing major backyard ornaments and, along with his fellow Autobots, making enough noise to alert an entire city block to their presence. Oh, and by the way, Jazz had class. He was not a twenty foot tall expression of bling-bling culture. Ugh, being that I could read Tolkien when Darius McCrary was probably failing elementary school English, his presence in this film is an insult to everything the original series was about. It is one thing to have characters who are, to quote George Clooney, dumber than a bag of hammers. This film goes a lot further This film assumes that its audience is made up entirely of four year olds who have never read a cereal packet. In so doing, it takes everything that such writers as Dennis O'Neil and Bob Budiansky created and perverts it.<br/><br/>Transformers as directed by Michael Bay is a two out of ten film in every sense. Avoid."

","Do you want your childhood raped again for financial gain as appose to being immortally honoured? Before this film came out I overheard people saying that it would be made for all those in their late twenties/early thirties who remember the original cartoons and that they couldn't possibly mess it up, could they? Well enter big budget movie maestro Michael Bay and Steven 'can I have my fingers in anymore pies' Spielberg and more CGI than your eyes can take and you have the most disappointing film of the decade. Made for thick people who are easily distracted by colours and pre-pubescent boys who will almost certainly have hard-ons at the sight of the cars, the girls and of course the robots it is two hours of CG-action and very little else. Id tell you about the plot and the story if it had either, I don't remember any of the characters names, except the bumbling Malcolm in the middle type lead Sam (played by Shia LaBeouf) and I only remembered the robots because I had the toys as a kid. Mostly the film couldn't decide if it was an action or a comedy and uncomfortably spliced the two which became a little jarring at times. Considering they are an advanced alien life forms millions of light-years ahead of humans and don't forget 'robots in disguise' a particularly cringe worthy scene is played out in Sam's garden as all five autobots turn into the metallic equivalent of the three stooges and instead of just turning into vehicles they stay as robots and try to hide in bushes, hilarity ensues when a dog wees on one and optimums prime treads on the roses with a 'whoops my bad'. Sadly there is also a couple of slightly mild racial moments like when a soldier in a battle is trying to contact the pentagon and gets through to an Asian call centre and Autobot Jazz has been remodelled as a homeboy all street and full of b-boy attitude. The continuity is appalling to say the least, one example being: soldier 'Sam run up and set off this flare on the roof', Sam 'I cant do it', soldier 'you can you're a soldier now, go' Sam 'ok', soldier on radio 'all incoming planes look for the green flare' Sam gets to the roof and sets off a red flare which to me is just plain laziness its almost like the filmmakers are going 'the idiot audience wont notice and if they do we'll already have their cash so who cares'. Of course flare colour aside I think the army might notice ten twenty foot robots scrapping without a sign and if not are they actually going to be of any use to us? Sitting through this film I felt like Malcolm McDowell's Alex from 'A Clockwork Orange' where they hold his eyelids open and making watch horrific images at breakneck speed. The inner geek in me loved the robots smashing the living crap out of each other but the inner child and outer film fan was so disappointed. Left open for sequels (I heard a rumour they have already green lit 2 & 3) they will make more films because the films sell the toys, and you can blame Mr.Lucas for that, Transformers is the final nail in the coffin of the movie blockbuster, soulless eye candy that's only goal is to fill its pockets, taking money and returning empty promises. One of the tag lines is 'some have come to destroy us' which could as easily be related to the executives behind such films, now all we need are the ones that 'will come to save us'. Basically it's a shame this film couldn't transform itself into a half decent movie because disguised in there somewhere I'm sure there is one, instead we are left with a missed opportunity of Cybertronic proportions."

"flipcritic","5","7","15","1 July 2007"," A battle between nostalgia and common sense
","In my adolescence, I once thought that THE TRANSFORMERS: THE MOVIE (1986) was one of the best films ever made. Age and access had not yet tinged my movie-going experience. Such is youth, forever sentimentalizing our early lives and its subjects. Many of us who grew up on these Hasbro heroes still hold them in reverie, regardless of the profound silliness of it all. But we've all been young, and boys will be boys in love with their toys.<br/><br/>For followers of the series, how much you love Michael Bay's TRANSFORMERS will depend on how much you have grown up (and probably how many decibels your eardrums can take). It seems natural that many of us who collected toy autobots and decepticons might have had great interest in the fields of science, as the mechanics of how these robots transform required inquiry during our younger years. So if you're like me, watching this movie may not only reveal an on screen battle between good and evil, but also one's own personal battle between nostalgia and common sense.<br/><br/>I know that I shouldn't be applying logic against a concept that was never meant to be logical. Optimus Prime, Megatron and their ilk were not meant to be opposing leaders of a mechanical alien race set against a space epic. They're cool toys representing the fanciful idea of having normal everyday vehicles transform into humanoid mechas. That's killing two birds with one stone in toy marketing.<br/><br/>The problem is that the level of detail and seriousness the film initially builds up begs us to consider its plausibility. The movie's opening sequence of where a decepticon infiltrates a US military base (apparently in the Middle East) is well-executed and as convincing as can be. Explanations on how these mechas are able to speak English are humorous but (barely) believable. And the initial electronic strategies the decepticons use to hamper US defense systems make sense.<br/><br/>But when the deeper questions are asked, the house of cards falls apart. These robots transform to blend into earth's general populace, but why did they ever need to transform in the first place? Was there an evolutionary advantage that morphing gave them on their home world or are they just God's toys? Why do they speak to communicate as they are electronic beings? If they can reach the earth through space, why do they travel slowly as grounded transport? Couldn't they all have chosen aircraft functions to replicate? And why in one inexplicable scene are they reduced to comedic stooges hiding from a kid's parents in his backyard? Surely these and other queries are supposed to be ignored, but my inquisitive side keeps on tugging on my id. If your inner child wins out however, there are worthy sights to behold. The transformers themselves have been bravely redesigned, which is refreshingly the correct choice as opposed to keeping their original forms. Though some characters from the cartoon series will be familiar, the vehicular alter-egos have been totally revamped to fit current tastes (and toy franchising needs). Mecha battles engaged in Los Angeles are at times breathtaking, none more than Starscream's low-flying dogfighting maneuvers. Fans will likely warm to some in-jokes (a decepticon police car motto), a jab at ""My Little Pony"" (a fellow Hasbro franchise), and surely, hearing Peter Cullen's voicing of Prime.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, this gloriously authoritative father-figure lacks presence and warmth. Animated characters by their very nature more stylized and symbolic; highlighting their traits to an almost elemental level. How ironic that Optimus Prime in all his CGI glory projects less heroism and gravitas than his hand-drawn version. Perhaps it is our youth that taints our view, plus the all-to realistic detail of the film's special effects makes him look more of a machine and less of a hero (or maybe it's because now we can see his mouth move?). Shia LaBeouf, as the young Sam Witwicky who stumbles onto the robotic conflict, is the only well-rounded character worth following. He keeps it interesting, but can only do so much.<br/><br/>From a cinematic view, Michael Bay was born to direct this movie. He just loves toys, as not one of his films to date has had an unexploded vehicle. In filming convincing human dynamics however, he hasn't got a clue, as evidenced in one scene where he tries miserably and awkwardly in getting us to feel bad for an autobot's capture. His methods have deteriorated as he irritatingly refuses to stop using shaky camera movements during conflict, and dozens of slow motion sequences, mistaking disorientation and distraction for a frenzied perspective. For the life of me, I don't understand why he cannot just let the action speak for itself.<br/><br/>As you can see, I've grown up a bit too far from my guilelessness to enjoy TRANSFORMERS. I do not disdain this kind of entertainment. Truth be told, its writing is better than I thought it would be, but its fancy façade can't hide its flaws for those who want more substance. I find Prime deserving of better treatment, but considering its source, this might be as good as it gets. So enjoy it if you can. I tried and couldn't."

There is a seen around the half way mark where they are searching through Sam's parent's house that is so painful and awkward I wanted to claw my own eyes out.<br/><br/>The movie, thankfully, gets back on track towards the end of the film and aside from some extremely corny dialog is about the level I would expect from a movie about Transformers."

I admit for the few lines I heard Ironhide speak I was happy with his character he was very Ironhide ""I wanted to show them my cannons"" and his why are we bothering about the humans attitude that's Ironhide's character right there when they first meet Spike in the series. Jazz the stylish way he transformed was very Jazz he was after all the ""cool"" transformer his concern for Bumblebee was very in character to, there were a few episodes in the cartoon where the two worked together. The Spike er Sam Bumblebee relationship funny in the beginning good humor parts that I could see happening in the series they did have good comic moments in the cartoon. I believe Ratchet didn't get developed at all, but without Wheeljack and their banter I suppose he could be underdeveloped, it would be hard I was just glad he was in there.<br/><br/>The Decepticons did not get enough screen time, development or even words, Megatron vs Optimus that was bound to happen it's what fans want and they get it but only about 3-5mins worth, sorry guys. I love the military involvement namely because the military featured in the cartoon too<br/><br/>Overall because the graphics and actions scenes were awesome fast and eye catching I gave it a 7, still near the end it did speed up a bit far to fast that I didn't know what had happened till about three minutes after... I felt the end was rushed but still cgi *nods* made it believable that they could really do those things I found my self pointing at things after the movie as a joke with a friend going ""Transform"" oh if only...<br/><br/>I could go on and on and on... but I understand they did what they had to do for certain reasons but I dislike that the character that got me in to Transformers was killed... He out lived Optimus in the animated movie if you are going to kill one off why not pick one that didn't last long in the series not that one... it just felt wrong and dishonorable to the original v/a who died in 86 to take away that character, that v/a was a very respectable actor and I was massively upset at the end of the movie."

This film delivers the goods on all accounts and delivers them in a big way! The action is fantastic, the special effects are perfect, and surprisingly enough (in such an action special effects driven feature) the actors all turn in great performances that add that extra special touch to the film. Also, the humor works very well and is satisfying and natural instead of silly and forced. Transformer fans will be pleased and yet people who don't have a clue who Optimus Prime or Megatron are will enjoy this ride, too judging by the enthusiastic reaction of my friend who knew nothing going into the film other than that it was a movie that featured giant transforming robots.<br/><br/>About the only small complaint that I can offer is that they did such a great job with setting up the story and bringing the Transformers into the picture that they wind up having too little time in the epic finale to develop any of the Decepticon characters to the degree that lovers of the comic and show will remember. However, I'm sure that this will be rectified in the sequel that is hinted at by the movie's final minutes.<br/><br/>Go see this movie as soon as you can on the big screen!

It is racist as black comedians play to the stereotype and so pro-industrial military complex!!! BUT the biggest problem I have with this movie is that it did not make you feel anything. It was just flat throughout and I was BORED. It was not scary (we are talking big live alien robots here!), it was NOT funny (jokes were stale!), there was no suspense (we know who won!) Optimus prime, bumble bee were NOT given much of a personality for you to care enough for. They tried to make Shia Le bouf character the one to root for but c'mon -- this is transformers the movie. And shia, to his credit as a good actor, tries not to appear shallow but does his best peter parker impressions. He is not spiderman unfortunately.<br/><br/>I walked out of the show feeling truly cheated -- how can they spend millions on special effects and hardly any effort on story.<br/><br/>If there is ONE thing positive to say -- it is the special effects are spectacular -- they make the robots come alive and you get enough shots of every robot you want.<br/><br/>My feeling though is that -- with such good special effects, certainly one of the best I have seen on screen -- they leave nothing to the imagination and I feel robs away reason why we go to movies in the first place.<br/><br/>I am staying away from BLOCKBUSTERS from now on."

Only two other cartoons since then have had any kind of impact on me, those are GI Joe, which ran about the same time period as TF, and Batman the Animated Series which ran in the early 90s after I became a big Batman movie fan. Take my review as you will...<br/><br/>I think that this movie was neither an incredible embarrassment to the old series, nor was it a great tribute either.<br/><br/>Let me start with what I thought was bad. There were many things that upset me about this movie. To begin with, I was never an advocate of a live-action TF movie at all. I felt that if another TF movie was made, it should be all CG, like Cars or Toy Story, or it should be animated just like the original series, but using fancy new animation techniques of course. I always thought that TF in a live-action setting would end up being pretty hokey, and I think I was right. <br/><br/>I was never too happy with the new TF movie designs. I thought they looked like insects. Optimus Prime and Jazz were the only 2 robots that really looked decent because they were similar to the originals and not so much insect-ish. Megatron and Starscream were the worst and just looked plain ridiculous. <br/><br/>Except Peter Cullen w/ Optimus Prime, I also thought most of the voices were lousy. In the original series, Peter Cullen also voiced Ironhide, and he was already in the movie... why couldn't he voice both characters? I must admit that Hugo Weaving made a pretty good Megatron Voice. Jazz's voice sounded silly and bumblebee speaking through/as the radio was annoying and made me angry. <br/><br/>The dialogue was so cheesy! Why did they have to cheese it up so much? Prime steps on something and says ""My bad!"" STUPID! The odd-looking girl didn't recognize Sam through 10 years of grade school? What the heck was that all about? Well anyways, I could go on and on about designs, dialogue, voices, etc... but I digress.<br/><br/>The good parts of the movie? The action, battle scenes, and storyline were pretty good and in my opinion, balanced out all the bad things from this movie and pulled it up to an average score from me. The plot was good, simple, standard Transformers fare and its something you could see in the old animated show. The action and battles were pretty outstanding. Even though Michael Bay knows absolutely nothing about developing characters, he sure knows how to blow stuff up!<br/><br/>Although I went into that movie expecting it to be awful, it wasn't THAT bad. It also wasn't THAT good either. I suggest you set your expectations low, and you probably won't dislike it so much. Of course unless all you want out of movies is thin plots and lots of explosions and special effects... if thats you, this movie should be right up your alley. Well thats all I have to say about that."
"jonolbs","1","5","10","25 June 2009"," Transformer fans will be pleased movie watchers won't
","While this movie had great special effects and was visually impressive during the action scenes it would make anyone a fan of Transformers happy well, except for the fact that Optimus had lips that moved when he talked, not sure why he had lips he's a robot. However, any movie goer will be disappointed at how juvenile and weak this film was. This was the first movie i've ever started to get up to leave the theater but quickly remembered that the theater costs $10.50 now and i should stay to get my money's worth. The new one looks to be more of the same so if you enjoyed the cheesy dialog, weak story and juvenile humor of the first one enjoy the second. Me personally, I think Bay should just stop making films, he is just bad."

","I respect how much time and effort it would have taken to create this film. The special effects are spectacular and the locations are wonderful, you can tell it took a lot of work.<br/><br/>Shame it sucks as a piece of film-making on so many levels.<br/><br/>The plot is clichéd and unconvincing. Every few minutes there was another moment where I had to tut with bemusement. Many scenes are completely unnecessary, such as the house scene, which in the end he finds the glasses in the kitchen. I think we could have done without that 5 minutes of hideousness thank you very much. 5 minutes we could have been seeing a longer car chase. If you look, the ""chase"" goes by in an instant and nothing actually happens. The cars skid a few times and then its over. There are numerous instances of set-pieces which lack punch. The desert scene, one of them. The word is lacklustre.<br/><br/>Bay obviously thinks a still shot is murder and audiences are going to fall asleep if there's isn't a dolly being used for every clip. The constant movement of the camera grates on me. But maybe that's just because I analyse it closely. Stick with the special effects Michael and get someone who know how to make films.<br/><br/>Oh yeah and whats-her-name who's with Shia. What the Hell is the point of her? (Other than eye-candy) I have come to the conclusion that this is the ultimate popcorn film. By which I mean something to just watch and not have to think about it. This is because it just doesn't work as anything else.<br/><br/>On the whole, it's OK entertainment but a horrible film."
"cjs948524","1","5","10","13 September 2007"," Worst acting than what you'd find in a soft core porn film
","I'll give Tranformers this their special effects were great. However if you're the kind of person that doesn't drool over them this movie should be avoided. It was like watching fire works lots of bright flashing lights. Sometimes the movie was a blur due to the special effects. It was the worst acting I've ever seen. This gets my vote for fakest (I know fakest is not a word) movie ever made. With a good cast you'd figure you'd see good acting. I'm ashamed I spent even a penny to see this film and would've left the movie early if I wasn't too busy laughing at the actors/actresses! The movie genre should be that of a comedy. Megan Fox i'm sorry honey but just model please get out of acting now."
"Paul_Crowe","1","5","10","27 August 2007"," So much wasted potential.
","This movie was all I feared it would turn out to be.<br/><br/>Yes the FX are brilliant... The use of the military had some major plus points... I even though the cast was pretty good... But for the love of Prime the plot! I honestly believe a child could have come up with something better.<br/><br/>Seriously: The Transformers were hardly even in the film. It was ALL about Sam from beginning to end. The redesign of the TF's was pretty awful (Except Jazz... he looked pretty cool. A total Appleseed rip off.... but pretty cool). There was NO character development at all. The whole part about hacking the signal was useless rubbish and shouldn't have been there. The idea about Megatron being frozen in ice for thousands of years... No (and yes, I know they made a similar mistake in G1). That he was the basis for our advanced technology... give me a break! To reverse engineer anything means taking the original apart. If that were the case old Megs would have been sprawled over the whole site in about a trillion little pieces. And then... the crown jewel here... at the end of the movie: The military successfully cover it all up!! I nearly cried... I mean these giant robots destroy half a city, kill dozens of people in the process, and they're going to pretend it never happened? Sorry, but that goes beyond suspension of disbelief into the realm of the ridiculous! If there is one thing I always hate in movies it is wasted potential. This film was nothing BUT wasted potential. Done properly the Transformers movie could have been the next Bladerunner... the next 2001... the next Star Wars! (original trilogy, not the perequels). Instead we get this... This pathetic joke of a film.<br/><br/>I'm a G1 fanboy... I will confess to that. But I also recognize the multitude of mistakes G1 has in it and that is a very long list. It still surpasses this movies sad excuse for a plot line however. I'll just end with a quote I last used to describe the afore mentioned star wars prequels: ""It is all light and sound, signifying nothing."""

","A complete messed up movie. I couldn't believe this movie made me sleep. When i usually hear the dialog ""the whole existence of humanity is in your hands"" in any movie, I feel like shouting ""Oh come on! how many times would someone be saving us from extermination!"" Movie has more flaws than its childish dialogs. You would stop counting for flaws just in 10 minutes. I'll feel ashamed even to point out any of them. Sound is even not up to the mark, typical clang clang makes the hand resting on forehead. Only thing Michael Bay is good about is its wasting ""restlessmoney"" on graphics, but all the fighting scenes go in vain of classless camera position, with which you cant understand what is going on. Why doesn't Bay start from the basics of direction and produce a ""good"" movie? I'm afraid even under 10 may like it.<br/><br/>Rating on separate aspects: storyline = 3/10 script = 2/10 direction = 0.5/10 sound = 2/10 cinematography = 1/10 art direction = (are you kidding?)<br/><br/>complete movie = 1/10 (only for special effects) If Bay turns up somewhere before me, I'm going to ask him to return my money!"

Definitely THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SAT THROUGH. CRAP CRAP CRAP.<br/><br/>And I was actually a huge transformers fan growing up. It is a utter shame that this movie, which should have been a slam dunk for any other director, was completely fumbled by the worst director of our generation."

","Even if you are not a Transformers fan from the early 80's and 90's, you will enjoy this thrill ride. The story line is great because you don't have to know the history of the Transformers to watch it. If you know the history of Transformers, the movie brings it to life on the big screen (and not in the cartoon fashion like the Transformers - The Movie from the mid 80's). This movie really will appeal to all ages. Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg's Dreamworks team gets it right!!! You will believe that robots are in disguise. The special effects are amazing. Michael Bay with his need for BIG special effects gives it to you in spades and it goes hand in hand with the story line. I had some questions regarding the actors casted for their roles, but they worked out really well. I will go to see this again in the theaters again and again. I can only hope that the following two movies will stay as fresh as the first one and not go down the highway of other trilogies. Optimus Prime RULES!"
"Special-K88","Null","11","28","11 July 2007"," Bay's all-too-familiar approach falls flat
","Overblown, clunky sci-fi/action movie about a young high school nerd who has never had the courage to pursue his sexy, popular classmate. He reaches a milestone when he buys his first car, only to discover that the car is actually one of many sophisticated alien robots that have come to Earth to fight a definitive battle against a rival robotic race. Despite having the prestigious Spielberg name attached, the latest project from director Michael Bay is—like most of his previous efforts—swift and flashy but equally hollow and cheesy; loud and annoyingly overlong it grabs your attention with destructive action scenes and high-octane, high-tech gadgetry that move at a breakneck pace, but who cares? An abundance of eye candy can't hide its lame characters, nearly nonexistent plot, and extraordinarily stupid dialogue that lead up to a noisy, video game-like climax. With sloppy direction, a corny script, and visual effects that try but fail to leave you in awe, this one really only works on a no-brainer level. **"

","Let me explain myself. I'm a Transformers fan so when I first heard that a life action film was being made I was.......well I just couldn't wait for it to come out. Then I saw it. People please don't be fooled by the fancy special effects and the fact that there's a really hot woman thrown in as well. This film is truly awful! Don't get me wrong I like special effects and I really like hot women as well. But those two elements still doesn't shake the fact that the characters are poor (at best, in terms of how they interact and behave), the story is utterly dreadful and words fail me to explain just how bad the dialogue is. Also I was originally quite pleased when I heard that Michael Bay was the director. Bad boys, Bad boys 2, The Rock they were great films. I actually though that Bay would perhaps be the perfect man to direct Transformers. WHAT ON EARTH WENT WRONG MICHAEL! And now there making another one. I just want them to take Transformers seriously for the next film, (which I know they won't). I'd just like the focal point of the film to be the Transformer, because that's what the films called!"

"tom-longden","1","6","13","5 October 2007"," One of the worst ever films
","This is one of the worst films I have ever attempted to watch. I have to admit I have not watched it all the way through, in fact I lasted about five minutes before I started flicking through to look for the good action scenes - unfortunately there aren't any. If you like films with lots of CGI and explosions and no story, knock yourself out - literally. I am a fan of the original transformers but the two things bear no relation to each other. I think there is an increase in this kind of thing - the CGI looks like a lot is going on but in fact, there is not a lot of detail. The transforming sequences are extremely disappointing. The story is also rubbish. I cannot find anything to recommend this film. I write this review, not only to annoy my friend but also as a service to the cinema-going public. The current IMDb rating of 7.8 stars is outrageous!"
"dotmrt","1","6","13","21 September 2007"," Just another terrible comic-book movie with big budget
","Another terrible movie about kids toys that big producers are trying to make ""adult"" and ""serious"" and fail miserably. The whole transforming cgi is such a lame-ass - if one would design something similar, it would try to make the ""transformation"" as fast as possible with optimal amount of parts moving, but the damn transformation there is stretched out to look ""cool"" with the exact opposite effect, of course. And then there's the leader Optimus (seriously, what is this - is this name thought up by 9-year olds?) who tries to sound ""serious"" and ""leaderly"", but makes you want to roll eyes and find the mute-button. The writers Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and John Rogers have tried to make the story a bit less childish, but it still isn't quite ready. They have found some extremely stupid dialogue to make things either ""dramatic"" (what was that about the mystical relationship between man and car, car chooses it's driver, come on, I'm going to puke) or ""comic"" (my mom is very sensitive, don't ruin the lawn..), but make me wonder, how this kind of silliness has actually gone unnoticed. Basically we have a terrible screenplay with childish story, spiced with nice cgi and model-like girls, all that made possible by huge financing and good marketing. Amazing how this kind of empty and stupid movie can be marketed so well that it actually persuades people to go and watch it in the theater. It was a complete waste of my time, I'm only happy I didn't have to pay to watch that crap."
"rdoetjes","6","6","13","12 September 2007"," Mixed emotions about this movie
","As a 34 year old I grew up watching the Transformers animated series together with my little brother. So when finally the movie came out I was there as one of the first in line. I sad in expectations waiting for the curtains to open and see the movie.<br/><br/>The movie starts in a blaze of action when American troops get attack in Oman. I was blown away by the stunning action and visual effects. The CGI is so great that at the end when you see Shia and Optimus prime in a close up together it still looks real and very vivid, the scratches in Optimus' paint job showing the bare metal, just brilliant textures. But unfortunately not all the CGI has been done that good to reveal transforming difficulties or high speed action shots of the robots are disguised using a lot of jerky camera work and cuts. At times the camera motion is so bad that I had to force my dinner down not to ""leak fluids"" on the person in front of me. Don't get me wrong the CGI is truly really good but just to jerky for my taste.<br/><br/>The story on the other hand was a massive disappointment. A lot more could've been done with the story, it now feels as if the story was made to show of all the advanced special effects and not the other way around.<br/><br/>I also had a bit of a problem with the fact that the Transformers didn't look anything like the animated series, except for Prime in some extend. The fact that Megatron gets defeated is a bit of a shank really. Because we all know a sequel is pending with this amount of turnover. So in the next movie we will see that Starscream (who I believe wasn't caught) drags up Megatron and mends him or it; a cheap way to run into a next sequel, which I think will be made, but I hope it's not."

","As a kid i used to watch transformers every day and i was a big fan of them. So i was really looking forward to it. But i was afraid the movie was going to be a failure, like it happened (in my opinion) to previous adaptations from cartoons and video games to the big screen like superman, street fighter, the hulk and spider man among others. Thank God it wasn't anything like that. It was totally awesome, the robots looked great but i have to admit that bad guys looked cooler, plot was well adjusted and visual effects amazed me the whole movie. All people involved in this film did a great job and i know true fans out there loved it too. All i can say to sum up this comment is that it is maybe the best movie of his kind so far."
"Bungle-9","7","6","13","26 July 2007"," Tremendous fun
","I've been looking forward to this movie ever since they started thinking about it. I had such high hopes, then they announced that Michael Bay was going to do it. There was a collective ""Uh-Oh"" from everyone at this announcement given the trail of bad movies he's given us over the years. Over the course of production, the scares kept coming - Megatron's design, no Frank Welker, no Soundwave, Optimus as a different style of truck etc. Hopes started to become dashed. Until the movie came out.<br/><br/>I went to a special preview screening, found a good seat and sat down to enjoy the show, trying to forget all the negativity surrounding the movie and trying to clear my head to have an open mind. The film started. From the very opening moment when Optimus Prime started speaking, I was smiling from ear to ear. Optimus is back! So many memories and feelings flood back to me.<br/><br/>Bay made a good decision in getting stuck straight into the action. When I saw the very first transformation I just went ""wow"" in the cinema from the awe of watching it happen. The effects were amazing. All the transformations were amazing, for that matter.<br/><br/>The film was also really funny - funnier than I expected. Shia LaBoeuf does a fantastic job as the awkward hormonal teenager Sam and puts in a really convincing and funny performance. Josh Duhamel is passable as the typical standard GI Joe movie marine, though thankfully keeping his shouts of ""move"" and ""go go go!"" etc. to a minimum. Jon Voight is...well...Jon Voight. He's not bad, but his character is one of those that won't exactly stick in your head. John Turturro was incredibly funny as the Sector 7 agent Simmons, very over the top, although perhaps a little miscast. Megan Fox is true to her name as the human eye candy in the movie with an interesting back story, though her acting impact is perhaps less potent than that of Shia's. There is a very funny scene with her in Sam's bedroom though. Bernie Mac is also a legend.<br/><br/>Who cares about the humans though? We're here for the robots! The transformations were all amazing. The effects are really second to none. Megatron's design was interesting - I didn't think it was great but I'm sure it could have been a lot worse. Frenzy is funny as the angry little spy robot. Prime is brilliant and exudes leadership, but the lips thing...I'm sorry, but it just didn't wash. However, he speaks his lines like we all remember him, especially those lines that are little nods to the original series. Hugo Weaving does an alright job as the voice of Megatron, but I didn't feel it was particularly menacing - more like a standard bad guy voice.<br/><br/>There are a few gripes I have with the movie - not enough Megatron, not enough Starscream, the lubricant thing, Prime's lips, calling Brawl Devastator instead, the lack of the original theme music in any form outside the credits, the obvious product placement (some parts look like pure car adverts), the thinness of the other human plots (the hacker group working on the sound was pure silly) and sometimes the screen was just a little too busy.<br/><br/>Despite all this, the movie is clearly and easily Bay's best. Say what you want about him, he's given us some awful trash in the past, but occasionally he can put in some nice touches and exciting action, and this movie is tailor made for him. Do not expect the next Citizen Kane or Star Wars - just go in and have some fun. Well worth a watch.<br/><br/>Freedom is the right of all sentient beings."
"awpivec-1","1","6","13","4 July 2007"," Bad, yet Bay's Best!
","Let me first say that I'm not one of those crybaby geeks Michael Bay was moaning about when the movie was still under production. I assume he was referring to those 40 year old hardcore G1 fans (virgins). I couldn't have cared less about Michael Bay staying true to the original story, so long as his adaptation was worth my time. Thus, my complaints have nothing to do with this film's ""originality"". Besides, its not his script.<br/><br/>THE BAD: The story was stupid. Is that succinct? I figured not, so please allow me to break it down for you without spoiling the movie. The character development was laughable. There are several Autobots (good guys) in the film who are nothing but a name, a voice and a ""duty"" as described by Optimus. A story is supposed to be driven by characters, not CGI creations. There is one battle scene in which it is difficult to distinguish the Autobots from one another, not to mention from their enemy Deceptacons. Am I supposed to be happy that one robot kicked the other? I don't know what side he's on.<br/><br/>Additionally, none of the characters were credible. Anthony Anderson is apparently the world's most brilliant hacker, yet he doesn't seem to act half-intelligent. The Secretary of Defense walks around without body guards. He actually wields a shotgun in one scene (I hope that doesn't spoil anything. Its actually in the trailer). To Michael Bay, characters are nothing more than a name, title and appearance. <br/><br/>The plot was laughable. I don't want to give anything away, but let me just say that it lacked the slightest trace of imagination.<br/><br/>The dialog was laughable. This follows naturally from the pathetic character development. <br/><br/>THE GOOD: If you're looking for a decent comedy, watch the first hour of this film, then walk out.<br/><br/>I have to give the lead actor kudos. He did well with the script he was handed.<br/><br/>THE NEUTRAL: The perspective needed work. While I agree with Bay's assessment that this film is about the human reaction to these robots, I find that he overcomplicated that reaction. I personally think he would have been better off limiting the perspective to the Transformers, Sam and his hot girl who's name I cannot recall for the life of me. <br/><br/>This is certainly Bay's finest work. He's not a bad acting director like George Lucas. I think his flaw is a lack of imagination or vision. He can't see all of the events of this story and put together a meaning. This is why many people have complained ""I didn't feel anything"" after seeing this film.<br/><br/>In summation, do not pay to see this in theaters. Wait for the DVD, but make sure you buy handle of Vodka to help the time pass. You'll need it."

(Sans Bernie Mac whose cameo is negliable at best) The ad placement in this movie made me borderline ill, and the fact there was little to no fan service from a past series that had such a giant following and tons of material to choose from made me damn near dry heave <br/><br/>This is the kind of movies that are the reasons good films are dying, from the sub par acting to the nonsensical shallow plot, to the cliché dialog the whole thing reeks of Micheal Bay, and mediocrity which any one who takes movie making as an art form opposed to a circus should know by now are synonyms when it comes to film making.<br/><br/>I can only recommend this movie to drunken frat boys, and children that don't know any better, aside from that demographic STAY AWAY!"

I suppose it's because the film COULD have been so much more. We have a decent, blockbuster idea- giant robots bent on destroying the world- and we also have... there is also... huh. That's all. But anyway, if all the other things were better, like the clunky screenplay, the mindless direction, and the never-more-annoying Shia, this COULD have gone somewhere. <br/><br/>The biggest problem I have with the film is that it has no brain. It is just one big explosion/sound effect/giant ILM robot after the next. I like big action sequences as much as the next person, but not all the way through a 144 minute film. The actual 'Transformers' are quite hard to tell apart. Director Michael Bay obviously thought that all the visual effects would distract us from what the screenwriter hoped we would think is a plot. (Ooo! Shiny!)<br/><br/>The humor relies heavily on cheap jokes. The first is when Sam gets his pants pulled off of him by a robot. Anticipated audience reaction: HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!!!!!!! LOOK!!! BOXERS! Another scene is when the kid is being chased by his car and takes off down the street on his mom's bike, which is pink. Anticipated audience reaction: He's a guy, and- get this- he's riding on a PINK BIKE!!! Oh, the HILARITY! My sides are splitting! Oh, STOP!!! PLEASE!! NO MORE!!!!<br/><br/>There are also quite a few crude jokes in this film that just don't seem to fit. One of the transformers pees on a human. Note to whoever came up with that: Having a transformer pee on a human does not heighten our level of respect or fear of said transformer.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a film with minimal story, head-pounding action sequences and stupid jokes. If you REALLY want to see this film, I recommend watching it late at night with the sound turned right down. Don't try and follow the story because there isn't one. Just sit back and play with your iPhone until the effects/explosions come on."
"a_ogunade","8","3","5","15 July 2009"," A visual master piece.
","I remember going into this film thinking, Michael Bay, average director, average films with not much depth. But his must be his best film to date. I was simply blown away by the visual effects in this film, they where second to nothing I had seen before, he did an amazing job.<br/><br/>I like the fact that the film was humorous; it plastered over the fact that the acting bar a few was average. Most notably in this category was the newly acclaimed hotty Megan Fox, she may have the beauty but her acting skills are not on the same level, which didn't matter anyway because I was to busy admiring the robots she was talking to. I wanted to reach out and touch them they looked so real. Shia LaBeouf stood out as an actor to watch for; he put in a very decent performance The story wasn't going to win any Oscars but it was adequate enough. To be honest you aren't really going to see this film for an amazing story and a breathtaking script, if you are then you don't understand cinema.<br/><br/>On the whole this has got to be one of the most entreating films I have seen in recent years with stunning visuals and amazing action sequences. A definite must see."
"stevefriars","1","3","5","1 May 2009"," Stick with the cartoon
","Okay, so it's a film about a bunch of shape-changing robot toys by the director of Armageddon and Pearl Harbour, but then Pirates of the Caribbean was a film based on a theme park ride produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, and that turned out alright. So I did my best to approach Transformers with an open mind. And for the first half hour or so it's fine, the barely-seen giant robots providing a nice sense of menace as - this being a Michael Bay film - soldiers run around shouting at each other and firing their machine guns while everything explodes in the background and Jon Voight wears a suit and looks very earnest and jet planes take off against a vividly colour-filtered red sunset and the world's hottest female computer hacker tries to work out what's going on.<br/><br/>And then the good robots (Autobots, for the uninitiated) make their entrance and open their big metal gobs and start spouting dialogue that sounds like it's been swiped wholesale from the 80s TV series, and the film stops being a 12 rated action movie and turns into a cartoon for the under 10s. And the meagre plot runs out, leaving the film to stutter and splutter and limp feebly towards the huge climactic fight scene as the Autobots (who are sworn to protect human life!) stage their big stand against the evil robots in a heavily populated city centre, and everything goes BANG! In the end, Transformers left me with one burning question: Who is the film aimed at? If children, why are there references to an activity normally but not exclusively enjoyed by teenage boys in their bedrooms? If adults, why are the story and dialogue so childish? If the grown-up ""geek"" market, why are the good robots treated as little more than the comic relief and why does Optimus Prime's ""real face"" look so goofy? (Surely the most disappointing reveal since Darth Vader's helmet came off.) They should put this in a boxed set with the 80s Dolph Lundgren He-Man film and call it ""Why action figures don't make good live-action movies""."
"lincoln7","8","3","5","28 September 2008"," I don't understand
","OK so heres the low down on Transformers, its a big budget action flick about Robots in disguise who have come to earth in search of the ""Allspark"" which gives them life. There's two factions, the heroic Autobots and the Evil Decepticons, one tries to save humanity the other destroy it. Simple? Yes Boring and uninvolved? No.<br/><br/>I cannot believe some of things I've read about this film, yes its two hours of explosions and fights but what were we expecting here? This film is a rip roaring adventure that allows the viewer to suspend all reality and escape from the world for a bit. To sit there and say ""how do the parents not see 20ft tall robots in there back yard"", is frankly as stupid as the film that is being called stupid! Its a film, an action film which by its very nature requires the audience to suspend there belief of reality and take things as they are, which is a big ask for some I know. Not all films need to be realistic with character expansion and all the other film making ideas used in films such as Taxi Driver.<br/><br/>Now i'm no film buff, I can admit that but I know what I like and I think transformers is great fun, good characters not to taxing on the brain and it also features a great musical score! So to all those who read the ""awful, disaster"" reviews here I ask you give it a chance, give anything a chance once for that matter, you might find your self pleasantly surprised. <br/><br/>But REMEMBER suspend all belief in reality first, then and only then sit back and enjoy a great film that asks very little but gives so much!"
"jason_rogers80","9","3","5","10 September 2008"," Incredbile shoot
","This was without a doubt the most fun I've ever had on a shoot. Michael Bay was intense to work with and extremely professional. Watching a true master at work was spectacular and I was really blessed to have the opportunity. The movie, of course, was nothing short of incredible. Having been there for a good part of the shooting I wasn't prepared for the final result when I saw it for the first time at the San Diego premier. The sequels will undoubtedly be just as good.<br/><br/>It was extremely well written and the screen play was well thought out and executed. The plot line was fluid and held my attention the entire time. It held mostly true to the original series with just a few minor and necessary changes, as will any movie adaptation. All in all, it's one of those movies you can watch over and over."
"nvxx2004","8","3","5","13 August 2008"," The film was what it expected to be
","What was promised for the movie?<br/><br/>Stunning special effects: YES. That is what will impress you most.<br/><br/>For Transformers fans maybe it will be something more, but for all the others - just VERY good action movie.<br/><br/>Of course its plot is not something special, but you won't be worried about that and you won't be bored. It does not try to advance as sci-fi movie, it is more spectacle of high technological graphics. <br/><br/>Maybe you won't find it as epical as LoTR, but there was nothing more technological before!<br/><br/>About Michael Bay: Blockbusters are his forte, he deserves it ;)<br/><br/>The film won't disappoint anyone who values drive and action in movies."
"garry-butterworth","10","3","5","11 August 2008"," best movie in years!!!
","this is easily one of the best movies i have ever seen. a lot of people have been negative about it but i can honestly say i don't understand where the huge problem is. or those people themselves. what a sad life they must really lead. i think it is excellently paced and intelligently written given the source material. and going into this movie expecting Shakespeare just confirms that you're not all there, are you? i'm a transformers fan, and while i still adore transformers, in my older age i can see faults in the old TV shows. but i honestly thought this eliminated all those faults, they really put a lot of effort in here and applied plenty of verisimilitude to the situation. i read a lot of people complain about the military being involved? as if they wouldn't be involved! thats what would happen. i was so glad the human characters were written so that they're not taken too seriously, it was nothing like American pie, the funny situations in between were perfectly paced and played through extremely well, the first time i saw it, at certain moments in the film i laughed out loud, and i never do that at the movies. therefore, it works. and then there's the action, i still get goosebumps now. the cgi is flawless. the optimus prime in this is now easily my favourite version of optimus prime. its funny, as i write this review i think, i'm starting to sound like a giddy kid. and that, is the greatest thing that was achieved here, making me feel like a kid again. i just want to hug everyone involved in the making of this film. surpassed my expectations."
"adragonfang18","9","3","5","9 August 2008"," Hmmm...
","Loved the movie. Great visual effects, but some scenes are too close. fight scenes between transformers too close to see it, and you get lost on who is who, or who gets hit.<br/><br/>If you want to make a statement that they are big, but zoom out to recognize a fight, at least make some cars nearby for people to compare. <br/><br/>Also I want to put this in FAQ's but too cheap to pay for membership. *spoiler*<br/><br/>When they have a test of the AllSpark's power with the nokia... Whouldn't the machine that gets touched with the power of the AllSpark that relays the energy to the nokia get turned into a transformer also???<br/><br/>*end spoiler*"
"psfrag26","10","3","5","22 July 2008"," best movie ever
","This is the best movie I have ever seen and when I first heard about it I didn't even want to give it a chance. I thought to myself, why would they make a real movie about little toys. Naturally, I refused to see it then after everyone giving it raving reviews I figured I'd give it a try. First of all the plot was fantastic but the graphics were by far the best ever in a movie. They made the robots transition flawlessly from robot to vehicle. And just to put the icing on the cake I loved the acting and I thought Shia Labeouf did an absolutely fantastic job. Finally, Megan Fox...wow.. she did a good job but honestly if she didn't no one would have noticed because she is so beautiful. But all and all the movie at a little bit of everything and I am so happy I watched it!!"
"the_ghostman0","9","3","5","16 July 2008"," By all means a really great film.....
","Firstly, I'm no Transformers fan. I have absolutely no idea what the Transformers universe was based on or what the cartoons were about. I cannot, therefore, relate this movie to the cartoons.<br/><br/>I have, however, heard of Transformers when I was a kid from commercials and watching some cartoons here and there. When I heard about the coming of this film, I honestly thought it would be sort of corny.......BOY was I WRONG! This film brought back the sensation of ""Damn those humans have nnnoooo idea what they're dealing with!!"" just as it was brought in with the ""Aliens"" movie. The CGI was astoundingly realistic. I don't think I've ever seen graphics so convincing since ""The Matrix"". The transformations the Transformers undertook was incredible. They seamlessly transform from vehicles to their full forms. And during combat, these transformations brought the bullet-time moments as was in ""The Matrix"". For those familiar with ""Armageddon"", they'll feel the same feelings when watching this film.....<br/><br/>The only thing I really didn't like with this film is that the BIG brawl between the Autobots and the Decepticons took place in a city.....which gives a really uncomfortable claustrophobic feel considering these Transformers are large and need some room. Had the setting been more larger, I'm sure the audience would've appreciated the fights more. However, this downside is replaced with lots of damage and explosions that appeal to the eye.<br/><br/>Other than that, ""Transformers"" is a terrific film. Its the kind of film that I could watch more than once. I honestly don't know why some people gave this film horrible reviews but.......after all, not all movies taste good to others.....at least, I certainly enjoyed this one!!!"
"Zombie-Kermit","7","3","5","23 May 2008"," Flawed, Yet Still Very Fun
","This movie is by no means a challenging one. But I honestly can't see what people expected from a movie about alien robots that change into cars. <br/><br/>THE GOOD: The Special effects were awesome. Going into the movie I was prepared for cheesy looking robots. I didn't really think something like that would look good in a live action movie. It wasn't really a concern but I sure am glad I was wrong. They looked really good. Definitely a strong point in the movie. Being a Michael Bay movie of course there is plenty of explosions and such. And I am a simple man. Put giant robots in a movie with lots of explosions and I will be happy. I also don't think Shia was given enough credit for his role. He didn't really have the best lines, but he was very good in his delivery of most of them. He brought some humour to a role that was written to try and be funny, but many of the lines would not have worked if not delivered by someone with talent. He is a better actor than people give him credit for. Megan Fox didn't do to badly herself. The last half hour of the movie was really cool and really captured the way this sort of movie should be.<br/><br/>THE BAD: They may have pulled of not being cheesy with the robot's looks, but they didn't do very well with the dialog of the movie. The teen romance plot just seemed unnecessary, and seemed to drag on for a lot longer than was needed. I think Bay may have included in response to people who think his movies are just popcorn flicks. That sort of thing just doesn't seem to work in his movies, and it really didn't work in something that would have worked better as a popcorn movie. The characters were all pretty one dimensional and clichéd. For example Shia's character is a lovable loser and Megan's is a beautiful, but misguided girl.<br/><br/>All in all it was a very enjoyable movie that I was more than happy to buy on DVD after seeing it at the cinema. It was in no way perfect, but I am willing to accept the flaws. I found the movie a lot of fun and that's really all I wanted going into it.<br/><br/>At this point a sequel looks very good.<br/><br/>7.5 Out of 10"
"luisdim7","10","3","5","29 February 2008"," A Master piece
","I saw Trasformers in Colombia for firs time like in July 23 or 22, and I say that this was a piece of god's was an robot war masterpiece. This movie show as what Michael Bay can do, he first show as a space adventure at Armagedonwere he became famous and then a wonderful movie of he world war II, Pearl Harbor, this was an awesome movies, but not so great like Transformers, Trasformers was much better than Armagedon or Pearl Harbor, Transformers have, Espectacular Special Effect's has a good cast and have all the appropriate thing's to made a war movie like Trasformers, and like say in the comment of (Don't shy away transformers is not a kid movie) that comment is truth, because Trasformers is a war movie that have little blood and have some thing's not appropriate for kid's. Trasformers have a good rating here but I think that it deserve much better, but was a good rating, Trasformers is a wonderful master piece and i think that Trasformers deserved the Visual effect Oscar, Because Golden Compass was a horrible move it wasen't a good movie and the Visual effect weren't that so great. Transformers i think that is Michael Bay's first masterpiece, this was an awesome movie."

I watched it again the next day, and was overcome with emotion. i am a very sensitive person, and was moved to tears, especially when bumblebee is captured, and continued to cry for quite some time afterward. ha ha, what can i say?

Transformers is a adaption from the popular TV series of Transfomrers and I will be the first to say when I think that The film succeeds the cartoon.

I expected good special effects and film made especially for teens (-> not much complicated at all) so my expectations were filled. In addition, I saw a good piece of comedy e.g. when Anthony Anderson as Glenn Whitmann was getting across to one of the soldiers that the scratches on the base's wall are not made by Freddy Krueger but by Wolverine. I've also read some of other review here and I just must quote chrishayes737: ""This movie is 10/10 no question about that."" So, this is an excellent movie! :D :D :D"

","I walked into the cinemas looking forward to another Fun summer movie (Spiderman 3, Pirates ETC) At first the film blew me away with it's special effects. It looked fantastic, it was loud, and it brought all of my childhood characters to life. So i walked out of the cinemas very pleased but not as pleased as other films i saw earlier in the summer. <br/><br/>Acting- It was terrible. Megan Fox. Shes eye candy, but thats all. Shia did an awesome job. All of the robot Voices (Especially Optimus prime) were fantasitic, Megatron was interesting. But i think the worst actor was Rachael Taylor. Who ever casted her must have been deaf, because you cant hardly understand her. <br/><br/>The story was not very good, very little story, it was just a Special Effects extravaganza, It was a WWE Deathmatch With Hasbro Action figures. It was pretty to watch but thats pretty much all. It's a fun film but thats all, I enjoyed Spiderman 3 A bit more because of the interesting story."
"tdawgg29","10","3","5","23 October 2007"," Best Summer film EVER!!!
","Transformers: The Motion Picture is by far one of the most surprising Summer blockbuster pictures ever made. It is about a teenager who holds the key to the cube. Led by Optimus Prime, of the heroic Autobots, they wage their war against Megatron and the evil Decepticons. The biggest surprise in this picture is the voice of Prime belongs to Peter Cullen of the 1984-87 Sunbow/Marvel cartoon series of the same film title. The only downfall of the film is they do not have Frank Welker's voice of Megatron, but it's forgiven.<br/><br/>Filled with stunning visual effects, comedy, and human drama, this is without a shadow of doubt the BEST action film of the Summer. If I were you, I would personally buy the 2-disc set. It contains exclusive behind the scenes including the movie trailer. Transformers: The Motion Picture earns an A+. Way to go, Michael Bay!!!"
"alex-c-3","10","3","5","8 September 2007"," I saw it twice already!!! It blew me away
","Oh my god! When I saw the trailer, I was pretty excited about a fact that I will get the opportunity to watch theatrical version of my favorite cartoon ever. But after I've seen it, I actually don't have any desire to watch the cartoon anymore. The movie was that good!<br/><br/>The drama, battle scenes, Megan Fox and stuff will make this movie one of my favorite movies ever. I couldn't believe how all the pieces came together so well and so emotional. The very first scene will blow you away (if you have seen the film, you'll know what I mean).<br/><br/>Shia LeBouf did an amazing job there. I'm pretty sure that he is going to be one of the most wanted and one of the best very soon (you could watch him in Disturbia,a great film with, again, a great looking female). But she cannot measure with Megan, who is maybe the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. at the half of the movie, I wanted to marry her.<br/><br/>It is also good to see that director, Michael Bay, put a lot of humor in the movie, and Anthony Anderson and John Torturo was charged for that segment. Yhe film also has some famous veterans, such as John Voight, bu also some very young and talented actors, like LeBouf himself and that soldier guy with wife and kid (I forgot his name).<br/><br/>All in all, the best movie, the hottest girls and our favorite heroes - Transformers.

But don't lay into how silly that story is if you're going to defend the story of the transformers, which is, let's face it, pretty stupid to begin with. ""Our world was created by a powerful artifact, then destroyed by the evil robots who want to use it's power for evil, so we threw it into space to stop them, now we've come here to stop them again because we're the awesome good robots, defenders of mankind""... oh please.<br/><br/>At this point, you might be thinking I hated the movie, but you'd be wrong - it was awesome entertainment. The transformers are great, the action scenes are great, the music is great, Megan Fox is a fox (ahahaha like that pun hasn't been done a million times already), the nerdy-bloke-wins-fair-lady's-heart story is feel-good fun, there's plenty of laughs.

"craigsomerville","Null","3","5","25 July 2007"," Certainly ""More than meets the eye""
","OK I'm rating this movie on the basis of what it is- A sci-fi movie about big robots that can transform into mechanical objects on earth.<br/><br/>This is an event movie, a summer blockbuster, a no brains action/comedy film. I will not give this the critical eye of which I might give when reviewing something like the ""English Patient"" or the ""Constant Gardener"". This film is not trying to be anything other than what I described above.<br/><br/>So is it any good?! Well yes it is, many elements of the film are extremely well conceived and pulled off.<br/><br/>The Cast- Well that was OK, Shia LeBeouf plays the character of Sam Witwicky with charisma, style and competence. I great find for mainstream cinema. The rest of the cast don't have much to do or input into the story. Megan Fox certainly looks stunning, but it stops there, Josh Duhamel provides some slight acting gravitas, but is under-used. Sam's parents played by Kevin Dunn and Julie White both give fantastically likable performances. Overall the casting and performance of the cast was pretty good if not spectacular.<br/><br/>The Effects- Well hats of to them, this film is quite the spectacle thanks to those extraordinary CGI robots. All of them good and bad look absolutely amazing. This movie has a Jurrasic park feel to it regarding CGI, you feel that you are witnessing the next step of effects.<br/><br/>The Story/Script- OK lets pass on this one, its a let down, not much to it and very weak. I think they certainly could have put a little more effort into this than they obviously did.<br/><br/>Direction- Typical Michael Bay, loads of explosions, loads of jumpy camera movements, loads of slow-motion, loads of sunlight, etc etc...... Overall I was satisfied with what he did.<br/><br/>Overall- 2 hours of class no brain entertainment, its funny, charming at times, and exceptionally well made. As I'm from the generation that played with the original toys and watched the G1 cartoons I wasn't that disappointed about the changes. So go along, pay your money then sit back and enjoy a fantastic spectacle.<br/><br/>******** out of ********** <br/><br/>Points lost for poor character arc's and a pretty weak plot and script. As a comedy action event movie its pretty good, and in my opinion is a much more entertaining than all the other sequel event movies so far this year.....Spider-man and Captian Jack better watch their backs, as there are new boys in town......"

"geordie2410","10","3","5","21 July 2007"," A Great Movie!!!!!!!!!!!
","This film doesn't disappoint, A great film with a good plot. The amount of original series plots is great, with just enough taken from the new series for the young to understand and enjoy. This movie is a great starting point for a few more at least.<br/><br/>Though there is a couple of problems in my opinion:- <br/><br/>1. Bumbleebee is a Camero, I know why this was done and understand, though it's still a disappointment considering during his first scene he's featured next to a Classic VW Bettle<br/><br/>2. More of the original voices couldn't appear <br/><br/>3. The Decepticons used their own language under translation printing their language then over-copying ours, just as in Wing Comander. Personally I think this only works when the language is real and not random. <br/><br/>They kept enough humour in, as a viewer of the original series now would see, to keep us entertained and keep it light for the older generation, while also keeping it as much to a kids film as the plot could sustain.<br/><br/>The best points I left for last, they are. <br/><br/>The fact a line voted for on the Transformer Movie 2007 was included and one from the original run and the fact that Peter Cullen, the original Optimus Prime, did the voice for the one and Only Optimus Prime and with enough difference, yet recognisable as the same. <br/><br/>This movie got a ovation when watched, that should tell you how good it is!"

","I was eager to see this movie since I am familiar with the old animation version which I don't remember quite well. I'm writing this comment 10 minutes after seeing the movie. I can only say that it's one of my favorite movies. I'm not a true fan of sci-fi or genres alike, perhaps because I am a girl, but this movie just took my breath away. The robots were exquisitely rendered, the transformation was flawless and fascinating. I could not stop feeling that tension throughout the movie. It just kept me there and did not bore me at all, not for a second. There were some very funny moments in the movie which made me laugh sincerely and I do not usually laugh when watching movies because I usually find the humor too dumb. However, here it was different. I did not expect such humorous moments but they were well-balanced and gave me a great pleasure. I saw some bad comments about the movie, stating that it is for morons and I strongly disagree with such statements. Everybody has their opinion and view and they can judge for themselves. The movie is a must see for this year. I truly recommend it to all people of all ages - it is a great entertaining movie."
"lukepic123","10","3","5","21 July 2007"," Wow, that was a nice surprise.

"pavel28","10","3","5","21 July 2007"," Michael Bay did it again!
","First of all I'd like to say that this movie is not for children! None of Bay's movies are for children... I saw how couple parents with their children were leaving in the middle of the movie.<br/><br/>Michael Bay has visual and vocal signatures in all of his movies. And as I heard that this movie was his creation, I went to theater without a doubt. I was greatly surprised, because it overcame my expectations. The visual effects are as real as life. The movie is spectacularly dynamical. The actors are fresh, and the jokes are really funny.<br/><br/>I presume that most of you saw the trailer... Well, whatever you see in the trailer, the whole movie is like it and a lot more - Masterpiece!<br/><br/>Great work Michael!!!"
"Beowulf-29","10","3","5","20 July 2007"," Far More than Meets the Eye
","Michael Bay has outdone himself, and may not be able to do this great until ""Transforers II."" <br/><br/>Overall, the movie was pleasing to Transformers fans, and non. I appreciated the use of the ""transforing sound effect"" but not an over use of it. The references to the original 1984 movie were great; ""Autobots, roll out""; Megatron's relationship with Starscream; and to take the cake, when Megatron and Optimus Prime meet, the immortal line, ""One shall stand, and one shall fall."" Peter Cullan as Prime was amazing, and could not have been any other way. This movie was extremely pleasing to me, as I have followed Transforers all of my life. <br/><br/>But, what makes this movie pleasing to non-Transforers fans? I'm about to tell you. <br/><br/>The special effects in this movie were amazing. If there is anyone out there who likes explosions and giant robots duking it out, or just an old fashioned good versus evil film, this is your movie. The movie was also quite comedic, which was great. The cinematography was excellent, especially in the robot fight sequences. <br/><br/>As a devout Transformers fan, and also a movie lover, I rate this movie at 10 out of 10; 10 of 10 in special effects; 10 of 10 in story; 10 of 10 in action; 10 of 10 in directing. I strongly suggest this movie for anyone, and I mean anyone, because it appeals to all interests. <br/><br/>""Autobots, roll out!"""
"msghana","10","3","5","19 July 2007"," Absolutely excellent!!!!!!!
","When I saw the first trailer which was only a few seconds long, something deep in my soul stirred. An excitement gathered to the point that I almost burst with anticipation......and I was NOT disappointed.<br/><br/>The movie was absolutely fantastic! By far, the best sci-fi-meets-action film I have EVER seen. 5 minutes into it I already knew I was going to see it at least 2 more times.<br/><br/>Lead character was funny and easy to relate to. It was like being a kid sitting in front of the TV again except now it is as awesome as it should be when you imagined them being real. I will see this again...and so will you!!!!!! Now I'm just waiting for the Thundercats movie!!!!"
"ecm-9","10","3","5","18 July 2007"," great movie for the summer
","I thought this movie was awesome! So far, I've seen it twice, and I'm about to see it again for the third time. Heck, it was the best movie, in my opinion, this year. It's as original as ""Stargate SG-1""(If you're a ""Stargate SG-1"" fan, then you know why ""Transformers"" is/will be awesome). This movie is action packed, and it's science fiction!!! I'm 33, and I remember when Marvel first released ""Transformers"" in a four limited issue comic book series (I have them, by the way). Then the toys came out. I really felt young again watching this movie. <br/><br/>I'm glad they decided to make this movie in our recent times versus attempting to make it in the 1990s. Look what happened to ""Spawn"".<br/><br/>Anyways, you have to see it, if you haven't. ""Transformers"" is ""Transformers"", and it was made with the skills and creativity by those who made it. ""Transformers"" is not ""Star Wars"", and it's not ""Stargate SG-1"". Don't try to compare it to anything other then itself."
"ChrisCTD-1","10","3","5","7 July 2007"," Transformers Director's Cut
","I thought the film was great action flick it was something I have been waiting for all summer. <br/><br/>It gave a good setup for Autobot city to be built in the next movie and for Megatron to return and build his underwater base. It also opens up possibilities of the dinobots being built in the next film along with devastator.<br/><br/>The movie had a good running time of 2 hours and 24 minutes but I keep wondering if their is a lot more that was cut from this film that would of really flush out character and story development. <br/><br/>Does anyone know how long the original cut of this film ran and what was cut out?"
"Lord_Crypto","9","3","5","7 July 2007"," Transformers: Perhaps more than meets the eye?
","I grew up a huge fan of the Transformer TV series, the original one in the 80's. I have some of the episodes on cassette and I want to buy the entire series on DVD. That is how much I like the show and it was the best cartoon series of all time in my opinion. The movie Transformers, in my opinion, would make the cartoon proud. It is an absolutely stunning and brilliantly-made film.<br/><br/>The special effects of this film are great. The designs and interpretations of the Transformers are incredible, far beyond what I was expecting. The fight scenes are even better! Just imagine two 100-foot tall transformers going at one another! And the Transformer vs. Transformer battles are not just great, but the Transformer vs. Human battles are good too! The effects are so real as well! Not for a second did I think the effects were overdone or ridiculously fake. The special effects of this film are beyond belief and what they do to the Transformer characters. Although most of the Transformers lost their original exoskeleton designs for the movies, I was not displeased with their new exoskeleton designs.<br/><br/>Acting is pretty solid in this film. Shia Lebeouf, Jon Voight, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, and even Bernie Mac deliver good performances. The thing I like about the movie is that it takes a serious approach to the Transformers. But it still keeps a lot of humor in the movie. And it is not even stupid humor, it is good, solid, funny humor. A lot of it will either come from Shia Lebeouf, Bernie Mac, or the Transformers which I really like.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved the music in the film. I felt like I was watching Batman Begins and that was fantastic. The music was terrific, I might even buy the soundtrack. The sound was great as well, just hearing the Transformers transform was terrific. The story is fantastic as well. Some of the most crucial Transformers and Decepticons are put into the movie. The story builds up more and more as it goes. I kept getting more on edge as the movie went on and I like that in a film. I disliked how they handled the story with Sam and his ""girlfriend"" Mikaela. It seemed stupid and unnecessary. Other than that, the story is easy to follow and easy to get drawn into.<br/><br/>Finally, the Transformers themselves. I will admit, I was worried about there not being enough original and recognizable Transformers in the film but I was wrong. I do wish they had more with the Transformers in the movie though. The movie seemed to focused on the humans and not enough on the title characters. Other than that, the characters are great. They bring in 5 of the biggest characters as the core group of the Autobots which was wonderful to see. Peter Cullen voices Optimus Prime and all I can say is I think we need to give the guy an award. Lets get him an Oscar nomination, Please. Because whenever I hear him talk, my heart just starts racing. Megatron is voiced wonderfully by Hugo Weaving. You can barely tell it is Weaving because his voice is covered by a metallic voice-over which sounds terrific. I admit, I had a hard time deciphering Bumblebee. Although there is a reason for it, I had a hard time hearing him. I disliked Starscream in the movie. He looked really awkward (like a gorilla) and I was disappointed with his character. I do not want to be a spoiler, so I won't tell you any more Transformers although I would absolutely love to discuss them. One small thing, I wish Cullen would have done the voice of another Transformer in the movie. That is all I am saying!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Transformers is more than meets the eye. I was expecting a mediocre movie and I got a terrific movie. One of the best films I have seen this year. And if you think Peter Cullen should get an Oscar nod for his performance as Optimus Prime, make a comment on my ""comment"". Maybe than we can convince the Academy Awards!"
"Foosnickens-1","10","3","5","6 July 2007"," Awesome
","I spent 3 years of my childhood playing with transformers. To see them come alive in a movie like this brought me back to being a little kid. To See the characters comes to life was moving because these toys had a huge impact on my childhood. I played with these toys almost everyday form went hey came out until I was 11 or so. The action scenes were nothing short from spectacular. The actors were all perfectly balanced through out the entire movie. The voices of the transformers were also prefect. This was the best sci-fi movie I have scene since the Star Wars series. Being 31 and now a father to have a movie take be back in time is such a treat because it does not happen anymore to me."
"rydangel-1","8","3","5","6 July 2007"," Transformers
","Seeing the previews I wasn't sure I would like the film beyond the effects. The effects looked amazing, and they truly were. However the film was actually a lot of fun. No wonder Michael Bay did Victoria Secret commercials, the man knows what is hot. The cars, the chick, the shots, the music, all very hot.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is actually really good. It's got great comedy, great acting, great music, and great mix of stories. It's paced well, shot well and contagious. The second half left a bit to be desired. The dialogue between Optimus and Sam was a bit lame and too filled with positive messages for kids, as was the dialogue between Optimus and Megatron. They could have gotten the same message across in less cheese. In addition, the fight sequences between the robots were not nearly as cool as everyone wants them to be. While the effects are good and life-like, the coverage of the fights left a lot to be desired. Not only was it hard to see the actual fight, the fighting wasn't even that cool. You know you're not alone in this when in the beginning the whole audience is cheering, and by the end you hear the odd ""whoo"" and that's it. With that said, we all clapped at the end because it really was a cool film with great characters that you want to watch. I know I'll buy this when it's on DVD, in fact, I can't wait."
"jlauro9","8","3","5","5 July 2007"," An incredible visual display but it could have been much better
","Growing up on the ""Transformers"" I knew I would see this movie and I pretty much got what I thought I would get. The thing about a movie directed by Michael Bay is you know what your going to get just like you know what your going to get when you see a movie directed by Martin Scorsese or Tarantino. First off, even though I am not a huge fan of big Summer blockbusters and movies loaded with CGI, I must admit that this movie has some of the most awe inspiring action sequences I have ever seen on film. I must hand it to Michael Bay for being a master of the visual but god is his storytelling really bad. I just could care less if the characters in all of his movies died. The writing is so corny with all the usual lame one liners and cameos by the usual suspects like Bernie Mac. Even with all the flaws I looked the other way because the robots looked so great. My main problem with the film was that they could have made it so much more authentic to the cartoon. Basically taking the best elements of each. For example, in the original show the transformers get most of the dialogue. In the movie the Decepticons barely talk to each other at all. What the hell is that ? Starscream and Megatron don't even resemble the original characters at all but I must admit Optimus Prime is very cool except for him having lips. They even got the original voice which was a nice touch. I am actually hoping for a sequel because I am hoping they will fix some of the problems that kept this from being one of my favorite action movies ever. To capture the true flavor of the original the movie must be a little darker at least for me. It's about a civil war for god sakes ! Of course I know that Hollywood will always compromise quality for money. I know they have to sell toys and market to kids and adults. Overall, I got what I expected and the action scenes made up for the lame dialogue and story. I finally found a Michael Bay movie that I can watch. It's a miracle."
"rkj3cr","10","3","5","5 July 2007"," Better than hoped for
","My husband and I saw this movie with our three sons who grew up with Transformers on TV and owned many of the toys. We were all very pleased. When Optimus Prime transformed, it was like seeing an old friend again after many years. The special effects were outstanding, the updates to current times were appropriate, and the actors met the challenge very nicely. The cooperation of the military certainly gave this movie a measure of authenticity and that wonderful credibility that sucks you right into the story. The scenes with the parents dragged some and were corny, but the Autobots were as great as ever and the Deceptions were as despicable as ever. It's going to be a tough act to follow. I hope the sequel won't be a disappointment."
"stmdk","9","3","5","5 July 2007"," One of the better remakes.
","Being 35 years old, I spent many of hours with my eyes planted on the cartoon series. Before going to see this movie I was VERY worried that this was going to be another blown opportunity at making a movie based on one of my childhood shows, of which there are many horrible examples! I'm not easy to please.<br/><br/>First of all, one must realize that there will ALWAYS be some discrepancies between the old shows and a new movie. Also we must remember that no one is going to make a movie unless there is a chance at making money. You just cannot judge a movie if you're determined to nitpick before you view it. A lot of the negativity is coming from people that expect perfection and go into a movie looking for reasons to be dissatisfied.<br/><br/>People have complained about everything from the high velocity twisting when transforming to the paint jobs. I mean c'mon, get over it! It's a modern interpretation of the old show, ITS NOT THE CARTOON SERIES.<br/><br/>Overall I thought the movie was great. It was packed with high action graphics and humor. The first battle scene was awesome! The cameras were set a bit too close on some scenes, either to put the images more in your face or to hide imperfections. The characters (robot) personalities were not entirely true to the old show but extremely close. The heroic and self sacrificing nature of autobots was left intact as well as the dark nature of the decepticons. A few of them got wasted but remember this is Transformers, anyone can come back, and the movie definitely left room for the future.<br/><br/>I left feeling extremely pleased with the movie. To see it in this modern form was a real pleasure. I can confidently say that Hollywood managed to avoid crushing another one of my childhood joys. It is one of the best movie remakes I've seen and I'm glad they did it. I look forward to taking my kids to see it so they can share in the same story that I loved as a kid.<br/><br/>Go see it! At the very least, it's worth the ticket price."
"yorel01","7","3","5","5 July 2007"," Wow, amazing, beautiful and just plain great finally a real blockbuster!
","I have to say I have seen some of the positive reviews for Transformers and expected it to be good, but what I didn't expect was for it to be amazing. This is far and away better than the other so called blockbusters of the summer. It has the best CGI I've ever seen. There war a lot of awesome action which was expected, but it also has surprisingly good acting. It is very well written, and there are lots of very funny lines, but they never come across as cheesy. The entire film just works. Shia Lebouf, after Disturbia and this phenomenal film, is on his way to super stardom. This is a must see if you grew up with Transformers, and if you did not its still a must see. I pray for a sequel if they can do it right. Go see Transformers and you will see what a blockbuster should be!"
"hobojo76","8","3","5","5 July 2007"," OMG! CG mother load!
","There hasn't been a REALLY BIG 4 of July movie since Independence Day, but now enters Transformers. Based on the Hasbro actions figure that have been around for forever, we now find the robotic heroes/villains in search of a cube. But I bet you're wondering, ""What does a 6 sided 3D figure have to with this movie?"" Well apparently this cube called the Allspark is the center of a war between the Autobots (good guys) and the Desepticons (bad guys), and the Desepticons have followed it to Earth. Go figure. Now Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBouf) and the ""girl of his dreams,"" Mikala (Megan Fox) have to team up with Optimus Prime and the Gang to find the Allspark before the Desepticons do. Ooooo! Like it says in the title of this comment this movie is almost entirely CG. All of the Transformers are beautifully done, so much so that you can see almost every little gear shift as they move. The ""morph"" sequences are beautifully done, as well, if a little rushed. The only issues though it that during the fight scenes(of which there are lots!), it's hard to distinguish the good from the bad. I also have to give props to all of the actors in this movie. I can't imagine how hard it must have been to try and act with a little tennis ball have to represent a giant robot.<br/><br/>Its a great movie that really anyone over about 11 should see. GO SEE IT!"
"Reel_movie_geek","8","3","5","5 July 2007"," Transformers delivers
","TRANSFORMERS DELIVERS (Warning: spoilers) <br/><br/>Similar in theme to other Spielberg projects, director Michael Bay never lets Transformers sink into ""hopeless impending doom"" as did War of the Worlds. This is a lighter, video game of a film.<br/><br/>Humor pervades the screenplay. One could almost classify Transformers as a comedy. However, some gags work better than others. The ""bee-otch"" air freshener inside Sam's used yellow and black Camaro and male-centric lines like ""bro's before ho's"" seem to annoy some critics. Apparently they forgot their second decade.<br/><br/>The prodigy computer analyst (played by Rachael Taylor) and the car mechanic love interest (played by Megan Fox) fill out the mostly male cast. Despite overt pin-up poses by both actors, the traditional ""woman-in-jeopardy"" stereotype is mostly absent.<br/><br/>While there is little development with the other characters, the ""Bumblebee"" robot and Sam Witwicky (played by Shia LaBeouf) are given a wide space to grow. <br/><br/>Welsey Morris of The Boston Globe describes the scene when the lead character (Sam) brings the robots to his home: ""That little actionless sequence, with its playful comedy and light suspense, is a side of the director we haven't seen before. Steven Spielberg is one of this movie's producers, and these scenes imply his influence. The delicate touch on display for these 20 or so minutes, which feel like some of the quieter scenes in the 'Jurassic Park' movies, prove that Bay can do more than crush bones. They also suggest that finesse in a blockbuster might be the most mind-blowing special effect of all."" <br/><br/>Bay managed to do two toy movies: ""GI Joe"" and ""Transformers"" with a single budget, showcasing some of the newest military technology. At times, the film smells like a propaganda piece. When the Rumsfeldesque character (played by Jon Voight) says, ""losing is not an option for these guys,"" there were both cheers and jeers. <br/><br/>In a climactic moment, Sergeant Lennox (played by Josh Duhamel) tells Sam, ""you're a soldier now."" This Arthurian scene (from which I did not cringe like some of my viewing-room neighbors) formed the acme of Sam Witwicky's character arc. This is fantasy, after all.<br/><br/>There are so many elegant moments in this film, it is easy to submit to the sledgehammer fireworks and blatant product placement.<br/><br/>It has been a long time since I witnessed an audience ovation while the credits rolled. I was reminded of Indiana Jones, Empire and ET, and it made me want to go play a round of Zaxxon at the 7-11.<br/><br/>We buy our tickets and our overpriced popcorn expecting no less."
"pudge20","9","3","5","5 July 2007"," Excellent Movie
","I must say that I was totally surprised at how amazing this movie was. I am an old Transformers fan from my childhood and I kind of knew I was going to love it unless it really blew. However, I went with five other people who had varying degrees of Transformers knowledge (my buddy's girlfriend never heard of them) and all of us thought it was an excellent movie. It seemed like there was just enough romance, comedy and drama to satisfy all moviegoers. But the actions sequences were really the amazing stuff. I would highly recommend seeing this movie. Also, as an old school fan, I was not mad at how they portrayed the transformers or other characters, nor did I nitpick about plots not synching up. I enjoyed it for what it was worth.<br/><br/>Also, if you can see this on an HD screen, DO IT! We were totally blown away."
"jaysamaluvsya","9","3","5","5 July 2007"," Waiting 20+ years For This Movie..
","I went to see Transformers today.. a little fearful. I had been hearing bad things from critics about the movie. Keep in mind.. Transformers were my bread and butter when I was a kid. Ever since they first came on the scene in the early 80's, I've followed them through their various incarnations. And some of them were just gawdawful. And now it's 2007, 20+ years since the very first series. I loved it. ~There is action from the very first, when Blackout lands in the military base, and you know something bad is coming. And he dishes it out. ~I was afraid that the way Bumblebee communicated would be cheesy.. but it was actually very cute. I liked it. ~You could feel Megatron's contempt for the humans, even uttering 'fleshling' once. Love it. ~The little comedic opportunities by the Autobots weren't awkward either, most were genuinely funny. The different personalities of each Autobot stood out. ~Megan Fox is so hot. ~I didn't like the fact there was one death.. I'll say no more to prevent spoilers. ~Shia was REALLY great in this. He was the quintessential awkward kid who wants to try and get the attention of the local hot babe. In this he's such a great performer, very convincing. And the way he and Bumblebee bonded during the movie was really very touching. When Bumblebee was being captured by Sector 7, very cool. ~Megan Fox is so hot. ~I really need to make comment on Optimus Prime. A lot of people complained about his overall looks (ZOMG WHY DOES HE HAVE The FLAMEZ?!). I happen to like the way he looks, the way they all look now in this redesign. But more than that.. 20 years later, Optimus Prime is STILL the man. He just is. He is the true heroic archetype to me. When Ironhide asks why they need to protect humans (he doesn't see them as worth it at first), Prime speaks with a real wisdom. Over and over he demonstrates just why he's the leader.<br/><br/>If you're a fan at all of the Transformers, in any of it's incarnations, I really recommend this movie. Literally everyone I've spoken to who has seen it (9 people and counting) said they love it, and most have seen it at least twice. If you're a fan of big (in scale and cost) movies, then this could be very pleasing for you. It's an unconventional alien invasion movie. Think Independence Day (the non-suckass parts), mixed with some great car chases, the scale of Jurassic Park, and add a little dash of E.T., and you have a summer blockbuster."
"stonecoldmark","9","3","5","5 July 2007"," My favorite movie of the summer and that says a lot
","What is easily the best non sequel movie of the summer. Transformers is the most action packed, fun thrill ride of a movie I have seen in many years. I saw an 11:40 pm screening of this movie at the Arclight Cinerama Dome in Hollywood, with a sold out crowd.<br/><br/>This movie is better than I could have ever imagined. I have always enjoyed Bay's flair for flash and trash, this guy should have directed Miami Vice. He knows cars, and car chases better than anyone today. and this movie is no different. Action scenes so packed you have to see it again just to grasp it all. Great pacing between a national security storyline and a boy and his car, woven perfectly together.<br/><br/>The movie is fun, over the top and funny in all the right places. Megan Fox is the resident hot chick and the entire movie plays to the inner teenager in all of us. My only regret is my 2 year old son is not old enough to view this with me.<br/><br/>The first movie I'll be seeing a second time in the theater!<br/><br/>best movies thus far:<br/><br/>Transformers Die Hard 4 Knocked Up Pirates 3 Spidy 3"

Aside from some pacing issues in the middle of the film, I actually found it quite enjoyable. So much so, I actually want to see it again. I was even delightfully surprised that they managed to have to robots talk and communicate without making the film completely absurd.<br/><br/>Overall, It was a fantastic film, and as long as they can maintain this quality, I look forward to a sequel.<br/><br/>Now I can worry about G.I.

"mcewenks","8","3","5","5 July 2007"," great movie for the summer heat, but felt a tiny bit lacking
","first of all, the michael bay's editing has taken a huge amount of flak over the frenetic feel of the action sequences. I would like to point out that the movie was from a human perspective, we see the battles as a bystander would, does it make for as cool a film? Not really, but the objective served it's purpose, it was a decision that added cohesion to the film. All in all it was a great movie that deserves kudos for a conversion that pleases both fans and non-fans alike. My only complaint is that the movie occasionally didn't know whether it should take it's source material seriously or just have fun with it, which is a common problem in many newer comic-book/cartoon based films (especially FF4 and spider-man 3). The film is well done, if you have a gripe, tell me, what would have made it better, cause I see no way bay should have done any differently."
"disturbed3335","9","3","5","2 July 2007"," More than meets my expectations
","I'll admit, I had my doubts. Being that I'm younger and only met transformers through Beast Wars, I didn't know much about them. As soon as the video game for this movie came out, however, I was hooked. I went to the theater excited already, because most ads said July 4th, some said the 3rd, and I found a theater on the 2nd. From the opening scene, I was glued. I'm the type of person to seek out CGI errors and jumps, and all the little kinks every movie has. Whether it was the expert special effects or the overbearing fascination with the movie, I don't know, but I could not find anything substantial. This movie stepped it up where many others fell short. This was my ""summer at the movies"". My first of two complaints is that there was not enough close range fighting between transformers, however this is understandable. The second is that I have to wait until 2009 to see Michael Bay's movie adaptation of ""Prince of Persia""."

Had I known that this clunker would D-R-A-G out for two and a half hours, I would have packed the kids up, and left after the first movie. This is not a big-screen epic, and should never have been treated as one. This is a ""potato chips for the brain"" movie, based on a cartoon, that was intended to sell kids' toys 25 years ago.....remember? Had it been approached properly, as a ninety minute action fest, it may have worked. As is, it was TOO long, and there was way to much detail for such fluff. Also, the action scenes were too hard to follow, as the bad guys and good guys blurred together to look the same."

","I'm not going to say ""I'm a huge fan"" or ""I'm a child of the 80s"" because all that is irrelevant. A bad film is a bad film, straight up! Why does a Transformers film need stupid teenagers who wear band shirts running around trying to get laid? WHY? What does it add to the story, other than crude jokes and an excuse to tilt up and down some hot chick's midriff? How about NOTHING! This film should have just been Transformers and the military, that's what we want to see, not bodily fluids being unleashed and cheap sex references so MTV-martyrs can get a laugh! Why all the GM advertising? Are the kids who are going to bug their parents to buy them all the toys going to buy cars after the movie ends, too? Good lord! So Megatron can survive deep space, which is more frigid than we can imagine, but he can't sustain himself in a glacier? Wow Bay, you are so talented! Ever notice a similar theme in every Michael Bay film, that of a Caucasian loser (except the Bad Boys films) trying so hard to score with a few action sequences thrown in? I'm officially boycotting any film with his name attached to it for life. I had my doubts about this, and sure as heck, they manifested before my eyes!"

","I'm going to keep this short and simple. Michael Bay who remade Miami Vice saying this was not going to be an 80's staged remake did the same thing with the Transformers. All the real fans were expecting it to stick more to the original and why shouldn't they have kept it more to the original?? I think the original fan base aged between there mid twenties and early thirties is an more interesting audience, revenue-wise, then today's kids.<br/><br/>The movie is definitely putting all it's hopes on the effects.

"JCR-4","4","4","8","5 August 2008"," Fed up of these action films
","Films like Transformers have just lost all sense of reality. I know sci-fi cannot be 100% realistic, but there has to be a limit. Transformers just goes on and on for over 2 hours, action scene after action scene. Sure, the special effects are great, although a little annoying at times as it's a little too in your face and close-up. The plot is really feeble, which is why I guess they had to pack it so full of action. I get the feeling that Hollywood is continuously trying to out-do itself, and with films like this has forgotten the importance of a convincing storyline and a semblance of reality! As I watched I just got the feeling that nobody of any importance was ever going to die, whether the transformers or the actors, no matter how far they were thrown are how hard they were hit, despite buildings falling all around them. To add to the disappointment, we were treated to some terribly cringe worthy lines from some of the transformers towards the end. I think films like Transformers are simply an insult to the public's intelligence, but judging by some of the reviews here I'm perhaps living on another planet."
"xoloxolox","6","4","8","2 January 2008"," Open Letter to Michael Bay (warning: spoilers, as if it mattered)
","Dear Michael, ""Transformers"" was palatable, the most I can say about any of your movies. But I see a disturbing pattern: your movies are too damn long.<br/><br/>Two hours is too much. Your movies are about gun fights, explosions, car chases, the requisite hot chick, product placement and in this case, robots.<br/><br/>Your successful peers manage to tie these ingredients together with a thin string of a plot that lasts ninety minutes, just enough to fill us with adrenaline without being boring.<br/><br/>Transformers is over two hours along. For intriguing Oscar-worthy dramas that include character development, plot twists, and witty dialog, this is acceptable. For movies about giant robots fighting over a hot chick wielding the latest Nokia, it is not.<br/><br/>Not only does Transformers drag for long stretches, but the plot sucks. I can handle bad plots in action movies -in some cases they're encouraged- but not when it drags the movie out unnecessarily and clutters it with awkward moments. I've regrettably compiled a list of things this movie could do without: -Why did the Scorpion robot attack the military in the desert? Granted, it was a good scene, but it had nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Um... explain? -Was the young black kid simply pandering to the inner-city audience? He was introduced to crack a code, but the code didn't say anything. I don't even know what happened to him at the end, I think he disappeared.<br/><br/>-Same with the Australian girl. You already have a hot chick, adding another one only confuses the males in the audience and gives them false hopes of a threesome. Not only was she annoying, I don't know why she was there. Eliminating her out would've cut five minutes from the film.<br/><br/>-The scene where boy meets girl: too long and irrelevant. You've shown that he has a crush on her in the classroom scene, and that he's the nerd that needs a car to impress her. That's enough. You don't need him showing up uninvited at a party, as it added seven early, unneeded minutes to the movie. Remember: explosions, robots, hot chicks, product placement. You suck a dialog so don't bother.<br/><br/>Furthermore, ""boy lusts girl"" belongs in another movie; like ""Pearl Harbor"", you forget your point. Like the ADD addled audience you target, you suffer from quick jumps from unrelated subjects and the inability to focus for more than five minutes. That's why you make action movies.<br/><br/>-Speaking of that scene, remember his friend? The blond kid who hung upside down from the tree? Yeah... him! Why is he in the movie? Don't addle it with unnecessary characters.<br/><br/>-How did the glasses show that the cube is in the desert? The glasses were imprinted with the location of the cube when Megatron was frozen in the arctic. Goddamm, that's a confusing plot piece, such a development needs some explanation, like a sentence ""Megatron had followed the Cube to earth... (pause for digestion) but he got off course and crash landed in the Arctic (further pause). THE CUBE WASN'T IN THE ARCTIC, IT'S SOMEWHERE ELSE"" If you clarified that part, you wouldn't even need to try explaining how the cube got to the desert.<br/><br/>OK, I hate to nitpick, but you're making Transformers II, I'd really prefer not to have to sit through thirty minutes of pointless back-story in order to see robots battle over a hot chick, turn into cars and explode. Thank you and feel free to call me if you need a consultant, my fees are surprisingly reasonable compared to Hollywood standards."
"corey-tyler","7","4","8","21 August 2007"," Definitely better than expected.
","I want to start out saying that I am not a Micheal Bay fan, but this movie is definitely worth seeing. Visually the film is stunning, and during some of the aircraft sequences it had a bit of a ""Top Gun"" feel to it. Shia Leboef really did a great job acting in this film, and it was a treat to see John Tuturro have a cameo in the film as well. My only complaints with the film is that the dialoge between the robots was a little cheesy along with some of the gags, and Jon Voight's acting (the secretary of defense) was really bad (I had a hard time looking past that when he was on screen), but if you can get past those few flaws it is a fun filled action ride for the whole family."

"fcoucelo","7","4","8","10 July 2007"," Started off great but went nickelodeon after 45m!!!
","I had high hopes for this movie because of its special effects and Director. What started off as the major motion picture of the summer went to a kids nickelodeon movie right when John Turturro character was introduced. We went from a serious ""24"" type environment to a ridicule all is possible ""go kids"" atmosphere. I grew up watching Transformer on TV and I was hoping for an adaption that captured the fans that are now 30years old not, today's children that don't even know what type vehicle Optimus Prime was. Still I gave it a 7 for its special effects and general nostalgic moments it provided me and my friends in the Theatre but Damn you MICHAEL BAY YOU COULD HAVE MADE A 10/10 MOVIE!!! WHY GO NICKELODEON ON US, WHY??!?!?"
"vashsghost","6","4","8","8 July 2007"," Plenty of action and funny jokes, but...
","Keep in mind that this is a Transformers movie, not some random sci-fi robot action flick. The movie itself is quite enjoyable. It has plenty of action, comedy, and pretty girls. The story is not half-bad either. However, as a Transformers movie, it falls short in a number of places.<br/><br/>First of all, it seems to me that neither Spielberg nor Bay intended to make this into a true big-budget summer blockbuster. Transformers, being one of the cultural icons of the 80's, deserved to be treated more seriously and this movie should have been on the same scale as that of Star Wars, Superman, or Independence Day. I was not expecting a war drama, but I just wanted an action movie with more grandeur.<br/><br/>*Spoilers* Secondly, plot holes do exist. For example, how did the Autobots find out that the Cube was at Hoover Dam? All they had was the pair of glasses engraved with a map that indicated the ORIGINAL location of the Cube at the time that Megatron crash landed on Earth. This is perhaps a minor detail, but it shows that the script was not rigorously reviewed for consistency. Moreover, after escaping with the Cube, knowing that the Decepticons are chasing after them, why would the good guys take shelter in a heavily populated city, risking the lives of thousands of people? Yes, maybe they thought that a dense urban environment would be a nice place to hide the Cube, but apparently they also believed that the Decepticons were just going to play hide-and-seek with them instead of blowing up the city. The Cube itself bugged me as well. Why did every robot it made shot lasers and rockets? It was supposed to build civilizations of machine lives, not just armies of killer robots. Of course, feel free to correct me if I missed something in these observations.<br/><br/>Character development of the transformers was also limited. Optimus and Megatron didn't do much as leaders of their respective factions. Autobot Jazz was portrayed like some token minority funny guy in many movies that always got killed first. Most of the Decepticons looked like they were practically just weapons, not sentient beings. Instead of putting in so many random caricatural human characters, the time could have been better spent on the robots. If there is going to be a sequel, I hope to see the transformers as main characters and humans as supporting casts.<br/><br/>Last but not least I want to comment on the transformers' design. I'm not a fanatic who wants everything to look exactly like the originals, and I don't dislike the designs in the movie. At times, however, it was hard to figure out which body part was which and basically they looked like piles of junk metals when the actions were fast and camera was shaky. I think the robot forms can look neater without losing the realism.<br/><br/>In summary, this is a good action movie and nothing more. I am disappointed that it was not better, and I hope that there will be a sequel with more focus on the Transformers themselves. Also if I may be so bold to give a piece of advice to the writers: Having transforming robots doesn't make it a Transformers movie. It is OK to be creative and explore new ideas, but it is more important to understand and respect the original ""stuff"" that made Transformers so memorable."
"tesb_81","9","4","8","8 July 2007"," Way more than I expected! Best movie of 2007 so far!
","I've never been a huge fan of Michael Bay (I thought Pearl Harbor sucked), but OH MAN did he hit it out of the ballpark with Transformers! I am one who grew up with Transformers, so I was highly skeptical of this project when I first heard about it. Transformers delivers on so many fronts - action, humor, romance, sci-fi - that I found myself wishing it wouldn't end after just 2 hours and twenty minutes. Shia Lebouf did a fantastic job lending just the right amount of personality and humor to Sam ""Spike"" Witwicky, the CGI robots themselves oozed with personality, and the action was just jaw-dropping. As an added bonus, Bay employed some great character actors like John Turturro, John Voigt, and Anthony Anderson to complement a decent, though in no way perfect, script.<br/><br/>I think the icing on the cake for us Tranformers fans is the dedication Bay put in to making this a movie for the fans. Getting Peter Cullen (the original voice of Optimus Prime in the cartoon series) back as the voice of the Autobot leader was pure genius, and was a move that definitely hit a positive nerve with this movie-goer. For those who never really watched the old 1980's cartoon series, you have nothing to worry about. While Bay took great care to satisfy fans, I feel that he also did a nice job bringing in everyone else with the action, story-line, and acting. My wife, for example, never watched the cartoon series, but thoroughly enjoyed this movie.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the sequel - especially to see which new Autobots and Decepticons are used!"
"Quinoa1984","4","6","14","10 June 2008"," as far as empty-headed summer blockbusters go, this is the empty-headiest!
","For some Michael Bay can do no wrong. For others, he's the anti-Christ in cinema today. I'm nowhere near the former, though maybe not exactly the latter either. He does what he does and his films make money (with the exception of the Island, ironically since that film is somewhat more watchable than most). So he's a safe bet for the studios to do what he does, which are big, noisy, shiny, and completely empty-headed popcorn action pictures where the special effects triumph overwhelmingly over any human presence. This has never been more relevant a criticism than in Transformers, even if it might not an abomination like Pearl Harbor, or like Armageddon where its awfulness dawns on the viewer after a first somehow impressive viewing.<br/><br/>Now, in the interest of full disclosure, I should note that I wasn't a ""fan"" of the transformers by much when I was a kid (which, of course, is the best time to become a fan- they're cars that turn into fighting alien robots after all), and never watched the animated movie. So it wasn't a priority to seek out a film version directed by Michael Bay. After finally seeing the movie, it's a reasonable conclusion that it has either found its audience or never will. For those who might love a big, clunky, overlong and densely-plotted flick where the humans are given dumb-ass dialog in lieu of overpowering visual/special FX that moves at the speed of delirious light, it hits the nail on the head. For those who want, er, substance, look elsewhere. It's a film based upon a *toyline*, after all.<br/><br/>So, saying that it *is* empty-headed and silly may almost be a plus for some. And, in a sense, for Bay this has now become his forte. And indeed, needless to say, when one turns off their logic centers of the cerebral cortex and tries the 'go-with-the-flow' nature of the action sequences, of those giant alien robots fighting ridiculously with other robots all over some cube, it almost is kind of fun. Almost. But as soon as one is stuck with the human beings, characters like Shia Labouf's character, it's a little torturous when it's clear that Bay can't direct actors (it's not that Labouf is even not talented, as evidenced in the latest Indiana Jones picture). And there are a lot of scenes with these silly humans, far more silly than those with the robots, who work on a guilty pleasure level of excitement even for a viewer as reluctant to appreciate the finer nature of the movie's appeal.<br/><br/>Here's the bottom line, folks. It's a huge fantasy movie that has no real discernible plot, that often invokes ""the world wide web"" and ""ebay"" like they're sacred objects. It relies on dialog that any other filmmaker (well, maybe not Spielberg, who produced the movie) would find mostly laughable. It's cinematography is shiny, like an overpriced Christmas tree. It's got hot new young talents like Megan Fox, used mostly for eye candy. And Bay even tries to throw in ""real"" actors, like Jon Voight and, for a few cool moments, John Tuturro. And the work put into designing the robots by the VFX animators is commendable. Transformers, for me, isn't a total disaster, but a sign of the times, of marketing and packaging for a young and seemingly hungry crowd for loud, stupid action to lumber along at a frantic, uneven pace. In short, it's Michael Bay, as clear as alien-robot-transformer crystals."
"rasantel","2","6","14","2 February 2008"," brainless, waste of a great opportunity and resources
","Really, whatever awe the SFX might cause, this reflects what Hollywood thinks of the public, and how easily the public rewards the brainlessness with which it is treated. Pathetic new low for Jon Voight and John Turturro ""performances"".<br/><br/>The studio, producers, Hasbro, the ""director"", and cast must have been thinking of all the money they would make, so they played ""safe"". Why risk the franchise with a more intelligent and adventurous movie? They just chose cheap, C-rate actors, and an idiotic plot with cheesy lines. Little wonder that striking writers complain, in part, that the movie and TV industry only demands cheap crap for unthinking public, to just squeeze their money out. Thinking people seem to be dangerous (reminds me of the USSR).<br/><br/>Pitifully, the mainstream public will just reward these resource-and-opportunity waster ""moviemakers"". People will smile and swing happy, salivating tongues. Didn't Batman Begins set a precedent on how you can make a great movie and ""restart"" a franchise that appeared to have been killed by their own greedy owners in the 80's and 90's? Are we sinking back to the idiotic era of Hollywood?"

","Really just a tremendous waste of time. Most of the film is listening to the main character whine about his car and his not having a girlfriend. The autobots are portrayed as stupid (they didn't know that they shouldn't trample on people's houses). What little action there is is brief and unrealistic, even for a movie about giant transforming robots. Most of the Decepticons aren't even given names and don't speak English for some reason. The film tries to pass off Kanji as ""alien symbols."" Everybody sort of forgets that nobody killed Starscream at the end of the film. He blew up a plane and disappeared. The jokes are absolutely painful, and the only person who can act is Jon Voight. Come to think of it, Jon Voight (the actor, not his character) is a pretty cool guy."
"losnewdeal","4","6","14","6 July 2007"," a honest comment
","To be honest everyone i saw this movie yesterday with friends. I give it a five for a couple reasons. 1st Micheal bay is really in touch with todays trends example shai wears a strokes shirt wears vans the language he is very in touch. but that also plays against him i thought some dialogue was forced like the talk on masterbation. Also the story was not good and some shots the camera was just to shaky. But i enjoyed the hot girls megan fox racheal taylor, but when i watched this movie did I really care about the world fight no. IT was also to dramatic all Micheal bay movies are. Plu s it was to long. This movie is definitely the Mcdonalds of movie making. Hey I like Mcdonalds too. Big budget big promotion you can go see with friends or family entertaining none the less but any more special then Micheal bays last movie no, and will his next movie be anymore special then this no.<br/><br/>Take away the transformers and this movie would be nothing will i rent it no watch it again no but i had fun watching it and an enjoyable time with friends.<br/><br/>P.S. Two big complaints with this movie I wish it would have been only an hour and a half I don't need 21/2 hours of tranformers and anyone trying to hang out with friends or have family time probably does not want to donate that much time to a movie. By the time the climax came around i was falling asleep. I did not care about the dramatic battle i had been watching for two hours already and the theater was dark and the movie was not that entertaining. second less from optimus prime every time he opened his mouth he spoke garbage."
"amitjusc","3","6","14","7 July 2007"," Just awful!!!...the 1986 film was far better and that's not saying much
","Let's be honest, people. If you are like me, you are perfectly capable of turning off your brain and enjoying a good action romp. Live Free or Die Hard was a good example of this, although it was smarter than most people give it credit for. This piece of garbage, however, featured probably the best special effects ever seen in a movie, with no emotional subtext to make you care about any of it.<br/><br/>The opportunities for character development are wasted on childish drivel. There were more intelligent adult themes in the original cartoon than this, and that's not saying very much (even though I am a die hard G1 Transformers fan). If you don't care about the characters, you don't care about the action sequences. Incidentally, the action featured so many quick cuts and rapid camera motion that it was really hard to enjoy them.<br/><br/>There were a few funny jokes in the movie, and a lot more bad ones. All of the acting was terrible, although Shia and the people who played his parents did a halfway decent job. The plot was mediocre, but bogged down by terrible dialogue and directing. Michael Bay did what I expected him to do, which was to waste a wonderful opportunity to make an engaging action spectacular.<br/><br/>The biggest crime for me was the characterization of all of the Transformers. No Starscream-Megatron rivalry at all (except for one throw-away line). No personality at all, in fact, for the Decepticons. Ironhide was the only good Autobot personality while the rest, including Optimus, just aroused no feeling in me, and the Jazz character was just racist IMO (Scatman Crothers did a much better version of Jazz in the original series). I didn't give a damn who won the battle because I didn't know any of these undeveloped characters.<br/><br/>In the 1986 film, people were crying their eyes out in the theater at some points (no spoilers here because this is the film all of you should see if you care about Transformers). There's nothing to care about here except the really cool transformations and a few jokes. That's it and nothing more at all. I am so unbelievably disappointed."
"charchuk","6","6","14","7 July 2007"," Unsurprisingly disappointing
","Just another typical Michael Bay film. It's pretty much a mishmash of all his previous films, with some impressive FX and a silly story added in. Shia's plot line was the only one I really cared about, up until it merges with all the other ones, and it's too bad that it was cut up by lame stories about soldiers and hackers. The slapstick bit with all the autobots at his house while he's trying to retrieve the glasses was brilliant, and the fun found there was sorely lacking in the rest of the film. The big action scenes weren't all that impressive - mostly due to Bay's ineptitude as a director - even if the Transformers themselves looked great. By the time the final battle rolled around, I just wanted the film to end. A big disappointment, but I was foolish to expect anything else."
"Skutter-2","4","6","14","7 July 2007"," Not too happy with what meets my eye.
","The Transformers movie is not in my mind a success. There is a potentially cool, fun movie in here but director Michael 'Monkey with a camera' Bay and the writers seriously dropped the ball. The movie starts out okay with the scenes of the soldiers encountering the Transformers is the desert and the introductions to the teen characters aren't too annoying. After this promising introduction things go nowhere fast. There is far too little Transformer action on screen for the first two thirds of the movie- what we do get is cool but there is too much lame filler material with the teenage humans that just goes on and on. Most of it is lame lowest common denominator attempts at comedy such as the whole masturbation scene with Sam Witwicky's parents, the cowardly hacker and the government spook played by poor John Turturro. The whole slapstick sequence with the Transformers hiding from Sam's parents is just painfully unfunny. Sadly, it is one of the few sequences where we get to see the Transformers in action without it being spoiled with shaky-cam. When all the Transformers have actually arrived on earth, well over half way into the movie and we finally get to see what we paid to big robots beating the tar out of each other it is ruined by the editing and camera work. Yes that bane of modern action movies the shaky cam and the overly frenetic editing of Michael Bay make it really hard to see what the hell is going on up on the screen. These scenes look like they're amazing and should be tremendous fun. The CGI is excellent, the Transformers look solid and interact with the real world very well- almost real and the fight scenes show a lot of imagination and creativity  the stuff on the freeway, Transformers going through buildings. However, it is barely possible to work out what is going on screen or even what Transformers you are even looking at as they pummel each other. I wasn't expecting much from this movie- all I wanted was cool scenes of giant robots transforming and beating the crap out each other, I wasn't worried too much about plot or anything like that (How much plot can you expect from a movie based on a kid's cartoon from the eighties designed to sell toys) but they managed to screw it up. If they had lopped of about 30-40 minutes of the running time, mostly the lame comedic padding from the first half and actually shot the battle scenes in a halfway competent fashion this could have been a pretty cool movie. (Chauvinist moment- Despite the great CGI I would have to say the best visual effects shots are those lingering pans of Megan Fox when she is trying to fix Bumblebee)."
"hogwarts814","Null","6","14","5 July 2007"," Unfortunately...
","I walked into this movie expecting to walk out excited and energized. I have never walked out of a cinema in the middle of a film, but I came dangerously close tonight. I am not writing this to bash the beloved action figures, but rather, the piece of cinematography that has demeaned their legacy.<br/><br/>Start with a handful of raunchy jokes. Throw in a generous amount of earsplitting bangs. A dash of vulgarity, a half-dozen instances of sheer robot violence in twenty-minute intervals, and a mass car show/ commercial... Behold! Transformers.<br/><br/>It really is a shame that the animation is the only element that stands out in this movie. The animators spent months on these amazing CGI characters, and for what purpose? To have them tear apart buildings and slam into one another over and over again. Immediately, the audience was captivated by the Autobots, and I was personally disappointed that their personalities did not remain constant throughout the movie. (Although, I believe this relates to the endless violence getting in the way, causing them to appear to be nothing more but mindless fighting machines.)<br/><br/>The film runs at roughly two and a half hours. I am willing to bet that at least an hour was sacrificed to the mindless violence, which became so frequent that it began to lose meaning and blur the storyline. I continuously overheard audience members frantically whispering ""Wait...what just happened?""<br/><br/>Perhaps my opinion is biased because I am a fifteen-year-old girl. But my ten-year-old brother also claims that he kept waiting for something different to happen. My seventeen-year-old male friend noted that the movie almost seemed to serve as a series of commercials, and that the characters were drastically underdeveloped. <br/><br/>I understand that some people might enjoy movies where they can gape at cars flying and people screaming as robots run rampant through the streets. (And let's not forget the frequent flashing of a teenage girl's anatomy, nor the long shots spent admiring the over-priced eye candy of cars.) But for those of us that prefer a little more depth and meaning to our movies, you might as well step out of line to buy a ticket for Transformers."

This coming from someone who has seen the supposed blockbusters of 2007 like 300, Spider-man 3, Pirates of the Caribbean 3, Shrek 3, and Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer. Transformers easily tops the lot.<br/><br/>Micheal Bay does an excellent job bringing the 80's cartoon to the big screen. As a kid I grew up with Transformers so it's natural that I'd have some expectations for the movie, in particular with the designs of the Transformers. But Bay and his team did such an excellent job that I'm struggling to find anything to nitpick. A lot of people would argue that they should've been faithful to the original regarding the designs. These people are the hardcore Transformers fans who need to visualise how ridiculous they would look in CG. I'm glad Bay opted for a more realistic approach which works fantastically.<br/><br/>The acting was superb. There was not a single person who could not play their part well. Shia is brilliant as Sam Witwicky and I can see him becoming a big star in the future. There were numerous hilarious scenes involving him which I won't spoil here.<br/><br/>You must watch this movie, it will be one of the best movies of 2007 if not the movie of 2007.

","Not bad. The special effects were amazing but I think they went a little overboard. There were so many explosions and bullets flying, at times it was hard to see what was going on. This I think, is a function of creating movies on computers. Monitors are sharp and detailed, you're looking at the action on a smaller screen, over and over and frame by frame when it's being created. Then it's unleashed on a big screen and it's just too much to take in at once. Especially with the overwhelming sound. I kept wanting it to slow down for a second so I could see the robots in all their awesome animated glory. But they were too busy shooting at each other and throwing themselves into things (which then disintegrate in a very satisfying manner). Storyline-wise, there wasn't any. But let's face it, it's a popcorn movie with giant robots adapted from a cartoon. You don't go to see a film like that for telling insights into the human condition. I thought the romance between the two main characters was a bit Disney, and the offhand jokes were pretty hokey, but hey, they joined the dots nicely between the explosions.

","I have been a fan of transformers my whole life....growing up in the generation when they were on TV in the mornings, collecting the toys and swapping them with friends, this movie had a lot to prove to me.<br/><br/>I went in today to watch it and was blown away by the movie. It was visually amazing and had a good selection of characters in the film, my only small issue was that devestator wasn't a combination of the constructacons, though the script may have been the way as he may have out shadowed the evil megatron.<br/><br/>The script was done pretty well, with some good human character that will draw you into the the story, the music was done very well and integrated with the sound effects well.<br/><br/>Overall i gave this movie a 10, though i may be biased because I'm am such a big fan, after seeing it, i wanted to see it again.<br/><br/>I cannot wait to see (if there is one) a special edition version of the movie with any bonus footage.<br/><br/>Go see it now <br/><br/>Autobots...roll out!!!"

","First of all I am huge Transformer fan,when I was a kid I watched the cartoon and the original animated movie(which I also love)A lot of so called fans have made comments on how their not happy,I don't see how this can be.This film brings Transformers to life in every sense,it is visually stunning and the original personalities of the robots has been captured perfectly with added gusto.Yes, changes have been made but these were necessary and only enhanced the story, the human characters were actually good for once and were extremely funny.The story is perfect for a blockbuster film, the direction by Bay is by far his best(this is his best film)and for once I am actually looking forward to a sequel.The newcomer will be blown away by the effects and really care about the noble Autobots, the fan will have their dreams fulfilled.This is also the biggest action movie ever made nothing even comes close.I'm in Australia so I saw the film before my American buddies,so please believe me,see this movie if your a newcomer(you will love it) and to the Transformer fans you must see this film,even the line ""One shall stand and one shall fall"" is spoken by Prime and if your a true fan be prepared, you may get emotional."

","Seriously, it's nearly impossible for me to start watching a movie and not finish it. I've watched millions of movies that people consider to be terrible...yet I find some redeeming quality in the film and consider it to have been worth watching. Prior to turning on the Transformers movie on cable, I had only walked out of one movie in my life (Flesh and Bone...circa 1995-ish). This movie however...um...I could only watch about 30 minutes and then had to change the channel. I made it through an hour of Flesh and Bone. I loved the Transformers cartoon as a kid, and I was leery about a movie adaptation because...how do you make a high-budget sci-fi movie from an admittedly cheesy concept? The only good thing that came from the resurgence of the Transformers brand in my opinion are these Xip3 Transformer jackets from a company called Core Gear. While transforming robots from outer-space are pretty far-fetched, a hiking jacket that turns into a back-pack that turns into a pillow...well that's at least functional and kinda cool (see the jackets http://budurl.com/transf ), and if you're a raving Transformers fan, there are limited edition Transformers-logo jackets available for sale."

","What Michael Bay lacks is the fact that film is about artistic merit, not how many explosions or stunts you have. Bay is never clever with the camera for this badly made flick, he simply relies on patheticly glamourising a classic retro cartoon series.<br/><br/>It's hard to understand what anyone sees in this tedious drag, with Shia bumbling constantly in his repeated 'Even Stevens' act, Megan Fox performing as good as a house brick and the cult Transformer characters given urban attitudes, its easy to see that this is just another Hollywood mess.<br/><br/>There's nothing to highlight in this science-fiction action epic, there are some funny moments and the great Peter Cullen returns to voice Optimus Prime (Cullen's voice-over gives the film it's extra star).<br/><br/>With more product placement than creative imagery to boast, Bay's Transformers is awful and a key movie to highlight when it comes to explaining why business shouldn't come before art in film. It actually made me feel dizzy watching it, if your going to make an animated series into a film, do it properly because the majority of these characters do not appear in the Japnese cartoons and its all to appeal towards the numb minded teenagers.<br/><br/>Badly written, boring and nothing special."

","I somehow managed to avoid any film by Michael Bay---until Transformers came to HBO. I've heard numerous times that Michael Bay is the worst director ever. But I watched anyway because...well...okay, I couldn't think of a good reason except for maybe because it's HBO. So, I watched it. Good Lord! Who green-lit this stink-burger? Bay doesn't direct movies; he blows stuff up on film.<br/><br/>1) This movie didn't have one storyline. It had a gazillion story lines, all of them hard to follow. Teen film, war film, espionage film, comedy, action. This film created a new genre: confusing film.<br/><br/>2) This film had a gazillion stereotypes. You have the geek pining for the hot chick, the hot chick that dates oafish bullies and doesn't know geek exists until they're thrown together by circumstance, the idiot best friend of said geek that climbs trees (what is he, a two year old?), geek's cheapskate dad, geek's loud nosy mom, the smart-hot British chick, the fat black dude that hacks computers and yells at his mom for being nosy, the know-it-all agent that harasses geek and hot chick, the clueless President just finding out his country is overrun with Transformers, etc.<br/><br/>3) The women in this film have it the worst. They're either hot skinny chicks with limited to no acting ability but show more skin than Maxim magazine or made to be loud, shrill, and nosy or made to be overly smart and have some sort of accent but still hot.<br/><br/>4) The film is called Transformers, but they don't appear will half-way through the movie. WTF??? How do you screw this up? The Transformers are suppose to be the stars of the film, not the supporting characters of their self-named film.<br/><br/>5) Who's the idiot that decided to dumb down the Transformers? One scene where the 'bots try to hide outside while geek gets the glasses he's been trying to sell on EBAY (enough with the product placement), I thought I was watching American Pie. Transformers are suppose to be fighting, not hiding from nosy parents in the middle of the night. If I want to watch American Pie-style humor, I'd be watching American Pie.<br/><br/>6) Talented actors (John Turturro, Jon Voight) and TV actors (dude from Las Vegas, some dude from Prison Break) wasted in this film.<br/><br/>7) Why is the guy playing the geek getting all this hype? All he does is say a bunch of one-liners trying too hard to be funny and trying to act like an action hero. I kept hoping Optimus Prime would kick his weenie ass. This is the next big star? Seriously??? Hollywood needs to realize that just because Disney gave him a career does not make him talented. What's next? Miley as Wonder Woman? <br/><br/>8) Hot chick should stick to modeling. Or stripping. Or taking it off for Playboy. Or work at Hooters. Anything but acting. One look at her examining the engine of Bumblebee car and it's obvious that her bare midriff had better acting skills than she did.<br/><br/>9) Movie was too loud. The explosions were loud and everyone had a need to shout their lines. I know this isn't Shakespeare but shouting your awful lines will not help the film.<br/><br/>10) The camera-work was all over the place. I kept thinking, ""Am I watching a movie or am I on a roller-coaster?"" I had a headache and was dizzy by the time the end credits rolled.<br/><br/>11) How sad is it when the only redeeming quality about this film is the Linkin Park song at the closing credits?"
"twoten","1","5","11","18 July 2008"," Astoundingly BAD film making - how much did they spend on this?
","It would take me as long as the running time of this disaster to point out all that was wrong with it. The first thing you will notice is that the color of every scene has been destroyed. Senor Spielbergo should take all his fancy multi-million dollar computer controlled color ruining machinery and throw it all away. Then sit down and watch something like ""North by Northwest"" and see what true, accurate color looks like. The next most nauseating thing is all the moving camera shots. I tried counting them, then gave up when I realized that 99% of the whole movie is traveling camera shots. Just a few minutes of that nonsense is enough to make you barf.<br/><br/>Then there are the unlikable characters, which is just about everyone in this film. Totally shallow characterizations, somebody ought to tell the billionaire geniuses over at Dreamworks that if you hold a camera on an annoying and stupid jerk, like the character played by Shia LeBouef, long enough, they will appear to be annoying and stupid jerks. I could not have cared less for what happened to anyone in this ""movie"".<br/><br/>Next is the cloying and maudlin sentimentality, the humor that wasn't funny, the shallow stereotyping, and the presumption that the US Defense establishment is always working towards the good of all mankind. Oh brother give me a break, I'm through being kind to this piece of crap, it is tied for last place as the worst movie of all time!

First of all the action scenes left me bored, everything about them was bland and didn't leave me to question what would happen next.

"Ricky_Roma__","Null","5","11","17 January 2008"," Painfully bad
","I used to love Transformers as a kid. The cartoons were great and I loved the toys. But then a few years ago I got the toys out of my loft. Bloody hell they were crap. Cheap, flimsy and poorly made. How could I have been so wrong? How could something so awesome secretly be a pile of toss? Well, I guess children are both stupid and easily impressed.<br/><br/>But I guess that assessment must be extended to a lot of teenagers and young adults, as a lot of people are saying that Transformers is a good film. Well, it's not. It's a horrendous example of film-making. The action is dull and uninvolving, the characters are annoying as hell and the writing and the acting are risible. What an atrocious piece of crap.<br/><br/>That being said, the special effects are pretty good. But why would anyone want to watch a film just because it has some nice graphics? And anyway, even though the Transformers themselves are impressively rendered, you rarely get a chance to look at them properly. The camera never lingers on them, so you only get glimpses. Therefore there's no sense of awe. They never take your breath away like the space station did in 2001 or the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. They just look...nice.<br/><br/>But unfortunately they don't sound very good. Yes I can imagine it must be pretty damn difficult to think of dialogue for alien robots, but the stuff here is just painful. 'My name is Optimus Prime, we are autonomous robotic organisms from the planet Cybertron.' 'You still fight for the weak! That is why you lose!' 'Freedom is the right of all sentient beings.' Just awful.<br/><br/>Not that I was expecting Kafka from this film. But it would be nice to watch the film without having to cringe every five seconds. The dialogue here isn't even serviceable. It's floating about in the toilet. And the plot itself is almost incomprehensible. Okay, so a big cube thing lands on Earth and the robots want it and, er... Yeah, I've lost the will to live. I'm sure the film explains it all in its dim-witted way, but the movie is so restless, so eager to move onto the next explosion or next joke that everything just washes over you like a tide of effluent.<br/><br/>But what about the characters? Okay, so even if the writing and the direction are pants, maybe the characters can save it. Er, no. Nearly all the people here just made me want to kill them. Whether it be Jon Voight as the Defence Secretary, the fat black guy who's mouthy but a genius, the blonde Australian bimbo, the army guys, the Transformers themselves or Megan Fox's airhead heroine. The only people who don't totally humiliate themselves are John Turturro (who's always fun), Bernie Mac (who's gets to be an amusing jerk for about ten seconds) and Shia LaBeouf (who's passable as the film's hero). Everyone else though can go to hell.<br/><br/>And Megan Fox can go there first. She's got great legs and a flat stomach that I'm sure loads of men are dribbling over, but she seems barely sentient. She has no charisma, no screen presence and no ability as an actress. She's a dull fantasy for teenagers and men with no taste. I mean, there's a scene where she looks under the bonnet of a car and tells the panting LaBeouf what's wrong. Maybe I'm asking too much in wanting believability in a film about alien robots, but I can barely believe that Fox knows how to open a door let alone know her way around an automobile.<br/><br/>But now that I think about it, there is something worse than Megan Fox  the annoying little Decepticon robot that runs around. It's meant to be a Puckish figure. A cheeky little rapscallion. But every time it was on screen, which was often, I wanted to rip Michael Bay's arm off and slap him in the face with it. This little robot is one of the most irritating screen presences I've ever seen. I'd rather have five hundred Bette Midlers dancing around. They'd infuriate me less.<br/><br/>And is it just me or is there the whiff or something unsavoury in the way that the Decepticons (minus Megatron) all speak an alien foreign language and want to destroy the world and the way that the Autobots all speak perfect English and want to protect it? Take this robotic bitch-slapping surrogate Muslim fundies! But how to explain Megatron speaking English? Maybe he was the smart one that was sent overseas to learn a proper civilised language. And then something went wrong in his brain circuits and he turned loopy.<br/><br/>But this would give the film too much credit. Transformers is really just all about building up to one large robot face-off. Too bad, then, that the final sequence is a snoozefest. Part of the reason for this is because we don't care a jot about the characters and their fates, but it's also because the direction is so poor. We rarely get to see what's going on. Indeed, half the time it's hard to know which side the robots are fighting for. Is that big thing an Autobot or a Decepticon? At least in the cartoons you had helpful logos on the characters to tell you who was who. But here you're screwed. Yeah, you might be able to recognise Optimus Prime and Megatron (maybe even Bumblebee, seeing as he's actually given screen time), but the others are just anonymous blobs. And as such, the one reason to watch the film, to see gnarly robots beat the snot out of each other, is rendered pointless. You might as well just get those toys out the loft. As bad as they are you'll probably have more fun."

Myself, I watched it on the small screen, and I was bored to tears. <br/><br/>The characters are all thin, poorly developed and generally uninteresting. The plot barely keeps its head above the clumsy pile of bad comedy relief, teen angst and Mtv-style geek sexuality. The robots are impressive, though soulless. Michael Bay continues to show outside of blowing things up, he's not worth much. It makes for a loud roller-coaster ride of special effects and explosions, but it sorely lacking in story, character development, plot development or anything else remotely interesting. <br/><br/>When the two most compelling elements of your movie are a chattering boom-box and a fake- tanned hard-body, you haven't got much to fill the drawn out dimensions this beast took up.

","Hollywood does it again. I don't know why this is the case, but it seems inevitable that Hollywood seems to just be on a roll as far as their agenda of white male bashing. The lead character is a male wimp at the start of the movie, He is in lust with a high school female that doesn't even know him, but is the girlfriend of the jock football star who is of course a jerk, more stereotypical stuff. She of course turns out to be a top wiz mechanic with cars and engines, including the ability to not only operate a tow truck flawlessly but do it in reverse while hooked up to one of the broken down transformers. Amazing chic! Another female is a college student ( I think) and she is smarter than all the military personnel combined. The movie really slams the men in it.

","Well I saw this movie recently. Granted it was on videotape so most likely the effect on me would not be nearly as profound as if I had viewed it on the big screen. Nonetheless, it was BAD (not the good kind of bad rather the BAD bad).<br/><br/>Here's why: 1) Weak, weak character development. It immediately starts off with a tense atmosphere no much buildup. The main character has the same tired cliché of ""dork gets the hot girl from jock boyfriend"". All the characters had corny lines and racial stereotyping to boot. Jazz anyone? The transformers had little to no personality whatsoever. Starscream barely was recognizable. One of the soldiers even had to point out that it's not a plane it's Starscream! He should've at least looked distinctive.<br/><br/>2) The movie focused waaaaayyyy to much on the human characters when it should've been on the transformers. We really don't get to know much about the transformers' personalities. They were more akin to props then anything. Of course the little Frenzy bot was especially annoying sounding like more like a crazed African pygmy than an highly advanced machine.<br/><br/>3) Misplaced humor. Now I appreciate humor sprinkled around here and there but this was almost constantly applied. The stupid masturbation inference..the urinating by Bumblebee on the government agent. The quote ""I bet my ridiculously high government paycheck""..I mean way way out of line or ""Criminals are hot""..stupid. Finally the sneaking around by the Autobots who were like bulls in a china shop. Such humor seemed so infantile and maybe the appeal was to children, I don't know.<br/><br/>4) Actions scenes. This is BY FAR the worst thing in this movie. Shaky camera (I guess that's the ""in"" thing to do). Transformers who looked too similar. Dizzying action sequences where everyone is racing at 100 mph an hour while firing weapons. It was most difficult to discern what was even going on and the Decepticons and Autobots were hard to tell apart in their battle sequences.<br/><br/>5) Length of movie. For god's sake it was almost two and a half hours! I was so bored in the extended city battle scenes. Continuous action for over half an hour or it felt like it. It was mind numbing and not in a good way.<br/><br/>So basically if you like CGI and super fast action scenes with little character development and meaningful dialog then this movie is for you."

We get to see a little ""bathroom humor"" when the dog pees on a robot and a robot pees on an unpleasant government official. Perfect fit for 12-16 year old boy target audience. After those positives, the reader might wonder at my low rating. The movie gets all five points I give it for what I've written above. It should get a negative five for everything else about it. Transformers is no longer an extended advertisement for the Hasboro toys of the same name. This version is a slick commercial for the military packaged precisely for the young teen boys who will watch it. Scenes in the movie are exact copies of ads for the Army, Marines, Reserves and National Guard. All the army guys are cool, quick, smart, heroic and supported by honest, hard-working, highly-trained and courageous backups. They pack LOTS of firepower and even when an entire base is wiped out by a single Discepticon there is NO BLOOD, NO WOUNDED, NOBODY SCREAMING IN PAIN. This is the worst kind of violence there is. The movie glorifies blasting away at things and NEVER shows the results. Further, the soldiers are good buddies, talk to their wives and kids on the internet and seem to be having a great time even when they are getting their a___es shot off. Reviewers often comment on the product placement that takes place in movies. The military had better have paid these producers a significant fee for this two-hour-long advertisement for how great it is to be an ""army man."" If you can avoid taking your boy to this movie, do so. If not, take a minute to interject a little reality therapy. The US invasion of Iraq is costing our country a huge price in young men and women. It is immoral and unethical to sell such misguided policy with a slick movie based on little kid's toys."
"uygaraydemir","3","5","11","9 July 2007"," a propaganda movie
","The movie is no more than another American war movie, unfortunately.<br/><br/>The movie begins with the attack of the evil Decepticons to an American military base in Qatar (note the country), which makes it a war of The US; and in the rest of the movie we watch American patriotism in almost every scene. It is the Americans fighting the Decepticons, not the Megatrons. Megatrons' role is just to help American soldiers in their fight with the Decepticons (spoiler: oh, if you do not count their role in the very end... the role of guarding the main characters' having sex on bumble bee). When I heard of Optimus Prime speaking on freedom and the backwardness (or underdevelopment, I do not remember the word well) of human race, I felt as if I am listening to the American president talking about the Iraqis.<br/><br/>The events and the wars should have taken place in Cybertron, not in the cities of the USA. We should have seen the social relationship among the Autobots, rather than a boring American teenager love story. All these and more show that the movie cannot be a classic (unless it becomes a classic of propaganda movies in near future).<br/><br/>The visual effects were good, though. Yet it is difficult to see the effects and to follow who fights whom in the crowded city.<br/><br/>In short, the movie is frustrating for the fanatics and nauseous for the non-patriots."

","OK, there's just one word that I can use to describe this movie - awesome!!!!! When I went to see it movie I admit that I had high expectations but what I saw just blew me away. Some people said that the movie was too long but I really enjoyed every scene in it and especially the CGI effects. I give credit for the look of every transformer all the way from the human-sized Frenzy to the massive Blackout. The CGI will be leading my league of the best CGI effects ever seen in a movie. Just take a look at the ending battle, Optimus Prime against Megatron, two gigantic Transformers in a massive fighting scene.<br/><br/>But I didn't come to praise the movie and give it a top report only for the effects. This is also a movie with great acting. Some may not see it this way but I am impressed with the cast that they could pretend talking and even fighting to something that didn't even exist.<br/><br/>Transformers had it all, action, comedy, excitement and romance. The comics really increased the movie, but what I didn't expect at first was that the robots should utter the funniest things in it. From top to bottom this is one of the best films I've seen and possible ever will see. I just can't believe all the critics that say that the movie isn't following the series and on and on with stuff like that.<br/><br/>I promise that who ever wants firing action and excitement, this is the movie you should watch at. When I came out from the cinema I just wanted to rush into the auditorium at tell them to play it again.<br/><br/>And those will be my last words Amen."
"lock_ness_nessie","10","5","11","8 July 2007"," Calm down all you Transformer haters
","This film was well crafted. The Transformer purists will consistently deny this, and continue to wallow in their own disappointment, and their only refuge will be the other crying purists alongside them. So, they must realise it is impossible to take previous material, such as books, video games, TV shows, and historical events, and then place them in a modern film which effectively recreates it. Firstly, this is because a Transformers remake DOESN'T make sense. How can you fit DECADES of TV programming into a single film? I am saddened that the purists did not realise this and take it into consideration. Secondly, an exact remake brings with it complications, which must be dealt with by the producer and writers and directors, and a whole load of others that make this film possible. For example, sponsorship and usage rights come into play with makes and models of vehicles, you cannot rigidly stick to the original aspects of the show without having movie-killing complications. If for some reason you don't get the rights to have a volkswagon beetle, you either scrap, or modify. Relax. calm down, take a deep breath, and be happy that they didn't change names and they didn't make the human actors the stars of the movie. Basically if this film is looked at from the point of view of a snobby, ""this is how is must be"" Transformer purist, then you will certainly not like it. I am puzzled as to why anyone who loves Transformers enough would even go see this film, and not stick to their old recordings and tapes. To go so far as to bash one of its greatest chapters, is even more ridiculous. And to say that this film was a giant advertisement and there was ""too much slapstick comedy"" and that the plot was incomprehensible, I say to that that your ignorance is what gives you that opinion. Of course they have to specify the makes and models, and of COURSE they are going to show it. WOuld you really have been pleased if there were NO labels on anything in this film? Not any sort of connection to our world of today? only blank model cars, and blank t-shirts, and no billboards or insignias. Lets get real here guys, I found the ""ads"" for GMC to be quite subtle amongst the explosions and shapeshifting battles. If you were all strung up because of your problem with the ""Ads"" then please, stress some more, it will do a lot of good. The humour that was implanted in this movie was also subtle, whether it was because of it being once again being drowned out by the intense action sequences, or because realistically, the humour had a well founded basis. For example, A certain transformer ""pees"" on a human. Has not that certain bot been living among humans and learnt their language and ways? and in a lot of ways, these bots are quite human like. If i was 40 feet tall, and there was someone 6 feet tall i didn't like, but didn't feel like killing, and i wanted to humiliate them whilst having fun... i would personally do the exact same thing as the bot did. As for the ""teen"" feel of some of the humour, get over it, if this movie was nonstop action and explosions without a little bit of awkward conversation between then parents and the son, really, it would have been a lesser movie. Plotwise, this movie was not the most amazing thing, but it was simple, direct, and not confusing. Of course, it is a little bit out of the acceptable materials list for the Purists, but hey, why not something sort of new thrown in with the old? All in all, I loved this movie, and I can see why the purists and pretend-purists have their pessimistic opinions, because this is not an exact transcription of the original TV series. It is a great film which when considered with an open mind, is not overpowered by any certain aspect. I left the theatre excited and wide awake. I was extremely pleased. As i said before, if you truly love the old Transformers, do yourself a favor and do not see this movie, for you will be disappointed. It would be a great mistake to claim that this replaces the old series, and that this is the better. Moreover, I would consider this a great success in the Transformer history, and an addition which can be appreciated by almost everyone. I see now that many people have picked and scratched at themselves to find as many flaws in this film and list them off... but why not consider the amazing aspects of this film as well? The flawless interaction between real-life and CGI in this film is extraordinary. This is a benchmark in the world of animation. Consider the time and effort and imagination that the animators had to put in to make such beautiful images. (consider the cartoon transformations they had to go on...) Take a minute now, breathe some more, and and please consider what i have said. This is not a remake, this is a chapter; this is not a horrible film; it is beautiful; this is not fact; it is my opinion. having said this, i will once again ask the purists to calm down, and finish this off with re-iterating the fact that this movie blew my mind, and I highly recommend you see it."
"DrStrangeFate","Null","5","11","5 July 2007"," Oh please... not a movie about 20 year old toys.
","I never really understood the fascination with Transformer toys. I always thought they were kinda stupid the way they transformed into inane things like cars, boom boxes, and ugh.. dinosaurs. I have friends that love them... but even they could not make me sit though the 80s cartoon movie. Never was a fan.<br/><br/>So, in my inbox pops the invite from this same pack of friends to their outing to see the Transformers movie. I was not interested and declined this particular fanboy cinemaplex Pilgrimage but the next invitation was not so easy to decline, my kids asked me... repeatedly... to take them. I finally relented as I have sat through everything from Chicken Little to The Santa Clause so why not Transformers? After all, I am a veteran of sitting through crappy kids movies.<br/><br/>The next 2.5 hours would be a blur of unanticipated cinematic goodness. As much as I love the Spiderman franchise and counted the days until SM3, there were times during that movie that I wanted to hang myself from the nearest thing that would be high enough to hang myself from. This movie on the other hand had me wanting more... 2.5 hours can seem like half that amount of time when a movie succeeds in captivating you like this one does. The movie moves along at a good clip with action to spare, very good acting, and even a decent storyline thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>There are some parallels you can draw between this movie and Independence Day. ID4 was a good movie but it didn't grab ahold of me and refuse to let go like this one did. This movie is perhaps one of the finest action movies made... finally, an action movie with style AND substance.<br/><br/>If you don't like this movie, then check your pulse my friend because you are probably dead."
"stepwallace","5","5","11","3 July 2007"," It's not more than meets the eye.
","This movie shares some character names with the cartoon series of the same name, but no more. <br/><br/>With the possibly exception of Optimus Prime, none of the characters are true to their originals. Not in appearance or personality. I can understand changing Bumblebee if you couldn't get the rights to use a VW, but giving Prime that horrendous flaming paint job? I've read many comments implying Michael Bay tried to stay true to the ""Myth"" of the Transformers, but I found none of this to be a Transformers film. It's a disappointing action film, cashing in on a name from our childhood.<br/><br/>That aside, it's still a disappointing film. There is little if any character development or even a developing relationship between the Transformers and their human co-stars. <br/><br/>Even as an action film it's a disappointment, the camera is so close to many of the action scenes you can't actually see any of what's going on. Slow motion scenes abound, but not in the John Woo (slightly excessive) good way to build tension, they simply mean you get to watch things explode slower.<br/><br/>-- Massive spoiler -- And then there's the plot... The premise is good, if a little weak. The secret to creating all Transformer life is lost on Earth, and Megatron followed it here. <br/><br/>From that premise however, the movie deteriorates into a series of short term goals that don't add up to a story. There is an ongoing sense that the Autobots have no plans beyond find the Cube. This really shows through at the end.<br/><br/>The goal of the final battle makes no sense at all. Why are the Autobots trying to get the Cube onto the Air Force chopper? Surely they'd have been better off grabbing it and making a run for it as soon as they had it - Which was long before they battle in the city. Anything would have made more sense than driving deliberately to a city, to give the cube back to the defense forces they'd just recovered it from. -- End spoiler --<br/><br/>Save your money, watch it on DVD if you must - just don't pay for it. This movie simply shouldn't have the name Transformers, it doesn't deserve that. Michael Bay has been quoted as saying ""I urge them (the disgruntled fans) to watch the 1986 animated movie, go watch the cartoon. You'll want to shoot yourself (it's that bad)"". Right there Bay doesn't understand what Transformers was about. He's looking for an action movie in a kids cartoon. It was a cartoon about morality, about differentiating between good and evil, about making a stand regardless of anything, about giving second chances. Transformers was not at it's heart a violent cartoon, and that's reflected in it's poor translation to the big screen by Michael Bay's action disappointment."
"biggy_smooth","4","5","11","3 July 2007"," Masters of the Universe with a higher budget!!!!
","I am so disappointed with this movie. How can the decepticons be so serious and amazing, but the autobots have to be stand-up comedians. What was the purpose of Anthony Anderson's character? What happens to the English chick that cracked the code? She seemed reeeeeal important. Who casts Jon Voight to be anything? Tyrese added nothing but clichÃ© lines. The Transformers looked amazing, and there were some scenes that were spot on. However, immediately following a great, dramatic scene, they show something completely stupid. Shia saved this movie, and thank god he saved that horrible chick's juvy record, she faced years of no prison time if he didn't think of taking that off the books before they went to save the world. I am sure their efforts alone, if successful, wouldn't have gotten her name cleared. Great stuff Michael Bay, and by great I mean horribly disappointing."
"JCHathaway-1","5","5","11","2 July 2007"," NOT a kids' movie, and that's a bad thing
","Looked at as a whole, as an adult viewer and lifelong fan, I enjoyed this film. The action sequences were a bit too frenetic, and left me with a nauseous migraine. As an ""80s nostalgia"" flick, it was very interesting. There's ""Col. Sharp"" (the name of Duke's boss before they brought Hawk into the Sunbow GI Joe series). The three main army guys could just as easily have been called ""Duke,"" ""Roadblock"" and ""Gung-Ho,"" and there are several other things a Joe fan will catch. There's even a line about Japanese technology taken almost verbatim from the cheesy _Masters of the Universe_ (non-Hasbro property, but 80s) movie.<br/><br/>One major ""inside"" reference: Jazz was originally a Porsche; Bumblebee was originally a yellow VW bug. A few years ago, when Hasbro started the ""Alternators"" line of TFs that were more ""authentic"" toy car replicas using ""Generation 1"" characters, VW and Porsche both refused to license their products to a ""war toy."" Since then, fans have been disappointed in these characters' classic alt-modes not appearing in various collector-oriented lines or in the movie. The movie addresses this comically in the scenes where Sam's dad takes him to buy a car.<br/><br/>But here's the big disappointment: this is not a kids' movie *at all*. Bay and other producers kept talking about not wanting to make a ""toy movie."" Many fans talked about wanting ""realisim"" and so forth. I had thought it was understood that this film should at least be *appropriate* for children, and that Hasbro would have seen to that.<br/><br/>I could not in good conscience allow my children to see this movie, and I'm advising all parents not to. They say Spielberg argued the MPAA down from an ""R"" rating to ""PG-13"". There are some things in ""R"" rated movies that I'd sooner tolerate my children viewing than certain scenes in this film. There are some highly gratuitous scatological jokes and sex references for a movie that is supposed to be striking a balance between a young kids' market and a young adult market.<br/><br/>I was expecting something along the lines of _Star Wars_ or _Ghostbusters_, where some more adult-oriented aspects just go over kids' heads, but this movie is very ""in your face"" about some things. It raises topics that many parents don't even want their kids hearing about."
"shahmatt","5","5","11","2 July 2007"," Too much action. Misplaced sound. Unconvincing characters.
","There's something wrong with Transformers. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I'll try my best to explain how I felt as the movie went from start to finish, and perhaps you, the reader out there, can figure out what I mean.<br/><br/>The movie started off well enough, lots of mystery and suspense, the character development of the many heroes were all right. Some relatively funny lines. So far so good.<br/><br/>Now comes the body. A bit confusing. What is the focus here? We are introduced to good guys, who behave so much like bad guys you immediately assume villain! villain! whack the SOB! Then the finale. A very long drawn out action sequence, overwhelming the senses and numbing them. So much destruction and carnage goes on that it is impossible that our heroes continue to stand without even a scratch on them. I kept watching and waiting. Look, there's an entire building made of concrete destroyed by a transformer, our hero is in its midst, surely a splinter would pierce his foot, surely he'd get whacked on the head and go unconscious, or at least get stunned. But no, he still has smooth skin, its a miracle. This happens over and over and over again, until I grew quite tired of it.<br/><br/>I am also amused by the sudden dependence on this unlikely hero. His task could have easily been carried out, with much greater efficiency, by a transformer. All the while I thought, plot hole, BIG plot hole.<br/><br/>Many of the characters are very unconvincing. We have senior army personnel acting like children.<br/><br/>Music direction was very VERY poor. Too many times, epic-like music was played at relatively unimportant points. You immediately assume something significant is about to happen, but you end up disappointed.<br/><br/>If you are a devoted Transformers fan, please do go for this movie. The transformers are beautifully rendered and remind me so much of the cartoon when I was a kid. This movie will please fans. If, on the other hand, you want to be entertained by a 'good' action movie, you might be disappointed. I know I was."
"bredetrollsaas","7","5","11","1 July 2007"," A well run dry
","Let me just settle this: The first hour of ""Transformers"" is incredible. It's everything you wanted, and more, including humor, acting and special effects that are beyond reason. Michael Bay's take borders on action-comedy, with charming robot slapstick and tons of giggly one-liners taking turns with the hyper-realistic and often brutal action sequences. Shia LaBeouf does a nice job as the human main character, and the cast (including a hilarious guest appearance by Bernie Mac) does an honorable job, without stealing the thunder of the movie's real stars: Optimus Prime and his band of vigilante robots. And again - the effects really are mind-blowing. Fight scenes are messy and sped-up (as seems to be the norm these days), but with the incredible attention to details, such features only enhance that sense of immediacy that carries much of the movie. And although the plot is pretty thin at times, and the clipping strange just as often, it's all nit-picking compared to the massive impression the movie makes.<br/><br/>And so all is well until about half an hour is left. The story has been worn pretty thin by then, and without revealing any plot points, it then suffers a deadly blow. The main characters unanimously make a decision that, at least to me, defies any rational thinking, and after a couple hours of swallowing camels, the whole thing suddenly becomes quite hard to accept.<br/><br/>This is however nothing when faced with a sudden and extremely bland ending, seemingly rushed together at a tenth of the effort of the rest of the movie - it's like watching the final minutes of Spielberg's ""AI"" all over again. It all sums up extremely off-balance, with a climax that in no way meets the expectations built up by so many excellent moments before it. One can only hope that the sequel rectifies some of that final impression.<br/><br/>That being said, ""Transformers"" is a movie well worth both your time and your money, and even a crummy finale cannot overthrow this film's position as action flick number one so far in 2007."

The movie stars Shia LaBeouf As Sam Witwicky a high school senior who is getting picked on in school until he meets a pretty class mat named Mikaela Banes (played by Megan Fox) who then becomes his girlfriend who have no idea that the decepticons are after them to find the allspark. The first one he encounters is Barricade the Decepticon scout who like the others wants to know where his grandfather's glasses are but he can't trust them, until the Autobots help to gain his trust. Not only that this movie has a lot of good action, and CGI, it also has one scene that I found to be real sad which is where Jazz gets ripped in two by the Decepticon leader Megatron who was twice his size. Luckily four of them survived the mission city battle. This one of the best movies of 2007 because of the excellent writing, direction, and visual effects.

","I watched this again having seen the new movie, and not thinking too highly of the sequel, I found I actually like this one a little better.<br/><br/>This is a typical popcorn fun blockbuster, but the human characters and the humor prevent it from being totally mediocre. Unlike Revenge of the Fallen, I didn't really find the characters annoying and I thought the humor was much more fluent (as opposed to forced) in this one.<br/><br/>POSITIVES - I like most of the humor in the movie, and I got a few good laughs out of it. The action and special effects sequences are all excellent. Bumblebee is awesome. It sustained my interest throughout, and I liked most of the characters. In fact, none of the characters really made me angry, which is a definite plus because the new one had several annoying characters.<br/><br/>NEGATIVES - Ad placements are everywhere. Granted, they're there to pay for special effects, but they are... everywhere in this movie. - Some of the Autobots' dialog was a little corny (especially Optimus Prime) but they're working based on dialog from the cartoons, so I understand. - The plot is pretty silly with everyone trying to get a cube and hiding ancient robots under the Hoover Dam, but, again, the original material is a little silly. - There are also a lot of plot and story logic errors in the movie (a problem carried to the second one) but it didn't make me angry. More like, ""That's just silly."" Overall, I feel the movie is entertaining popcorn fun. Not everything will appeal to everyone, and I felt a little silly at times watching it because I felt the plot, story, and some of the characters were a little goofy. However, it doesn't get to the point where I'm really mad or irritated by the movie. I gave this one a higher rating than Revenge of the Fallen because the sequel has moments which just made me cringe in disgust.<br/><br/>6/10 - Recommend for anyone who just wants to sit back, relax, not think too much, and eat some popcorn."

","OK a little disclaimer first: yes critics hate it, but then again I hate movies that critics praise. I did not find anything wrong with this movie, any flaws are minor and hardly worth mentioning.<br/><br/>Soundtrack - excellent, pleasant, well-timed, has some rock songs which must be what scared the critics.<br/><br/>CGI - I don't even need to say anything, do I? Robots look truly amazing, I wish I've seen it when it was on big screen. And definitely a good idea to redesign them from the blocky simple cartoons this was based on. About those comments that mention that it was hard to tell which robot was which, well you should actually pay attention, Bay included a couple scenes on purpose in which all the robots on both sides are presented together with their names. I had no trouble telling them apart.<br/><br/>Special effects - just as good.<br/><br/>Action - fast-paced, desert scene reminiscent of Black Hawk Down. Robot fights are fluid and quick, unlike some action movies where the hero and the villain fight for half an hour in the end.<br/><br/>Plot - an interesting sci-fi premise, and believable as such, although the 'surprise' ending is predictable. Has the usual geek-likes-hot-girl-that-goes-out-with-a-jock beginning which could ruin a movie, but, thankfully, uses it only to introduce Shia's and Megan's characters.<br/><br/>Dialog might not be worth entering a poetry contest, but it goes along with the movie's pace well and has plenty of quotable moments.<br/><br/>Acting - in my opinion, the actors were great, conveying emotions and delivering dialogue lines well. Not sure what critics don't like about them. Some critics complain about slow motion shots of Megan, but there are much more slow motion shots of robots than her. One of them even had to be included as it fits well with the dialogues and entire scene.<br/><br/>Humor - surprisingly, IMDb doesn't even list comedy as one of the genres for this movie. It had several hilarious moments, scenes, and characters. I was pleasantly surprised by those, and I give credit to Bay for including them rather than trying to make a purely serious movie. I wouldn't have enjoyed the movie as much without them.<br/><br/>To add to that, I did watch Transformers like good 10-15 years ago, and hardly remembered them except for a few characters' names. The memories did make me very curious about this movie though, and I definitely wasn't disappointed."
"vlefs","10","2","3","2 June 2009"," The greatest movie ever made. Ever.
","I have never sat silent in a theater as the credits rolled on a movie I had just enjoyed. I usually clap, or laugh, or talk excitedly to my friends about it. With this one, I needed a minute to savor the emotions I was feeling. I had, for the first time in my life, felt true love for something other than a woman.<br/><br/>This is a truly great film. Compared to this movie, No Country For Old Men, another film I like, is garbage.<br/><br/>The visual effects are spectacular even if you don't understand the complexity of either getting the right shot or creating the CGI necessary to make it look real. Any and all flaws about lighting or the transition of sunlight are pathetic compared to the visual masterpiece they ultimately created. These robots look real! The fights look real. The characters react to them as if they were real.<br/><br/>People criticize the stupidity of the film. Yes, it is stupid. So? <br/><br/>The film flows well; every scene not only works, but helps to explain the situation a bit more, helps to reveal a bit more about the characters,and helps to move the story along. So what if we don't find out about the global reaction to alien robots fighting a war on our planet; you're already complaining about how long the movie is! I did not grow up on the original Transformers; I had to settle for the toys and the Beast Wars show; but I still loved the mythology. This film captures it perfectly, accentuating the most important themes without complicating things with unnecessary dialog and explanations (ahem, Episode I...).<br/><br/>My favorite element? The score! No film's music has ever captured my attention like this one. I still hum the damn tune as I walk my dog each night. The producers realized that they had struck gold; watch the trailers for the second movie; the music and sounds are mostly the same.<br/><br/>This is a great film! Great on television, yes, but it will never be the same if you do not watch it in theaters. I saw it three times there, and I will do at least as much when Revenge of the Fallen comes out.<br/><br/>See this movie! <br/><br/>Michael"

","The cartoon series of many young men childhood finally made it to the big screen and my God was it entertaining. Transformers has a simple premise, two giant robot factions, the Auto bots and the Deceptions who were in the middle of a Civil War on their own planet and after it ends up being destroyed, continue their fight on Earth. The television series was really a marketing top to sell the toys, but to children we didn't care and it continued to other franchises like GI Joe, He-Man and Pokemon.<br/><br/>The plot of the film focuses on Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), a teenage American student who happens to be selling some of his great grandfather's stuff on the eBay. He just brought his first car, a 1976 Chevrolet Camaro. But just happens to be to have brought a transformer. On the other side of the world the Deceptions start their war against humanity, attacking an American base in Qatar to access American military information. Their discover that Sam Witwicky's eBay may be of value to him, and the young man is thrown in the middle of the war, with Autobots coming to Earth to protect and Sam, and find the AllSpark that could bring life back to their home planet. At the same time is a sub-plot with Sam and his love interest Mikaela Barnes (Megan Fox). Sam is the school geek, whilst Mikaela the hotty that everyone wants to be with, but has a macho side to her. As the film progresses their friendship grows.<br/><br/>Now that plot is paper thin, there is not hiding the fact. But the Cartoon was never that deep on plot anyway. The target audience for the film was always going to be teenage boys and young men, all they wanted to see was robots beating the hell out of each other and seeing Megan Fox doing some poll-dancing would have been a bonus. The film was too long, and should have cut at least 20 minutes. It takes too long to see the Autobots. The action is excellent. Michael Bay is a expert on bombastic action. He was a sound choice and combine military action, and giant robots and CGI to great effect. This was also the biggest film the American military got involved with since Black Hawk Down, which was good for the military, but made Transformers a jingoistic film. It was also a irony in the cartoon that the Deceptions happen to be military vechiles, whilst the Autobots were mostly sports cars. I do wonder what the film would have been like if someone like Spielberg, J.J. Abrams or Zack Synder directed, but Transformers is Bay best film so far. As well as action, there is comedy, some hit, some miss, but it has a good in-joke to one of Bay's previous film.<br/><br/>The acting is standard. LeBeouf and Megan Fox have done alright for themselves after their work on television. Who really wins out is Peter Cullen who reprises his role as Optimus Prime. You got to love his voice and their is nothing more awe inspiring then seeing Optimus first scene.<br/><br/>Other issues with the film is that there are too many characters, both human and Tranformers, which makes you lack caring for some of them or wondering where some people have come from. Some characters should have been cut or reduced, especially the Peneagon staff. Also their is too much product placement, the film was a giant ad for eBay and the car companies. It's ruins the film and should have been done in a more subtle manner. Also it ruined some Transformers like Jazz who was a Porsche in the cartoon, but a Pontiac Solstice in the film.<br/><br/>But with all the issues aside, Transformers is a fun action blockbuster, and it sequel looks promising. Let's hope it's as good or even better."

","This is a great film! I was an 80s kid and I was so impressed with this! If you want a fun and visually stunning film go and see it! All those who gave it low marks should lighten up a bit! <br/><br/>1) Its based on a cartoon - it doesn't need to be 100% realistic! <br/><br/>2) Its about robots!!!<br/><br/>3) It looked amazing so who really cares?! <br/><br/>The CGI was brilliant! The robots not only looked convincing on their own, but they fit into the street scenes perfectly! The action scenes, the interaction with humans and objects, it was breath-taking.<br/><br/>So thats why I gave it 10/10. Anyone who has complained about the storyline, plot holes, acting... then yes it had a few issues. But this film isn't suppose to be serious or deep and meaningful.<br/><br/>Like I said, its about robots for goodness sake... and the ROBOTS RULED! :-D"
"Jerique","9","2","3","13 January 2009"," Another spectacle by Michael Bay!
","This epic starts off by showing Sam (Shia LeBeouf) getting a new car from his dad (Kevin Dunn) as a present for getting good grades. Sam unknowingly chooses a transformer, Bumblebee (Mark Ryan). After a confrontation with Trent (Travis Van Winkle), Sam takes Mikaela (Megan Fox) home in his new car. Eventually, Sam discovers that his car is a transformer when it helps him escape Barricade's attack. Mikaela is there with Sam to witness the ""robot death match."" Later, they meet the other Autobots lead by Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen). They must find the Allspark before the Decepticons lead by Megatron (Hugo Weaving) get it first.<br/><br/>The transformers are stunning to look at. The action the movie is packed with rocks! The ensemble cast work hard to make you believe everything is real. Special and visual effects are once again amazing, and it seems like every Michael Bay film achieves this incredible feat. The comedy is very present and you get many laughs. Their is also a slight hint of romance between the two leads which will give all romantics a sigh of relief.<br/><br/>Comedy and action in the movie take you for a great summer blockbuster ride and thrill you until the very last frame when ""What I've Done"" hits the speakers. The climax of the film has a great action sequence filled with numerous shots of special effects that look intensely real. This one will be remembered for a long time to come. See it and see it often."

","I am really ashamed I have not seen this movie in the theater, I thought of this movie first as of something with childish robots shaped in cool cars. Well I have to disagree with my first opinion of the movie. When I watched this movie, I was astonished of the good effects, the humor, the dialogs, the action - and above all the soundtracks, made by Steve Jablonsky. It all sounds a bit like Hans Zimmer, though Steve has some incredible Cello-tunes in his song, especially in the song called ""arrival to earth"". I would like all of you to listen well to the music in this movie, and if you get distracted by the movie itself, just buy the official soundtrack CD, you will not regret that!"

","I like reading the trivia and goofs on movies that I watched to see if I might've missed something or just to go beyond the movie. when i read the trivia on this movie I noticed one of the comments that read the nowhere in the film are the ""transformers"" referred to as such at least not directly. But when I was watching it again recently, I picked up on on line between megan fox and shia labouf while they are riding in his car after shortly after bumblebee fends off barricade. She specifically asks ""if he is such a super advanced robot why does he ""transform"" back into this piece of crap camaro"". she is specifically referring to Sam's car so to me that is a direct relation to the autobot, bumblebee and his counterparts. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think it could get much clearer that as a direct reference."
"vip_ebriega","8","2","3","15 July 2008"," More than meets the eye.
","My Take: Subtlety is not in the name of Michael Bay, but boring isn't either. <br/><br/>""Pump up the volume! I like that special effect, but make it look more real! Now, I like that shot, well done!"" That's what probably Michael Bay said repetitively, other than ""Action!"" and ""Cut!"", all throughout his latest summer blockbuster TRANSFORMERS, and when it is what you've come to hope for (big, glossy, silly and noisy), then TRANSFORMERS is the best, most anticipated and enjoyable rides of the summer. Does it live up to the hype? Never thought so before. When I saw the trailers and posters set up for advertising the film, I though this would just be another summer popcorn movie that's doing its job. I also though it would just be another exhibition of the newest line of special effects available at the department, something that director Michael ""Kaboom"" Bay is more comfortable to make.<br/><br/>I stand corrected. While it is silly, dumb and has no ambition to write, TRANSFORMERS works on the levels where it should work. The action keeps viewers on the go, and under the watchful eye of exec. producer Steven Spielberg and his Dreamworks crew, TRANSFORMERS has touches of class (a class of its own that is). Shia LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky, a teenager who gets himself involved into a plot to save the world when his ""new"" car turns out to be one of the Autobots, a race of machines set to save the earth from their enemies, the Decepticons. They're also in search of an object called the Allspark, also known as ""The Cube"" before the Decepticons rest their dirty hands on them, therefore fulfilling their plans for intergalactic supremacy. Along the way, the film juices up a few subplots including Sam flirting with the hottest chick in his school, played by model/actress Megan Fox. There's also subplots concerning a bunch of American soldiers (mainly Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson) and their families, but it's rarely exercised and almost utterly forgotten.<br/><br/>TRANSFORMERS may not have much of a plot, and if it does, it feels like it's been written by a bunch of kids playing with their Transformers toys. But what's weak in plot is more than made up for pure summer movie entertainment. Bay booms up the sound system, making it quite possibly the loudest summer movie since Bay's own films like THE ROCK and BAD BOYS. The special effects are triumphant creations, making the famous gang of Optimus Prime, Megatron, Bumblebee and the lot far beyond their plastic toy origins. Every single rust and scratch is captured by the film's creative and industrious effects crew. The fights scenes, most especially during the early moments of the film are especially exciting. The problem that lies on its never-lacking amount of action is that in almost overstays its welcome. The film runs at about 144 minutes tops (that's more than 2 hours!), much too long for a movie that doesn't intend to make much sense. The film could have cut at least 30 minutes or so of special effects and have nothing to risk losing.<br/><br/>Still, while surely not free of its flaws, TRANSFORMERS is everything you can ask for in a summer action entertainment. It may not offer anything more in bargain, but it deserves much credit for offering one of the better times I've experienced at the movies during the year.<br/><br/>Rating: **** out of 5."
"De_Watcher","8","2","3","23 June 2008"," surprisingly good
","This movie was surprisingly good. I had no expectations whatsoever and left off watching it for months and months. And months. Finally came round to seeing it and it was actually very good. Perhaps not plotwise, but hey let's be fair, that's not what you're looking for in a film like Transformers. It was funny in the right moments, the special effects were spectacular, and Megan Fox is a fox. What bugged me was the introduction speech that Optimus gave of the Autobots, it really didn't sit well with the tone of the movie. But that's just a minor glitch and easily forgiven. Lots of good chase and action, not a dull moment and a nice set of actors with a quirky as ever John Turturro standing out in minor role. Watch and be pleasantly surprised."

","Transformers: a humble children's toy. Transformers: a cartoon show. Transformers: one of the greatest theater experiences I have ever had. When I heard that they were making a Transformers movie, I thought the same thing that I thought about a lot of other recent movies: What the heck are they doing wasting their time with this movie? Then I saw the trailer and I changed my mind. I knew I had to see this movie when I saw a jet plane fly under a bridge, transform, grab onto the bridge, and throw itself into the air. I went to see this with my friend who had already seen it two times.<br/><br/>I truly was amazed. Though the story line was a little shaky and the shots were a little confusing, they were outweighed by the best special effects I had ever seen and the most edge-of-your seat action I had ever witnessed. In addition to Transformers becoming the coolest-looking movie I had ever seen, it was one of the funniest also, which was a big surprise.<br/><br/>Sure there were some plot holes and sure this movie was completely unrealistic, but its lack of realism made it that much more believable. All I have to say is ""Bring on Transformers 2!"""
"punisher6191","7","2","3","7 March 2008"," One of the most amazing films ever made!!
","This is a visual feast of a movie!! The special effects are just absolutely amazingly real!! The plot is very much something that would be in a generation 1 episode. I was absolutely enthralled when I found out that Peter Cullen was coming back as the voice of Optimus. He was, is, and always will be Optimus, no matter what!! Megatron was very cool, and I find it interesting that they kept Optimus's axe and Megatron's flail from the very first episode. The action is extremely well put together, the humor is great, and the acting is superb!! This in my opinion, the best way you could spent 2 hours. Transformers was always one of my favorite shows and they put it on the big screen extremely well. I only have 2 complaints about the movie. The first is Starscream's voice. In the show, it was a high pitch annoying voice, but in the movie, they made it deeper and more evil. The second is Bumblebee's voice. In the cartoon he was the kid of the Autobots, yet in the movie, when he does talk, he sounds more like a professor or something like that. I can't wait for the sequel!!!!"

","I just finished reading the last comment and I can say with all my heart I think he is completely missing the point. 1. I never liked the cartoon, and I don't think the other 110,000 viewer that gave this movie above 7 points average are all fans of comic books or the cartoon either. 2. This movie is probably for kids around the age of 5-17ish so I doubt they really care too much about where the planes are flying low or high. 3. Its supposed to be cheesy-ish; You want them all too sound like what exactly??? 4. 'After seeing this film, I almost feel like everyone in the movie was a robot' You mean you must be the stupid one and spent all your time and money wasted whining about it! Instead of sitting back, chilling out and enjoying this action packed, outstanding animation and explosions. 5. 'but absolutely ruin the movie for all of us' Speak for yourself egotistical egghead. Every movie ever made will have mistakes. Weather it be the car in LOTR or the star trooper banging his head on a door frame. One thing I can say to you Kev50027 is build a bridge and stop leaving pathetic comments on Christmas Day."

","I thought this movie was very entertaining in many ways. It brought back many good memories from the transformers cartoon from my childhood. The movie is very well done in terms of acting, plot, action sequences, and special effects. It has a great combination of action, humor, tragedy,and suspense from start to finish. The choice of cars for each Autobot as well as the vehicles chosen for the Decepticons was perfect. This is a true clash between good versus evil. I loved hearing Peter Cullen perform the voice of Optimus Prime once again! I also believe Shia Lebouf did a great job as well. If you desire to see an excellent action-packed movie (even if you are not a transformers fan), then definitely see this movie. Great job Michael Bay on a work of excellence!

"philip-473","9","2","3","22 February 2008"," Transformers- One of the best, but not without it's flaws
","Okay, this is my first review on this site so I'm going to warn you. This is not perfect, there will be some mistakes seeing that I'm only 14 years old. That is all, no lets get to the review.<br/><br/>I first heard about the movie a couple of months beforehand. But before then, I had only seen the original movie and enjoyed it. I wanted to see the movie and when I finally did sometime near the end of July/beginning of August. I had one of the best times of my life. My mom did too (We went on her birthday) and I only have one thing to say about it- WOW! Now let's get to the review shall we? <br/><br/>PLOT: The plot is pretty good, but for the series, it's straightforward- Robots come to Earth, Some humans befriend the good ones, the good bots (The Autobots) fight against the villains (The Decepticons). That pretty much it, but there are some thing that are added in,. For example, Megatron came first and got frozen, The villains free him and they go all Godzilla like on the Autobots for the All-Spark, destroying most of a city in the process. score-8.5/10 (If it wasn't the same formula that it was in all of the other series, I'd have given it a 9.5) <br/><br/>Casting: The cast was pretty good, It's a shame though that they used a new voice for Megatron (Hugo Weaving) instead of his old one. My other gripes are that no one understands what the heck Bonecrusher (Jimmie Wood) is even saying and couldn't they have gotten Keith David to do Barricade in the movie instead, that peed off many fans. The score for the cast- 9/10(I'd given this a perfect score if it wasn't for those problems) <br/><br/>SFX: This is where the movie shines, ILM has outdone themselves again. providing the majority of the CGI in the movie, there were also some props in the movie portraying the robots (Provided by KNB Effects and ILM-they did the Skorponok props, the head and tail in other words). My only gripe is the fact that the girl doesn't get any water on her when Ironhide (Jess Harnell) comes out of the pool. My score is 10/10 for these effects, they pulled them off nicely.<br/><br/>Overall: This move is a must see for TF fans as I myself enjoyed it (and I'm one too). But I have one question, why do so many people bash this movie anyways-9.9 out of a perfect 10.<br/><br/>Phil MacRae- Self appointed fan of Soundwave (I'm adding fun signatures at the end of my reviews just to tell you)."

That dude is frickin' awesome! When you watch the movie it will only feel like it was an hour and a half, but if you look on the back of the DVD case it is a wooping 144 mins. That may sound overwhemling but it's a fun ride so it isn't that long. Lets face it, even though we're afraid to mention it, this movie is a great summer popcorn flick!"

But the reviews were pretty good so we went to see it. We all thought it was a lot of fun, really well done, and most importantly, the transformers themselves were so well constructed and animated that they were believable.<br/><br/>Sure, there are some little problems with accuracy, like the Laurentian Abyss (27,000 Ft deep) being the deepest part of the ocean instead of the Marianas Trench (35,000) but most people probably wouldn't catch that.<br/><br/>Finally, we can't wait until the next Transformers movie comes out."

The only actors i enjoyed were him and the relationship he had with his parents, truly good scenes. Why does Jon Voigt (or however you spell it) walk in every scene? WHY IN EVERY GOVOURNMENT SCENE DO THEY BLOCK IT LIKE AN E.R. EPISODE? I liked the effects and all, but the plot line and character reaction to the plot line gets so misconstrued a lot.

The action sequences were thrilling enough to get adrenaline pumping, the acting was nearly flawless, and the CGI images of the Transformers - there are no words to describe the latter. The humour was laughable and it was interesting to see the whole storyline unfold slowly. Ah, yes, I musn't forget the real star of the show: Optimus Prime, voiced by the ever-young Peter Cullen. I thank goodness that they are making two more sequels, and I know I won't be disappointed."
"superstar_carnage","10","2","3","27 December 2007"," The best of 2007!
","I was skeptical at first to see transformers as I thought it would just another nerdy sci-fi film. I must say though when I saw the film, it exceeded my expectations, it was the film that surprised me most this year. The only real aspect that drove me to the film was the director, Michael Bay as his previous films are awesome (Bad Boys 1 and 2, The Rock). Not only does the film feature gigantic transforming robots but it is action packed, with slices of humour and heroism especially from Josh Duhamel, it also features some famous faces (Jon Voight, Jon Tuturro and Anthony Anderson just to name a few) and also a sappy love story between the main character, the nerdy Sam Witwicky.<br/><br/>At first the idea of cars, trucks, planes etc transforming into giant alien robots was outrageous to me at first but the concept combined with explosive action sequences made this film all the more enjoyable. For those thinking that this movie is just a copy of the cartoon, it is not. Bay has transformed the cartoon into this highly action packed realistic looking film, that surely does entertain and will not leave an audience bored. If you fall asleep in this movie, you must be narcoleptic! Transformers is far from a kid's movie, although the story is originally a kid's one. It's clearly apart of the action/adventure genre. For all action fans it is a must see and even if your not and your just bored and want to watch a movie that provides many thrills this is also a movie for you. In my opinion this movie is a transformer of the action genre, probably the first movie since Die Hard (1988).<br/><br/>Definitely in my top 10!"

","I was never a transformers fan I watched the beast wars series but i always consider it not a part of the transformers universe. Besides this the other transformers cartoon shows i always founded them to much for kids.<br/><br/>Since we live in a time when every comic book and cartoon show seems to get to the big screen you just don't know what to expect. I'm just glad i gave Transformers a chance i would have missed one of the best movies ever. The transformers are not the silly designs from the cartoon they are well done realistic CGI. Just to see them on the screen coming to life.. it's hard to put the feeling into words but i haven't felt that good watching a movie in a long time.<br/><br/>It's true that some characters could have used more screen time but with so many characters it's hard to propally introduce all of them. Anyway you will start loving Bumblebee see the hero that Optimus is, Ironhide also seems to prove to be a great and the evilness of the Decepticons.<br/><br/>The plot is not that spectacular if you think it in detail but with all the action and cool giant robots you tend to forget about it. <br/><br/>In all this movie will prove a great movie to watch and trust me you will not regret this movie. Om my personal list Transformers beats the Terminator series any day."

This isn't actually a flaw because I think its better like this for those who aren't fans of Transformers (like me).

I ended up watching it anyways and man I must say I LOVED IT. I was very happy with this movie. This film was made almost perfectly in every way. The movie did a great job at explaining the story of Transformers. It's great for both fans and non fans. The beginning was awesome with Blackout taking over the base. All the way to the end with the final showdown. The special effects are incredible. The way the autobots and decepticons transform is my favorite part of the movie. The characters are done very well. I liked the movie so much I watched it at least 2 mores time again. I immediately got into transformers after this movie. There are very few flaws I saw in this movie. I think the editing could have been a tad better, it would have been nice to see more dialogue between Megatron and Starscream, the idea of 2 young kids working at the Pentagon just seems funny, and small other little bits of stuff. This still doesn't stop me from giving Transformers a 10. I am surprised that there are actually people that bash the film. In my opinion it's one of the best comic movies ever made with Batman Begins. I would recommend this movie to anyone."

Everything about it's just good,the autobots are as comical as in the cartoon especially Jazz they've still kept him as cocky as he used to be.Peter culled done a top notch job as optimus Prime as he always does and he showed us that Optimus still lead the pack well.The only thing I did'nt get about it is why did they have to change bumblebee coz I fort if they used a new Volkswagen beetle it cud have still been really good but it did'nt bother me that much coz the car they chose looked nice anyway.The decepticons cud've been a bit more brutal,Starscream was the nuts even without his original annoying voice screaming down Megatrons neck but the decepticon who stole the show for me was barricade coz he looked so flash and I just love the bumblebee and Barricade fight scene.<br/><br/>Overall I think this movie is the nuts lol and if u liked the cartoon I know that u'd like this trust me I used to watch the cartoon all the time when I was little and iv'e started collecting the old videos again so thats how good it is lol.<br/><br/>I just can't wait for the Visionaries film when it cums out ;) 10 out of 10"
"themidget17","8","2","3","22 October 2007"," Michael Bay's best
","You know, just when everyone thought Michael Bay couldn't handle scenes with no action, he makes TRANSFORMERS: loaded with action and at the same time with excellent laughing scenes, plus the never-before-seen FX like these ones in the movie: I bet they are going to win the Academy Award for the best FX next year (2008).<br/><br/>If you see the movie at a cinema (which is the place where you can enjoy it best) you will realize why Michael Bay is a genius: the different stories stream in the movie and then they get connected with such a subtlety that you may not notice it! And also the music is awesome! When the Camaro transforms itself into the new Camaro (the Camaro of present day) they use a song from the movie Kill Bill!; and, I gotta tell you, it couldn't fit better..."

","I have heard so many people gripe and complain about the Transformers Live action movie that I simply had to put in my own two cents.<br/><br/>For those of you complaining that there was a lack of plot in this movie, well HELLO!?!? It's a movie about Giant Alien robots who transform into cars and trucks, what kind of plot did you expect it to have? Michael Bay did an *excellent* job bringing the transformation to as realistic terms as possible, I love the live action Transformers movie. To hell with what everyone else says.<br/><br/>I don't care! Have your opinions about the thing, but I thought it was a really well done ACTION flick, with incredible CGI and some sarcastic humor thrown in.<br/><br/>I don't care about: ""Wahhh Bumblebee is supposed to be a bug! ::fanboy cries::"" guess what? They can transform into whatever the hell they want, we're going for realism here, and what is cooler then a Camaro? Nothing! Nothing is cooler then that.<br/><br/>If you want to see a really great action film with fantastic special effects and humor thrown in, go see this movie!!"

",":) Forgive the title. I simply couldn't help myself. Well, on with my review. Put quite simply, I fell in love with this movie. I was skeptical at first about how a (sometimes cheesy) cartoon and comic book would translate to the film. We have seen it happen successfully with other characters of course, but alien robots? :D Well, I went in with an open mind and I was not disappointed. Every minute of this film was filled with either 'edge of your seat' action, or 'rolling in the aisles' humour. And in many cases both were expertly put together.<br/><br/>The special effects and writing were absolutely wonderful in this film, where even cheesy bits from old school Transformers made both serious and humorous transitions to the big screen. I loved the witty banter that came from some of the characters, just as much as I loved watching the rolling transformations of the Transformers. Additionally, the soundtrack for this film was absolutely breathtaking, especially the Autobots Arrival and the one playing when the soldiers are fighting the decepticon in Quatar.<br/><br/>And the actors themselves. Well they were wonderfully chosen. Even the voice actors. Having the same person voice Optimus Prime in the film as had in cartoons and video games was a wonderful touch. But for me, the best choice was Shia LaBeouf. Shia has proved that he has a wonderful on-camera presence whereby he can play a wide range of roles. His ability to perform in tense action scenarios combined well with his ability to keep an audience in fits of laughter. :) He totally made the movie for me.<br/><br/>I remember sitting in the movie theatre on the first night the Transformers preview came out. Everyone was on the edge of their seats trying to find out what this exciting movie was called (it was a very brief initial preview consisting of video footage from Mars). When Tansformers flashed onto the screen the entire theatre erupted in laughter. Well I hope everyone involved in making this film is laughing now, because they created a hit that people will want to watch again and again. I know I will.<br/><br/>Everyone, go rent, borrow, buy this film. You will not be disappointed! P.S. And just so you know. I rarely give things a ten out of ten. :)"
"csenek","10","2","3","2 September 2007"," The best movie in over a decade
","To begin let me say that over the last number of years I have watched with disgust as movies, books and art moved towards martyrism and over-sexualising humanity. I have stopped going to most movies and am surprised on rare occasion to find a movie I can enjoy. 300 was fantastic, but when I heard about Transformers coming out I figured, ""How are they going to butcher this thing?"" being an old Transformers fan. Then I went to the movie, and I was for a lack of better words amazed. Optimus' voice being the classic Optimus, Jazz sounding like his cartoon equivalent was amazing. The 'bots looked so real and the CGI didn't even show during the movie. I loved every second of this movie.<br/><br/>To those of you who hated it, you really need to calm down. I read a lot of the negative comments on this site and found that most of you seem to be out of your minds with anger. I don't know what you expected that didn't come through this movie but man you must be reaching for the moon to grasp Saturn! I loved this movie, I hope that they make a sequel and that it is just as awesome as this one. Amazing!"
"marctg17","10","2","3","20 August 2007"," one of the greatest movies ever made...awesome job Michael bay.
","When I saw the trailer for Transformers, I knew right away that it was going to be amazing. And I was right. When I went to see it, of course, like most other major features, the theater was completely packed and I almost couldn't get a seat. The movie was incredible though. It basically had everything a smash-hit summer movie should have: action/adventure, comedy, romance (you know what I mean :) ), OK maybe not everything but it had a lot. I absolutely loved it overall. The acting was incredible, CGI awesome, story-line fantastic, and Shia Lebouf did an incredible job as the lead role and so did Megan Fox as his co-star. I give it 5 thumbs up. It was so good that it's still in theaters. I also loved the fact that is the only non-sequel in history (I think), to have grossed the most money on opening weekend."

","Extraordinary from start to finish: it was ""awesome"" seeing one of the most beloved landmark Classic animation TRANSFORMERS brought to the big screen. The acting of the characters & voices (and 3-D Actions of our Heroe's) of the Autobots & Decepticons were magnificent & out of this World!

","WOW!! Transformers is the best movie that I have ever seen!! I can't believe some idiots would rather go and see Simpsons the Movie over Transformers!!! I was blown away at the start of the year by Spiderman 3 ...and now this... this film has blown even that out of the water! It could even be the best film I have EVER seen! The special effects are out of this world! When watching this, we got goosebumps..and I wasn't even a massive transformers fan to begin with. Even tho the effects are amazing, the movie wouldn't have been half as good without the fantastic writing of the script. The lead role in this movie (guy from 'Even Stephens') is really funny and perfectly casted for the role. I think the producers were spot on only releasing a tiny part of the films footage in the trailers that came out last year because it really built up the anticipation of the film! I can honestly FULLY recommend this film to EVERYONE of all ages. Any person who has a negative view of this movie is just envious of their amazing success! This, to me, is the best movie of our time. :-)"
"Jedi_Mike89","10","2","3","4 August 2007"," Thank you Michael Bay!
","You didn't screw up! In fact you did amazing! Now normally; and we've all seen it before, film makers take a famous franchise (Batman, Superman, Fantastic Four, Spider-man, Transformer's etc.) and royally screw it up. No offense to anyone but look at Fantastic Four. Breaking from the trend, Michael Bay took our beloved Transformers and just flew to the stars with it (in a good way). My expectation wasn't very high and to be dead honest Transformer's wasn't my favorite show as a kid though i watched it. But word started going around about how good it was so ofcorse i had to check it out. Oh man was i impressed! Really the only thing i found bad with it is you can see a bus (of people?) explode but the mother and son go unharmed. I know it was because OP ""saved"" them but you never see a family die in a disaster movie (or action in-which civilian's die). But really that doesn't even make me mad i just had to find something to talk about negatively. Even down to the cinematography and different shot's made me just ""wow""; i can't even explain it! I'm very excited the ending kind-of screamed sequel. Good job Michael and anyone else involved in this project. It made my dream of becoming a film maker regain the glimmer of hope that in this day and age good movies still can be made. I thank you Transformers."
"helgar30","8","2","3","6 July 2007"," Easily this summer's blockbuster movie!
","I grew up as a fan of the original cartoon series and this was a dream come true. Yes, there were some changes that were made in regards to the robots and their alternate forms (No VW Bug, no Porsche, nor Megatron changing into a gun, etc.) but these differences are easily overlooked and actually worked out for the better. And since a sequel was green lighted, there's an opportunity to improve upon such details. I know that there's a group that hates Michael Bay movies because they're CGI driven, loud, and practically obnoxious but you know, this actually works out perfectly for the subject matter. This isn't an intellectually stimulating movie nor will it win an Oscar, but it'll definitely be up for best picture at the MTV movie awards so that should tell you something in regards to the majority of the audience that will see this movie. When I watched as the Autobots formed up together and Optimus Prime belts out his first words...let me tell you, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. Don't try to over analyze this movie or even knit pick it. Just leave your common sense at the door and enjoy it for what it simply is, a fun, action packed movie."

","I reviewed this before but some of my opinions have changed and I've become to appreciate it more. The greatly paced and remains entertaining no matter what is happening, the score and music used is great, the action and robot fights are the best thing about this movie (My personal favorite is Optimus Prime vs Bonecrusher), the characters are tolerable and memorable but nothing too special except the acting is great and the characters feel natural including the robots. Only problem I have is there is a bit too many subplots (at least 3 different ones) but they tie them in together nicely enough to not distract you. The humor isn't bad but I wouldn't say every person would die laughing at every joke, some of the jokes are funny because of how weird they are tho. This still remains the best out of all the 5 (or 6 if u include bumblebee) films. The special effects also still hold up today really well. Tons of fun to be had here."

","This was the first film in the transformers franchise and the one that is concidered the best of them and like Michael bay's previous films before this here he takes the has to figures and makes it into a sci fi film it has army rangers working at a military base and a deception comes and attacks<br/><br/>Meanwhile later Sam played by Shia labeof is a school kid who trlls about his great grandfather archibald and how he explored the arctic circle and here the film has a decent storyline and unlike the sequels this one was the most coherent of them all while I find the first two sequels enjoyable and the fourth and fifth installments not good and the worst of the series this one is the best and the most enjoyable and interesting the film also has Megan fox who plays mikaela she does a mediocre performance but that doesn't effect the film it's still a god sci fi film mothers it's like in ET and like how Steven Spielberg made it charming with a beard here Michael bay makes his own and he killed it he captured it brilliantly a lot of series of events happen like when all the other autobots arrive and the leader optimus talks how they are trying to stop the deceptions and it also tells that there was some of the all sparks cordinantes on the glasses that have ended up in the possession of witwicky and they also explain that archibald accidentally reactivated megaton.<br/><br/>Later more charachters come such as agent Simmons of sector seven played by John turturro who gives a fine performance and they capture bumblebee who was the first auto or who came to earth and was sams car the other autobots, ironhode, ratchet, and the leader optimus prime later continue their mission then when all the humans including Sam, makaela and the other team members find megaton Dorsey up he then awakens and signals all the deceptions and then escapes.<br/><br/>Later a battle in Chicago happens with autobots fighting the deceptions and as you se this is were the biggest action is done and Michael bay gives his best directing performance and like I also said he is one of the best action directors he is the Martin Scorsese of action movies and he directs it well I ca easily tell what is going on and in the end megaton is defeated when Sam is tasked to push the cube into optimus chest so he can sacrifice himself but instead pushes it into megatroms chest and later the film ends with autobots back togeather and this is how they started to work with humans and defend the planet.<br/><br/>This is among the best summer blockblusters of all time and is among bay's best movies I get how he has been loved, admired and praised by moviegoers and here it's among his greatest directing debuts this film deserved oscars for best director( bay , best picture, best screenplay, best sound editing, best sound mixing, best visual effects, best cinematography, best film editing, best original score and best original song

Speaking as a Generation X, avid 80's cartoons and toys buff, and proudly having purchased a 12"" Optimus Prime a couple years beforehand, this movie was a boyhood dream come true.

","Ground-breaking in its attention to detail as far as effects go and honest in its intentions as a loud and bombastic series of action set pieces, it has a surprisingly fitting aesthetic that both tips its hat to the source material while adapting it for a modern age. However, Transformers '07 is at its core call-back to the blockbusters of the late 90s, where character and development take a back seat to effects and spectacle, making CG the star of the show in place of story and causing the players in this multi-million dollar play-date to range from flat and forgettable to insulting and exploitative."

","Good and evil alien robots that have the ability to transform into other mechanical objects come to Earth seeking a powerful artifact that can bring life or destruction. Shia LaBeouf, who plays a teen who unwittingly owns an object that has a clue to the whereabouts of the valuable artifact, finds himself in the middle of a war between the Autobots (good Transformers) and the Decepticons (evil Transformers) when he buys a used Camaro that turns out to be an Autobot named Bumblebee.<br/><br/>My most memorable, movie moment of ""Transformers"" is the scene when Megan Fox (the love interest of LaBeouf) asks why Bumblebee, with all his alien robot technology, would transform into an old, piece of crap Camaro. Bumblebee comes to a sudden halt, throws out LaBeouf and Fox, and speeds off.<br/><br/>There are many who are not fans of Michael Bay. I think most are in the category of film snobs. Michael Bay is great at what he does: make fast-paced, action movies that have a dramatic, driving score that accentuates the numerous fleeting but highly dramatic moments. Realism is not his forte; but when it comes to dramatic spectacle, there are very few who can rival Bay. He has made ""Transformers"" not just about robots fighting humans fighting robots; it's also about a boy's taste of freedom when he finally gets his first car and the opportunities it opens up with the girls. With all the outrageous, action sequences and amazing special effects, what really connected me to this movie is the love LaBeouf has for his car - you really have to be a guy to understand this.<br/><br/>Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"

"joshuadrake-91275","9","1","1","29 September 2015"," The Autobots rises!
","I do my film review of the TRANSFORMERS movie franchise and I am going to start with the first installment of the franchise, released in 2007.<br/><br/>The film follows Sam Witwicky, a teenager who gets caught up in a war between the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons, two factions of alien robots who can disguise themselves by transforming into everyday machinery.<br/><br/>The Autobots intend to use the AllSpark, the object that created their robotic race, in an attempt to rebuild Cybertron and end the war while the Decepticons desire control of the AllSpark with the intention of using it to build an army by giving life to the machines of Earth.<br/><br/>The film was developed in 2003 and the film went into production in 2006 and it was released on July 3, 2007 and the film was really amazing when I first saw the feature film and I was impress to see the Transformers on screen and I really did not know what they were until I went online and found out more about them.<br/><br/>The CGI and action sequences were amazing and the Autobots and the Decepticons were really created well with the help of computer-generated imagery and the final fight between Optimus Prime and Megatron is my favorite action sequence in the Transformers film released in 2007.<br/><br/>My favorite Transformer characters are Optimus Prime, Bumbleebee, Jazz and Ratchet. Peter Cullen does the voice of Optimus Prime and he does a great job. Mark Ryan does a really great job as Bumblebee. ""Family Matters"" actor Darius McCrary plays Jazz. Robert Foxxworthy plays Ratchet and they are both amazing in their performances. Hugo Weaving from V FOR VENDETTA and THE MATRIX TRILOGY does a really great job and it is amazing to hear him as Megatron.<br/><br/>The human characters are also great. Shia LaBeouf is really good as the lead, while Megan Fox is really hot and is amazing and she was the right choice to play the love interest of Shia LaBeouf and the two on-screen together is really amazing in this film. Tyrese Gibson is real cool. Josh Duhamel is really amazing too. Jon Voight, Anthony Anderson and Rachael Taylor plays their parts really amazing in their performances and the screen time they have.<br/><br/>Steve Jablonsky's score is really amazing in this film and I really enjoyed Linkin Park's song, ""What I've Done"" and I loved the music video and their other two songs from the other two films, ""New Divide"" and ""Iridescent"" in Revenge of the Fallen and Dark of the Moon and the song by Imagine Dragons from Age of Extinction is called ""Battle Cry"". I liked that song, too.<br/><br/>Overall, TRANSFORMERS is a perfect movie by all means and I am giving this a 9 out of 10."
"CinematicInceptions","7","1","1","7 December 2014"," Not very classy but potentially enjoyable.
","This movie and its series are all a matter of taste. You'll probably like one and only one of the four Transformers movies. Each one is like a different flavoring of the same food, so there will probably be one that you think is decent and one that you absolutely hate. For me, this first installment is the one that fits my tastes best (I absolutely hated Revenge of the Fallen), though not in all areas. All of the first three movies (I can't speak for Age of Extinction since I haven't seen it) try to be an all around crowd pleaser in kind of the same way that Forrest Gump does but with much less class. The filmmakers tried to include lots of humor, a fairly prominent love story, a scattered amount of character development, and overriding action. The final product comes together okay, but the style it's done in has so much personality that it can't get much praise from critics.<br/><br/>The first aspect I will address is the characters. Overall the filmmakers get about a B- for the characters, but this grade results from the averaging of the good and bad. The minor characters got the best development like the Airforce guy taking the long road back to his family and the government and hackers investigating the Decepticon messages. However, the main human roles of Sam, Mikala, and the one government agent who comes back in the other two were not well written. Mikala had zero personality, which never helps for any character. Sam was too greedy and undeserving of recognition to be a good hero, but I'll get into more detail with that in regard to the story. The government agent had a believable jerky personality, but implausibly negative actions like how he hides everything he has discovered already about transformers. The Transformers were diversely written with lots of personality, but I feel like their personalities collectively are a mix of Lord of the Rings and a group of street punks. Optimus and Megatron are very dramatic and speak in menacing tones while all of their followers act like the whole thing is a big game. I'm not familiar with the Transformers cartoons, so maybe this is commonplace for the robots. The redeeming aspect of the characters is that none of them are poorly acted, only poorly written to an extent.<br/><br/>Next is the storyline, which has a number of branches. The main branch involves Sam Whitwicky, Mikala, and Sam's new ""car"". Sam getting the girl of his dreams is rather reminiscent of the early 2000's Spiderman movies in that extraordinary circumstances bring them together instead of any actions on Sam's part and the fact that Sam is portrayed kind of a loser. The second largest branch is the Autobots and Decepticons both trying to obtain the Allspark that will save their race. The third branch is the government trying to make sense of all of the alien activity and how they should deal with it. The fourth and final branch is the deployed soldiers that are returning home to the States only to get caught up in the middle of the alien war. None of the plots are very hard to follow and are very simple and straightforward. <br/><br/>The next and smaller aspect is the comedy element. The filmmakers overtly try to put laughs in the movie in frequent and large amounts. Humor is, of course, a matter of taste, so I won't say whether it's good or bad. I suppose it is well delivered and has a consistent style throughout, although we get comedic lines from many different characters. <br/><br/>Lastly is the action and its execution. The transformers are basically big fish fighting in a too small pond. Any time they go into combat, whatever venue they choose to fight at has to be rebuilt from scratch after the battle. The fights are very explosive with huge guns and large scale boxing matches. There is some human interaction with these fights, but the humans are very technologically outclassed so there is little they can do to harm the robots. The effects are obviously big budget and are very sharp, realistic, and cool in a sci- if way (i.e. the way the transformers transition from car to humanoid shape. <br/><br/>On the whole, it appeals to popular cinematic whims and isn't anything that's going to last through the ages. However, it can be enjoyable, but not if you like movies with lots of thought and class put into them. If more pictures follow the four that already exist, they will make lots of money, but not get great critical reviews as they have in the past. If you didn't like this one, I would actually recommend watching the other ones because one of them will probably strike your fancy. Overall Rating: 8.2/10."
"filmfan1991","Null","1","1","25 April 2014"," A flawed but entertaining and fun summer sci-fi action flick
","7 years ago this movie completely blew me away. Everything about this movie was just awesome. The action was intense, the special effects were incredible and still looks great to this day. And the acting was so well done between the robots and the human characters that I almost believed that the Autobots and Deceptions were real. It was even because of this movie that I was formerly introduced to the ""Transformers"" franchise. Of course after exposure to other incarnations, multiple viewings and other better movies, it's not as perfect as I thought it was but it's still a fun and spectacular special effects extravaganza.<br/><br/>The first live action Transformers movie is about the ongoing war between the Autobots and Decepticons and how they bring their war to Earth looking for the Allspark cube and get us in the crossfire including a young teenager Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), his crush Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox), a military unit and various other characters.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox as Sam and Mikaela respectively make for good likable leads. ""Transformers"" was the breakout role for both of them especially more so for Megan Fox since it launched her career as a movie actress and sex symbol. She played a good role since her character was rough, gritty, street-smart and incredibly gorgeous to boot. Shia also did well here too as the awkward and geeky teenager looking for a car so that he can impress the girl. He delivered some good lines including the classic ""I bought a car"" line and had some good chemistry with Megan. Other mainstream actors like Tyrese Gibson, Josh Duhamel, Anthony Anderson, Jon Voight, Kevin Dunn, Julie White and John Turturro were here but the most memorable was Turturro as the federal agent Simmons from Sector 7. Turturro brought a lot of good humor to the series since he knew what he was working with. But the biggest icing on the cake was bringing the original Optimus Prime ""Peter Cullen"" back to voice the character since he had the commanding and noble voice that defined Optimus. As for Megatron, Hugo Weaving came in and he did a great job for the most part giving Megatron that sinister and menacing voice that Frank Welker originally gave even though his role in this movie was short. (Trivia: Welker couldn't come back to voice the character since Michael Bay thought that his current voice didn't fit but I've recently watched the newer TV series ""Transformers: Prime"" and Welker reprised the role there and he was just as good as he was in the original show even though he sounded much older.) So I don't completely understand why he couldn't come back but that's a nitpick and Weaving still did a great job.<br/><br/>Even after seven years the special effects and action scenes still pack an incredible punch and considering that most of the effects were done by Industrial Light and Magic it shouldn't be a surprise. And while Michael Bay is pretty infamous for making high octane popcorn films with fast edits and stylistic visuals, he was a ""decent"" choice for directing this trilogy but with one criticism and it's the most clichÃ© thing to say now since everyone else before me has said it but I'm still going to say it anyways. (The human characters overshadow the Transformers themselves in their own movie trilogy.) Because of this, character development from most of the Autobots and Decepticons is minimal to none with most fan favorites reduced to cameo roles. And unless if you are at least familiar with the other incarnations including the G1 series from the 80s, you might not get some of the references or know the relationships with one another. Even the script is questionable at times with the robots doing things out of character like Optimus Prime saying ""Oops"" or ""Sorry my bad"" after accidentally trampling a backyard water fountain and a small garden or even Bumblebee urinating on Simmons when he refuses to talk. (I'm not kidding, he actually does that in the movie.)(These are more personal nitpicks because I like the ""Transformers"" franchise and like other fans I'd like the characters to be more faithful to their original incarnations, much like the reboot of ""Star Trek"" which modernized the franchise but remained faithful to the original series but I'm going off topic.)<br/><br/>That all being said, ""Transformers"" is a flawed but entertaining and fun summer sci-fi action flick that I still enjoy to watch every now and then."

","This movie was definitely a disappointment. The original Transformers: The Movie was AWESOME, and to this day still remains one of my favorites.<br/><br/>THIS movie was a special effects monster with much to be desired in the way of plot and storyline. It kept switching between being a film that took itself seriously and being downright cartoony. Furthermore, references to the first movie and original cartoon series were very forced.<br/><br/>The worst part? The credits tell us it is based on the action figures manufactured by Hasbro, not on the original series or ideas. Guess we know who bankrolled the movie."

","I cannot believe that people gave good reviews for this drivel. The only thing worse than the pee jokes and ridiculous plot (the world is ending but Sam Witwicky is worried about his parents finding out there are robots in the yard) is Shia LaBeouf's crap ass acting. How top Hollywood producers can scour the world for talent and come up with him is shocking. Is it the name? Is it the face? Is it maybe because he comes up with his own lines? Whatever the case, for some diabolical reason Hollywood is going to have this son of Satan on the illustrious silver screen for as long as they can float him.<br/><br/>Did you know that ""when casting for the role of Robert Ford it came down to Casey Affleck and Shia LaBeouf. Affleck eventually got the role, because LaBeouf was felt to be too young.""????!!?!?!?!? Too young?!?!?! The thought of him single handedly almost ruining that movie makes me shudder.<br/><br/>Oh, and he's going to be the next Indiana Jones. What a way to end a franchise you pickle-brained producers.<br/><br/>If/when Armageddon comes, you won't have to take a cyanide pill or throw yourself off a cliff. You can just buy this movie and play it at home. The sheer power of SUCK rays will melt your brain like Velveeta."

","This is really a terrible movie and a total disappointment. The only upside is that there are some watchable action scenes. But even the quality of those action scenes is beneath what you would expect from a Hollywood 'blockbuster' wannabe. The movie tries to be funny, but in a way no one over 13 would appreciate. The jokes are awful to watch. When the movie is funny, it is almost always unintentional. Every character except maybe the main male character is a stereotype and played in a ridiculous way. I was sitting there thinking 'How can anyone make such a stupid movie. What a terrible waste of money and time'. I did not even wait until the end, but left the movie theater early, something I almost never do."

","I attended the midnight screening in Dunedin, New Zealand, this morning and oh my god, it was the best movie I have ever seen. I too am a die-hard Transformers fan(girl!), as is my brother who went with me, and it exceeded our expectations. Of course there are going to be those who think that the exact plot of the 80's cartoon should have been adhered to but come on, reality anyone? (Although, don't get me started on the X-Men movies, being an avid collector of said comics) Plus it was aimed at those of us who grew up with the cartoon, and who have grown up into more sceptical adults. I thought it was completely believable and suited to the modern times we live in, it was funny, thoughtful, action-packed and even though I had been awake for nearly a day, I was wide-eyed throughout it. Who cares that they don't match the vehicles/whatever they were in the 'day'? Or that the voices weren't exactly the same (well, then again, if Peter Cullen wasn't Optimus Prime's voice, perhaps I might I felt differently)? It was fun, it was awesome and Optimus Prime rocked. Megatron's voice was way awesomer than the original and I loved how they incorporated all the kitch-ness of the 80's cartoon into the dialogue - 'more than meets the eye' - so cool! The plot line wove neatly together, with several different characters and aspects merging towards the end, and the battle scenes were intense and the special effects amazing. I think I have waited my entire life to see something like this. Shia Lebouf was really good as Sam Witwicky and blended so well with the action. Of course he was the hero, even in the cartoons, Optimus Prime valued human life over his own. I recommend this movie to everyone (well, not the littlies), girls and boys, it so rocked my world and I am going to go see it again next week. -H"

","The immortal words of Shakespeare came to mind as I watched Michael Bay's latest abomination of cinema. Why Shakespeare? Because he was a man who with little more than a stage and a few actors and some creativity he entranced hundreds, then thousands, now millions with stories with humor and heart. Basic human dramas rich with timeless themes.<br/><br/>On the other end of the spectrum, we have Michael Bay, a T.V. commercial and music video director with about as much soul as a cappuccino machine. He has a budget of $100 million and the best special effects that money can buy and all he can come up with is this.<br/><br/>This travesty. This is two-hour slickly produced, focus group honed Chevy commercial with some comic relief and some nostalgic Saturday morning cartoon robots thrown in for good measure. Is the new Camaro hot? Duh, that's like asking is Megan Fox is, well, a fox... Sure the vehicles look great and the effects were well done, but the film like it's vacuous director lacked a soul.<br/><br/>People will say, ""But...it's a just a popcorn summer movie!"" or ""It's the ""Transformers"" what do you expect?"" Well, I expect more than what I received for the ticket price.<br/><br/>I expect some attempt at an interesting plot. Come on! Herbert Hoover hid it in the dam? Please. World class beauty falls for the insecure nerdy kid? Whatever. Optimus Prime wants to sacrifice himself to save the world? Nonsense.<br/><br/>The film lacked scope. It lacked any sense of dramatic tension. It lacked suspense. The cartoonish over-the-top performances of Turturro and Voight were B-movie grade schlock."

GM/Ford along with the military must have paid loads to this movie. But the worst part, having seen Die Hard 4.0 before Transformers, where the execution of the plot seems remotely possible (not counting the whole Autobots thing against, of cause), and knowing they made two movies in one. A great action movie, and some low humor ""American Pie 'Insert number'"". And so damn long. Let's see some more action, not a robot escaping off of a bridge, determined that is has to be done in near slow motion."
"gary_dory_dory","3","5","12","28 June 2007"," Other than SFX.... Rubbish Movie.
","Sure, the SFX as everybody has stated DEFINITELY worth 10 stars. But the movie itself was totally ruined by the director or story writer whoever and deserves a huge one star. This is another movie that makes you ask ""why did he do this? why did he do that? How did this happen and so on""... When a movie makes you come up with all these ""why"" questions... it's bound to be a terrible movie. I am a huge transformer fan myself. Have toys, whole series, old movies and books of transformers since im a young kid. All these years, i expected they were going to make a transformers movie and i really looked forward to it. It was one day when i watched pirates of Caribbean 3 that i saw the preview of transformers i jumped up in mid air screaming ""oh yes!!!"". I was pumped up alright... but not when i got to the actual movie. If you're a super fan of transformers like I am, a person who would dress up as megatron with a optimus prime head to the cinemas on first viewing... trust me u'll be hugely hugely disappointed. They made the transformers look more like BIONICLE units. They couldn't really create the uniqueness of each one of the transformers AND THAT INCLUDES OPTIMUS PRIME AND MEGATRON. Fight scenes were incredibly messy too with so much goof you can pick out. OH YES THE GOOF... THERE ARE MILLIONS OF THEM YOU CAN PICK OUT. The SFX were the only thing worth watching throughout this movie. I've been doing animation myself for quite many years with Maya and zbrush for fun and i must say im quite good at it. To tell me to do a short scene with the quality of shrek or incredibles is no problems and will take about 3-4 weeks. But to tell me to do a short scene of transformers... man it'll take me 3 months at least!!! THe SFX is by far the best i've seen in a movie hands down.

Even better than The Rock! A lot of people have said bad things about Shia, but I think Shia really carried this film, he's acting is the best out of all the human actors in the movie. As for the robots voice, Peter Cullen IS GOD!!! Optimus Prime... And Hugo Weaving's mechanilised voice as Megatron is pure evil! Absolutely good job all round! And this movie received a standing ovation like you've never heard!

"Unholyxxxx","4","4","9","26 June 2008"," Most overrated movie ever
","A while before it came out here, I didn't think I was going to like this movie. I had already seen pictures of the Bumblebee model, and was very disappointed by the design they chose. I suppose this style is more like in the modern Transformers animated series, but very different from how I remember the Transformers from the G1 series. <br/><br/>But then, when I saw the trailer in cinema for the first time(the one with the helicopter), I actually got goosebumps and when the film came out, the reactions were all so positive that I couldn't wait to see it. So I did, and damn, the movie turned out to be exactly what I had expected in the beginning;<br/><br/>The robot's design was far too complicated and overdone, the CGI was so obvious, I never got the idea that I was looking at real giant living machines walking around. At many times it was almost impossible to follow the action and I'm sure that when the designers would have sticked more to the original - more simple - Transformers design, the fighting scenes would have been much better and easier to follow. Besides, with a few exceptions, the robots all looked alike to me; when fighting each other hand-to-hand, it was very hard to see which one was the Decepticon and which one was the Autobot. Or maybe I just need glasses.<br/><br/>I understand it is also a children's movie, but I so hoped for a more dark feeling(like the first Batman movie, with Michael Keaton, that worked, didn't it?) maybe even a little gore. For example: why would a giant evil robot try to scare a tiny human into giving it what it wants, instead of just pulling out an arm or a leg?? I was hoping for some Starship Troopers like violence, you can call me a sick person, but I think that a battle between a Decepticon and a group of humans, would be over in a matter of seconds, leaving the Decepticon fully intact and the humans... well... dead. Then they would need the Autobots to protect them...<br/><br/>Another thing; why the hell did they waste the name 'Devastator' on a meaningless Decepticon that dies within 10 minutes(if I recall correct), while every fan knows that in the TV-series, Devastator is the first 'combiner' that consists of the 6 Constructicons, and one of the coolest Transformers ever. At least this Devastator did look like a Constructicon, but wasn't very impressive without the other 5...<br/><br/>There's one thing that the CGI Transformers can do, that the animated Transformers couldn't(or never did on screen), for as far as I know, and that is to 'scan', for example a car, and then transform into that car. When watching the series, one of the things I found weird, even as a kid, was the fact that an alien robot, that has crash landed on earth 4 million years ago, can look like a modern F15 jet... So the scanning thing would explain that, but for some reason, I don't know why, it kinda took the fun away for me. Another strange fact from the series was that Megatron could transform into a handgun that was small enough for Soundwave or Starscream to hold with one hand. That wouldn't be a good idea for the movie, but at least let him transform into a Cannon then, like Galvatron, but not an aircraft...<br/><br/>Aside from the things mentioned above; the script really sucked, as well as many other things, so don't think I only didn't like it because of the confusing special fx and the fact that they didn't stay true to the original series.<br/><br/>The movie also has some good points; like Shia LaBeouf, and a few good scenes, like the opening scene with the helicopter, and it was still enjoyable to watch in a way, but it could have been so much more than this... I've seen it some time ago, but I still can't understand how people can be so positive about this movie, like it was the greatest movie of 2007... That, and the fact that I'm bored right now, is why I wrote this. I hope the sequel will have some improvements, but the biggest failure of this film, for me, was the Transformers design, and I don't expect that to be much different in the sequel. CGI keeps getting better and more realistic, and although they are not yet able to create a realistic lion, or shark, or dinosaur, and far from making a realistic looking human, you would think that making a believable computer animated robot/machine would be hard to f*ck up, but they did it! And for that, I give this movie 4 *'s."
"paul2001sw-1","2","4","9","11 January 2008"," All about the product
","A car that turns into a robot. Great idea for a toy; not such a great idea for a film. But the toy was conceived with the idea of it being marketed by a television series; that gave rise to an animated film; and now to this live action remake. If the film was pure sci-fi, it might not be too bad; but the attempt to make a partially human-centric story around these devices, in a semi-real world context, is disastrous, featuring by turn ridiculousness, clichés and product placement (and not just of the Transformers themselves); the film borrows from the conventions of thriller, teen movie and knowing comedy without offering any originality or coherence as it does so. What are on offer are a lot of spectacular special effects, but watching the robots fight over skyscrapers I was reminded of the original 'King Kong'. The special effects of that film were then cutting edge, but now seem primitive; yet the reality depicted in this movie is no more convincing, in spite of the modern graphics, so divorced are the images from any sense of meaning. You can make a fun movie about fighting aliens: 'Independence Day' is a good example, but the concept of 'Transformers' lies wholly in the product, and the narrative justification we get is stretched very thin. If this really is what Hollywood currently considers as premium movie-making, we can only hope that our descendants will first damn, and then forgive us."
"kg2006","Null","4","9","16 December 2007"," A terrible fx movie from a truly talentless director 2/10
","This film was a disaster. A mess. Unwatchable. The worst direction of a movie since the Island. I don't know what I enjoyed less, this or the Star Wars prequels.<br/><br/>The script was non existent. Confusing--stupid. Not even the writers of the cartoon show would have stooped to a level as mentally challenged as this. It wasn't even tongue in cheek or camp. It was just bad writing. Shame on the screenwriters--though is suspect the director had a lot to do with it so let me save my venom for him...<br/><br/>The fx: yes the compositing of cg into live action was very good--not as impressive as Davy Jones from Pirates of the Caribbean but still very good. Unfortunately, the direction was so rotten as to spoil the sense of awe you might have expected from it and the fx sequences. For one thing--these 10 ton machines ran around like..well, 8 inch toys. They were hiding under bridges, stumbling through backyards without making impact tremors, basically reduced to a joke. Truly. There were very few moments where they behaved like actual gigantic machines. But who cares right? Its fantasy. OK well then give me great action sequences. But they weren't great. They were confusing and poorly edited--so much so you could hardly stay focused on the action.<br/><br/>This is why Michael Bay deserves a kick between the legs for being such a failure as a storyteller. Above all its his fault(and Spielberg's for urging him to do it.). If I go to see a movie about giant fx monsters, I expect bad writing, even bad acting, but I want to see cool action scenes if nothing else. But he directed them like he did the Island, confusing, choppy, constantly moving cameras that didn't focus on the characters long enough to stay absorbed in the moment of the story.<br/><br/>The only irony in the film is that when i heard about it I thought it was like Small Soldiers in reverse, so it was amusing for half a second to see the father from that movie playing the same role in this one. Small Soldiers was a much better movie.<br/><br/>Masters of the Universe 87 was a better movie. The animated cartoon movie better (and that is saying a lot). I actually wish it was as good as the first Jurassic Park--which had a lame story and weak dialogue--even that was genius next to this.<br/><br/>Its a shame someone like Paul Verhoeven couldn't have made this--he knew how to do an action sequence and if he was going to throw humor in it would have been more sophisticated<br/><br/>I give the film 2 points. 1 for the fx and the 1 for the casting of Cullen as Optimus Prime (even though his design was an eyesore and he didn't behave in a very dignified fashion).<br/><br/>I read somewhere that Bay used to work for George Lucas and when he heard about Raiders of the Lost Ark he dismissed it as a ""toy movie."" Well Bay really showed that he knows how to make a movie as if he was a 3 year old playing with a camera. This was one truly infantile movie.<br/><br/>A big budget Hollywood movie at its worst."

","Michael Bays toy based block buster is a lot like a transformer itself.On the surface it appears to be a fun action film, but when you sit down to watch it, it transforms into something else- a moronic, product placement pushing remake of independence day, where giant robots replace giant space ships.<br/><br/>Though the transformers franchise has its own universe and mythology, the live action movie throws it all out of the window and replaces it with a mid nineties disaster movie formula: Tons of clichéd, underdeveloped characters, holey and illogical plotting as well as unintentional laughs.<br/><br/>A big problem with the movie is its frustrating sense of priority: the transformers are supposed to be the main attraction of the movie and yet the film devotes most of its time to an annoyingly bloated cast of characters who don't have any real impact over the plot and really aren't worth giving a damn about. The transformers are reduced to being clumsy machines who destroy stuff and say funny one liners which is just wrong because its their movie, not the U.S military's - save that stuff for G.I. Joe ! <br/><br/>As to be expected, the visual effects are amazing: the autobots and the decepticons look spectacular. Even when they are doing something as mundane as talking to each other, optimus prime and co look very realistic. As great as the transformers look though, you'll have trouble seeing them at times and that leads to what is unexpectedly but undoubtedly the biggest fault of the movie: the action . Transformers is an ACTION movie based on ACTION figures, directed by an ACTION movie director and yet the films action is surprisingly crappy. The moment it looks like a big battle is gonna kick off, wobbly camera shots and hyper fast ADD editing just distract you from whats going on . Movies like king kong (2005), and Hulk made sure that their action sequences featuring giant battling behemoths were exciting and easy to see- why couldn't transformers do the same thing? <br/><br/>It boggles the mind to think about how badly bay missed the mark on this one."

Thirdly they should have just focused on one city rather than show the transformers turning up in Iraq too (I think it was Iraq but not sure). It was all a bit disjointed.<br/><br/>Now onto the positives(actually I mean positive).

Shia LaBeouf, Anthony Anderson, John Turturro, etc had their acting talents wasted, and reminded me of another bad Gen X flashback film, ""Super Mario Bros."" The Gen X'ers need to come to terms with their age and stop being the high school quarterback living out his glory days on film. The Transformers were a poor knock-off of Japanese Anime and if you were going to do any robo/cartoon based movie, at least have the sense to go to the source - Robotech."

","Seriously, what a piece of crap!!! This picture like a typical Michael Bay movie has good special effects but simply the movie is so stupid I'm actually starting to feel brain damaged. The movie is an attack to the intellect with just a few laughs. Michael Bay is horribly unskilled behind the camera, thanks to this, the action scenes, the core of a movie like this, are extremely ineffective and the never-ending advertising is horribly annoying. I hated this movie. Don't watch this, is not worthy of the time. Thinks like this makes you wonder how does the people in Hollywood think about us, do they think we're stupid? Do they think we're ignorant? Do we give them any reason to think different? Based on the money made by this it looks like it. Shame, shame of us... pity of us. 7/100."
"Netscape_Navigator","1","4","9","28 July 2007"," WTF? How can ANYONE like this piece of #%&
","You'd have to be either a child, or an adult with the IQ level of a shower curtain to enjoy this movie. Here's what's wrong with it: <br/><br/>**It's tries waaay too hard to be ""cool,"" hip, and current to our culture. It ends up mocking itself and fails miserably. There's never ANY sense of danger or drama at all, it's all just a happy, cheerful display of moving machines.<br/><br/>**It made me sick to my stomach how literally 30 seconds could NOT go by without some character in the movie making some lame ass childish joke. I'm not exaggerating, 60 consecutive seconds could not go by without something moronic happening. It really bothers me that some dude made the conscious decision to have this movie be riddled with stupid, idiotic, 'teen' humor.<br/><br/>**Did it bother anyone else at how relatively easy it was for the humans to capture and restrain the Transformers? <br/><br/>**I hated the sense that the first half of the movie was the ""story,"" and the second half was just like, ""ok, now time for the action."" <br/><br/>**Has the typical useless girl character who ends up being completely insignificant in the final parts of the movie, yet they spent so much time on her in the first half. She plays ZERO role at the end. Then again I guess it's better to have her do nothing, than give her a clichéd role of coming up behind some bad guy and saving the hero or something similar. And speaking of her, as usual, the movie makers obviously only care about appearance, since that girl couldn't act at all. Look at the moment(s) where she encounters the Transformers. Instead of looking shocked and in complete disbelief at seeing a several story tall live robot, she has the same expression you would have if you saw someone at work, who you previously could've sworn had the day off, but you see them at work anyway. She had that SAME subtle look.<br/><br/>**I'll say one positive thing for once, the main character, who I also liked in Disturbia, has good energy to him and seems to have a knack for comedic timing. He's the only person who I DIDN'T want to shoot after seeing this piece of crap.<br/><br/>**I haven't wondered this hard about ""what they were thinking"" since I first heard Wakka's voice acting from Final Fantasy 10."

I really hated the way Megatron looked and acted in this movie. <br/><br/>The good things about the movie: 1) The special effects; 2) I liked some of the comedy of the human characters; 3) ??????

It was unbelievably terrible! 4) Megatron and that little decepticon that transformed into a radio, later a cell phone. That little robot was one of the most annoying things I've ever seen on screen. Jar Jar Binks was even more likable and that's saying a lot! 5) I quit...my childhood sentiment is pretty much destroyed by this movie!<br/><br/>I had high hopes and doubts about this movie.

"ir0n_jaw","2","4","9","23 July 2007"," Ground-breaking effects let down by paper thin plot, terrible script and bad direction
","Let me start at the beginning. The opening dialogue will bring back many memories for us 20/30 somethings who remember when cartoons were full of action and the world was a very different place. This Michael Bay adaptation of Transformers starts off with extreme promise. From the booming opening lines setting the scene, and our first glimpse of bumblebee - the viewer is left with hope. I don't want to give away any real spoilers, so I'll give an overall view from here.<br/><br/>After the opening 10 minutes, the film rapidly declines into a cop-out cheese fest of the highest order - which if you read further, I will do my best to justify.<br/><br/>For the main characters, I'll give Bay his due, he couldn't have got it any worse. In Shia LeBeouf's case, it's not so much that he can't act, it's more the outright stupidity and daft sense of reality that his character is given to perform in. The guy can clearly act, but was he right for this part? I'll leave that up to you to decide. Moving onto Megan Fox. Well here we have a classic case of looks over talent, which the film makers crudely try to cover up by giving her a pathetic attempt at a interesting twist - she can mend cars. Yeah right. Those hands of hers have held no more spanners than I have held kryptonite - really it's laughable. And as for the jail back story - puuuhlease. Her character has about as much depth as the shallow end of a kids paddling pool.<br/><br/>Moving away from the characters (I'm purposefully avoiding the parents), there is the directing. I read somewhere about the amount of processing power it took to produce each frame of film where the transformers are on screen, being enormous. Taking that into consideration, it seems criminal to me that their appearance on screen (especially during the fight scenes) is so erratic and hard to follow. Honestly, THEY LOOK FANTASTIC(the only saving grace in this crud-pot of a film), which begs the question as to why they weren't given the respect on screen that they really deserved. Yes, Bay may have been trying to borrow the confused sense of battle from something like Gladiator, but it ruins the effect. People wanna see the Transformers in their full glory.<br/><br/>Next gripe - the sense of realism. Now before you shoot me down - yes, I realise that this is a film about alien robots landing on earth searching for an all powerful cube that can grant life yada yada yada. I'm not talking about that. Every kid in the modern world is brought up from an early age with computers. Taking this into consideration, why the hell hasn't Hollywood grasped that when an 'alien' is apparently 'uploading a virus' to the 'Defence Mainframe', that the computer screen wouldn't actually say 'Virus being uploaded' blah blah blah. Kids aren't stupid, they know the terminology better than Hollywood gives em credit for, so please next time someone opts for an 'Independance Day' moment - think carefully ;-). Unfortunately, they really didn't do their homework with this one which is reflected on-screen.<br/><br/>I know this movie is primarily aimed at kids, but I honestly feel it could have been so much more. Instead it's been watered down, purified, pasteurised, bottled and labelled into a modern franchise-wielding forget-a-thon. It makes me sad to think that what looked to be the most promising movie of the summer has instead been treated with about as much care as Ronald McDonald does with his burgers.<br/><br/>Yeah some of the kids love it, but how on earth it got 8 out of 10 on IMDb I will never know. Maybe when the kids grow up, they'll realise just how corny this film is.<br/><br/>Shame on you Michael Bay and Dreamworks, shame on you.<br/><br/>2/10 (2 being the effects alone)."

","If your like action movies, you are in for a treat. To any fan who grew up following the exploits of the changeable machines called ""The Transformers"" this offering will become the Holy Grail of your interest. The movie has so many qualities which breath life into the original comic book heroes, it is difficult to point out which parts are the best. From first to last, the track is packed with breath taking action scenes and fabulous and heroic characters. Suffice to say both the visual confrontations, which fills the screen with an on going intergalactic conflict and the exemplary story which brings the several groups together to fight the invading metallic giants. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is the small town hero who along with his girlfriend Mikaela Banes, befriend the Leader. The success for the believability of this incredible movie, owes much to Jon Voight, who plays as Defense Secretary John Keller. In addition, John Turturro as Agent Simmons, Josh Duhamel who plays Captain Lennox and Tyrese Gibson who is Sergeant Epps insure top notch acting. I would suggest everyone bring a large box of Pop-corn, to see this explosive story as it will simply blow you away. Great Film! ****"
"lewis_cruickshank","7","4","9","21 July 2007"," How did they get it so wrong?
","I remember anxiously waiting for this film to be released here in the wind swept UK, only to be disappointed. Am going to contradict myself but am sure those people who remember transformers in the 80's will understand what i mean. The film in general was brilliant no one can say any different, the special effects just shows how far cgi has come along over the past few years. Heres the but and its a big but did the people who wrote the script watch a episode of transformers seriously? The only similarities in the film to the cartoon is the names, sitting there i watched the film asking myself, were is soundwave? Why didn't they try and get voices that kinda sounded like the original cartoon? Is the All spark meant to be energon? How can you kill Jazz? and million more questions it felt like a episode of Lost.<br/><br/>Simply if you have gone to see the film expecting nothing, then you will probably think this is one of the best films of the year. If you go expecting a film about the Transformers of the 1980's, you will be upset without a doubt. Just pray if they do make a sequel and am sure they will, they watch a few episodes of Transformers before they write the script."
"jonny28","2","4","9","16 July 2007"," Coming from a fan...terrible movie
","I went into this movie with huge expectations and that could be why it was such a gigantic let down.<br/><br/>The first third of the movie was alright, as long as the transformers didn't speak. The interaction between Shia LeBeouf and Megan Fox was cute and entertaining. I enjoyed the relationship between the boy and his car, and its rebellious nature was a perfect fit. However, once the Autobots uttered a single word, the movie fell into a downward spiral and that is when I started to cringe in my chair. <br/><br/>I know that the Transformers are all Aliens and not technically robots, but it's impossible to treat them that way. They give off that feeling because they did supposedly ""learn"" about earth's culture. They conveyed way too much feeling through their dialog and that made the movie super cheesy. I enjoy cheese, but this was not what the movie set out to be in the first place.<br/><br/>Other than the robots, there were also a few other lines by human characters that made me gag...so I'm not just picking on the poor transformers.<br/><br/>Other than that, the plot was very loose and skipped from one event to another (apparently with very little stringing either together). Once again, it was a movie where SE was supposed to be its saving grace.<br/><br/>Lastly, (something that also tied into the terrible dialog) there was too much to remind us of the importance of the transformers' cause. It's obvious that the Decepticons needed the Allspark to start some serious trouble, but we don't need to hear things that sound like ""the fate of the world rests on us"". Over-dramatics in robotic characters comes off as terrible!<br/><br/>I also found that the movie was a gigantic sellout, where GM had product placement through each of the Autobots. Every time an Autobot transformed, we were obviously reminded that their disguise consisted of some sort of GM vehicle. I am aware of the fact that the movie got huge revenue from this, but it totally ruined the feeling.<br/><br/>I have loved the original Transformers since I was a kid, I even had all the toys and action figures (including a mint Optimus Prime still in box). I always considered myself a fan, but since watching this movie, I have been left disillusioned; It left a terrible taste in my mouth and I am deeply saddened that such a great idea could turn into such a terrible movie.<br/><br/>If we could be reminded of 3 things by this movie, they are:<br/><br/>1) Michael Bay still makes bad films 2) Amazing special effects cannot rescue an sketchy plot 3) Too much obvious product placement is tacky<br/><br/>As well, 5 ways to summarize this movie: Cheesy/corny, over-dramatic, overly-epic, sell-out, long."

Or maybe they knew it was an assured hit so they just put a load of monkeys in a room with a type writer... The people behind this film had no regard for the depth of the original Transformers story and were seemingly ignorant of it. This film is only worthy of being called Transformers in the most shallow sense.<br/><br/>You really know a movie is bad when a TV advert for a fairly bland looking family hatchback car makes a more convincing looking transformer than the movie did...One that you could actually tell it was a car, after it transformed. AND, even though the 'transformer' in the advert was just a plain old family car it still managed to come off as way cooler and much more authentic... Maybe the team behind that advert should have been given the job of doing the CGI on this film?<br/><br/>It seems that you can slap a big name on a movie like 'Transformers' or 'Aliens vs Predator' or 'Star wars' but then make it so bad that it does a good job of ruining the credibility of the franchise which was originally great...But it is OK, the people behind it have made so much money from basically screwing the movie going public that they don't care what you think...Sigh<br/><br/>The movie industry wonders why sales are down and people don't go to the cinema any more...Are they really that blind?

","I'm not going to completely degrade this movie with giving out a 1, but it sure doesn't deserve anything more than a 4. I'm not particularly a fan of Michael Bay, as I've seen probably most of his movies, simply because they are unavoidable. Michael Bay once again leads a giant circus to the worldwide cinema's.<br/><br/>I have seen Transformers a lot when I was young and I was hoping for once that Michael would not make complete circus out of a concept. I was hopeful when going to the cinema but after half an hour I was getting annoyed with the dialogue, the overly cheesy jokes and the total lack of depth of the concept.<br/><br/>It instantly made me feel I was in a circus watching clowns dressed up like Transformer character creating slapstick humor. The thing with humor is, it messes up an ambiance completely. On the other hand, there was no ambiance of ""feel"" of the Transformer movies at all, so the jokes didn't hurt it. I do feel the old concept has been ""whored"" by Mr. Bay.<br/><br/>The CGI was breathtaking, I have to say that. The action was very, very awesome to see. I felt so sorry for the people that created the action scenes, because the awesomeness it created was completely destroyed afterwards by one of the cheesy jokes. I am really tired of ""the usual movie clown screaming and acting as if he's on speed"".<br/><br/>A concept ruined. Do not watch this movie if you're a transformer fan.

It is with some sadness I report that Michael Bay has tarnished my fond memories.<br/><br/>The movie had such great potential; the action, art direction, the characters, the powerful themes of humanity and triumph over evil. Bay mangled them all. This movie suffers from many critical flaws which result in it being simply a bad movie. No character development is created for the title characters: The Transformers. We never care about their battle, we simply watch it. This leads to the next problem, with the exception of the Scorponok scene, there is no suspense or interest. Big machines just trade gunfire. If I wanted that I could play the video game - and at least be involved. The action is either too fast to see or in Bay's trademark groan-inducing slow motion. The Transformers take too long to transform, there's way too many moving parts to make it even believable, and the film makers lose track of what they should be doing (telling a story) and instead focus on fancy lighting and excessively complex noise.<br/><br/>Please let someone like James Cameron, who can direct technological-oriented films and not lose their heart, direct the sequel.<br/><br/>6/10"
"kevin-1147","6","4","9","9 July 2007"," Disappointing
","I guess I'm either too intelligent or rather not quite dumb enough to enjoy this movie. I had heard all the reviews going in saying how excellent it was IF you could suspend some belief and not focus on the plot etc etc. Well...I can't I guess. This movie had so many ridiculous plot holes, worthless characters, under developed characters, etc etc that I found it impossible to truly enjoy it. YES, the action seems LOOKED really cool. But that was it. Plenty movies have action that looks cool but if you don't care about the characters AT ALL (i.e. Jazz...boo hoo he's dead, the only thing I knew about him was he break danced and talked like a rapper wannabe). The odd thing was you got the feeling that if the writers, director, editor etc had taken a little more time they'd have gotten it right. It is OK to have a simple plot but at least make the characters buy into it and live it. This movie went from War of the Worlds, to Herbie the LoveBug, to War Games, to MIB, to Bad Boys but never became a complete movie of its own. How can the team that did a silly comic book toy line like XMen get that SOOO right the first time but the team behind this puts out XMen3 on the first shot? For you who have seen it here are a few of my complaints / ideas.<br/><br/>SPOILERS 1) No tension building in opening scenes. Blackout/Scorponok scenes could have had real impact if they had been built up a bit more. If they had removed all the Capt Lennox family bs (since it never had a payoff, his family life never comes into play by effecting a choice he makes or is felt in some other manor by say having the town his family lives in being wiped out if he doesn't do something.) they could have spent a few more minutes investing in building tension prior to Blackouts transformation and attack and/or developed the soldiers trek through the desert and Scorponok tracking them more.<br/><br/>2) No tension built up in the Barricade/BumbleBee meet/fight. Again, skip the classroom scenes and some of the scenes with Sam's friend (again a character never utilized in this movie at all) and instead spend some time showing BumbleBee and Barricade searching for Sam, who'll get to him first type of thing.<br/><br/>3) Frenzy - could have been a cool character if he was a little more serious and a little more mysterious. I know the writers must have thought he was good for kids but he isn't. My 5 year old kept asking me what he was saying and never really laughed at anything he did. (By the way, if you're trying to make a kiddie character don't have him use subtitles to speak, Frenzy was a Jar Jar Binks you REALLY couldn't understand) 4) BumbleBee - Barricade fight. How about showing it!!! Instead we cut away to the Gremlinsesque scenes with Frenzy and Sam and Mikaela.<br/><br/>5) Autobot intro scene is too over the top. Adults think it's stupid/kids (once again) don't get what is going on or said. Character development for these guys should have been done here (and some in Sam's backyard) but instead all we get is slapstick comedy routines that quite honestly are not all that funny. (By the way, from now on can screenwriters have teams for doing movies like this where you have an action writer, romance writer and comedy writer, having two nerds try and write comedy and romance really sucks) 6) Hackers - Completely unnecessary. Especially Anthony Anderson. Not funny for adults or kids. Make no sense to adults. Kids. LOL. Are you serious, get back to the transformers. Again, I can see the point of having that one person who figures stuff out but too many were brought in here and given too much screen time. Keep is short and sweet, ie the guy that busts in the door in some armaggedonish movie and says, ""we have 4 days"".<br/><br/>7) Sector 7 - should have been played serious, making them comical takes away all tension and anxiety in late scenes such as when the army guys and sector 7 guys square off on what to do (and your only job is dealing with the transformer threat and you end up being the MOST incompetent group fighting them??) 8)Final battle. Obviously this is where everyone on the production team put all their focus and it is a cool 30 minutes (minus the scenes with the hackers/defense secretary etc) or so but all the failures up to this point really take away how effective it could have been. You don't feel for Jazz dying cause he is under developed, you don't care for any of the Transformers on either side. Love or hate so you don't cheer when a Decepticon gets punked or cry when an Autobot is killed or wounded. The lack of emotions just makes this an eye candy scene that feels like it could have taken place anywhere in the film. There is no tension build up and you don't care who wins or loses.<br/><br/>Overall. I walked out thinking, eh, it was OK. Not as good as I had hoped but bearable. But after a few days it started to bug me more and more especially when my son who loves the toys (he has at least 50 of them and it is all he wants to look at at Target and all he wants for Xmas every year etc) didn't care to want to go see it again. He actually asked to stay home and watch the Transformer Cybertron episodes we have on DVR. This could have been to him what Star Wars was to me but it didn't even come close. Sad."

","When I was merely a boy, my folks took me out to see the animated Transformers movie. My mother will still tell you that it was ""awkward"" to kill off the hero in a movie that was obviously targeted for children.<br/><br/>The modern day live action remake seemed just as awkward to me. The theater ran ""R"" rated previews for this film, even though it was a PG-13 movie. One I would later learn was linked to this film for it's audience. The humor in the movie went from cornball cartoon references ""there's definitely more to you - than meets the eye"" - to masturbation humor - without skipping a beat. It seems that they just couldn't decide who to market this to, so they left it open to several audiences. Rather than having wide appeal, it proved awkward for kids and adults alike.<br/><br/>The drama and bad comedy was poorly edited to space out what everyone wanted to see - robot fighting. When the robots finally went on screen and started ripping each other up, the action was so fast that the crummy film running through the projector in the theater just wasn't fast enough to keep up. It seems I will have to rent the DVD in a couple of months to see what was really going on the whole time. All I remember is the occasional explosion, snarling, and emotive robot faces.<br/><br/>There was plenty of good talent here - and I can't say that it was wasted. Yet the character development was just lacking. You were expected to root for the soldier who wanted to get home to his young wife and daughter. But you weren't supposed to care when the loaner was ripped apart. He was obviously invented solely to play a victim. Did anyone care that the ""hot love interest"" of the lead character had a troubled past and a daddy that taught her how to hot-wire cars? The only black robot was ripped in half and nobody blinked. I thought Tyrese would be next - but splitting a human in half would have upset any kids that came to see this. Robot's are okay to kill off, because they don't have souls.<br/><br/>I could go on - but fan-boys will sink this like they do every honest review that gets written here. So let me roll off a few more things that bothered me.<br/><br/>* Stop putting Bernie Mack in everything. * Bumblebee was a Volkswagen Beetle. Not a lame ass Camero. * Do bad-ass robots really like teenagers to dry-hump on their hoods? * Why was Megatron only in the film for a couple minutes? Does he turn into a gun ... or anything? Or is he always a big stupid robot?<br/><br/>I would like to think that in a couple of years, we will see a Transformers 2 made with a new director. Sorry Michael Bay."
"hereyesrolledback","5","4","9","6 July 2007"," this movie was fine...
","This movie was fine... It deviated far too much from the original transformers concepts for me to really enjoy it. It could have easily been just a war movie, with the occasional giant robot. The special effects and acting were on par with most movies of a similar budget. If you're just looking for an action movie, you'll probably enjoy this. If you're a die hard fan, you'll want to see it so that you can complain about what they've done. This film is basically plagued by the same pitfalls as many video game and TV show to film translations; The filmmakers have banked on name recognition to bring credibility to a movie that bears little resemblance to it's original inspiration."
"galva3","3","4","9","4 July 2007"," 100% Pure Trash, Save Your Money, PLEASE NO MORE!!!
","First off any one who says this was a good movie is a paid employee, a moron, under twelve, or just likes to see anything thats shiny and moves really fast and cool. I'm a movie and transformers fan and I've seen enough films to know when something is pure garbage. This movie is not a bad transformers movie, its just a bad movie. If your a transformers fan save your money or go buy the 1986 transformer film. It's sad when an over twenty year old cartoon movie has a better story ,characters, and designs than a 150 million dollar block buster. Michael Bay is as out of touch as Spielberg(I still love the Berg) and neither probably has ever watched a good anime or a 80's cartoon and has no idea what cool or quality is at this point in time. I liked Bad Boys and Armageddon so I know Bay can make entertaining films but this just wasn't the one for him. I'm not surprised by the results especially from a guy who thought Raiders of the Lost Ark would be a failure. The problem with many directors who are attached to many comic and cartoon movie projects is that they have no respect for the source material and in their ignorance they fail to see that the reason that these franchises still have strong fan bases is because the original creators did something right. All film makers and producers should remember this ""everything is not a hit"". So, don't be so quick to dismiss the fundamental elements of any franchise especially if it doesn't particularly resonate with you.<br/><br/>Note To Spielberg: STOP SLAPPIN YO NAME ON EVERYTHING, YOUR ONE OF THE GODS MAN!!!!!!"

","I've been looking forward to this movie for quite some time now. And since I've kept an interesting eye on the project haven't had too high hopes about it - I've kept it realistic.<br/><br/>Sooo, the start was real good and I got quite excited since it all looked fine (the story, the characters etc). So far so good. But about halfway through the movie those sector 7 dudes showed up and the movie just fell apart! The humour got worse, the story suffered and the characters became awful...<br/><br/>You got some feeling about the Autobots - especially Prime and Bumblebee (and to some extent Jazz and Ironhide), while Ratched was rather anonymous throughout the whole movie. You got some sense of how they were as characters (with the exception of Ratched). Actually, the HUMANS get most of the screeningtime! So we get to know Sam and whats-her-name pretty well (though it's only Sam that get any depth). She's just there as a pretty face (and WHAT a pretty face!). You could easily have dropt the hackers sidestory (it did NOT add anything what so ever importence to the plot) and cut back the military dudes time. <br/><br/>The evil guys were just that - evil. The decepticons remained VERY anonymous the whole movie! Megatron got a little bit of character, but just as the usual badguy that wanted to destroy everything - not very deep at all. Most of the decepticons were there for just one thing (I think you can guess for what) and had NO character development whatsoever... meh! So, summery: good beginning with some awesome action scenes, and the middle and ending... not so good... Not even the action scenes were that good! just lots of explosions... Although both megatron and starscream had some pretty cool scenes! And Prime remained a puss... a wuss and got beat up by megatron in every fight... meh..."

","This was the best movie I have seen this summer, hands down. I grew up with transformers as a kid and to this day I am a huge fanatic. Though I will admit I was very skeptical about this movie and I thought it would kill my love for the cartoon. I was so very wrong! It exceeded all of my expectations, no; actually it took my expectations, crumpled them up, poured gasoline on them and incinerated them. Although the plot wasn't the same as the original series, it made for a very good story. The acting was top-notch (not to mention that Megan Fox and Rachael Taylor are HOT!) and the special effects and CG animation were the best that I have seen ever. I left the theater and on my way home I kept waiting for the cars around me to transform into 50-foot robots. It would have been nice to see more character development from the autobots and decepticons, but what are sequels for?!?!<br/><br/>It is a must-see for anyone who calls themselves a transformers fan, and it is a must-see for everyone else as well.<br/><br/>Roll-out and see this movie the first chance you get; you will not leave the theater disappointed!"

But this is one great movie. People will probably knock and be contrarian and say it's bad just to be different. They will be lying or have no clue about good movies.<br/><br/>I was a big fan of the show when I was a kid. I know of someone who cried when Optimus died in the 1984 cartoon. Even though certain things have been changed (Bumblebee is a Camaro), they have been updated well and in sync with the original show.<br/><br/>I've seen some reviews that say there is no story. I do not know what movie they thought they saw, but they are wrong. It has great action, a poignant (yes, poignant) story, smart acting, excellent effects, and (at times) laugh-out-loud humor.<br/><br/>If you liked the original show, you will love it.

From one moment to the other the main characters suddenly are portrayed as heroic world savers. This includes slow motion effects and violin music.<br/><br/>Talking about music, what's up with trumpets and cello's? I mean, when some tank transforms into a rampaging 30 ft monster robot with guns the size of my car, wouldn't heavy-metal or techno be more appropriate? Final conclusion is that this movie is worth seeing simply because the designers and art directors did their job sublimely. Michal Bay ruined the rest."

The film stars Shia Labeouf,Megan Fox,Josh Duhamel,Tyrese Gibson,John Turturro,Jon Voight and up and coming Australian actress Rachel Taylor. This movie had great action scenes and comedic scenes and I am glad there was no cheesy romantic scenes that feature prominently in other action films.

"ramificating","10","4","9","28 June 2007"," definitely more than meets the eye!
","My review Saw the film yesterday in Australia, have to say, it is definitely one of the best films this year, 8 out of 10. I found this film to be a great science fiction/comic book movie, I can safely say it is much more entertaining than any of the previous blockbusters that have come out this year such as Spider-man 3, Pirates of the Caribbean 3 and Shrek 3 but I felt it still lacked things other people are going to agree with.<br/><br/>So here's my quick rundown: <br/><br/>The good: <br/><br/>·The films story telling is amazing, you never once feel like the story is dragging on, or boring, it really keeps you entertained and satisfied.<br/><br/>·The acting is terrific by some, I absolutely enjoyed listening to some of the funniest calls made by some of the human characters, Shia definitely steals the film with his wit and humour and never leaves you unsatisfied. I found Megan Fox as hot as ever and was quite a good actress, though her acting began to decline towards the climax of the film and I didn't find it too convincing, she pulls a Jessica Alba in one scene.<br/><br/>·The Autobot's were fantastic to watch, they absolutely kill in this film, and they were entertaining to watch when the fights broke out with the Decepticon's. I thought they were incredible and really well designed.<br/><br/>·The Decepticon's in my opinion stole the film, they were more entertaining and had a better story to bring to the film, and I felt they were the highlight of the film.<br/><br/>·Hugo Weaving was superb as Megatron, you will not even recognize him, it took me a while to realize it was him and I felt he did the best job voicing his character over everyone else.<br/><br/>·The special effects were awesome; it was great watching the transformations and fights. The detail was really good and the destruction caused by the transformers looked so incredible, that it was hard to believe they pulled all of it off with CGI.<br/><br/>The Bad: <br/><br/>·The dialog for the transformers was in my opinion very bad, it was too immature and it felt like Tim Story from Fantastic Four 2 came along and wrote them up himself. It felt to me that the Autobot's were mildly retarded, whether this was intentional to show how their translation from Cybertronian to English isn't very good, to make it more realistic or the writers were just bad at writing dialog and weren't sure how the Autobots would talk to one another.<br/><br/>·The Decepticon's were much better in dialog, which doesn't say much, they showed more maturity in their dialog and were easily taken more seriously, sad enough as I was cheering for the autobot's the whole time and expected them to be the more serious of the two races.<br/><br/>·Only three of the Decepticon's ever really speak; Megatron, Starscream and Barricade have actual dialog, the rest speak in Cybertronian in one scene of the film, and Frenzy swears quite a bit which I actually found amusing.<br/><br/>·The most under used Autobot had to be Jazz, he makes little appearances and I wasn't pleased with him one bit being a fan of the character in the cartoon series. He only speaks 3 or 4 times in the film, but had the most mature dialog out of the Autobots showing the most compassion to his follow Autobots.<br/><br/>·Brawl is the most underused Decepticon, he only says one thing, and appears twice in the film and that's about it for him, you will barely notice he was even there the whole time.<br/><br/>·Frenzy had to be the weirdest transformer, some of the scenes he's in left me saying to myself wtf, as he does some awkward things when hacking through computers.<br/><br/>·Certain scenes with the transformers were hard to intemperate; so much detail made it hard for me to understand what was happening and what the Autobot's were doing in the fight scenes.<br/><br/>·A lot of the action is rushed and frustrating to follow and was quickly done so it was kind of like Ghost Rider for some scenes, which left them pointless.<br/><br/>·Hardly any references to G1, I only counted about 3, so many of you who expected it to have good references, I'm afraid it doesn't.<br/><br/>Over all, don't take my criticism to heart, it is nothing compared to the good in the film. I recommend seeing this film; it is worth seeing and really enjoying! It has become one of my favourite films of all times and I can't wait to see it again!"
"Exeter79","1","3","6","31 July 2019"," Less than meets the eye
","Warning: this is a review written by a grudgy, nearly 40-year old who grew up with Transformers in the 1980's.<br/><br/>The 2007 original is the first and last movie I watched from the infamous ""Bayformers"" series. I went to the theatre with enthusiasm, finally a live-action Transformers movie! Thought that, with modern CGI, it would have been plain simple to render our beloved Cybertronian heroes and villains on screen. Huge dispappointment when I saw that all robots had been turned into incomprehensible walking masses of metal junk. The Decepticons especially had nothing at all of the characters from the cartoon and comics. At least, the Autobots had the names of the historical characters, while the 'cons were completely invented out of the blue, save for Megatron and Starscream.<br/><br/>The worst part about this movie, and all its disgraceful sequels, is that the main characters are not the Transformers themselves, but their human allies! US soldiers blowing up Decepticons with human military weapons!? Excuse me!? The leading topic of the whole Transformers franchise always was that Cybertronians are so advanced and powerful that humans are helpless again them. Only the Autobots can stop the Decepticons, we all know that. One of the most memorable episodes of the 1980's cartoons shows the whole Decepticon air squad obliterating US aviation. ""Even Earth's best pilots can't anything against us"", said Megatron after the memorable sequence. Who needs the Autobot if a single marine soldier can destroy a Decepticon by shootig a rocket launcher in his ""balls""?<br/><br/>Enough said. It's now 2019, and fortunately the Bayformers franchise came to an end. Hopefully, if a reboot will be done in the next decade, it will be with good ol' 1980's characters for us old men."

"lee-p-sherman","2","3","6","25 March 2010"," Less than meets the eye
","When I saw this, I thought it was one of awful movies where word soon spreads about how awful it is, like ""Catwoman"" and ""Last Action Hero."" But here we are a quarter of a decade later and there are still people singing the praises of this turkey. So I feel an obligation to give fair warning about just how bad it is, in the hopes that I can save some people from learning that the hard way. Simply put, this is a science fiction action comedy where the science doesn't work, the action isn't entertaining, and the comedy isn't funny. It has no value, and should be avoided (except in a ""Mystery Science Theater""-type mindset).<br/><br/>I'm someone who can enjoy mindless action films. ""Alien vs. Predator."" ""Batman and Robin."" I'll watch that stuff over and over and like it. But this! This is the exception that proves the rule. This is the mindless action film that's so mindless it fails to be a pleasant diversion. This is a movie made by people who think that we, the movie-going public, will watch *anything*.<br/><br/>""Alien vs. Predator"" isn't your Hal Clement, Poul Anderson-style hard science fiction. But it doesn't expect you to buy blatantly bogus science. Things like a cellular phone and a laptop computer unfolding into robots that are not only the same volume, but look exactly the same as well. Or that sound waves are something you can represent three-dimensionally, so a computer hacker can rotate the sound wave ninety degrees and read hieroglyphics off it. Or that an alien artifact can restructure machines, even ones with almost no electronic or mechanical parts, into fully functional robots with minds of their own, in the space of one second. All these things happen in ""Transformers."" These aren't just beyond believability. These are insults to the viewer's intelligence.<br/><br/>""Batman and Robin"" isn't Shakespeare. But it is a sequence of scenes that progress logically from one to the other to form a coherent plot, a plot you can think about, at least briefly, without it all collapsing in on itself. It has characters who speak more or less like human beings with brains functioning at an adult level. Their lines form conversations that progress rationally from one point to the next. All this is more than can be said of the plotting and dialog in ""Transformers."" And the one saving grace of a mindless action film, the action, is also completely botched in ""Transformers."" The robot fights are by-the-numbers affairs that fail to excite (by the way, one fight destroys half a major city, and we're expected to believe the government covered it all up at the end). The problem isn't that the C.G.I. is unbelievable. That part is actually competent. The scenes are just really lame. It doesn't help that the Transformers are so over-designed and under-characterized that it's hard to keep track of who's who. When one of the Autobots dies, you don't care (and the other characters barely seem to care either). The military vs. Decepticon sequences don't fare much better, and bringing back the soldier characters from the beginning, who were pretty clearly dead, makes the desert ambush scene seem even more limp.<br/><br/>Even when they're not fighting, the Transformers aren't very interesting. The designer and director fail to make giant robots seem cool. I don't really understand how that's even possible. The only points this movie scores in that area are from the scene with Megatron in the ice cave. That was actually pretty cool.<br/><br/>The emphasis on humor succeeds only in making the viewing experience more painful. Never, ever, at any point in this movie, is *anything* funny. Not intentionally, at least. Every joke and sight gag falls flat. In a movie that seems to have hundreds of these, this is truly mind-boggling.<br/><br/>There you have it. The anatomy of a bad film. You can't even use the excuse that it's for kids, because it isn't. The constant references to sex and masturbation make that pretty clear. It was, however, made to sell toys, and that may be why nobody tried too hard to make it enjoyable in its own right. The toys weren't even very good, by the way. I was working in a toy store in 2007 and I know what I'm talking about. Only the largest ones actually transformed, and those were like $30.00. The rest were basically just regular action figures with the usual number of moving parts, or ones that turned from vehicles into grotesque vehicle-robot hybrids with no more in common with the transformed characters than a Centaur has with a human. The toys also didn't sell very well, at least not until the wave of new commercials for the holiday season and the prerelease promotion for ""Transformers: Animated."" I can't understand why people like this movie. Or why people think Megan Fox is attractive. I may never know the answers to these mysteries."
"jzathajenious","1","3","6","20 June 2009"," Noise, destruction and nonsense. Bay strikes again.
","I honestly went into this movie expecting to be entertained. i thought that would be a reasonable expectation. i wasn't expecting to be moved, i wasn't expecting to be stimulated intellectually, i didn't expect the movie to stay with me for days after seeing it...but congratulations are in order for the Bay-Meister couldn't even keep me interested in the action scenes.<br/><br/>So lets get the positives out of the way first. the movie IS stunning to look at, every frame is polished to a chromed shine. CGI is wonderful, and the robots are pretty cool in their design. so that element of the film gets a 3 out of 10.<br/><br/>oh boy, now the negatives. lets start with the humans. Shia: i don't know if his ""jumpy geeky nervousness"" is supposed to be endearing but i just found it very annoying. Megan brings nothing more to the film than eye candy (although that is some DAMN tasty candy). john turturro, one of my favorite actors, reduced to hamming it up so awfully i expected him to blurt out 'bud-eep bud-eep, thats all folks"" at the end. john voight, ah how the mighty joe buck has fallen, just a run of the mill 'government-guy' performance. the rest of the actors, milquetoast would be a compliment to their performances. some roles are just so perfunctory and purposeless(the worlds greatest hacker happens to be a smoking hot little blonde Aussie chick. yuh-huh. and her role brings nothing to the film except to develop the very bare bones story, which is so riddled with plot holes and nonsense i could do a thesis on it). the transformers: not much personality is injected into these cgi creations, other than some woeful and weird stereotypes (jazz, although hailing from another planet is now acting like a Harlem pimp. riiiiiiight).<br/><br/>so the humans and robots acting is atrocious. and the fact that the dialogue given is just so cliché-riddled and uninspiring sure doesn't help either. i cant decide whats more tiring to sit through with this film...the horrible acting and dialogue and story or the action scenes. so lets move onto the action anyway, which is just sound and fury, a mess of flashing images of destruction and cacophonous sound that leave everyone but the 12-18 yr old male demographic numb. Bay cant do an action scene. he specializes in them, yet this doesn't mean he is competent at doing them. a well staged action scene is not shaky cameras, quick cuts, deafening noise and wanton destruction. but this is the calling card of transformers...the worst thing is that when the robots do fight, most of them look relatively similar, so when they do collide, its just a big ball of machinery rolling around. and that fight in the city at the end, the film really seems to gloss over the fact that half the god damn city is destroyed, buildings demolished, hundreds of cars thrown about like marbles...how many thousand people would have perished amidst all this carnage??? just glossed over like its completely irrelevant, as long as megatron was destroyed everything else is inconsequential....<br/><br/>OK, I've wasted enough time writing about this film, its a complete load of tripe that ill forget about in 30 minutes from now. its just so frustrating that in this day and age we are privileged to experience great character driven action movies (Iron man, The Dark Knight etc) we still get Michael Bay's crap-tacular Transformers."

There are good jokes, soldiers are shooting evil robots, the robots transform to great cars and planes etc etc etc. The visual effect are perfect. I could not believe my eyes when Megatron transformed into a plane. And the interaction between humans and robots are also perfect; I have no idea how the visual effects were done. They are better then the visual effects in Heroes.<br/><br/>Finally, after 8 years, there is a movie that can compete with ""The Matrix""."
"dunmore_ego","6","3","6","4 August 2008"," More Than Meets The Eye-Strain
","The CGI prowess in the movie TRANSFORMERS almost makes us forget that this film is for people who still play with action figures.<br/><br/>Directed by Michael Bay and his motion-sickness cameras, this overwrought production revolves around the All Spark, a mechanical-mystical cube that has knotted the steel knickers of two races of giant robots engaged in civil war over it  the heroic Autobots and the lunatic Decepticons, who want to take over human technology with the cube for their own evil ends. From a planet called Cybertron, they've tracked this cube to Earth. Good for them. Bad for us.<br/><br/>Caught in the midst of the fracas is young Sam (Shia LeBeouf) and Mikaela (Megan Fox). LeBeouf is eccentrically fibrillated in a slapstick-frenetic performance, stuttering his way through the movie like an American Hugh Grant, or a funny Ben Stiller, providing some pretty good distraction from the simple story. While Megan Fox struts about with her T&A all aquiver, just aching for it  which, when you look at her, seems like it was all she was ever put on this Earth to do. Case closed, Yeronner.<br/><br/>While Mikaela makes us want to touch her in all the right places, other subplots provide even more distraction. Josh Duhamel (you know, that guy who looks like a straight Ryan Seacrest) runs around as a military guy, Kevin Dunn and Julie White provide great comic relief as Sam's kvetching parents, Tasmanian Rachael Taylor makes our pants tight with her broad Aussie accent, Anthony Anderson aims at some kind of Overacting Hall of Fame award, and Jon Voight waxes stentorian as the Secretary of Defense  in the movie, he is the mouthpiece for presidential orders because as we all know, the REAL president Bush (depicted in the movie as a moron) is a moron, and could never actually make defense decisions that don't involve lying through his skunken shithole.<br/><br/>(When a Secret government agent appears, saying he is on direct orders from the president, we snigger so violently at the thought of George W. Bush issuing orders to perform a task which might actually be beneficial to mankind, that milk and peanuts come out our nose; when Voight later affirms the president has ordered the destruction of the defeated robots, again we climb our highest imagination pinnacles to envision that mongrel son of a whore having access to information which we know he doesn't read and which he couldn't comprehend *were* he to read it, we being well aware that he self-admittedly *never reads any of his intelligence reports, scanning them briefly if at all*.) <br/><br/>But nothing is as distracting  or as epic  as the ""reality"" of those giant robots coming to life before our very eyes, transforming from cars and helicopters and tanks. Whereas Michael Bay is probably the best person who could bring such giant imaginary things to life in a grandiose way, he misses the opportunity to make them as awe-inspiring as they should be, turning the Autobots into the Three Stooges, pratfalling all over Sam's front yard in an attempt to hide from Sam's parents.<br/><br/>Admittedly, it's a reasonably amusing scene, but it followed a scene where the mighty Optimus Prime, the Autobot leader, related the tale of why these ""autonomous robotic organisms"" found their way to Earth. (I hate tales that start, ""Ours was a peaceful society and then war came."" As if ""war"" is some outside element intruding into a bubble of harmony. If a society descended into war, then by definition it *wasn't* peaceful!) As the Autobots stood tall before Sam and Mikaela, there was almost an inspirational moment, as I imagined how the creator of these toys for Hasbro might have felt, seeing his tiny action figures rendered as gods on screen.<br/><br/>John Turturro suddenly appears as a secret government agent and actually makes it even funnier.<br/><br/>For every excellent freeway chase scene or epic interaction scene, there are the unnecessary scorpion robot scenes or that tiny annoying Decepticon causing havok. The music is quite moving - even when the obligatory Running and Screaming starts and all storyline is squeezed into the simplest of singularities: Protect The Cube. As big things that are not really there battle with other big things that are not really there, interacting with cityscape as if they ARE really there.<br/><br/>Though the detail is astounding on these robots, it's ocular candy to the myocardial infarction degree. Yeh, my eyes hurt. ""More Than Meets The Eye"" - you can say that again, Dr. Amblyopia. And it doesn't help if you slow down the frames on DVD. Because the transformations from beast-to-machine are not logical: the parts don't match or slot into actual physical spaces, the robots and vehicles simply *morph* back and forth. <br/><br/>I still remember, over 20 years ago, my baby cousin playing with ""Oktimus Prime"" and how ingeniously the robot slotted into his truck alter-ego  not so in the movie  it's clank and springs and panels and matter being created from nothing.<br/><br/>And when the robots battle each other, I found myself YEARNING for the discomfort of 3D glasses.<br/><br/>The Transformers are apparently the only movie where the action figures came first. I'm sure my cousin, now near 30, saw this movie in Australia. Yes, the movie IS for the action-figure set that would be ALL of us over the last three decades"

","I heard it was better than expected so I gave it a shot. For anyone under the age of 21, this may be better suited; however, for anyone that has seen way too many of the tired movie clichés that this movie dragged me through, it's pretty hard to take.<br/><br/>In fairness, I did appreciate that the film held my interest and tried at times to not take itself too seriously. Only problem is that when humans are painted with such broad strokes as to use them as stereotypes for aggrandizing the aliens, it appeals to the lowest level of intelligence. Of course, the film (as of this writing) averages 7.5 stars so maybe that level of intelligence isn't too off the mark.

","This movie mostly disappointed because of its story. The movie is muddling on too much and for too long. The story would often simply feel as a lame excuse to let Autobots and Decepticons battle and make lots of stuff blow up and cause mayhem everywhere they go. Often events occur without an obvious connection to the other. It was like the story came secondary and the movie was all about it's images. In that regard this movie does not disappoint. I mean, the movie is technically well made and good looking. <br/><br/>Typically for a Bay movie, there are lots of characters put into the movie. Some characters really don't seem to serve a purpose at all in the long run, despite their heavy introduction and actors portraying them. I don't think I ever complained about this before in a Michael Bay movie but he now have seemed to have reached a point by me that it becomes annoying, mainly because it's so completely unnecessary and probably also one of the reason's why the movie is about 2 and a halve hour long, though it easily could had been simply a more bearable 2 hours. <br/><br/>I'm no Michael Bay hater. Quite on the contrary! But this just isn't his best movie. His most ambitious perhaps, yes. Which perhaps made the movie all the more disappointing to me. <br/><br/>Seemed to me they couldn't really made up their minds whether they wanted to make a serious straight-forward action flick, or a more fun and comical like one. The result is an unbalanced mix of these two opposite generic elements.<br/><br/>The action is also somewhat disappointing. Yeah sure, it's always cool to see lots of things blowing up in a Bay movie but as for the fights between the Autobots and Decepticons, which is what the movie in essence is all about often; Most of the time you can't really tell what's going on, also because it's going so fast and all you basically see are just 2 big pieces of metal running, flying, firing and jumping at each other. It's also confusing because you often really can't tell who is fighting who at the time.<br/><br/>They obviously tried to put in an emotional tie between the human main characters and the Autobots, who are basically being presented as the protectors of humanity. But the whole relationship between human's and droid's doesn't work out very convincingly and effective. The movie feels like there is an human part in the movie and a robotic part. It just never really feels as one whole, as if both were happening in a total different universe. Often the Transformers also weren't given enough room in the movie. Also Megatron (and a couple of the other Autobots and the evil Decepticons) makes his appearance way too late, which does not allow him any time to really shine and impress as the real big main villain of the movie.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf was perhaps the thing that surprised the most about this movie. I already expected and predicated great things from him after seeing him for the first time in the underrated movie ""Constantine"" but I didn't yet expected him to already completely carry an high budget summer-flick such as ""Transformers"" on his own.<br/><br/>Technically there is of course little wrong with the movie. Leave it up to Bay to blow up things in am impressive big, yet convincing way. The Transformers are also all greatly designed, though they perhaps a look a bit too much alike in their robotic forms, as I all previously had mentioned. No doubt the movie shall score a couple of technical Oscar nomination's.<br/><br/>I'll most likely watch ""Transformers 2"" but I hope they put some more effort in the story and the flow of it next time. That way it can be the perfect summer-blockbuster of 2009, if it's still being released by then that is.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","And so Michael Bay soils entertainment yet again ... after such dreadful movies like Bad Boys 1 & 2, Armageddon, The Island and the utterly brain numbing Pearl Harbour ... he's back ... I'm all for CGI if it adds to improve a movie but when it 'is' the movie then something is wrong. To say I hated it is an understatement. I do believe it could've been good but such terrible acting, direction, editing and casting made any redemption impossible. The one glimmer of hope was the acting of John Turturo. For me watching this movie was as if someone else was playing a computer game and I had to watch their go for over 2 hours before it was my turn. So many people seem to love this film and I honestly have no idea why. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and everyone has their own tastes and this isn't mine.

"shakawtwf","6","3","6","18 November 2007"," Main problem I had with this movie
","The main problem I had with this movie, was that we see battle after battle of machines fighting machines and with the exception of a few instances, we don't really know which side any given machine is on. I couldn't get emotionally involved with a lot of these fight scenes (and I found the story of that cube and its importance kind of incomprehensible or maybe I just didn't care). In a movie like this, the plot is just an excuse to show cars and trucks morphing back and forth into robots. I think it TRIED to be more than what it ended up being but the movie was just too long, taking it's good sweet time getting to the point and ended up being really rather pointless."
"DonFishies","7","3","6","19 August 2007"," Amazing special effects cannot totally make up for how disappointing the film is
","Despite some of the negative publicity surrounding it, Transformers was one of the most hyped movies of the summer for me. The trailers suggested it was going to be an all out action-orientated blockbuster, and despite the shoddiness of some of the films in Michael Bay's repertoire, I got pretty excited for it. Sadly, it failed to meet all of my expectations, and left a rather sour taste in my mouth that has lasted for the weeks since watching it.<br/><br/>Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is in high school, and is desperate to get his own car. He uses eBay and even his own history class to try to hawk off some of his grandfather's prized possessions in the hopes of making the money for it, but seems to be failing on all counts. Eventually, his father Ron (Kevin Dunn) caves, and helps purchase one for him. It runs beautifully, despite some rather strange occurrences in the used car lot, and is just the kind of car Sam has dreamed for. But rather soon after, the car begins to move on its own, and no sooner does Sam realize this when he actually witnesses the car transform into a robot and fight another car turned robot.<br/><br/>This is the basic set-up for Transformers, which merges in elements of government intrigue, blatant Middle East war propaganda, epic CGI action sequences, and rather absurd humour, all revolving around the Autobots (good transformers) centuries old battle with the Decepticons (bad transformers), and both of their races' search for a highly technical piece of rock that just happens to be hiding somewhere on Earth.<br/><br/>Regardless of any fanboy pressure, Bay created the movie he wanted, and it turned out to be a totally convoluted and mixed bag. Looking away from the basics of the story, it seems like the writers and Bay himself tacked on a bit too much in the way of getting the film from point-to-point like any good highly stylized action film attempts to. Scenes with lengthy hacker technical jargon go on far beyond the point they pine for, and scenes where they attempt to go simply for laughs fall flat on their face as near frivolous wastes of time. I rarely see movies that seem to jog around the point for much longer than they should, but for a master of cuts and edits, it seems like Bay just wanted to add in every idea any writer could have ever had for this film, and just make the film a lot more bulky in its running time than it needed to be. It just begs of needing a qualified editor to tell Bay just when enough is. It ruined the near great concept he had in The Island, and it almost ruins everything here.<br/><br/>But the story is really secondary here to the CGI. And does that ever deliver on the promises of the trailers. Every transformer looks sleek and polished, to the point of looking above and beyond realistic. Their interactions with each other, and even human characters is at a level of animation that is rarely seen with mainstream films. Where the likes of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix just has their characters look almost blatantly fake in front of their CGI backgrounds or characters, the animators on Transformers have actually taken the time to make everything look authentic and look real. Half-way through the film you stop thinking these robots do not exist, and start wondering how long it is going to take before you actually see one up close and personal. And that is just looking at them walking around, the scenes with them in battle between each other are even better (even with them being highly stylized edit-wise).<br/><br/>The voice acting is all top notch, across the board (I particularly dug the ever reliable Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime yet again, and Hugo Weaving as Megatron). The real actors acting is not as great. LaBeouf does his best to support the robots, and pulls off a fairly decent performance. We have obviously seen him in much stronger roles demanding much more of his acting capabilities, but for the little amount of real acting he has to do here (which does not include the running, screaming or genuine awe at what is going on in front of him), he does pretty adequately. His mandatory love interest, Mikaela (Megan Fox), does about as much as her gorgeous one-dimensional character needs to. The rest of the supporting cast, rounded out by Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Rachael Taylor, Anthony Anderson, John Turturro (in his most uselessly over-the-top performance ever) and Jon Voight, all do sufficiently enough, but like all the supporting characters in Bay films, basically serve the function of helping the film move from beginning to middle to end (and of course, help explain the jargon being employed by the extras).<br/><br/>But while the film may have its follies, what truly destroys the foundations it successfully employs, is the deliberate product placements scattered throughout the movie. Unlike the cartoon versions of Transformers, almost every single car is a brand name one. Mentions of eBay literally fly through character's mouths, and there's even a whole two minute long conversation about how great Nokia is. I understand the need for product placement, but when the film dwindles on these symbols for more than a mere second, it just shows me how unashamed these filmmakers were in creating this film. If I wanted to see an advertisement for cars, phones, Burger King and Mountain Dew, I would sit through a television commercial or read a magazine.<br/><br/>It disgusted me to see just how far Bay and company milked the placements, and to me, stands as the one true killer of everything that Transformers has going for it. Yes, it is a fairly good action film with some amazing effects, but at the price of being one huge commercial.<br/><br/>7/10."
"sterydus","7","3","6","1 August 2007"," One of the best movie of the year
","Apparently it must be 'in' to flog Hollywood mainstream movies that come out these days, and give them pathetic 1 out of 10 reviews that clearly show that these people know little about how to critically analyse a film or are doing it to irritate the majority of readers looking for a decent, fair review. Normally i would give this movie an 8 but there are a few pretty big flaws in this movies that are blown out of proportion by the 1/10 rating 'OMG OMFG worst movie ever' idiots.<br/><br/>GOOD> Good things are the acting, Shia and Megan show chemistry and at times OK humour especially when bumblebee tries to, ahem... help things along. That was a nice little touch. The transformers themselves in terms of effects and changes are as fantastic as you can imagine. The transformer battles are epic as hell and thats where bay's editing shines, lots of wide angle slow motion shots when the shooting breaks out and plenty of hard hitting chaotic close quarter combat when they stand toe to toe. The script well written especially for the humour but there are clearly some missing scenes that were taken out of the final edit. Despite this there is plenty of good dialogue, if you can see past the cartoonish bellowing of the transformers, but hey who the hell are you to tell me how alien robots from outer-space talk?<br/><br/>BAD> Cuts are painfully visible, you can tell from the jumpy edits and 'out of nowhere' dialogue. This is a long movie as it is though so i don't blame them for the obvious cuts however they are sloppily done. Josh Duhammel and his platoon were a waste of screen time, (their acting wasn't bad, they were just not needed in the plot!) They could have completely written them out and still could have tied the plot together relatively easily and given more development to the protagonists. Their presence in the film could even raise questions about political pressure on the film to involve military hero figures to subliminally boost troop support in Iraq, its only a guess though don't hold me on that one.<br/><br/>OVERALL> Despite these few niggles i have with the film it still delivers, the dialogue from the Transformers is mad and OTT but thats a good thing, they are meant to be larger than life and have to ring true to their original source cartoon characters, if you keep changing the source material to be more 'cinematic' we may have ended up with another Doom. The action is top notch, Shia carries the film competently as the protagonist, effects are excellent, soundtrack and music do the jobs they are meant to do in context with the mood of the scenes and even though there is some dodgy editing due to cuts and some unnecessary characters the film is still vastly enjoyable to hardcore fans of the old series and newcomers alike. Anyone who rates this movie under 3/10 without giving solid reasons why, i pity you..."

","Was well looking forward to it, and once again, poorly acted, terrible script and some awful characters detracted from what in fact could've been one of the greatest Action Flicks ever... stunning effects are spoilt by the inane drivel of the main character played by Shia LaBeouf who quite frankly is now up there with Slater on my most hated list.

"JKristine35","7","3","6","25 July 2007"," Action that will make you jump up and say 'Wow!'
","First of all, a warning to anyone who likes in-depth story lines. This movie's storyline is cheesy and practically non-existent. The bad guys are bad to the point of being overdone, and some of the acting is questionable. That said, you don't really care cause the actions scenes are so hot that it makes you just wanna watch it over and over again. I actually am glad that they kept any real chic-flicky romance out of the film, and focused on the action. And the movie had many funny moments. Well worth the price of admission and then some. If you want to watch a movie that will make you want to yell 'Awesome!' and 'Cool!' at every action scene, see Transformers. It is well worth it."

"blaughlin75","7","3","6","21 July 2007"," A good setup for the inevitable sequel
","Let me start out by saying that I taped every episode of the Transformers cartoon back when I was a kid. I owned every single Transformer that my parents would buy for me. When I heard there was going to be a movie adaptation with real life actors, I was taken aback a little. How could the Transformers effectively translate to CGI images and move amongst real life objects while retaining the personalities that made me love the cartoon? The answer is...okay at best. They spent more time setting up the story line than actually developing the characters of the Transformers. Once they did get around to showing their personalities, it was clear that the movie-makers were trying to stay true to the cartoon of two decades ago. They even got the guy who did Optimus Prime's voice from the cartoon to be his voice in the movie. Excellent touch. If you come into the movie with little or no Transformer knowledge, you might feel left out a bit, especially considering they don't develop the Decepticons much. The rivalry between Megatron and Starscream is old hat for me, but it will go over the head of the casual viewer. Plus, the personalities of Bumblebee, Jazz, and Ironhide are only hinted at.<br/><br/>The problem here is that the Transformer storyline is too big to capture in a two-and-a-half hour film. Especially one that tries to start near the beginning and explain everything to uninitiated viewers. With the inevitable sequel, I expect a much more powerful plot to emerge since they won't have to spend 1.5 hours setting up the situation. Still, given the difficulty of what they were attempting here, they still come out looking pretty good. The special effects were ground-breaking and the attempts at humor were occasionally successful. You will leave the theater wanting more, since much of the emotional wallop was seemingly left for the sequel(s)."
"dfranzen70","6","3","6","8 July 2007"," I don't know whya you say good Shia, I say it blows. Kinda.
","The good news is that this formulaic, high-octane action movie from Michael Bay is pretty entertaining stuff; the bad news is that it feels like it was directed by a semi-retarded spider monkey on crack. Jarring visuals, incomprehensible fight scenes, and overblown special effects are at least somewhat mitigated by appealing performances and, of course, state-of-the-art CGI.<br/><br/>In this remake of the 1985 film that was spawned by the cheesy cartoon series, evil robots have arrived on Earth to reunite with their leader, Megatron, who came to the planet a couple of millennia ago in search of the Allspark, a box of something or other that will enable Megatron and the other Decepticons to rule the universe! Only Megatron crashed into the Arctic and froze. Well, as much as a robot can freeze; he was merely paralyzed. Meanwhile, the good-guy robots from the same planet, the Autobots, have tracked Megatron to Earth, also in search of the Allspark.<br/><br/>Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf is an awkward teen who's trying to earn money to buy his first car. Of course, since he's awkward and somewhat smart, we know he's the hero. And we know who his enemies are, too, because they're the ones who laugh at him. They'll all be sorry! They're not too sorry when Sam's first car turns out to be a beat-up yellow Camaro, although they might be a little bedeviled when they find out the car's really an Autobot.<br/><br/>It's up to Sam, his new galpal Mikaela (Megan Fox), the Secretary of Defense (Jon Voight), and the U.S. Army to somehow defeat the Decepticons, who will stop at nothing to find the Allspark, even if it means exterminating all the ant-sized humans. Luckily, Sam and company also have the Autobots on their side, and a showdown of giant robot versus giant robot is ON, brother.<br/><br/>One puzzling problem with the movie is that the Autobots don't show up until a good half hour into the film. I guess this was to establish the all-important Sam-Mikaela relationship, which naturally will eventually blossom into something bigger. Because, of course, the dorky guy always gets the hot chick, even if he has to defeat giant robots to do it. But it's true, presenting the backstory of the characters before showing us the Autobots does add a more human aspect to the film; otherwise it would be just a big, violent robot-versus-robot extended fight sequence. Wait, it was that anyway.<br/><br/>Michael Bay movies are not immune to clichés; they revel in them, exploiting them to complement the loud pyrotechnics. Or maybe the loud pyrotechnics are there to distract us from the inane characterizations and dopey plot. In any event, how many movies have we in which an intern/trainee/cadet is the only one, out of literally thousands of experts, to solve the problem? How many have we seen in which someone working for the forces of Good manages to sneak something secret out of an otherwise-secure facility? On the other hand, this was one movie in which the military is actually competent; where the guys with guns know what they're doing and aren't the shoot-first, ask-questions-later types? That was surprising, and amusing.<br/><br/>And I realize this will confirm me as a cranky old man, no matter my chronological age, but what was UP with all of the loud music? Every scene was shot as if it were a crappy heavy-metal video, circa 1986. Grating guitars turned up to eleven on the volume control drowned out some dialog and a lot of sound effects, such as robots doing robotic things. Add that to the hyperactive zooming, panning, and scanning, and this is certainly not a movie that an epileptic should ever watch.<br/><br/>Nor is it a movie that young kids should watch, in all honesty. Transformers is rated PG-13, but it's pretty violent; the only thing that's lacking is actual blood. People get blown up, smashed, crushed, and shot by robots, and it's pretty intense stuff. So be careful when bringing little Timmy to this one, unless you want to put up with a week of nightmares and nocturnal enuresis. This ain't the Transformers you grew up with."

","As the title of the film suggest: ""a Michael Bay film, Transformers""<br/><br/>Transformers (2007) is Michael Bay's version of the Transformers of which he described as a ""stupid toy movie"" before he was educated about the subject matter by Hasbro. The movie therefore reflected Bay's vision of the Transformers which in ways are different from the original.<br/><br/>Apart from that is also the fact that the movie is just a commercial film for the mass market filled with Product Placements.<br/><br/>Even with all the effort and brilliance in creating the live action movie using CGI & special effects (which is entertaining to the mass market), the movie really fell short on capturing what should be the essence of the original Transformer characters.<br/><br/>As a film it did not do strongly on story telling, creating a compelling atmosphere & developing characters. What it did however was to put on a show of explosion, crashes & cheap humor.<br/><br/>Sure the film entertained in terms of giving its audience a cinematic experience with visual & sound (mostly bass) effects but is a good film based just on that alone?<br/><br/>Whatever happened to script writing, screenplay, cinematography, directing, editing & complimenting musical score?<br/><br/>Is this the way movies should be made even if the audience should cheer & applaud them?<br/><br/>As a media of great influence, shouldn't movie makers at least consider what values & messages they are sending out by their creation?<br/><br/>When Optimus Prime & his Autobots made up their mind to save earth and the human race, just what kind of a world are they really saving?<br/><br/>A world of destruction, a world that sees commercial values above all else and a world whose people view a film like Michael Bay's Transformer something of high regard?<br/><br/>Just who are these robots in disguised as the Transformers?"

Remarkably the flick aims to visual effects Oscar award, but I think Michael Bay only work hard on this point, What happened with the rest, for instance, the plot?. I agree with some comments where criticized the roll of some actors, for example the useless performance of the soldiers after the first 10 minutes of the film, and the incoherent plot. I'm completely sure for lacking of talent in the development of history TRANSFORMERS could have been one of the best movies ever made. In spite of this, I enjoyed the movie from beginning to end, I disagree with people give it 1/10 or 2/10 just because they expected something better or it doesn't seem to the original cartoon, that's exaggerated.

"pptuser","Null","3","6","29 June 2007"," Worth the admission, but leaves a lot to improve
","Personally, I give Transformers a rating of 7.8 -- high enough for a movie that is intended to entertain. Michael Bay's shortcomings persist, but it's still well worth the admission.<br/><br/>Best plot layouts and dialogs are within the 1st hour, most of which I doubt are Spielberg' efforts, not those of Michael Bay (MB for short). Top-class sitcom jokes except the Chris Rock-like cliché performed by Antony Anderson.<br/><br/>The quality goes downhill from where good robots hide from the parents. Lengthy, repetitious, with too few punchlines.<br/><br/>In the fight in the last third of the movie, MB's usual weaknesses go abound.<br/><br/>Superfluous, childish heart-warming dialogs and background music (reminds you of Peal Harbor. Did MB read too many ""Washington cut the cherry tree"" stories?). Contrary to the 1st hour, multi-threaded plot lines begin to scatter here and there. And don't forget the meaningless slow motion takes.<br/><br/>But this part edges out in special effects. The ensemble is not too sloppy, compared with camera manipulation of his previous works.<br/><br/>As a whole, it's a must see, but leaves a lot of room too improve.<br/><br/>To me, MB is a 2nd-class director. There's must be something missing in his character,unable to judge ""what's to be left and left out in movie composition."" I wish this film would have been directed by James Cameron, Steven Spielber, Tony Scott,or even Ang Lee. MB probably will never be on the same level of the above-mentioned great directors."

","With movies such as The Rock, Bad Boys, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, and The Island, (not to mention Aquaman 2) Michael Bay has gained a reputation as a director who makes summer blockbusters loaded with explosions and huge special effects, but lacking in story and characters. If this is what you are looking for, than Transformers will probably not disappoint.<br/><br/>The movie, which stars Shia LaBeouf, Jon Voight, Josh Duhamel, and the beautiful Megan Fox, depicts Optimus Prime and the Autobots battling Megatron and the Decepticons while the fate of the human race hangs in the balance. Overall, the story was what it was, neither too complicated nor too intriguing.<br/><br/>The special effects on the transformers themselves were simply wonderful. They all looked as realistic as cars which turn into robots can possibly look, and they blended in nicely with the human actors and the settings. It was actually stunning to see them all transform.<br/><br/>However, where the movie went wrong was Bay's direction. He absolutely ruined the film for me with his pacing, shot selection, and editing. While the machines looked great, every scene where they battled was cut up so much that I could hardly tell what was going on. One reason I enjoyed Live Free or Die Hard was because the filmmakers took a step back and allowed the audience to see the action scenes play out. This made the movie far more entertaining, and easier to follow. In Bay's film, action scenes seemed disjointed, and I felt like I never truly got a good look at what was happening.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the movie had too many characters that were in separate places for much of the movie. While many action movies deal with a situation from one point of view, this movie dealt with it from four or five different points of view, making the movie feel even more disjointed. While each of these characters was well acted, I think the film would have been well served to tone it down to simply one point of view (that of Shia La Beouf and Megan Fox). This would have trimmed down the running time, and made for more of a succinct plot.<br/><br/>Overall, I came into this film not expecting much, and I left disappointed. Where its cheesiness was at times entertaining, it quickly became boring. The action sequences also made me angry with their quick cuts and numerous close-ups. I think this had the potential to be a great movie, but because of Mr. Bay, it was a huge disappointment. I give the film 4.5/10 salty stix, and I would recommend if you are looking for an entertaining action movie to see this July 4th, skip this and see Live Free or Die Hard.<br/><br/>Google Saltystix for more movie reviews"

"Rectangular_businessman","1","4","10","14 June 2010"," Only a talentless hack as Michael Bay was able to ruin such a good cartoon as ""Transformers""
","Could have used more of a story, more background, better acting, characterization etc. Even though the movie last 15 minutes, the key elements probably take up less then 5 minutes of its duration, meaning that it is empty. There is really nothing inside, I have no idea how it even manages to exist. It has explosions and Megan Fox as supposed merits and overtly bombastic, ridiculous music. I could sit there and complain about the characterization and plot development or rather the lack of it and some blatantly obvious flaws or stupidities rather but why should I? I was left with a couple of questions after seeing this. If the Transformers are like millions of years old why do they behave like 80's stereotypes from our planet? Where does the AllSpark come from, is the universe just full of all powerful machinery for no reason at all? Why does Megatron want to wipe out humans, I get a quest for power but isn't it like trying to wipe out a ants nest from his point of view? Humans shouldn't bother him, they are just pointless. This leads to another question as to why the Autobot's should bother helping humans, it like siding with ants. It seems like looking like a particular car is just a personal preference for them and not an obligation, why look like a car, disguise, fun,.? If it is a disguise, they should avoid more appearing like giant robots and a car whiteout a driver is obvious and is it really the fastest and best mode of transport in the whole of the galaxy or even on this planet, guy who turns into a F-22 makes more sense to me etc. Is this because I am unfamiliar with the cartoon? I do remember having a doll of Optimus Prime when I was very, little. It is still a lot better then the abomination that Pearl Harbor was or the intense stupidity of Armageddon because Michael Bay stopped concerning himself with humans, meaning that he makes no effort anymore to give anyone a personality, motivations, back story or anything, most humans in this movie appear to be about as human as a piece of cardboard with a cue card on it. This is a good thing because his efforts, dialogs, back stories and etc. are frankly just nauseating. 0/10"

How can you take beloved characters and change them? After watching I said ""well OK maybe in the second one they will go more in depth with the actual transformers (I am writing a review on the first one as I refuse to accept that the second one even happened!) this should be so easy to take and make a good movie . The fact that they sold out is what bugs me the most and thats why almost every character is different than in the cartoon/comics, it would be like taking spiderman and changing his costume to be furry like a spider and giving him 8 legs, sounds pretty stupid doesn't it but thats what they have done here. Also its called transformers right? instead of the human people taking up 75% of the movie heres a crazy idea, focus on the robots! They change everything from how the arrived to earth to the base to the character both human and robotic. If you are 5 years old you will probably like this as you don't know any better, but anyone who grew up watching this shouldn't even go near this piece of crap movie, not even if its free on TV ! not even if its a choice between watching sister act and this watch sister act instead, i mean sure you'll be angry and disappointed at the fact you are watching sister act but you will at least be expecting that and not hoping for something good. stay far far away from these movies if you are a real fan. very disappointed in what should have been a easy sure fire hit"

","The generation that grew up with the first Transformers movie comes back with an awful version. The watergate babies truly are the least creative generation. Maybe the high school comedy was too long. Maybe the robots were too detailed to watch. There are no heroine transformers, unlike the 1986 movie.<br/><br/>The shaky camera, home video look is hard to follow, but it's all in a day's work for a generation which grew up with hand held home videos. The human heroine is pretty independent, never depending on the men 2 save her, although she depends on the autobots.<br/><br/>The dialog in the 1986 movie was preposterous and out there, but it made it interesting. The new dialog just fits in and is boring. Except for Optimus Prime, the voices were disappointing. The original Megatron, Starscream, and Bumblebee voices are gone.

When they're not fighting each other, they transform into trucks, cars, and other terrestrial vehicles, which is interesting the first half dozen times it happens.<br/><br/>There are also some humans in the movie--a skinny white nerd, a hot brunette mechanic, a fat black nerd, a hot blond nerd, a gung-ho white soldier, a gung-ho black soldier--but they're as interchangeable as the robots. In the end, the skinny white nerd saves the planet and gets the hot brunette mechanic; it's unclear if the fat black nerd gets the hot blond nerd, but he deserves it as compensation for all the fat/racist jokes he's the butt of. The gung-ho white soldier goes home to his pretty wife and pretty baby. I lost track of the gung-ho black soldier, but he probably dies heroically saving the gung-ho white soldier's lifeit's that kind of movie.<br/><br/>This is the second movie I've seen in as many weeks where hacking the DoD's network is a plot point (the other is Live Free or Die Hard); certain screenwriters must go to the same Hollywood cocktail parties. Speaking of the DoD, the U.S. armed forces, all the way up to the Secretary of Defense (!), are depicted as superbly trained and extremely well equipped, although their clownish Commander in Chief only displays interest in Hostess Dingdongs. Not coincidentally, the movie was preceded by commercials for the Marines and Air Force.<br/><br/>There are certain films that revel in their own stupidity. This is the dumbest flick I've seen since 300. Judging by the applause at the end, there were a lot of like-minded individuals in the audience.

","I went to go see this movie primarily for the special effects, but with those minuscule expectations it didn't deliver.<br/><br/>Aside from the very cliché'd characters and weak script writing, the biggest problem I had with the film is very fast moving and jumbled scenes. You hardly had time to digest one scene before you were onto the next. The same is true for the special effects. I appreciated the few slo-mo action shots as you can grasp what is actually going on.<br/><br/>Not too many directors today know how to build suspense. The opening scene seem to have some promise, as the unknown army helicopter makes its way onto the base. They could have shown the copter slowly morph into the transformer, but they did it too fast and from there it went at a too fast pace from scene to scene.<br/><br/>Another uncomfortable moment was the masturbation comment from main character's mother. This is a kid's film isn't it?"
"Rotten_Tomato","Null","4","10","10 July 2007"," Could have been so much better...
","In my books, it's never a good thing when the special effects (or a teaser trailer not set to release for another half a year) are a movie's strongest point. Still, I found it hard not be in awe of how realistically the Transformers were realized by the CGI team. Aesthetics have to count for something, right? <br/><br/>Outside of that, 'Transformers' mainly struggles to intrigue. The basic story is a race of alien robots search for a powerful relic that landed on Earth years ago, which culminates in Optimus Prime and the Autobots fighting the evil Decepticons to save mankind with the help of a teenage boy and a small assortment of other humans.<br/><br/>What failed the most? The script was so atrocious that it's as if the screenwriters knew the only way to keep the audience's attention was with shtick rather than engaging dialog. A movie doesn't have to be funny to be fun, which an action/adventure flick should be. Yet most of the humor was inappropriate for the mood of the scene and lent little to nothing to story or character development or an all around fun time.<br/><br/>And the director, well his name is Michael Bay. Enough said there.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Bay's best talent, action, was a mixed bag. At times it was great popcorn fare, complete with explosions of epic proportions, lots of guns, and of course the impressive Transformers themselves. At other times though, the pacing was odd, destroying any tension that had built up. I also found it hard to tell exactly who was who and what was what when the Autobots and Decepticons were fighting, a sentiment I've seen echoed by other users, which is not a good thing for a movie that so clearly defines good and evil.<br/><br/>All in all, I would have liked to see a new script, a new director (come on Spielberg), and more development dedicated to Transformers not named Optimus Prime or Bumblebee (this movie is called 'Transformers' right?) and less to Sam and Mikaela's blasé relationship. Yes still, this is a huge summer blockbuster, so I suppose expectations can only be so high. It's just disappointing that Hollywood feels it must water down something that could have been so cool.<br/><br/>6.3/10"

Any time anything happens we get blasted by music as if the movie is saying ""look how cool this is"" even though its just a scene with a dog pissing on a transformer's foot.<br/><br/>Even the special effects are wasted because the camera doesn't sit still long enough for you to appreciate the detail.<br/><br/>Please for the love of God do not go and see this in the cinema because if you do they will think its successful and make a sequel.<br/><br/>Watch the animated movie instead it has 10 times the depth of this."

The first part of the movie was good enough. I actually started to like the movie because the introduction to the characters was very well done and the Transformers looked believable. But during the action back in the US of A, it lost its way. The interaction between the characters was so unbelievable. Sure the story is a fantasy, but when you have such a fantasy as this one could have been, making the characters act like idiots doesn't help the movie. Of course Bay had to exaggerate everything. I am not sure why he has to push everything over the edge, and I do mean everything! Go if you loved the Transformers as a child, you can still feel like a kid at this movie.

Parents will also talk about those embarrassing things, especially when there is a girl present, -of course they didn't know, ...indeed indeed-.<br/><br/>Ron Witwicky (Kevin Dunn) played a house dad role. He is very strict about ""keeping off the grass"", and ""no locked rooms in my house"". He is also a tight-to-reality person, ""there is no such things..."". <br/><br/>Judy Witwicky (Julie White) was so happy for her son, Sam, when she saw a girl suddenly appearing in his room. She was very happy that he was straight, as well as he chose a super babe! However, the look on her face seemed like she had been possessed by a guy and wanting to date and marry Mikaela herself. That was one of the funny moments besides the embarrassing talk.<br/><br/>What an amazing car Bumblebee was. He played all the right songs at the right time, totally flirtatious, a very very pro playboy indeed. ""The 'Autobots' also learned human language from the WWW"", that was just hilarious. On top of that, they talked in all kinds of ways that different nationalities and ethnicities would communicate with each other.<br/><br/>Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) played super sexy role, she posed in front of the open-hood car and made Agent Simmons (John Turturro) to strip down to his under garments. The way she dress definitely gave us the hardship she suffered during her childhood, the attention-grabber style dress-up is abnormal amongst every other girl in school and in the movie.<br/><br/>Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) was an amazing guy, whose last name is always mispronounced. When he first invited Mikaela (Megan Fox) into the car, he pretended to talk about the car and all, but he was definitely checking her out. The car later helped him out with the trouble in the engine. While Mikaela posed sexy and leaning both arms out onto the open hood, again Sam's jaws fell to the ground like ""The Mask's Super Exaggerated Shocked Face"".<br/><br/>Glen Whitmann (Anthony Anderson) and Maggie Madsen (Rachel Taylor) were a total match. He was so funny in the interrogation room, he ate almost all the biscuits, talked about how they try to tempt you to talk and spit the truth. In the end, he spilled the beans: ""She did it!"". Her innocence suited her expertise and she sneaked into the discussion room where Defense Secretary John Keller (Jon Voight) rejected her analysis. I thought that was very brave and the right thing to do to alert the man in charge about the possibilities of the national problem while others believed that they are capable or handling unknown and unidentified alien forms.<br/><br/>Everyone was so fantastic, the list will go on forever.<br/><br/>The Autobots were like kids, they hid away from Sam's parents very childlike and breaking things as they find their hiding places. The effects were totally unbelievable, for example, sonic waves reminded me of the game Dune 2000. I cannot say more, it is definitely definitely very very good.<br/><br/>I recommend watching this movie for ages above 13 because there is some amount of crude sexual depictions.

But as soon as they said, ""Let's go to the city,"" I just groaned, because it was just so ludicrous. If you have a bunch of giant robots on your side and a bunch more who are fighting them, you don't go in the city! You go out in the middle of nowhere to have it out where civilians won't get hurt. It was such a painfully obvious excuse to have a cool battle in the middle of tall buildings with lots of special effects and explosions, which is fun to watch but it definitely gets old after a while.

","Well, to be honest, I have finally completed my list of Worst Movies Ever - and this one is definitely number one.<br/><br/>My life has changed thanks to Transformers - now i understand that Power Rangers had GOOD special effects, Anakonda was a GREAT movie, Tom Cruise is an IMPRESSIVE actor and average Brazilian soap opera have FASCINATING plot.<br/><br/>But let's put jokes aside. What I consider to be the main problem of the movie is that it doesn't seem to meet any target audience - at least if we divide the audience by age. The plot may be convincing for kids under 13-year old, but several elements are too 'hard' for kids (language, violence, even though it's moderate). So, with PG-13 rating, who was it made for? I guess the answer came from the audience which I met in the cinema - fully armed with popcorn, tacos and active mobiles. Audience which burst into laughter because of ""black-man-with-funny-voice"" or ""agent-gets-undressed"" scenes. The audience which doesn't have any problem with traditional ""nerd-gets-a-bully's-girl-because-he-gets-involved-in-something"" plot.<br/><br/>As for the famed special effects - I'm not very up-to-date with computer games, but as far as I remember, I've seen more impressive things in game cut-scenes a few years ago. At least they didn't use machine-gun editing, random camera shaking and hundreds of little elements of steel and concrete flying around to hide the most important part of CGI. How many times did we actually have a chance to see a full robot and its animation? I'm disappointed. I hope Dreamworks has already started lawsuits against the company which made CGI. I hope the writers who decided to connect hundreds of unimportant subplots, empty dialog lines and flat characters have been punished.<br/><br/>Ah, I give the movie 2 instead of 1 for ONE SCENE: Megatron hitting a random human on the ground, saying ""Disgusting""...<br/><br/>Yes.

","A live-action movie about the Transformers. What more could a fan wish? A live-action movie about the real Transformers, for one.<br/><br/>Having owned the toys (and having loved them) and having watched the series in its entirety more than twice (and having loved that, too, in the deepest sense of the word) I was almost moved to tears when I first heard about this movie. Seeing some of the heroes of my youth really move and fight, thanks to the visual effects of today, was literally a dream come true.<br/><br/>Save for the fact that it's NOT them.<br/><br/>I seriously wonder if anyone within the production, screen writing, and SFX personnel actually remembers -or took the time to watch- the original series. The complex battle for domination (Energon cubes, anyone?) that was portrayed in the series is totally absent here. Unlike the Transformers of old, none of these ones has any tangible personality; the Decepticons are bent on destroying humankind and the Autobots are bent on stopping them. Now, this may or may not be a consequence of not having enough time/space to tell the whole story, but it's hardly a good thing to start with.<br/><br/>And apart from personality, what exactly happened to the robots' aesthetics? If technology is available to render a giant robot on screen and animate its morphing into a car or truck, then how hard can it be to have it morph in the PROPER car or truck?! Instead, Starscream is an F-22 Raptor, Bumblebee is a Chevrolet Camaro, Optimus Prime is... well, not a cab-over truck. And I won't even mention Megatron. The only thing left coherent with the original design seems to be the paint scheme.<br/><br/>As a die-hard Transformers fan, I tried and tried again, but I just could not see Bumblebee, Optimus Prime, and ultimately Megatron in the characters bearing the respective names within this movie. It will probably be a huge hit because of the exceptional and unprecedented (at least to my memory) visual effects. It will rock and shock the audience with its frenetic combat scenes, big loud explosions, and bullet time sequences. It will be the ultimate robot movie -- at least, until the already announced sequel comes out.<br/><br/>However, if we are to assume that 'transfoming robots' equals 'The Transformers', then we can also take any ordinary kid, have him lose his family in a tragic accident, dress him as a baseball player, paint the whole in shades of black, and finally pretend it's Batman."

As far as the writing goes I guess they saved a great deal of money on writers because there was little dialog to follow even when you could hear it over the constant loud explosions.<br/><br/>The pros - The graphics were colorful. They would have made nice posters for a kids room. What dialog there was could be amusing. The filming was well done and the special effects were up to pare. Of course when that is all there is to the movie they certainly should be decent. I liked the small transformer that turned into a humping dog at one point. That was the height of the humor of the movie."
"sebpopcorn","Null","3","7","3 June 2010"," Another franchise ruined
","If you want a short review of Transformers here it is: it's a loud, badly written disjointed mess of a movie with a nonsensical plot that ruins yet another potentially good franchise.<br/><br/>So what? Well that's pretty much Michael Bay's reaction. If you read his biography page he defends himself in two ways which I'd like to address in relation to this movie.<br/><br/>He's made a lot of money. That's his first point. Well, yes but you'll notice that most artistic people don't make a huge amount of money and when they do they generally don't see that as being their primary motivation. This movie has made a lot of money from 13 year old kids because that is who Hollywood markets their films to. In fact if you spend enough on marketing it's virtually impossible to lose money on a film, though obviously it does happen from time to time. If you went to the cinema ten years ago you'd see people of all ages enjoying the spectacle of the big screen. Now you only see kids and their weary looking parents because there's virtually nothing for a discerning adult to enjoy. This brings us to point two of this hacks justification for creating drivel like this.<br/><br/>I make movies for 13 year old kids - big deal! Yeah, in fact it is a big deal because takings are now down 20% and it's part of a consistent pattern over the past ten years or so. The more you alienate the adult market by making crappy PG13 guff like this the narrower the market becomes and the more you have to pander to their taste.<br/><br/>People like Micheal Bay are poisoning Hollywood for everyone and if people disagree bear in mind that you aren't 13 forever, your taste will become more complex and there will be literally nothing to see at the cinema. Hollywood would like to pretend that their abysmal takings are down to piracy of their product and to some extent I'm sure that's true, but the main reason is that the films on offer are generally awful and if you get stung by a few utterly awful movies in a row you have little motivation to keep going to the cinema.<br/><br/>In short he's an idiot and so are the people who only see cinema as a financial concern. It's an art form, we go to see art and this is about as far from art as you can get. It's not even financially viable in the long term because the people most likely to pirate movies are teenagers. <br/><br/>In short, it's moronic crap like this that is killing cinema."

","If you're NOT familiar with the Transformers cartoon series, have a look at Episode 1 on You Tube: http://www.youtube.com/ Or even better; Episode 6.<br/><br/>On Episode 6 you'll hear the taunts the robots exclaim to each other and humans. Very fun stuff!<br/><br/>But in my opinion, the movie doesn't deserve less than 4 stars because it has some good points.<br/><br/>THE GOOD 1. Optimus Prime has the same behavior like in the cartoons.<br/><br/>2. Some of the action is nice. <br/><br/>3. Seeing them transform (although kinda blurry) is cool.<br/><br/>The BAD 1. It takes TOO DARN LONG to finally show the transformers transforming for action against each other! (more than 30 minutes!!!!)<br/><br/>2. The Transformers are NOT the main characters but more like supporting characters, because they appear so late in the movie and have too few lines!<br/><br/>3. There's too much hand-held cameras usage during the action sequences.Even when filming a pilot's face from in front, the camera just can't stand still! I know that Michael Bay wants to place the viewer ""in the middle of the action"" but it shouldn't come to the expense of actually being able to view and concentrate ON the action. There are many action-packed films that show BETTER camera work, like ""The Mummy"", ""Pirates of the Caribean"" and The ""Terminator"" series. Even ""Bad Boys"" (I haven't seen Bad Boys 2 yet!) has better camera-work! So in the climactic final battle in the city it's Total Chaos! I really hate the camera hand-held work!<br/><br/>4. Too many times Michael Bay uses Emmerichs style (Godzilla) of zooming too much on the robots to show how huge they are. While it's not even necessary because they are not THAT big! So prepare to be unable to see their entire structure when they are on screen!<br/><br/>5. There are NO taunts when they battle against each other or humans! (Excepting the few taunts between Optimus and Megatron) The Decepticons could say stuff like:""Your puny human weapons tickle me!"" Then he fires at them. Or; ""That's not a gun. THIS is a gun!"" then fires his HUGE gun. And other cool taunts...like in the cartoons.<br/><br/>6. I didn't like the ""jokes"" like the one where an autobot ""lubricating"" (read ""peeing on"") John Turturro's character. Or Sam's mother trying to find another word for ""masturbation"". So NOT funny!<br/><br/>7. Even the music in the end credits is annoying! Smashing Pumpkins' ""Doomsday Clock"" made me frown, even more at the end of the movie! Good thing Disturbed's ""This Moment"" sounds much better!"

The only thing I really like were the special effects, that was awesome, but the rest was like, corny, and non-sense. It should be a lot better, if not for the script.

The little phone made me laugh and reminded me of my childhood when the sun went down and we played tag till we couldn't see our own hands. The car that was named Bumblebee made no sense, how does a robot know about bees. The movie is filled with these kinds of plot holes and Megan Fox.

The only thing that stopped me was the final fight scene towards the end of the film.<br/><br/>My reasons for saying this is that the story was lame and silly, the actors didn't sell their roll to me and it was NOT funny at all. It felt weak and just like another 'cutsie' routine actioner. I feel that this movie is made for children and didn't deserve the 'M' rating it got in Australia.<br/><br/>If you want a family movie that could possibly keep you interested, this is it. But otherwise it's not worth it."

","First, I never watched the cartoon or bought any of the merchandising when I was growing up. I was excited to see the movie anyway. The only two redeeming aspects of the movie are Megan Fox and the appearance of the new Chevy Camero. Both are hot!!! Shia LaBeouf plays a very obnoxious teenager that is full of too much talk. I got tired of him right from the beginning. I saw that same character in ""I, Robot"". The movie also has the typical drawn out action/chase sequences where everything gets destroyed (buildings, cars, etc).<br/><br/>I did like some of the attempts at humor. The Transformers themselves were pretty cool. I just thought the movie was completely formula and the acting and dialog was terrible. If the movie was from the viewpoint of the Transformers instead of Shia LaBeaouf's character, maybe the film would have been better."
"iceykewl","4","3","7","14 April 2008"," Less Than Meets The Eye.
","So, okay, I guess I'm the only one who's not a critic who didn't like this movie. I'll be honest, this movie was a big disappointment, and my least favorite of the summer so far. <br/><br/>Transformers delivered on its promise of stunning action and visual effects. The opening sequence in Qatar was literally jaw-dropping. My friend next to me had to push my mouth back up. Absolutely stunning. The final 45 minutes were also full of jaw-dropping visual effects, the most amazing shot being Optimus and Megatron flying through a building in downtown Los Angeles. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, there's another hour and twenty minutes of the movie that we have to sit through. The plot for this movie is barely enough to cover two hours, let alone close to two and a half. The Decepticons are evil and want to use the Allspark to turn Earth into their new empire. The Autobots have to stop them. That's it. So Bay fills the rest of the movie with total filler material that's about as necessary as the cannibal island in Pirates 2 (meaning completely unnecessary). <br/><br/>There is almost no characterization for any of the main characters. There is no depth or motivation for any character. Sam wants to score. Mikaela is there for eye candy. The Sector 7 agent is there for humor only (not to mention poorly executed humor). The Secretary of Defense is there to have a veteran actor on board. The chick hacker is there for eye candy. <br/><br/>And that's just the humans. The Transformers have no character development whatsoever. They're giant five-story tall robots that transform into cars and blow things up. Nothing more. There are no relationships explored between robots. The closest we come to character development for them is Megatron's line, ""You fail me yet again, Starscream."" That's it. In the final battle sequence, I found myself disinterested because I didn't care who won. I didn't really care if any of them died. No motivation was explored on either side. It was just Autobots vs. Decepticons. That's just boring. <br/><br/>Another thing. I'm able to suspend belief for movies if I have to. I'm a seasoned 24 viewer. But I can't throw believability out the window. Come on. A five-story robot literally pissing on some guy. Give me a freaking break. It's hard enough even accepting that there are five- story tall robots that transform into cars. When you have them do really stupid things like that, you destroy any possible credibility that the movie may have. <br/><br/>Bay also tries to insert campy humor into the movie. He fails miserably. The only time I laughed while watching the movie was when the soldier (don't know his name) in Qatar was on the phone with the operator who was asking him about a credit card. That was it. The cheesy humor puts more nails in the grave marked ""Credibility and Believability"". <br/><br/>Finally, we have this massive battle in downtown Los Angeles. Massive death, destruction, and mayhem. And in the end, the government buries the evidence and goes about their normal business. Come on! Like you could cover that up. That's like trying to cover up the destruction of the White House. It's just not possible. Completely impossible. That put the credibility coffin six feet under. <br/><br/>So, in the end, this movie focuses on eye candy and nothing else. The effects are eye- popping and jaw dropping. But eye candy will not float a film. To get a really good and entertaining film, you need: <br/><br/>1) characters you care about 2) a plot that is more than twenty words when boiled down 3) stunning action (on which Transformers delivers 4) believability and credibility <br/><br/>And all Transformers has is eye candy. It is certainly not ""more than meets the eye"". 3/10.<br/><br/>You also know it's not good when one of the trailer you see (1-18-08) is as memorable as the movie itself. If you want a great action movie this summer, go see Live Free or Die Hard or The Bourne Ultimatum."

But no later he uses the same weapon which mysteriously is worth crap.<br/><br/>And what did they do to Jazz, and what did Jazz do to them to deserve that kind of treatment, from his personality to his death everything looked like they were making it up as they moved along.<br/><br/>And why the Hell did the Allspark regenerate Frenzy's body but when Bumblebee touched it, his vocal processor didn't get fixed. It creates entire robots but can't fix a mute one? The CG Transformers were overdone, too much useless crap on them that they didn't need or use, it was like listening to the tech talk on Star Trek, useless and pointless just for show.<br/><br/>I swear i feel like they didn't have a script at all they just improvised, and did a horrible job at it. And there is more but i just can't bring myself to point out all the mistakes because its a full time job.<br/><br/>I liked the Cars though, especially the Mustang Barricade, but that's it hated the movie, and having a hot babe does not make a good movie, but luckily Transformes has two so we are saved.

"Tatsujin","Null","3","7","23 December 2007"," ""based on the back-cover of a toy package""
","Watching this, I delightfully realise... ""thankfully, no real writer has to take responsibility for writing this pool of toxic waste."" The story is so obviously written by a toy-making company. During lunch. On a napkin. Using a finger dipped in jam. For example, with names like ""Decepticons"", ""Megatron"" and ""Optimus Prime""... there's no way to escape from toy-land confinement.<br/><br/>With much difficulty, I tried to set aside the cheap toy-story, and tried to follow the film instead, however little there was in there. The reward I got from this was nausea and utter dejection. This ""movie"" is made by and for people that played with transformer toys when they were kids (maybe they still do?). The juvenile portrayal of the two protagonists is just silly. It belongs in a direct-to-video movie. Many times I just thought to myself: ""oh no, they didn't just do that, did they?"".<br/><br/>Now, you're probably saying ""but it's just a cheap summer blockbuster flick""... and you'd be right. It's exactly that and it deserves no higher grade than 4. Not because it's ""only an action movie"", but because it's very very bad. Even ""only""-action movies need a sane, cohesive plot and somewhat understandable characters. Otherwise what's the point? For me there's none, but judging by the grade it got here, I guess there's many that doesn't need more.<br/><br/>I'll give it the benefit of a doubt for the CG. As an inquisitive ""pixel-police"", I admit there'are some nice interaction between the live elements and the CG elements in this movie. People see the climate changes as a threat... I see another threat, perhaps a more short-term one; crappy CG-focused movies. I urge all movie-goers; don't pay for crap! Is this really the trend we want to encourage?! Like MPAA and RIAA says: ""piracy is theft""; I say: so is making crap and selling it as good quality entertainment.<br/><br/>Of course, if all you're looking for is some nice CG, watch a car commercial. And you don't even have to pay; they show them for free on TV! But then again, a car commercial has a much more complex plot than this movie... It just sounds too good to be true."

","After buying his first car, gawky high-school nerd Sam (Shia Leboef) learns he has actually stumbled across Bumblebee, one of the transforming 'autobots' from planet cybertron. He is there to warn off an impending attack from the decepticons, an evil brand of transformer, who are hell-bent on launching an all-out invasion. Together he teams up with high school sex-goddess, borderline lap dancer, Mikaela (played by Megan Fox who looks a lot older than most high school girls). The original series of Transformers was nothing special, but admittedly had charm. Michael Bay's latest crime against cinema takes that charm, and turns it into a great big two hour advert for a mobile phone. Every girl who shows up just happens to look like Paris Hilton, and you could probably fill a beach with the amount of gruff dirt and manly sweat dripping from the eyebrows of our beloved human heroes. Even the action is underwhelming, devoid of menace or subtlety to underplay the visual vasectomy that your eyes will suffer from. The only redeeming quality is Shia Leboef, who is so charmingly funny amid the preposterousness of the actual Transformers, almost validating the movie's ballooned sense of silliness."
"ChrisW42","3","3","7","4 December 2007"," What was the story again?
","Granted, this is supposed to be an action film based on a range of toys. On that level I suppose it delivers the goods. However, for a budget of some $145 million, it shouldn't have been the be all and end all. There ought to have been at least some semblance of plot to go with it.<br/><br/>In the right place and well-executed, action sequences are no bad thing, but by the final act of this film I was yawning. The relentless onslaught of one battle after another is simply mind-numbing. The CG Transformers, while realised proficiently, are nothing new: there's a car ad by Citroen that's been running in the UK for ages now, which features a transforming/dancing/skating car. It was easily on a par with anything this film had to offer, so there was hardly a 'Wow!' factor.<br/><br/>Michael Bay seems content with his limitations as a maker of overblown, plot-lite action spectaculars. If he wishes to be taken seriously as a filmmaker, he needs to work out what elicits genuine emotion from an audience, and start substituting some story for his stunts."
"robert-880","2","3","7","20 November 2007"," Amazing............................that this movie is rated as highly as it is!
","OK, I'm probably an idiot for expecting more from a movie about robots from outer space that can re-form themselves into (coincidently) earthmen-designed cars and trucks of this period. (It's true, they leave a flimsy ""out"" for this unlikeliness). As a lad, I confess I thought the whole transformer thing peculiar, albeit creative.<br/><br/>Outstanding CGI to be sure -- one requirement fulfilled. The positives end there. I found the movie ham-handed and reliant on volume and hyper-kinetic camera work. Bay has a way of pummeling his audience. Much has been touted about how much great action is in this movie. But I came away feeling less like I had seen this all before, and more like this time I was forced to lie on my back while giant robots emptied trashcans full of everything I've seen before on my writhing body. Maybe that's what people like about the movie? On the human side, Transformers is chock full of predictable caricatures acted with...well, zero nuance. I can just see Michael Bay directing his cast ""Try it again -- this time even more goofy!"" (More cowbell!) Some people found Shia LaBeouf's performance great. To each his own. A barely interesting point:counterpoint is his over-the-top mugging contrasted with his leading-lady's glazed vapidness. Not sure what John Voight was thinking by taking this role. Maybe he had a good time. His call.<br/><br/>Finally, Michael Bay seems to think upping the contrast and saturation in post production is some sort of clever art form. Looks more like Photoshop 101. <br/><br/>I was totally open to enjoying a movie about Transformers. But besides the fun CGI, I didn't. Hey, what do I know? Bay keeps making millions...and millions. And that worries me."
"redemption37927","2","3","7","19 November 2007"," Shia saved this movie from being a TOTAL piece of sh*t
","Initially, I saw the teaser for this, somewhat intrigued at the idea of a 'Transformers' movie, though I had never seen the cartoons before. At least, I WAS excited...until I saw the words 'A Michael Bay Film'. That brought me back down to earth...<br/><br/>...but THEN something distinct occurred when I saw the extended trailer: I was actually surprised by what I saw, and I thought, 'Maybe Steven Spielberg was all that Michael Bay needed...'<br/><br/>Well, opening night, after working a long shift at work and hoping to relax at home, my roommate surprised me with my ticket, and off we went.<br/><br/>Well, sorry to say that the term 'What you see is what you get' most certainly didn't apply to this movie. Nobody informed me that I would be subjected to alien cyborgs prone to surprisingly-good earthling pop-culture lingo and urinary pranks. And it wasn't that I was put off by the complete misinterpretation of the title characters; it was the fact that, about forty-five minutes into the movie, I was just bored with what I was seeing. With the exception of Shia LeBaouf, nothing impressed me about this movie. And given Michael Bay's penchant for making movies twice as long as they should be, I knew I had another hour and forty-five minutes left to go.<br/><br/>First of all, the incident in the Middle East: A) didn't need to be there in the first place, or B) if you do include it, show the Decepticon wiping out the entire base with no survivors. That's right, you most definitely don't need Tyrese and Josh Duhamel in this movie, they don't enhance anything. All this is made worse by the fact that they conveniently find themselves fighting these things at the end of the movie, which I'm sure is exactly what they want to do is fight things they could barely predict in the desert...<br/><br/>And if they were dead weight, I can't even begin to describe what that would make the hot Australian hacker chick and her friend, who besides being a fellow hacker is her complete opposite (and played by Anthony 'stuck in fat black comic relief role for life' Anderson). This was a subplot that had ABSOLUTELY NO BEARING ON THE STORY WHATSOEVER, if only so Michael Bay could turn to his friends and say, 'I can get Anthony Anderson and hot Australian chicks in my movie'. Well, maybe you've got a slight edge on me, Mr. Bay, but if I had that ability, I reckon I could find a better way to utilize them in the ACTUAL STORY! (By the way, did I mention that there is a hacker played by a hot Australian chick? Yeah, that's believable...)<br/><br/>Now, about the ACTUAL STORY itself: Kid wants a car to impress babes in badly, ends up igniting the battle between Autobots and Decepticons in the fight for the power of the Cube. All the previous things considering, that's not TOO bad. And hell, if it weren't for Shia, this might have been the first movie I ever would've walked out on. He was unquestionably good, and his improvisation is amongst the best I've seen.<br/><br/>With that said, the least that Spielberg could've done, as executive producer, was find a competent writing staff. Now, yes, I have NOT seen the cartoons, but that doesn't necessarily mean I don't know the story. Hell, it isn't hard. My issue with the story wasn't with the main story, as muddled as it became at the end (and that last half hour was a mishmash of bad cinematography and editing that I couldn't decipher to save my life). My issues were with the two other story lines mentioned before that had no real reason to be there in the first place, and the extremely crappy dialogue. I've lived in Florida, and there are products of the Florida educational system that could've written this a lot better that it was.<br/><br/>Really, the only three positives about this movie:<br/><br/>A) Shia LeBaouf B) The special effects (at least, when you could tell what the hell was going on) C) It isn't the MOST boring and disappointing movie of the summer (congrats to 'Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer' for that award)"

First, the transformers talking like they're hip was just stupid. Which brings me to my next point, it tried too hard to be funny, and therefore wasn't very funny at all. Also, what's the deal with focusing so much on the humans? Aren't the transformers supposed to be the stars of a movie called Transformers? Finally, the movie was just plain too long.

First I will say what I did like about the film.<br/><br/>The visual effects were superb. The shots with the transformers transforming were amazingly realistic. My wife told me that there were a few times that she was watching them and thought ""come on, don't take so long..."" and then realized that what she was watching was not really happening. Very cool.<br/><br/>There were some of the funniest one-liners I've seen in an action movie. Even though I wasn't especially enjoying the film, there were several times that I laughed out loud at a line or sight gag.<br/><br/>Now for what I didn't like about the film. First of all, I'm over the whole ""amazing visual effects"" effect. Have been since the last LOTR. I don't go see CGI movies because I don't care how amazing the animation is if there isn't a good story. So I see them when I hear there's a good story. To me, Transformers had the effects, and that's it. And I got bored with it.<br/><br/>Further, there were too many characters, and none were developed at all. Not to mention that Bernie Mac's cameo was extremely unnecessary and distracting. It appeared that the filmmakers were trying to tug on your heart about certain characters, but you didn't know who they were or care about them. The only character I cared about was Bumblebee, and that was because you just thought he was sweet. Everyone else seemed like people you were looking at while you walk through Wal-Mart's toy section.<br/><br/>I paid one dollar to see this through RedBox. I'm glad I didn't spend any more."

Fun, action, cars and a hot woman. Is there anything else a movie needs? An actual plot you say? Seriously though, if you're going into this movie, than should know better than that. I checked some of Mr. Bays favorite things above ... a few others are: the always moving camera if an action scene is played out in front of you. The spinning camera around the hero(es) etc. etc. etc.<br/><br/>The actors are great too (for a blockbuster), Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox! Some characters come short (come to think of it most of them) due to the amount of time spent on the action and/or comedy scenes in the movie, but that's OK. OK because it's what you can expect. So shut down your brain at the entrance and enjoy this ride. It's worth it (and I'm definitely nothing close to a Bay nor a Bruckheimer fan)!"

","This is a very poor conversion to live action. I have always been a fan of Transformers in all their many and varied guises as cartoon but this live action attempt just does not do them justice. The only saving grace is the spectacular special effects. The start of the film gives so much promise. Then it is all downhill. Overall the acting was weak, Shia LeBouef and Megan Fox can be justifiably embarrassed at this poor attempt to mix action and comedy. The plot is poor,obvious and confused at the same time with so many annoyances I found myself yelling ""What??"" . The slapstick comedy routines of the Autobots were almost embarrassing. Very disappointing. I found myself looking forward to the transformers transformation scenes just because there was nothing else worth giving any attention to. As a vehicle for demonstrating modern special effects this is a good film; as anything else it is a waste of time. Could have been so much better. And finally, BumbleBee is a Volkswagen NOT a rusty American Camaro."
"info-4912","5","3","7","9 August 2007"," Transformed too far....
","Initially, when I heard of a Transformers movie being created, I had low hopes. For some reason this year, I gave way to reason, and developed high hopes. My recent turn around appears to have been in vain. Transformers has been transformed too far beyond the original story/concept.<br/><br/>The Transformers movie is simply....<br/><br/>(1) The most fantastic piece of CGI work I have ever seen.<br/><br/>(2) Excellent action.<br/><br/>(3) Worthless story. Does not respect G1 series as Bay claimed it would. The main keys of the original series G1 story(from G1 series to movie to G1 after movie series) were far superior to anything that Bay can conceive apparently. So why try to reinvent it?<br/><br/>(4) Extremely poor characterization. In fact, what character developments exists beyond some of the human characters? Perhaps Bay intended for the fans to remember the characterization from the original series and movie. However, this can not work, as the story/history is completely changed in this new movie. Nothing(except for some names and very basic appearances, and some silly catch lines) is the same.<br/><br/>The movie seems to be about humans and the problems of Earth because of the Transormers arrival, not about the Transformers themselves. A substantial portion of the movie in the beginning is entirely about a human's life (Sam) without introducing Transformer characterization.<br/><br/>I am convinced that Bay should never be allowed to direct another film in entirety after seeing this. He is a 1st class action director. I think that he should be brought in specifically for action scenes, but not for an entire film.<br/><br/>This movie was far too long. After about an hour and a half, I only remained seated because I was with another person. I just wanted the movie to end after that point. Don't get me wrong, I love long movies. Long movies with entertaining stories/plots. For *pure* comedy and *pure* action, the shorter the better in my book.<br/><br/>I am not a hardcore TF fan that can tell you everything that happened in every EP of the series. But I was a fan when I was a kid and owned quite a few of the toys at that time. I remember most of the key plot points of the G1 story arc. For me, to see this extreme deviation from I remember was just another black eye on the film. But, I realize that Hollywood movies rarely follow the original story arc of what they were based upon. I don't know why this is true, however. I can understand editing out parts for time content of what can be shown in a short time. I can not understand changing everything for the mere purpose of changing everything.<br/><br/>I will give the film 5 stars. But for me, the star rating is linear. 5 is a 50 percent mark. It means this movie is halfway between horrible and excellent. Absolute middle of the road. Mediocre. I usually find no entertainment value, personally, in mediocre films."
"aeo","2","3","7","4 August 2007"," If I was not a Transformer fan, I would have given this movie a 1.
","Basically, the special effects were awesome. I could not get enough of the way the robots transformed. That was the high point. The low points are the story, dialog, and acting----they were terrible. The dialog was just stupid. The love interest of the main character was pretty but just a filler and was placed in this movie so that juvenile boys could go crazy over, which is not a bad thing if she had some decent script to work with and if she had the ability to act. Both of which I did not see.<br/><br/>If I was not a fan of Transformers already, I would have given this movie a 1. If you want to check out a good Transformer series, then go rent Beast Wars or the old Transformer animation. The latter though is dated since it came out during the 1980's."
"tarsoasis","2","3","7","3 August 2007"," Give away of Transformers
","This movie was the greatest deception of the year. This is not a adult movie, this is a kid movie.<br/><br/>Only the special effects are great. Too much clichés. Too much merchandising. Too much poor jokes. The people of US government is shown like disqualified ones. The movie treats LAN house players like genius that can decipher an alien code in seconds while the NASA itself can't. Sorry, but that was bad, very bad.<br/><br/>That credit card thing in the middle of a war was a really big mess. The movie was lost to me in that moment. A ""Super Funny"" Agent of a Secret Sector 7 with ""Super Funny"" underpants is the worst thing I could ever see in a movie in all times.<br/><br/>I don't know why the film makers thought that too much explosions e action scenes are the only important things in a movie. I like a lot action scenes but a good story is necessary.<br/><br/>Michael Bay has a lot to learn. Spielberg did not choose well.<br/><br/>I'm tired of things like that being produced."
"gmheymer","3","3","7","29 July 2007"," Michael Bay crashes... again.
","I very rarely comment on a film but I feel compelled to comment on this one. I am not a Transformers fan of the original series. I'm not going to write a long comment about how it is not like the series. This film has to be one of the most poorly constructed and disjointed films I have seen in a while. The problems with this film begins and ends with Michael Bay. The spinning crane and staid-cam shots which he constantly employs, in slow motion, completely distract from the story. The constant use of loud dramatic music, music that sounds identical to that in Pearl Harbor and Bad Boys II, is also overdone and inappropriate. I found that there were many plot holes, that interesting characters were never used effectively, that characters seemed to suddenly do things without reason, that monologues were used instead of action to tell the story.<br/><br/>I gave this film 3 stars because of the CG employed. This was the one area of the film that was outstanding. The transition from live film to CG was almost flawless. It seems that this was the main focus of the film making process and it is a pity that the rest of the story suffers as a result. With a better script and a different director this could have been a really amazing film."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","3","7","29 July 2007"," Good family summer entertainment
","Transformers TRANSFORM - something this movie offers that is unique. The CGI sequences of vehicle-to-robot (and the reverse) are as spectacular as promised. Other elements that are however all too familiar - parents-vs-adolescent comedy and big-brother type secret government outfit, just to name two. All told, there are enough visual treats to satisfy and enough laughs to give you a good time. Definitely family entertainment but at 144 minutes, it's a tad too long.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf, seen last year in an ensemble role in ""Bobby"", bears an uncanny resemblance to Ryan Gosling (who is 6 years older). Watch out for him next year in a key role in the 4th installment of Indiana Jones (directed by Spielberg himself). Jon Voight and John Turturro have stereotyped roles as big shot government official and hateful secret agent respectively. Megan Fox provides youthful sensuousness and the rest of the cast whatever support necessary, all quite on cue. Scene stealing are the transformers, robots with distinct human characters and mannerism, both good and bad guy. Performing the voice of the chief villain Megatron is none other than Hugo Weaving."
"muppet-show","3","3","7","25 July 2007"," Perfectly computer animated mediocrity
","First of all, I would like to say that I have read some of the reviews posted here and they seem to agree to disagree. In the end it will simply boil down to this: Either you are a Transformers fan, in which case you will REALLY hate this film, or you are out for a mind-numbingly stupid story in a beautifully rendered action film, in which case you will probably love it. So, leave your brain at the door.<br/><br/>I am not going to write a synopsis, largely because it's already been done, and quite frankly there is not much of an interesting synopsis to write about. What I will say is this: Transformers is not as good as Die Hard 4.0 in terms of its execution and story line. So if you HAVE to make a choice I would suggest you go see that one, but that's just me.<br/><br/>That being said, I must admit I was fairly disappointed by the film. While I am not a hardcore Transformers fan, I am part of the generation that remembers the old cartoons with fondness (in which case I mean all those generation 1 cartoons - which incidentally had more story in one episode than this entire film does-, not the crap that came later). Furthermore, the prospect of giant robots duking it out on the silver screen in a time of near perfect computer effects on film, well the idea had me geared up for some serious action. The name Micheal Bay does not strike me with extraordinary panic (unlike his crew members and actors, as I have heard), although I do concede that aside from The Rock (which set action film standards back in the day) and Bad Boys 2 (which I consider a solid, but slightly goofy action film) he has not produced anything of significant value. Transformers will not change this perception. When Bay initially heard of the project, he declined, saying he found the basic premise too weak/absurd for a decent story (which I find ironic given the story arc of the finished product). And this idea must have stuck with him as he finally conceded to directing Transformers. Throughout the film, one has the impression, that the characters of the movie are not being taken seriously. Thus the film has a hard time of actually involving the audience. While most of the action is solid, shaky cam non-withstanding, the story is actually so weak that the audience tends to not really care for what is going on. Even as an Autobot dies, he does so as more of a footnote (the fact that the one doing the dying is the only ""black""-one, may also raise issues of racism by the way, but that is another matter). On a high note, Shia LeBoef DOES do a decent job of portraying Sam.<br/><br/>Given the financial success of the film however, I am sure there will be a sequel to the movie coming up soon. I hope that by then the studios will have realized that solid animation will only carry a movie so far. But then again, looking at the financial successes of both Transformers and Pirates of the Carribbean 3, I will not get my hopes up too much. I am just going to buckle down and watch well-made Asian films until the new Batman comes along.<br/><br/>Roll out."

Transformers was a favourite of mine as a child so this was a great nostalgic film as well as an utterly amazing one.<br/><br/>The CGI is flawless and you realise how little they gave away in the trailers, which is a great thing when you see the film. The storyline is there too, and while its not the deepest or full one ever this is an action sci-fi film, not a romance or anything. you paid to go see giant robots fight, not to sympathise with the protagonist on a deeply personal level.<br/><br/>or anyone who loved the cartoons or for anyone who loves films this one is definitely for you. easily one of the best films I've seen this year.

"wwwdotloulantosdotcom","9","3","7","23 July 2007"," robot on robot action? OH YEAH!
","I went into this movie with expectations restrained. The trailers kicked @ss, but then again thats the purpose of trailers, right? They're little bundles of lies that leads us to believe a movie will rock the sh*t, whether they do or not we soon discover once we sit through the features themselves. Fortunately no lies were involved here, and, if anything, the movie itself tore the trailer to bits and p*ssed on each shard one fragment at a time.<br/><br/>It was an arresting experience, sitting in awe, watching this movie roll by one frame at a time. I was just engrossed. It was one of those instances where you're so overwhelmingly entertained that you begin to forget you're sitting in a cinema full of people; you're by yourself in your own mind, you're locked-in, and your existing for every moment of the film that passes by. I know that in itself seem like a very powerful statement to make, I mean, it's not like this film bears the same kind of emotional integrity as say Schindler's List or Hotel Rwanda, but that doesn't make it any less an experience to savour. It has the kind of energy and enthusiasm that we all embodied as tiny children when we were crunching our Transformer figures together on our bedroom floors; occasionally integrating a Ninja Turtle, or a Ghostbuster just to broaden the fantasy in our tiny minds.<br/><br/>If you go into this film as a critic, you'll be doing yourself a disservice. This film demands that you volunteer your senses. That you don't sit there in analytical mode; questioning why every ounce of the film is happening the way it's happening and why. You can do that with all the Bergmann, Lynch, and Ozu films you want to when you get home. And if you simply insist on doing that then you've chosen the wrong film. Transformers is an artifact; an anonymous exhibit in a museum with no factoid printed below it. You don't need to know how or why it got here, you just need to look and admire."
"oded_50","3","3","7","22 July 2007"," Where's the script?
","It's literally been decades since I saw the last episode of the transformers on TV. I remember the fun and excitement I felt as a kid when the autobots transformed. I expected an action-packed movie, a war between robots with explosions, car chases and a high tempo. I was very disappointed by the result. The movie resembles a teen summer movie more than an action flick, where the dorky kid (played very well by Shia LaBeouf) falls for the pretty girl. The transformers seem like the background to this story line for the first half of the movie. It's like we gone back in time to see mid 80s Disney movies. Later the transformers start fighting. The FX are very cool but sparse, the text isn't cool at all. Optimus Prime is an avid advocate of the humans right for freedom, holier than the pope. Very tacky and distasteful. The heroics of the young kids and soldiers are not believable. John Turturro does a good job, but that's not enough. Count me out for the sequel."
"gfgr","10","3","7","22 July 2007"," More than meets the eye!
","What a movie! Transformers must be one of the best movies (if not the best one) of the year. Though I belong to the Transformers generation (1980's) I was never really hooked up with the franchise and couldn't recall any of the transformers names aside from Opitmus Prime and Megatron if you had asked me.<br/><br/>Having seen the trailer I went to see the movie knowing that I was in for some eye candy special effects, but not so sure of the overall story. But as the transformers slogan goes the movie was ""more than meets the eye"".<br/><br/>Knowing more or less what the main theme of the ever-changing saga of the transformers is, I though this movie had many reasons to turn out silly and have nothing more to offer that visual effects I mean we are talking about robotic aliens, with human emotions, simplistically separated into a team of goody good autobots and the all-evil decepticons. Oh yeah and they turn into trucks and other vehicles and planes for some reason in a nut shell I thought it would be an fun take on the transformers cartoon and toy line at best but it's so much more.<br/><br/>It has actually avoided the cheesiness of most ""America under attack"" movies focusing on the human characters as well as the transformers. Fresh characters presented with a touch of humour that each has his/her own gravity in the story and aren't just fillers to help the plot unfold. Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky does a great job at becoming the underdog we all sympathise for, who ends up becoming the hero (reminding us how we all felt for Peter Parker in the first Spider-man movie). It is action packed from beginning to end but you never get enough of it. The visuals are astonishingly well made not distracting from the movie with thoughts ""that looked fake"" and besides the effects, there are many scenes with great visual interest. I enjoyed the music and sound effects (especially the transforming ones) and as a hole the movie worked so good. A must see for all ages and genders, shapes and sizes.<br/><br/>On the downside it was a bit too long and some scenes coul have been shorter, but everything is so well made that you enjoy every bit of it! I for one am not ashamed to admit my excitement over this movie. A must see!"

","Okay, here's the deal: i went to see Transformers yesterday for a preview screening. It blew my MIND. Now punch into the calculator that i was expecting to see a good movie. Extrapolate that, it was that good, i mean it. Now i can expect that a lot of adults went to the theatre with their kids, disheartened to be dragged into Transformers rather than an '18' rated movie. Well i'm sure their days will have been brightened. Transformers cannot from almost any angle be considered a 'corny-kiddy' movie. The very teen 'i well fancy you' storyline, not only melds fantastically with the 'end of the world' scenario powering the plot, but is also greatly improved and 'romanticised' when it's a life and everyone's death situation going on. Shia LeBouf's acting is both witty when the comedy moment calls, and when the scene asks, is extremely fast paced and romantic.<br/><br/>Michael Bay has truly raised the bar among the directorate elite via Transformers. The action scenes are the hands down best i've seen ever; the sad scenes MAKE you empathise towards the characters; the Transformers acting is beautifully heroic, though quite the cheesy-baked potato.<br/><br/>And there's the robots themselves. You really get a feel for the autobots passion for their mission of saving the universe. Self-sacrifice in the cause of the greater good seem of little loss as long as the humans survive and the Decepticons are destroyed. This is no more obvious than with Optimus. The SFX is perfect. The facial expressions on the robots are emotively-dead-on. No more can be said about that, as it would be so long, and praising...and my hand's starting to hurt.<br/><br/>All in all, you really would do well to put Transformers on the top of your must-see list o' summer films.<br/><br/>P.S.

Unfortunately I was disappointed.<br/><br/>The good: The look of and way they handled the Transformers transforming was pretty impressive. (However it usually happened too fast to appreciate how it worked.) And the plot was OK, I could suspend disbelief enough to follow and enjoy the plot.<br/><br/>However the rest of the movie was disappointing: It seemed written by and for a 14 year old boy. Geeky selfish, spoiled upper-middle class Caucasian boy gets his dad to buy him a car so he can ditch his friend to go after a ""hot"" girl (who he doesn't even know anything about other than that she is attractive), and then of course ends up saving the world/getting the girl. The script was pathetic - trying to be hip in places it didn't work. Editing was done poorly -- too hard to follow the fights and the bouncing between plot points was not handled well.<br/><br/>I counted at least 10 separate product placements and would love to know just how much of the budget GMC paid to get their name and their logo not only on the Transformers but the showing of dealerships and other GMC cars. (Plus Ebay, BurgerKing, XBox, DeloitTouche, etc. etc.) I could have forgiven the rest of the flaws since it's just a fluffy action flick but paying $10 to see one big ad really really upsets me!"
"noizyme","4","3","7","16 July 2007"," 1st time seeing Transformers in action
","I went into the film not knowing most of the characters or even seeing the previous show nor movie. I grew up in the time that they were on TV, but I wasn't allowed to watch violent cartoons, so there you go. The Michael Bay version is interesting; a lot of new special FX that are more common in shorter doses (like car commercials) were displayed for the eye candy. The humor was a great touch (Bernie Mac especially)for such an odd movie (robots from space land on earth to search out a relic from an Antarctica expedition so that they can regain control of some energy cube before more evil-doing robots get there first). The movie, I was thinking, was aimed at kids, which it is but in a more mature fashion. And where there were Transformers, there's always a hidden agenda, it seems...<br/><br/>More than a slightly shadowed message about alien races (like, say, immigrants and recent national policies here in America about such), I had a giant problem with the fact that the producers of the film must've said to themselves, ""Here's a movie about a cartoon that was made popular because a lot of kids bought their toys. But kids haven't heard about Transformers in ages. What they have heard and seen lately are sports-cars, mobile phones, and XBOX 360s. Let's incorporate products in the movie as much as possible."" And they went crazy with it all. Brand names everywhere. I understand that movies cost money to make, but if a soul hasn't heard about eBay on the internet by now, do we need to hear the name ""eBay"" spouted at least 3 times in the film? How about Pontiac, a Saleen Mustang, or a new Camaro? How about Nokia phones? No one's heard of those? How about spending that money for some decent shots of space, where these robots originated and fought most of the time? How about offering advice to the cameraman in charge of placing the CGI screen so close to the robots fighting that you can't tell what they're doing? The camera was so wobbly, it made Michael Bay look like a drunk behind the shot concepts.<br/><br/>The concept behind Transformers is mind-boggling enough (who makes these things? what responsibility do the ""good"" guys have over the things they destroy on alien planets, like ours?) that a crazy director was all they needed. But you have to call this movie what it is, which is a car-commercial aimed at big kids with Transformer-size wallets who want to see how Army men handle getting blown up by giant outer space robots. It's a fluff piece aimed at kids with loud CGI in-your-face action without purpose. It was pretty fun while it lasted, but it made the storyline behind the series look pathetically boring. But they kept the same crappy music in the film like the original movie (I have since seen the cartoon movie) like Linkin Park.<br/><br/>My advice to people like me who never really got into the series, go watch the original cartoon movie. Watch a few episodes, then see the live-action-meets-CGI version. Its something for the legacy of Hasbro to deal with, but what warranted this movie to be released other than new products to talk about and new issues in the news. Skip it."

","I grew up with the original generation 1 TF cartoon series (man I feel dated LOL) back in 1984. This was a revolutionary series, full of action and wonderful animation. Granted back then the execs of Hasbro and those at Sunbow thought of this show as a 30 commercial for their toy line, but for millions of kids the show was so much more.<br/><br/>Now we fast forward to 2007 and Michael Bay's version, and there are no words to describe this. Let's start off with one of the most iconic characters, Optimus Prime.<br/><br/>Of course his design is not as I, or others who grew up remembered (a flat nosed red, silver and dark blue semi with silver trailer), but the new design just fits the character perfectly. Next we have to take the iconic voice actor of Peter Cullen. I would have been so disappointed if Peter had chosen not to reprise his role of Prime. He has done many 80's cartoons and some of later, but this character (and even Iron Hide) are the most memorable.<br/><br/>For the CGI. It is the best I have ever seen, and is the most realistic and glitch free to date. I can't even comprehend the computer power this thing must have taken to render the images. WELL DONE!!! I was saddened that Frank Welker was unable to perform as Megatron as he did so brilliantly in the original series 23 years ago. However the voice that was used for Megatron felt closer to Leonard Nemoy's Galvatron from animated Transformers The Movie (1986).<br/><br/>I hope there is a sequel in the coming years to Transformers the movie. My hope is that the writers take what they did in this movie and ramp it up to the nth degree.<br/><br/>Thank you to Michael Bay, Steven Spielberg, the cast and crew of Transformers for keeping this iconic tale that began over 4 millions ago alive."

","I have read countless reviews on the Transformers movie and I have to say some of them are outright ridiculous. What did most of you expect when you went into the movie theater? Did you think you were going to see a movie with a phenomenal storyline? Well it's a Michael Bay movie so you know that is off the menu right off the bat. Did you think you were going to see the most stellar acting to date? Once again: it's a Michael Bay movie. However, because it did not have either of the two above mentioned aspects does not make this a horrible movie as many have gone on the record saying. The special effects were more than satisfying and the fight scenes were some of the best eye candy ever to be placed into a movie.<br/><br/>I am sure I will receive umpteen messages about how I am off base with my opinion but Michael Bay delivered exactly what we should have expected and yet people still find it necessary to think this was an atrocious movie. Tell me what exactly happened in the movie that made it terrible? Did anything occur that would be out of the ordinary for a blockbuster summer movie? Transformers delivered in the one area it needed to: It brought the robots to life in front of our eyes and that may have been the sole purpose of the movie. If you didn't like it that's really too bad for you. So here is an idea for everyone who absolutely hated the movie. The next time there is a summer blockbuster throw out all expectations. To expect will only leave you disappointed. Instead going into the movie and just take it for what it's worth. This movie was not meant to wow us with amazing acting or a storyline for the ages. Instead it was a special effects monster and that is exactly how it should be judged. If you did not like the way the robots looked, moved, or fought then I have to say there truly is no pleasing a fan with that though process. In the end the idea of the Transformers is what put your butt in the theater yet so many of you decided to complain about a movie that will happen once in a lifetime. By the way, I will watch part 2."

"Twilight_Wraith","10","3","7","5 July 2007"," The greatest summer movie of all time
","Transformers, it's a movie that everybody has been very negative about ever since it was first announced. Once you see the movie, you'll find yourself enjoying it on every possible level. It's a lot of fun to watch. It's not a intellectual movie, it's not thought-provoking or deep. That's not the point, the point of the movie is to be complete 100% fun and enjoyment. The highlight of the film is Peter Cullen, who voices Optimus Prime and also does a voice-over for the very beginning of the film. He has a booming heroic voice that will send chills up and down your spine. The movies CGI is incredible, the jokes are not particularly fresh or new, but they are a lot of fun. You'll find yourself laughing throughout the film. There are a lot of moments to cheer during the movie. Whether you are new to Transformers or are a total G1 fanatic, you'll love this movie. The only way you won't enjoy this movie is if you enter the movie expecting it to be bad. In any case, you will leave completely entertained and blown away, because after this film Hollywood will be hard-pressed to make anything bigger."

","This film was incredible!, everything was top-notch!, the action was flawless and dare I say that Megan Fox's acting was superb, Micheal Bay and Megan Fox and Shia were born to do this film, simply amazing performances!. Words cannot explain how awesome the CGI was, simply mind blowing! When Blackout first appeared and he started transforming you just go like WOW!!! all the action scenes were like a roller-coaster ride! this movie really does deserve to bi on the top 250, its something original and fun. I was tired of all the superhero in suit crap like Spider-man and Fantastic Four, I mean really, who would want to see Pirates on wooden ships when you have giant robots beating the crap out of each other??? I was waiting for this film for more than 3 years and the wait was definitely worth it. Two years of bashing Michael Bay saying that he will ruin the film, but after I saw the 2nd Teaser trailer and the 4th trailer this May I was speechless, I ate my own words. All I can say is: Congratulations Micheal Bay, please forgive me!!!."

","I have been waiting since I saw the first trailer. This movie well exceeded my expectations. Plot was good and acting was good. If you are expecting ""Oscar worthy"" or ""Artistic"" that is not what this is about. Understand this is an action movie. I have heard some people ripping this movie because it was ""cheesey."" HELLO it is (as I am) a product of the 80's. What isn't cheesy that came out of that era?!?! It had so much more to offer then I thought possible. The effect were outstanding (that should be a given). But this movie was so entertaining. My Wife, who I had to drag to the theater, actually commented that it was ""awesome."" I can't wait to see it again, and then buy the DVD and then wait for the sequel :-)"
"DG_Zapdos","10","3","7","5 July 2007"," Rejuvinating a cult classic
","When I spent two years anticipating, it led me to study more of where the writers were going. It was truly stressful because I and most certainly other fans of the 1984 Transformer G1 series were worried that it will be an inevitable screw up. Film adaptations or recreations of successful television series/cartoons most notably end up humiliating the success and popularity of something that has grown into history. Transformers was in my lifetime and it was an honor to experience its growth as I grew up. In fact, I notice that many cartoons back in the day were more intelligent and creative than the cartoons they have in this present day. I feel I was lucky to witness great amazing cartoons back in the day compared to what the future generations have to work with. All in all, Transformers was a dear childhood memory for me. HELL it even improved my vocabulary when I was young, so you can say an important part of my life.<br/><br/>I looked at any detail to this film in development to post-production and I have to say I had my minor doubts. When I saw the concept sketches I protested immediately. I was heartbroken to hear that Optimus had a G2 paint job with its flames over the Peterbuilt truck. It was not a flat nose, instead a bloody long nose. No trailer provided. I certainly was being naive about thinking that they could pull it off regardless of the odd misplacement of the trailer every time Optimus Transformed. Yet I realized, in order to make a live action film, you need to compensate for the things that cartoons can get away with. Live action film must reveal something an audience can relate and believe in. That means regardless of our childhood memories, Megatron can't shape shift into some small pistol, it's too inconsistent and mindless. So realistically, this film pulled it off quite well. We have to realize that with some sacrifices made on some appearances to the robots, we have what looks like a believable look.<br/><br/>Finally, I started to build my trust on a good product, or what looked like it at the time. The trailers did not show too much. It was enough for me to salivate over. Every time I was in the theater watching another film, the trailer would make me yell out in excitement and cheer for the Transformer feature.<br/><br/>When I saw it, I was awestruck on how they brought it all in. Now, here is where I get to appreciate my past a little. A film pays a proper homage to the classic series as well to its entire history. The characters were pulled off well aside from some quirks. After this film I began to actually appreciate more of my times as a kid, watching the original G1 series. It reincarnated the franchise and opened a new door which would push transformers into a new future which looks positive for where the films trilogy is going. Now that I have seen this, I await more impatiently for the second film, hoping to see SOUNDWAVE and hoping to see Jazz come back to life. (I almost cried when they said he did no survive) JAZZ can't die; he's an important character in the roster. So we know there is an opening for the series clearly. Scorponok did not die in the film; he disappeared in fact throughout the film. Barricade did not fight in the end battle so he must have been alive; unless they killed those two in the adaptations. Star Scream however is evidently going to roundup some decepticons for the sequel since he flew off out of the earth into space. Megatron is dumped into the ocean....if anyone is a G1 fan they would know that's where Megatron makes his base of operations. If we remember, when the decepticons were cast(Crashing into the ocean from there blown ship) into the ocean by the Autobots, they hid in the ocean until they created a base where they could then make a comeback and continue there evil plans. So there is a major opening for the sequel and I sure as hell want to see it. So, it's rejuvenating to see a live action Transformers film compliment an old cartoon classic into a new mean lean trilogy."
"SHB_73","10","3","7","4 July 2007"," Transform and roll out!
","If I can sum up my feelings on this movie in one word, it would be awesome! Based on the popular 1980's toy and cartoon Transformers is a wild ride from beginning to end. The story is about alien robots who are searching the planet Earth for the Allspark which has the power to turn any type of machine into a transformer robot. A race between the noble Autobots and the evil Decepticons to find it, the main human character Sam Witwicky (Shia Lebouf) is the key to finding it as he has in his possession a pair of eyeglasses which belonged to his great-grandfather that have a map burned into one of the lenses that shows the location of the Allspark. The Decepticons under their leader Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) want to use it to take over the universe while the Autobots led by Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen gives the voice he made famous on the 80's cartoon show) want to find it to protect it from the evil robots. The computer and special effects are first rate and the action sequences make you jump for joy. The acting which boasts Academy award winner Jon Voight is right on the money as well. Transformers is one of the best summer movies to come out in a long time, roll out!"
"banditphd001","10","3","7","4 July 2007"," Awesome
","I loved this movie. This is what summer popcorn movies should be like. Fun. I'm looking forward to seeing this on DVD and looking forward to seeing a sequel. Michael Bay has done this movie justice. I grew up playing with the toys when I was a kid. When I heard this was going to be done into a full blown live action movie I was skeptical, till I heard Steven Spielburg was producing it. Then when I heard Bay was directing it I figured that if anyone can do it to it's most chaotic he would definitely be the guy. No one can blow things up on film like he can. The actors were right on. Shai or how ever you spell his name was great in the movie. So was Megan Fox, that girl was perfect and really good to look at as well. I'm never been a fan of Tyrese, but he was pretty good in this and Josh Duhmmal was good as always. Let me say this, Optimus Prime is just one bad ass good robot."

","All I have to say is that this was a wonderful movie.... completely blew me away. I'd recommend it to anyone who want to go to the movies and just have plain old fashion fun. Can't wait until they make more installments.<br/><br/>The CGI was very out of this world. I think most of the people in the audience thought it was great as well.<br/><br/>What I didn't like about the movie was that they should have explained a bit more about some of the characters. It really did seem a bit rushed. Although, what they did explain should be easy enough for anyone to follow.<br/><br/>Again, BRAVO....."
"ivalines-1","10","3","7","4 July 2007"," Wonderfully Crazy
","I am still trying to catch my breathe five hours after we just saw the movie. What a wild ride. They did an outstanding job creating the Transformers. I was hoping that they would do more slow motion shots of the machines transforming themselves. The audio was great as well. I never knew there were so many Transformers fans out there until we were at this movie. I can only remember one other time when people cheered throughout the movie but this is the first movie everyone stood cheering at the end. The movie was well worth it. I liked the job that the two main teenage actors did. I see great things coming from them in the future."
"sahayog_mardan","10","3","7","4 July 2007"," An excellent movie for the audience and easily the best of 2007
","Frankly, I am not a fan of SCi-Fi movie genre, but this movie comes as a big surprise. This is not a typical Sci-Fi movie, it is not even a serious action movie and is packed with so much comedy and humor( not the cheap ones that we see in American Pie etc etc). The special effects were simply incredible (debatable as the best ever).The robots were great and the action sequences among them is just perfect. The way the robots turned themselves into Chevy Camaro and GMC Trucks is so well etched out. As for the actors, Shia LaBeouf is the perfect cast(Hollywoods future) for the lead role. He is really comic. And then his opposite sexy Megan Fox may not be that good an actress but certainly adds a package of glamor. The rest of the cast including Tyresse, Josh Duhamel, Racheal Taylor and Jon Voight do not disappoint either. The movie looks far more expensive than just $147m and could not understand how Spiderman could cost more than this one. Okay this may not be the best ever but certainly its way better than Spiderman 3, Pirates of the Caribbean- At World's End. It certainly was a relief for me as the movie that i watched before this one in the theater was the extremely pathetic EVAN ALMIGHTY."
"Bigsmak","10","3","7","4 July 2007"," Ride of your life, and then some
","No Spoilers<br/><br/>Gutted, 100% gutted. Gutted at the fact I have to wait another 23 days before I can watch this again. OMFG this is the best movie I have ever seen ever. Godfather II, suck my balls. Cassablanca, go hide in the corner you no good pile of horse manure. Star Wars, Bet you wish you were made in 2007 with Michael Bay directing!<br/><br/>OK - It was in English which was great (saw it in Norway), apart from a few times the transformers spoke to each other in cybertronian, with Norwegian subtitles. Never mind, the crowd laughed and I can wait to see what these 5 or 6 lines I missed were.<br/><br/>My Review.....<br/><br/>Non stop action. And them some. I know you can't start a sentence with and, but never mind, I'm in far too good a mood to worry about crap like that. In fact, my 30 years on this planet may just have been a build up to those last 2 hours. Explosions, fighting, explosions, sexy ladies, explosions, some big f'n robots and some more explosions. Oh yea, this might also be one of the funniest movies I have seen for a long time.<br/><br/>Plot wise, good robots, bad robots, humans in between and they're all searching for something. Which they find as you'd expect and everyone fights over it. That's about it really. But, my God! I am still shaking with excitement, it's just pure carnage from start to finish. I cheered a few times while watching this, as did the rest of the audience. We clapped in unison, laughed in unison and occasionally there were about 120 people saying oooooo and aaaaaaaa in unison. Bay has done a fantastic job with this. I was expecting a no brainer movie and I got it. He did me proud (so I guess I don't have to hunt him down to kill him now Laughing) and he did it with an extra loud bang.<br/><br/>Will kids love this movie? Yup Will 30yo's love this movie? Yup (and then some) Will older people love this movie? - To be honest, I am not sure that they all will. It's so fast paced and loud that I can imagine some old dear being taken out of the cinema with a cardiac condition. But she will probably have a smile on her face....<br/><br/>There was a hell of a lot of in jokes, references to other movies, actors who have Transformers connections and in general it is a geek fest. I won't spoil it for you. I will probably have to watch it 2 or 3 times to pick up on them all.<br/><br/>The acting.<br/><br/>If you've read the Empire review, you'll see that they single out Le Beouf for praise. He deserves this. He was fantastic. His comic timing helped make this movie and had someone like Tom Cruise, Bruce Willis, Tom Hanks (when they were younger) played this part the movie may not have worked. Le Beouf manages to bring the movie down to earth and keep it there. It's so real what he says and does and I can totally emphasise with his character, as will most geeks like us! comparisons to woody Allen - I say give it time but he can do it. Megan looked fantastic and was actually very good on screen. She got more time then she ever gets in Hope and Faith and she will turn out to be a big star. Josh Duhamel was very likable and it was always fun when he was up there. The rest of the cast also did a good job with no real notable bad turns.<br/><br/>So, as you may have gathered I liked this movie a hell of a lot but do I have any complaints. Yup, I do. There is not enough screen time for some of the Transformers. I guess that with sequels in mind they will get more eventually, I guess as it's the ""introduction"" movie we should have expected that. Also the way that some of the humans, (especially government ones) react to some situations is almost comical. I think that it's meant to be that way but some gain no respect for this. They don't give any indication that they could do their job if if weren't for the smart kids running around helping them.<br/><br/>Other than that. Brilliant.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>I am sorry if this is was a bit disjointed as a review but I am very excited and my blood is still pumping."
"MovieMan914","4","3","7","4 July 2007"," Very Disappointing
","About 1 year ago, when I saw a teaser of Transformers, my first instinct was that this movie was going to be lackluster at best. I had that same mindset until a couple of weeks ago when I saw an amazing trailer in the theater for the movie. This trailer was so great, it swayed my whole mindset and I actually became very eager to watch this movie. Fast forward to last night. From the opening of the movie, the disappointment began. The plot is very disappointing. Even the all-star cast could not improve this movie. The CGI was definitely groundbreaking and amazing for the most part. However, it was over the top at times especially during fight scenes between Transformers. There was so much CGI, i couldn't tell which Transformer was which and what they were doing. There were an excessive amount of attempts at slapstick humor and comic relief which inevitably made this movie overall Corny. Micheal Bay is definitely a great director in the action genre, but it is clear that in this movie, he placed too much emphasis on the CGI and paid little attention and provided lackluster effort in the area of Plot. The considerable amount of explosions, crashes and action sequences fail to distract the moviegoer from the fact that the movie was extremely disappointing."
"Grahamsky","5","3","7","3 July 2007"," If you are a transformers fan, you will not like this movie
","Thank you for ruining one of my favorite cartoon shows, Michael Bay. Transformers is not a terrible movie, but it is not good either. Shia LeBeouf is the lone bright spot in a film that drags, has multiple extraneous plot lines (the computer programmers, Sector 7, the Army unit, etc.), and many unnecessary attempts at humor. Bernie Mac has a hilarious cameo at the beginning as a used car salesman, but Anthony Anderson's cameo as a computer hacker is annoying and pointless. Similarly, the phenomenal John Turturro is forced to play an irritating G-man who does not contribute anything the plot of the film, but attempts to conjure cheap laughs instead. The focus of the movie should have been on plot rather than making it a film that everyone can somewhat enjoy.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe, however, is the lack of character development for the Autobots (the good transformers) and Decepticons (the evil transformers). Optimus Prime, the leader of the Autobots, is the only robot with any significant screen-time besides Bumblebee, who is a silent Camaro for most of the film. The transformers should have been the stars of the movie, not the human characters who help them. Characters like Starscream, Bumblebee, Hot Rod (who's not even in the film despite being the #2 Autobot), Jazz, Soundwave, Frenzy, etc. are integral parts of the TV series and cartoon movie, yet they are barely in the film and nearly impossible to tell apart in the battle scenes. Also, Megatron is only in the film for a few minutes and turns into an airplane rather than the giant gun that he is supposed to be. How can the antagonist only be in the film for the last scene? To top off night of epic disappointment, there was no Stan Bush song on the soundtrack. Whos is Stan Bush you say? Only the musical god who rocked our socks off with ""Dare"" and ""The Touch"" in the original film. Bay opted for Linkin Park instead...F+ for that decision. There was also no mention of energon cubes, the matrix of leadership, or Unicron. Granted, only hardcore fans know what I'm talking about, but many of the 20-somthings who went to see this movie grew up watching the show and were probably as disappointed as I was with the lack of effort to stay true to the show.<br/><br/>While the visual effects are stunning, the plot wanders like lost child at the fair and the transformers are presented as little more than advanced machines. For anyone who truly enjoyed the cartoon show and movie, avoid this film."
"graghutthamareddy","10","3","7","3 July 2007"," Wow! Breathtaking CGI and Sound Effects!
","Although I never am a fan of transformers although have seen a few episodes really went in to this movie with high expectations. The movie really delivers what it is meant to be.

The way they portrayed the transformers was really very cool. can't wait to see the sequel which also includes UNICORN.If I am to summarize the movie<br/><br/>The plus points are Shia LaBeof, Good Humour, Sound and CGI The Minus points are Megan Fox, The irritating parents and the way the US Defense s portrayed in this movie"
"griffolyon12","10","3","7","3 July 2007"," Explosions galore!!!
","Wow!Going into this movie I was afraid I would receive yet another disappointing summer blockbuster,and boy was I wrong.<br/><br/>We open with the voice of Optimus Prime describing what the Transformers are saying they are from the distant planet Cybertron,and all was peaceful until one robot known as Megatron wanted the all powerful Allspark(a very powerful and mysterious cube) and his followers(the Decepticons) and his enemies(the Autobots) engaged in a war that eventually destroyed their planet and the Allspark flew into space and landed on Earth.Transformers begins when a mysterious helicopter lands at an American military base in Qatar,and the chopper transforms into a gigantic hulking robot that destroys the base and tries taking top secret military files from the bases main hard drive,but is stopped in the act.Where meanwhile we meet teenager Sam Witwicky(Shia Labeouf) taken to get his first car by his dad,and gets what appears to be an old beat up Camaro(which later turns out to be the robot Bumblebee).Then one night Sam's car is stolen and follows it to find out that it stole itself and see it transform into a gigantic robot as it calls the Autobots(good robots) to Earth.Thus Sam gets caught up in the war between the machines and he later learns that he might even hold the key that can save all of humanity from the evil Decepticons(bad robots).<br/><br/>I have to say I was thoroughly impressed.The movie was good primarily all around,fairly good acting by all(in particular Labeouf),amazing CGI,and pretty good directing(Michael Bay at his best).The best part of the whole movie is the fact that it knew it had an outlandish premise and so it never took itself too seriously,I mean this is by no means a comedy,but it has plenty of laughs to keep the movie light-hearted and fun.<br/><br/>The action was superb,Bay definitely took advantage of this film's budget,and it shows,giving us some of the best action sequences in years.My only complaint with the entire movie was Bay was so close to the action I found it hard to distinguish which robot was fighting which,I wished the camera was pulled a little further back.Still putting this minor gripe aside,the action was top notch and this little gripe didn't detract from my enjoyment in this movie.<br/><br/>This film is the greatest movie I've seen all summer.With more action than any other movie so far this summer.I must say on a final note the CGI in this film deserves at the least an Oscar nod,it was superb.Great top notch entertainment from start to finish.<br/><br/>A well deserved: 10/10!!!!!!"

I have to say that it is, without a doubt, the best film I have seen all summer. The effects were great, the dialog was there. I say poo poo to all of you who said that Optimus paint job change would ruin everything, you were dead wrong. The film does what few films can, it combines action, sci-fi, horror (with Megatron who's with me evil as hell), romance, and comedy. You get all great movie idea rolled into one package. I have to say that everyone stood and cheered and clapped when the film was over, it was cool. There were parts when I almost cried (and I'll admit it I cried when Optimus died in the first movie). It was also by far one of the best film viewing experiences I have ever had. The crowd was pumped and there to be entertained."

I'm not really a huge fan of the transformers, but this movie made me love it!!!... this is definitely worth the 7 bucks people.The storyline is perfect with a beautiful ending... it is also left open for a sequel, which according to the writers will happen, and all the actors got signed for Dreamworks for 2 movies, so the question is not IS? but WHEN? I don't wanna give away much, go see it you will NOT be disappointed I promise you that. Ohh and P.S. to all the fans on this board that are dragging' about the small details like the characters, Megatron not turning into a gun, shut it, because I saw the movie in a screening room FULL of fans and everyone loved it saying it was the best *LIVE ACTION* (don't forget that) adaptation ever!!!

Everything about this movie is pure entertainment, and all out fun! Many criticise Michael Bay for his over the top extravagance when it comes to his movies. Suffice to say, Transformers is not the sort of franchise that would benefit from a softly softly approach to the film. Bay was definitely the best choice to direct, as he has produced some of the most jaw droppingly amazing action sequences ever seen. What struck me the most was the how believable the interaction was between the Transformers and the humans (well, as believable as a 20 metre tall alien robot can be). There is plenty of humour and a pleasing amount of cheesiness present throughout, which makes for an extremely entertaining total package. I can't recommend Transformers highly enough, and have no hesitation in giving it 10/10"

Everything in the plot was well thought out and Michael Bay is a leader in the special effects genre. The Action scenes kept my eyes all over the screen every minute.

With this in mind, the movie is full of witty jokes about the situation. This only ads to the enjoyment of the movie. If you think, ""The Transformers need to be serious!"" Well, if you feel it's too kiddy while you watch it, wait for the ending 45 minutes. You will be happy! <br/><br/>The story line was very good I thought. Simple and to the point. There is plenty more to come! (keep reading).<br/><br/>The CG was AMAZING! I found myself during one scene looking at what I really thought were two huge robots beating the crap out of each other. It looked so REAL! This is what great CG looks like and is where it is going! <br/><br/>I got goose-bumps more than 10 times through out the movie! I wanted to get up and cheer for the Autobots! This is what a great movie is about! From action, adventure, science fiction, comedy, and a great ""we've only just begun"" ending, to the underlying tones of love and friendship, Transformers delivered on all levels!<br/><br/>I am very happy with this movie!!"

","that this would be a great movie. I just walked around the mall and decided to go for for a movie, it was die hard against transformers. Since I have seen enough of baldy Bruce, I thought I would give it a try. Ticket prices in Thailand are as low as 5 USD so I thought, I might just walk out of it if it turns out crap, as I honestly expected. I did not like the cartoon series, so I thought I was a question of minutes until I got annoyed. But hey, the story rocked, and it really had likable characters. The specials were great. I have to say that I liked the young boy/girl (especially Shia LaBeouf who was great) story and the 'good' Transformers, but I did not really like the 'good' or 'bad' army guys story. Sorry Josh Duhamel was a miscast, totally forgettable. Also Tyrese Gibson was nothing special, we know that he can't act. If you take the 'good soldier guys' as side show, yeah, they might not disturb too much. John Turturro was alright, but I liked Jon Voight! as the defence secretary. All in all a very pleasant surprise, I might go see it again tomorrow."

","Transformers is a terrible film. I mean really, really terrible. Worse than I was expecting, and I was expecting very little. Michael Bay should be encased in concrete and buried deep in the Hoover Dam. It is insulting that a studio executive gave this project the go ahead with the script that ends up in the movie. Absolute proof that this movie exists purely to make money, sell toys and cars. No thought has gone into it WHATSOEVER. This script could literally have been written in 5 minutes. By a child. That was stillborn. Credit must go to Shia Leboeuf and Megan Fox for doing their best to disguise the cliché ridden nerd guy/pretty girl romance thing. John Turturro does all he can to keep a straight face while playing a parody of the equally overused ""secret government agency man"". Some of the dialogue given to the Autobots is just embarrassingly bad. I have never before shifted uncomfortably in my seat and felt sorry for a CGI character because of the lines he had to say. That brings me onto the transformers themselves- To look at- they are AWESOME. It is a pity that what will surely come to be regarded as a benchmark in movie visual effects is otherwise so bad. The transformation scenes, especially in close up, are staggering and they do deserve to be seen on a big screen. If you haven't seen it yet- here's my advice- take your ipod- turn it up loud and just enjoy the visuals. The script and story really don't do justice to the effects- so there's no point paying attention to them."
"beronginigo","1","2","4","27 April 2016"," this gave me a headache
","After nine or so years, it's only now that I get to review this live action turkey. To be honest, I wasn't that excited to hear the news of a non-animated version of the Transformers, especially something that was to be shown on the big screen. It's not like I haven't seen giant transforming robots on the big (or small) screen before. For example there's that obscure and forgotten Power Rangers movie back in the 90s or how about the countless super sentai shows in Japan? I just don't think big mecha would translate real well in a live-action setting as they do in the animated format and after seeing Bay's movie, I was proved right all along.<br/><br/>Instead of Hasbro wasting all that money on big name stars and special effects, why not hire a competent Japanese anime director, hire Japanese animators (the studio behind ""Transformers Zone"" is highly recommended)and stick with the aesthetics of the original 1980s animated movie. I guarantee if Hasbro followed what I just suggested here, the spirit of the first two seasons of the 80s Transformers cartoon would be revived for both old fans and new.<br/><br/>Of course, judging from the current decisions of the present Hasbro management, this won't be happening anytime soon because they would rather be trendy and modern. Better to create more shows and movies to keep the hipsters in the populace happy right? It helps them buy more mansions, luxury cars and pay for the trophy wife's boob job. The toy buying sheeple of course would continue supporting Hasbro; they don't want their supply of garbage movies, shows and crap toys to end.<br/><br/>To get back to the live-action film, I don't think it's Bay's fault alone that it turned out to be this great steaming pile of horse dung. I actually like his Bad Boys films so I can't really blame him. I think what is at fault are the people financing the movie. They know the psychology of the demographic they were aiming for. Big dumb movie for big dumb people right? The type of people weaned on a daily helping of American Idol and Master Chef. The kind of people who gush about the Kardashians and listen to the latest insipid Justin Bieber hit. That is what this sorry excuse for a movie was made. For the non-discriminating masses who have simple tastes. They obviously can't tell or discern what makes a movie good or bad.<br/><br/>The designs of the robots were crap to begin with. And what about the transformation sequence? It sucks. None of the witty rearranging of parts like in the cartoon. All you see is a bunch of pixels morphing. And the story was written by people who overdosed on crack cocaine.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is a film for the multiplayer gaming attention deficit disorder crowd. A barometer of modern civilization's decline and decadence."

Sam is just trying to be a typical teenage boy worrying about a car and girls but is wrong. He is involved with the Transformers,a robotic alien race who are at war with each other. These robots come to life with the incredible CG. Every time I watch it I am amazed with how each little part moves and creates either some type of vehicle or the aliens themselves.

","Oh dear oh dear this must be the perfect example of a modern day film and how bad they can be ruined with the dreaded CGI monster. Where to begin! first off using Bay as director was probably the worst decision made when this film was being created, the man can make good action flicks yes but this sci-fi cartoon creation of epic proportions was not meant to be like this. The film is a mess from start to finish with loud noises and visuals that make no sense to the naked eye, yes it all looks very pretty shiny and flashy but you have no idea where the Transformers begin and where they end.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting an amazing plot nor was I expecting an adult based film. Even though the original cartoon was actually quite dark in places and we all knew it would be hard to translate the robots to the big screen, but at the end of the day as an old fan of the original cartoon and toy line I hated how they made the Transformers look in this film.<br/><br/>Only Prime and Bumblebee actually looked visually pleasing as all the other robots were practically indecipherable, a huge maze of shiny moving parts which I couldn't tell if even a head was present! Yes the transformation sequences looked kinda neat but again I had no idea what was moving and where! a complete U-turn from the original cartoon where you could actually see how the robots transformed. I just hate how only Prime looks like the original concepts, I understand they updated the robots but the fact hardly any of them resembled their original designs killed me. For some reason all the Decepticons were very pointy and had spikes...why? also I noticed every vehicle was a US vehicle, a good example of how Bay and Hollywood totally 'transformed' (pun totally intended) this cool franchise into what they wanted. Bumblebee an ugly looking Camaro!? and what the hell did they do to Megatron and Frenzy!.<br/><br/>So apart from the mass of in your face CGI what else is there? what is left if you take away the effects? nothing, the film has nothing else to offer a tall. The acting is bad, B-movie bad, we're talking 'Godzilla' remake bad. John Turturro gave me some smiles but apart from that this is 'Independence Day' acting right here. Plenty of sappy jive talking' and Fox looking like she's made out of plastic with her bright white teeth and ridiculous amounts of orange body tan.<br/><br/>Kids will enjoy this film I'm sure as they have probably not seen the original material, its loud, got lots of plosions and slow motion fighting. I myself cringe at how gaudy and terrible this trash is, the whole human side of the film is totally pointless! the real live actors are completely defunct and could literately be sidelined. Whilst the big robots are all fighting away in an orgy of shiny CGI nuts n bolts we get little snippets of the actors running around driving stuff and trying to look busy or like they're actually of any use. Then out of the blue one soldier manages to shoot and kill a Decepticon easy as pie! (had to do it from jumping off a moving motorbike for some reason). It all leads me to think they should of made a fully CGI animated film like the old 86 movie.<br/><br/>Best thing about the film? they listened to the old school fans and got Cullen back to voice Prime. Unfortunately when Prime says 'sorry my bad' I had to put my face in my hands, yep they got Prime talking' like a hoodie. No...quite simply no, blow me back to the 80's please!<br/><br/>1/10"
"spambox-548-5909","1","2","4","6 October 2009"," Incredibly Atrocious
","I won't go into great detail as to why this movie is so bad, many others have done so before me.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the original cartoon series, you'll be extremely disappointed. Some parts of the original story hold, others are missing, misinterpreted, or mistaken. The entire movie (I believe it's over 120 minutes) has less storyline than a single episode of the original series (around 20 minutes).<br/><br/>Glaring inconsistencies in the film include:<br/><br/>1) The main character kicks an 18 inch tall metal robot spider roughly 100 yards.<br/><br/>2) (I believe, didn't bother rewinding) Megatron refers to Starscream as Starspite, with a quote somewhere along the lines of ""Starspite, you fail me again"". Keeping in mind, 'Starspite' was created through some weird remote electronic process only 10 minutes prior in the film, and hadn't at that point played any part.<br/><br/>3) Optimus Prime has trouble doing anything but crush everything underfoot, yet has the finesse to pick up a pair of glasses between thumb and forefinger.<br/><br/>4) Said glasses lens width measure the thickness of OP's finger, making a human head rough the size of a tennis ball for OP's hand. Yet later in the film, OP holds a human in his hand, with legs and head just falling outside of his grip.<br/><br/>5) OP gets hurled into an office building full of humans, and plunges a whole 1-2 yards into the building. We're talking about 30-40 tonnes of metal flying at 40-70 miles per hour. I work in emergency services - this prospect is beyond ridiculous.<br/><br/>I'd like to congratulate Michael Bay on putting another nail not only in his coffin, but also the coffins of Jon Voight, Anthony Anderson (why oh why AA did you take this on), and John Turturro, whose script seems to have been written more for Steve Carrell."
"richardmnorton","4","2","4","25 June 2009"," Huge disappointment
","I'm a fan of the Tranformers cartoon and I have to say that the movie wasn't very good at all. The fight scenes were, honestly, the worst I have ever seen. It was a just a huge mess where no one could really tell what happened. When you have to wait for the movie to come out on DVD and then stop and watch it in slow motion to actually see what happened, that is totally unacceptable. The story was not very well thought out or executed either. This movie was another classic case of the best parts of the movie were in the trailers to lure people in. Megan Fox was probably the biggest reason this movie didn't totally tank at the box office. All the fanboys couldn't get enough of her."

","The Good- LOVED Optimus. Peter Cullen's voice gets me every time. Had good-fortune of meeting him at BotCon '97. Lovely fellow. Bumblebee cute, but different, a grown-up kick-a$$ Bumblebee...thumping the VDub was rude. Sam rubbing the dust from the Autobot symbol...Ooo. Cool how the dam looked like Sherman Dam...Ahh happy 80's memories. Starscream's entrance, awesome (poor Bumbles) The vending machine dude, cool. Coke kills... Loved the different storyline, (But not how Cybertron was destroyed & didn't look good) Liked it better than TFTM-It didn't kill everyone we loved. Hey we know Megatron's coming back. Loved the sound score. The effects, awesome, action spectacular. As much as I love Golden Compass, TF's effects were superior. Borne getting the sound Oscars? This'll teach Bay to omit Soundwave.<br/><br/>The Bad: 1) What stupid tool goes to see Transformers for humans? I liked Sam, SoldierBoy, Michaela... Hated the Hackers, Sam's muggle parents & creepy Sector7? Scenes could've been woven in for more screen time for the REAL starts of Transformers. Sam/Michaela should be Spike/Carly (Michaela's the girl form of Michael. Bay even messes the humans.) Or call the hacker Carly, wearing original blue suit. I'm Australian, but her accent was wrong for the film. I'm glad TF was filmed here. We got it before the US. (They should've digitally erased the Harbor Bridge in the background though...) Spoiled viewing pleasure. Great posters spoiled by 'Their War. Our World.' Again - We go to see Transformers for the Robots. If we wanted to see humans we'd go to the shopping mall.<br/><br/>2) The Decepticons! No, they're not the bad-where oh where were Soundwave, Thundercracker & Skywarp? This was SUPPOSED to be a G1 movie!! If Bay watched the series, he'd've seen names, colour schemes & heard the voices. None of his other G1 named characters were G1. Some voices sounded disjointed like a Terminator rip off.<br/><br/>The Ugly: 1) Megatron! Don't blast me! I care not Bay wanting a new look, (the fact that Megs sounded different oddly worked) Hugo did a wicked job. ""You failed me yet again, Starscream..."" Ooo shivers. Ahh the good 'ol days, back on Cybertron...Megs was cool, but a version of Megatron, not the REAL one. If the Wizards at ILM wave magic wands, say ""Feraverto,"" transforming 1984 Optimus into new Optimus, there's NO reason they can't for Megatron. I've heard arguments of Frank Welker's voice not being right. WTF?! Is this TF or Bay's ego trip?! I heat They asked Frank to phone lines in. He didn't get a studio appearance--clearer & with decent voice changing equipment there would've been no problem. Sigh...takes a fan to think of these things.<br/><br/>2) Optimus Prime's mouth-plate down...Planet of the Apes look did FA. ""Good Grief!"" A bizarre tribute to Optimus Primal? That's just Prime!...Not!<br/><br/>3) If Starscream saw it, he'd up-chuck his Energon. His robot mode looked like a friggin' ape. Jet mode cool, (though I adore the original F-15) I hope his ""I live to serve you, Lord Megatron,"" was sarcasm. If not, Bay, you've a lot to learn.<br/><br/>Ratchet's eyesore colour scheme...There's Ratchet & Starscream toys in movie & G1 colours, another Bay money scheme. Not happy, Jazz! (An Aussie joke) The robots had expressive faces & voices in the original. I realise some VO actors have crossed over, bless them. At least Bay could've made the new actors emulate the characters close to the original. Fans can do better. No offence, Charles Adler, great G1 Silverbolt, but they could have made him do Starscream more G1. The battle scene? I'm wondering who the slag's who. Very embarrassing-- hence Bay, a lesson here--COLOUR SCHEMES!! Maybe he's colour blind? <br/><br/>Optimus, Bumblebee & Jazz- correct coloring. Jazz, spiffy mode, miss the Porsche but Pontiac Solstice cool! But he sounded terrible. Ironhide looked like a gorilla & the voice of one to match. Did Bay write TF after watching King Kong while roaring drunk? Now all's said and done, I loved having a new TF movie, seeing people TF mad, playing with toys, wearing the clothes like the 80's. I hear the next one's to have more robots, including Soundwave. Barricade?? Not even remotely G1. AT least Bay's taken the hint putting Arcee in, realised there be girl fans, did you? What of Elita One & Thundercracker!? Movie style toys of them exist, why no presence? At least Thunder has the right colours, but hulking robot mode leaves a lot to be desired. The Seekers were slender in the original series. Perhaps by TF3, Bay'll realise he's making TRANSFORMERS, established characters and fanbase. If he wants to do robot movies, fine, but if you make Transformers, you make Transformers.<br/><br/>As much as I've panned, it had its cool, funny moments and a great atmosphere. Prime was firm, but gentle, but kick-ass, just like the old days. I liked the way he treated Sector7 like obnoxious kids. Calling Megatron ""Brother"" made me cry...I knew it was Megatron who would fall. (Without spoilers/ reviews) Optimus' ending quote was inspirational. *Hugs Optimus.* Go away, Bay. I'm not hugging you...Well if you do Megatron, Soundwave & Starscream right & put Thunder in. It was great how Starscream escaped at the end. Optimus saved the Universe & didn't die. That's a first...so I don't completely hate you, Michael;) Prime saved a piece of the All Spark, interested how this will fare & hope Jazz'll be fixed. You can't kill the tooth fairy! Let's hope there be better voices, colour in the next & that Soundwave looks & sounds right or I'll go ape...<br/><br/>*Jinn Holds up scorecard* Peter as Optimus, a TF revival, visuals & action- 10. Too many humans...minus 3 ...Voices/colours wrong minus another 4.<br/><br/>As for girl fans, one argued Sam was cuter, the other SoldierBoy. They asked me who I thought was best looking. And I told them... Optimus!"

","Enough said, because those are the four things this futuristic movie relied upon. Action-filled scenes, Direction, visuals and LaBeouf. Michael Bay, after a box office success with Bad boys 2, makes a comeback with Transformers, a film based on the popular animated series. And let me just say I got what I was looking for, a simple film filled with a bad guy loses good guy wins scenario, and a film filled with heavy special effects. Michael bay directed the film to his best. And one constituent that rose above the rest was LaBeouf's tremendous performance. The Even Stevens star gives a top-notch performance filled with huge laughter, energy and the usual a teenage boy has a crush on a girl story. But above all lies the consistent and exhilarating action in the film along with the personification of the alien robots and the stunning visuals, that had me longing for more."

","I always thought Transformers seemed like one of those franchises that wouldn't transfer well onto film. This actually transfered pretty well. By no means is it perfect, some names have actually been changed, and some of the Transformers' alternate forms have been changed, (most likely for legal and copyright reasons). Those minor changes don't really harm the film at all.<br/><br/>The Special Effects is what makes this movie a great action film, you are aware that these are giant robots, so you know it's special effects, but they move so fluidly and blend into the real-life setting in which they've been placed, that it's hard to not forget that they aren't real. I do wish that they made the Transformers a little more character, you get that there are GOOD and EVIL but you basically only get that because you're told who's evil or good. The film relies on the Human's perspective of the situation, not really the Transformers. Some more character development for both the Decepticons and Autobots would have made this movie A lot better. I do realize that sounds weird, but the movie is called Transformers for a reason.<br/><br/>This is Mr. Bay's best film in my books.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"
"barhound78","6","2","4","28 July 2007"," Good and Bad but never Ugly
","Transformers, for me, is a film that veers somewhere between the absolutely spectacular and the cringe-worthy, the predictable and the plain bad.<br/><br/>First of all, the good things. Transformers, in all likelihood, contains the best action sequences that you will see all year. They are as bold and exciting and as crazy as anything in Michael Bay's career. The opening assault on the desert base is fantastic and the final forty five minutes that takes the action from the Hoover dam to the very heart of the city is sustained on pure adrenalin. <br/><br/>Alongside this, if it doesn't pick up awards for its effects come Oscar season it will be a crime. There's a fantastic sequence in which Optimus Prime transforms before our very eyes in near slow-motion and we get to see every piston and bolt and panel twisting into shape. For that alone it's breathtaking. Similarly, the Transformers are as real and believable as King Kong was eighteen months. If Peter Jackson was rightly lauded for breathing such humanity into a giant living breathing ape, then Bay should be afforded even greater credit for the enthusing his giant robots with such lifelike traits and dignity. My only complaint would be the lack of Megatron until the final thirty minutes! <br/><br/>As well as this, there is a performance that stands out as well. Although much attention has been drawn to Shia LeBeof (who I shall reluctantly come to later), the real standout, for me, came from Josh Duhamel. Admittedly he didn't have his limits stretched in the role of Captain Lennox but what he did have to do he did extremely well. Perhaps the biggest compliment that I can pay him is to say that he reminded me of a Terminator/Aliens era Michael Biehn. A piece of casting that Bay no doubt intended but, nonetheless, Duhamel pulled it off charismatic aplomb. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, there is little more positive that I have to say. For whilst I thoroughly enjoyed Tranformers whilst Bay was doing what he does best, the whole film is let down by a lacklustre script, weak two-dimensional characters, cringe-worthy attempts at humour and a crushing level of predictability. <br/><br/>We've simply seen Transformers so many times before. I mentioned Aliens and The Terminator earlier on but this movie stomps on narrative territories that have been de rigeur in modern blockbusters since Independence Day. That is not to say that Bay has ripped anything off but simply that there is very little original here. Multiple narratives that pull together to include geeky boys, attractive and seemingly unattainable objects of affection, computer experts who are ignored, US military overwhelmed by higher civilisations (apart from a single hardcore special ops unit of course) and shady Government organisations kept secret from even the highest ranking politicians. Transformers is a positive melting pot of modern blockbuster clichés. <br/><br/>Duhamel aside, the casting doesn't particularly help either. Megan Fox simply seems to be included to satisfy the audiences objectification needs, the heavyweight Jon Voight simply coasts his way to another paycheck and Bay shoehorns in every single African-American stereotype into the roles occupied by Tyrese Gibson, Anthony Anderson and Bernie Mac. Whilst it is always a pleasure to see John Turturro on screen, you could practically see his tongue protruding from his cheek in almost every single scene! As for Shia LeBeof, I am mystified how his star is rising so quickly in Hollywood. I'm all for studio's moving away from the bland leading clones of the early 00's but he's like the terrifying result of genetic experiments of Corey Feldman's pickled liver. An irritating smart-ass who here appears to be regurgitating his performance in Constantine. <br/><br/>Which leads nicely to the films biggest problems. The script. Oh dear. Right from the offset the script hums with a mixture of cheese and sleaze. If I were a cynical man, I'd argue that half of the reason that the action is so effective is simply because we have been aching for Bay to show some mercy and shut the characters up! LeBeouf and Anderson are prominent offenders but the characters of Ron and Judy Witwicky are by far the most grating. Intended as comic relief no doubt but ultimately an embarrassing instrument of torture. Like the Levensteins dumbed down and living under the Witness Protection Scheme. One can only presume that any sequel will have Alyson Hannigan returning from band camp to win Sam back from Mikaela! <br/><br/>Indeed, it's the moments in which Bay is trying to be self-consciously funny that really grate. There are some humorous exchanges that genuinely do work (""I'm gonna count to five""... ""I'm gonna count to three"") but when Bay steps out of his comfort zone the results often induce uncomfortable seat-squirming. The extended sequence in which the Autobots ""hide out"" in the Witwicky's back garden is the case in point. Heavy-handed, laboured and below even cartoonish. Transformers is, unfortunately, riven with such moments. <br/><br/>I left the cinema last night with the same mixture of satisfaction and disappointment that I felt when I watched King Kong. There is a lot to enjoy about Transformers and if you are looking for big, dumb fun then this film ticks all the boxes. However, be warned, there is a lot of dumb, not-so-fun, small talk to wade through too."

","I went into Transformers expecting to see a childhood memory butchered into a mass appeal CGI fest. I was pleasantly surprised that this was not so, and the movie had me well entertained almost the entire way through. The cast was good and likable, even though the script had some seriously dodgy dialog in places it did the job, and the Tranformer effects and character designs themselves were well realized.<br/><br/>The main problem I had with the movie was the way the Transformers were treated as side characters to the human cast. The characters I remember were reduced to mere CGI set pieces with little personality, and most only have a few lines of dialog and are only introduced briefly towards the middle of the film.<br/><br/>I also am not particularly a fan of the way Michael Bay directed the more hectic action scenes, with the camera shaking all over the place. I know some prefer it, but I personally did not, and thought it took away from the incredible CGI.<br/><br/>Overall, a good, but not great movie which could have done with some more Tranformer screen time and character development."

","Transformers delivers what its supposed to ..... for a transforming robots movie. However, as an official Transformers movie, I find it way below potential. The transformation animation was excellent, though the camera was too close to the action to see it clearly in many scenes. i would also have preferred them to look a little less spiky and just a tad more like the original design of the 80s. It was most excellent to see the autobots together and the various homages to old school material was done well (transforming noises, catch phrases, the dam scene from the cartoon pilot). The dialogue was typical summer fare which seemed dumbed down in many places and a few scenes were just plain ludicrous. A side note for the director, if you have to have more human time because of budget, please make those scenes more believable than the invading alien robots that transform scenes. It has the love story thrown in but was done halfway decent with just a few 'groan inducing' moments. I overall enjoyed the movie though it could have been better, much better, epic even but then again it could have been worse. There was too much needless sexual innuendo for my taste throughout imo. Its as if transforming robots who want to completely destroy each other isn't enough to keep the attention of the audience?! My biggest beef with the movie is the same with most movies in that too much time was given to the humans rather than to the robots or aliens, etc. As the movie progresses, not enough time was given to learn the robots personality (Starscream and Megatron for example). I do think it captures some of the cartoon feel yet it is still squashed by too much human time.

"c_knewt","7","2","4","5 July 2007"," Disappointed G1 fan...fun blockbuster w/poor focus
","Like many people I grew up with the G1 Transformers and went in knowing that this movie was going to be different than the cartoon that I knew and loved as a kid. I wanted this movie to stand as original yet keep the elements that made the cartoon so special. Getting to know the personalities of each robot was what made the cartoon so endearing. Humans were the supporting cast. I know that it was a tall task to personalize each robot within 2 1/2 hours yet I believe that it could have been accomplished if the focus of the film were truly through a Transformer's perspective and not through Sam Witwicky's eyes. The time that was spent showing off Megan Fox's body (and all of the sexually driven teen-age humor) could have been used to build affection for the fun-loving Jazz (who was my favorite character back in the 80's.) I should have been able to feel some emotion from his death yet I was never given a chance to know who he was... very anti-climactic.<br/><br/>All-in-all the movie allowed me to feel what it would be like if Transformers were in our world today. It did make for a solid July 4th weekend summer blockbuster. I did enjoy the brief glimpse into the personalities of the Autobots (especially Iron Hide) yet left the theater feeling that I wanted to learn more about them individually. Disappointment in the movie compelled me to throw in a couple episodes from my season 2 DVD collection of the Transformers it actually helped. Maybe the makers of the next movie will get it right (I'm still hoping to see the classic match-up between the Dinobots and Devastator!) Too much human and not enough robot perspective... which is supposed to be what the Transformers are all about... at least based on what I remember.<br/><br/>Overall Grade: C+ Story: C Acting: C- Direction: C Visuals: A"

","Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay team up for the exciting and action packed blockbuster Transformers. Earth becomes caught up in a war between two groups of alien robots that have come in search of a device that gave life to their planet. That cast includes Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox, John Turturro, and Jon Voight, who all bring a certain charisma to the film. But the real stars of the film are the special effects, which are amazing. And Michael Bay does an excellent job at delivering high energy action sequences that are visually stunning. The writing is exceptionally poor and the film goes on for far too long, but the action and the visual effects keep the audience engaged. Transformers is messy and cheesy, and sophomoric...but it's also a lot of fun and immensely entertaining."

","Known for directing some of the greatest classics such as The Bad Boys (1995), A Rocha (1996), Armageddon (1998), Pearl Harbor (2001) and A Ilha (2005), Michael Bay started here the franchise from which he would sediment once and for all name as one of the great directors of action cinema bringing the fictional alien robots from a popular Hasbro franchise, capable of transforming their bodies into innocuous objects like vehicles, to the cinema screens and still counting on the production of Dreamworks by Steven Spielberg. Director Michael Bay, in charge of the direction, was another who did not believe in the potential of the project, but was convinced by Spielberg's vision. This is not a robot film, it is a film of a young man and his first car - inadvertently involved in the middle of a space invasion.<br/><br/>For years the Autobots and the Decepticons, two robotic alien races, fought in Cybertron, their home planet. This war caused the planet to be destroyed, resulting in the robots spreading throughout the universe. Megatron (Hugo Weaving), the leader of the Decepticons, comes to Earth in search of Allspark, a Cybertron cube that allows any electronic device to be transformed into a robot with its own intelligence. Megatron finds Allspark, but is frozen in the Arctic. Decades later, other Decepticons arrive on Earth, in an attempt to find Allspark. Its emergence soon alerts the main countries, in particular the United States, which has an attacked military base in Qatar. While Defense Secretary John Keller (Jon Voight) tries to find out what's going on, gathering all possible strength and information, young Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) has simpler concerns: getting a good grade in school, which will guarantee him Your first car. But what he did not expect was that the chosen vehicle, an old Camaro, had a life of its own.<br/><br/>But anyone who thinks ""Transformers"" is just nonstop action is wrong. The great merit in the script by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman is to perfectly blend the comedy in the midst of the action and a main cast that is the soul of the film. It is not easy to act in front of a green screen that will be replaced later by robots ten meters high in practically all the action scenes of the film, but the cast does very well, especially Shia LaBeouf, who plays the main character, Sam Witwicky . The actor ""reacts"" to nothing like nobody before him. The young man screams, feels fear, feels sympathy, runs and interacts with the absent robots with total surrender. Were it not for him, the film would lose half its strength. Not only in the scenes with the robots, but also when interacting with his parents, with Mikaela and even with the military, the actor is the great highlight of the production in his lines and reactions of enormous naturalness.<br/><br/>Despite some cinematographic habits worthy of a wedding photo album - can anyone take one more backlit kiss, sunset in the background, in life? - Bay hates blue screens so fashionable in Hollywood. And he hates studio settings even more. His business is to go out on the street with his team, blow up real things - and this predilection for realistic pyrotechnics is a decisive element in the success of ""Transformers"". The beating and chase scenes are extremely exciting, with the right camera in hand - war movie style - and interspersed with absolutely hilarious moments.<br/><br/>The comic part is present at all times. The action and comedic moments go hand in hand and support the entire script. The scene of the robots hiding in the garden, while Sam's parents discuss what he was doing locked in the room, is pure Spielberg. And the scene only improves with the knowledge that all the dialogues there were improvised by the trio of actors. We also have the hilarious Kevin Dunn and Julie White as Sam's parents in several scenes, which in addition to the already commented scene in the bedroom, we have the garden scene in the house, the car purchase scene and even in a post-credit scene with double. To top it off, we still have Bernie Mac, as car salesman Bobby Bolivia and Anthony Anderson, as a super-hacker, putting on a show - the impression (probably correct) is that all the scenes in which he appears are improvised. There is even a hilarious reference to ""Armageddon"" - also directed by Bay - when the Autobots start arriving on Earth.
Another source of laughter is the United States government itself, something very curious, considering that the production had immense support from the country's Armed Forces. George W. Bush and his administration have once again become a joke on more than one occasion - and even lead to acid criticism when the United States mobilizes against North Korea and China before even knowing whether the attack came from them or otherwise. source. But the military should not be too concerned, after all, soldiers receive that glamor that only Michael Bay can give - slow motion cameras, silhouettes carrying weapons in the distance, emotional acts of courage, etc. Everything that works undeniably like military propaganda. Among the most hilarious are those in which the military is being attacked by a Decepticon in the middle of the desert in a real war climate while Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson) try to contact the Pentagon and are delayed by bureaucracy by, apparently Indian, in a call center unrelated to the emergency situation that happened on the other end of the line. Even Defense Secretary John Keller (Jon Voight) takes part in some comedy scenes amid suspicions of an attack by some other American enemy and John Turturro (Agent Simmons), responsible for the government's top secret Sector 7, surprising other good guys moments.<br/><br/>But who cares about the military, when we have Optimus Prime and Megatron pulling the screws on the big screen? The robots are absolutely sensational, winning thousands of moving parts at the hands of George Lucas' ILM team. As a result, some fans wrinkled their noses, complaining that they look little like their lively counterparts. Nonsense. The result borders on the shocking, with robots changing shape in mid-flight to attack opponents, or even semi-transformed, razing a motorway in mind-boggling pursuits. The level of realism of the robots is practically perfect. We can feel the weight and size of their ""bodies"" when they walk or when they are in combat helped by the fantastic editing and mixing of sounds indicated to Oscar for the work. As if it were not enough to feel the clash of robots as if we were in the middle of battle, the metallic and electronic sounds in communion with the actions of the robots are magnificent.<br/><br/>In addition to all this, we have the electrifying soundtrack of Steve Jablonsky (The Island, The Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning) that knows how to increase, decrease, leaving only the sounds of the fighting machines, becoming more urgent or epic depending on the situation. The musical soundtrack including ""What I've Done"" by Linkin Park, ""Before It's Too Late"" by Goo Goo Dolls, ""Doomsday Clock"" by Smashing Pumpkins among others make up the vibrant soundtrack, especially when they were the medium of communication of Bumblebee with humans.<br/><br/>While credible characters are hard to come by in ""Transformers"", the effects are staggering and the action is thrilling. And for fans, the writers have reserved numerous surprises, such as classic phrases and hidden clues. Overall, Michael Bay never seems to have had as much fun this time. Unlike other projects where humor is present on a much smaller scale, here the element is essential for us to embark on such a fanciful story and the end result could not be better, having been one of the best adventures of its launch year. Of course, the ending is open, setting the stage for future continuations of one of the most profitable and fun franchises in recent years."

"bowmanblue","6","0","0","7 April 2019"," Guess the saga isn't for me (any more)
","I suppose in order to review the live action film of the 1980s cartoon/toys 'Transformers' (2007) I have to confess that I spent much of the eighties playing with the robots and generally gobbling up everything with an Autobot logo on it. If someone had released this film back then I would probably give it the highest rating possible. Sadly, I'm way too old, jaded and wrapped in the nostalgia of the Saturday morning cartoon I knew and loved.<br/><br/>If you don't know anything about the series (and I can't believe anyone could NOT know who Optimus Prime and Megatron are, but that's just me!), it - loosely - follows various narratives made popular in cartoon, comic and then computer-generated TV series and then blends them all together. But that's okay. They get the basics right - a group of good robots (who can change their appearance into Earth-based vehicles) arrive on our planet, but are quickly drawn back into their endless war with their evil counterparts, the Decepticons.<br/><br/>I never saw this film in the cinema and I'm glad. This is down to my unique way of watching my DVD copy. I will explain. The film is well over two hours long and, for the first hour, you basically don't actually see one of the titular robots. Instead, we're treated to a teen-love story which utilises every cliche in the genre. A nerd (Shia LaBeouf) falls for the hot chick (Megan Fox) and has to impress her despite the best efforts of the jock (who I don't know the name of). In short... I don't give a damn about any of these characters. Controversially, I watch a film called 'Transformers' to see Transformers. Therefore, viewing this film on DVD allows me to skip every scene which centres on the annoying and pointless flesh-bags.<br/><br/>Now, you may be expecting me to start saying how by ignoring the humans and concentrating on the robots make the film better. And it does. Sort of. Again, I'm trying to watch the film through the eyes of kids today and I can see them loving the robots in the exact same way as I did with those in the cartoons. For me, who's love of the franchise comes from the eighties (we call this 'G1' i.e. 'Generation 1') I wanted to see the robots look how I remember them. The Autobot leader 'Optimus Prime' is awesome. Fortunately the producers listened to fans and employed voice actor Peter Cullen to give him his personality - and it's by far the best part of the film. Even I could tell who Optimus Prime was because he basically looked how I remembered him. Sadly, the others didn't. A couple of Decepticons were okay (Starscream), but even Megatron was completely underused (he's the film's antagonist and yet only came into the story in the final act).<br/><br/>If I was given a free reign to make a Transformers movie, yes I'd base it on the eighties look, feel and story. Sadly, Michael Bay had other ideas and the robots are hard to tell apart (Optimus Prime and Bunblebee excluded) when they're standing still. When they fight, whatever epic battle scene that should be before us is akin to smashing two grey jagged lumps of metal together repeatedly while Megan Fox poses provocatively.<br/><br/>Basically, kids who have no prior knowledge of the franchise will probably love this. For 'oldies' like me, I just watch it for Optimus Prime - who is by far the true star. I just wish he was in it more. I've never felt so ashamed to be human!"

","7 July 2007. Overall, this movie is a bit of puzzle, and the lack of clear consistent directing is evident from what appears to be a script that seems to have been written by several different writers with different ideas as to what this movie should have been about. While most of the production values and cinematic photographic and sound effects are powerful and compelling, they can't make up for the apparent collapse of the movie midway in where what appeared to a be a fairly serious Carpenter's remake of ""The Thing"" (instead of living beings turning into monsters we have here things turning into monsters - almost as scary), the movie transforms partway into a more dumbed down version of juvenile lightness and then back to seriousness. There are the obvious emotional buttons pushed where a little girl is faced with a big bad monster, we have a little monster that is both cute and wicked like a ""Gremlin."" There are several logical gaps and unbelievable lapses in reasonable belief that distract from the movie. In total, this movie could have been a lot better, one of the best of the year (quite notable for this genre), but instead we are held to a collage of different subplots and sometimes add up to confusion and a dizzying array of special effects that take away from the solid underlying theme of the movie.

Shia LaBeouf's Sam Witwicky is always nervous, always sweating, always making excuses for himself. Megan Fox is there as the eye candy love interest and of course we have your typical military types, comedy relief types, and government agent types.

There are other Transformers movies which have followed, but this one is clearly the best one of the lot - at least that's what I think. As a fan of Transformers, I enjoyed this movie so much especially when you first see it. To be honest, before I first saw it, I wasn't expecting Transformers to be all that good, but I was wrong because it was. In fact, I was actually surprised. Transformers was serious as well as entertaining - you just know! I just liked the connection between the Autobots and Decepticons in the entire movie. If it wasn't, the movie would've failed to live up to expectations because of the intense rivalry between the two factions. It was a battle between the Autobots and Decepticons. This is what this movie throughout it's duration depicts. Megatron and Starscream were scary as well as menacing. It looked like they meant serious business, and that's what I enjoyed the most about Transformers. The movie gets you engaged right the way throughout. I'm a fan of Transformers, and enjoyed watching the animated series especially those involving the Beast Wars - I remember that very well appearing on television, and enjoyed every minute of it.

","The level of anticipation I had as a kid for Michael Bay's first live action Transformers movie is yet to be rivaled. Ever since the first trailer dropped, the first poster, the first images, all that went through my little head was a feeling of wondrous excitement ""it just looks sooo real"". By the time the film came out, you bet whatever you want that I went to see it immediately. Coming out of it, I thought I'd just experienced the best film ever made, no joking. Oh, the times. <br/><br/>Over time, the way we regard and evaluate summer blockbusters has evolved. We started to get more critical, and with the subsequent boom of the online community, it was easier for us to manifest our likes and dislikes with each film through various debates and exchanges with other film buffs. Critics' opinions also became more popular. All of these changes were for the best, as suddenly we started to get higher quality pictures that delighted, wowed, and enchanted moviegoers in far more ways than just cinematic escapism.<br/><br/>Transformers was a product of a far simpler time. By the time it came out, audiences only cared about the action, the spectacle, the visual splendor of it all. People never experienced such levels of high octane action and explosive set pieces before, and Michael Bay sure had a hit in his hands. The visual effects were revolutionary for the time (and still hold up after a decade), the soundtrack by Linkin Park was, and still is, iconic, and even though the story itself was convoluted, the acting ranging from alright to downright cheesy, and the product placement being everything-but-subtle, it was all forgiven because of the undeniable and irresistible sense of fun the movie had to offer. Seeing fan favorite characters like Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ratchet, Ironhide, Megatron, Starscream, among others, engage in battle while buildings are being destroyed, and the ground cracking wide open with explosions, was a novelty, and a dream come true for fans of the original animated series. <br/><br/>Michael Bay has a very skilled eye when it comes to visuals, and this movie is a prime example of that. Every time a Transformer appears on screen, it feels grandiose, cinematography is breathtaking and feels involving, soundtrack, as already stated, is iconic and even the musical score was outstanding. However, when judging in terms of storytelling, editing, and narrative flow, the film shows its true fallacies. The amount of subplots is unnecessarily big. We have Sam dealing with college, him trying to impress Mickeyla, the Autobot vs Decepticon war, the Cube, the government conspiracies, the hackers.. there's a lot to cover, and thus the film comes off as sloppy. <br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf is fine, Megan Fox may not be a ""good"" actress, but she's far better here than she is in most recent productions she starred in (TMNT). John Turturro is hit or miss as the comic relief character, and the least said about Sam's parents the better. The real standouts are the voice acting talents, most notably Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime. His voice is now a trademark of the character, that's how good he is. <br/><br/>""Transformers"" is a good example of pure cinematic escapism done properly. The film may not be perfect, with some average acting, product-placement galore, and over complicated narrative threads, but it is all compensated by the film's sense of wonder. The movie knows its dumb, and isn't ashamed in celebrating how dumb it is. The result? An entertainingly dumb summer blockbuster that knows how to have fun. If the film is able to embrace its cheesiness and deliver some glorious spectacle along the way, why should I be ashamed to admit I love the film (flaws and all)?"

","Transformers is brought by the director Michael Bay. He is well known for Bad Boys, The Rock This film tends to lead to a direction of mindlessly entertainment and enjoyment. As we've come to expect, robot's destructions and combats, we do get these aspects in veritable satisfaction. Michael Bay is well known for chaotic, blotchy destruction that gets convoluted or diverting. Either way, this film embraces these that makes the yet the best Transformers film out of the series.<br/><br/>Transformers follows a young teenage boy who wants to buy his first car ever. Meanwhile, a conflict between the Autobots and the Decepticons intensify as they strive to retrieve 'The Cube' that can transform any material into a biological metal being. Sam (Shia LaBeouf) perchance buys a car that tends to be a transformer as he gets yanked into a situation that can redeem the human race with his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox). As the plot is simple enough, it is equitable for this type of film. Audiences do not bother about the plot being splendidly the prime. Most of the audiences crave great and astonishing robot actions. We fulfill these aspects from the film. Evenly, the visuals are marvelous. The CGI is flawless as it is the fundamental requirement and it looks precisely realistic. The sound is spotlessly well crafted. There is a gracious finish to the sound as the immaculately designed cars transform into frantic robots. However, the characters are very poorly scripted and executed. They are notably unrealistic and sometimes facedly annoying. Although frenetic robot actions are stunning and frigid to look at, flat characters still bother the film to a negative sideward. Shia LaBeouf is surprisingly tolerable as the teenage boy who is mentally junior. Megan Fox is usual, she is adequate but faulty at some acting. The acting is just adequate or exceptional in terms of big action flicks like this. <br/><br/>Overall, Transformers is the film you may or may not have expected the outcome to be. It may entertain you or find the movie to be boring and disappointing. In my opinion, I was still entertained through all the years and gave chances for the sequels to be superior enough. As fans have said, 'Michael Bay, you still suck but we still love you.'<br/><br/>Grade: B"

A few critics complain about Megan Fox, I do not, I think she and the rest are what they need to be; entertainment! <br/><br/>One of the most entertaining movies of all time, but as a movie and if you look at what is actually going on, well then the score drops considerably. Entertainment-wise is a 9, as a movie a 4, so I put this on an 7. The following movies drop lower and few are pure crap, but this is very good and feels decently well connected to the original comic. <br/><br/>If you do not like being entertained without any substance, this is probably not for you, for the rest; this is a must see."

So I watched the movie and it was good in imax like watching the autobot for the freaking first time but it was kind of long like I understand some people liked the film I enjoy it watch it but I recommended you watching it it is worth watching but it's not the best one in the series.

","Seven years since this was released and we've had a decent sequel and an even better third movie, yet looking back at the first Transformers not a lot has changed and that's for the better. Bay is sticking to his big scale action and use of jaw dropping visuals, ignoring the critics and pretty much saying kiss my ass and good for him, Bay has fun and so do I with his movies.<br/><br/>The special effects created by Industrial Light And Magic are undeniably some of the best I've ever seen, no one can say they suck because they are genuinely groundbreaking, watching these vehicles turn into enormous talking robots sounds cheesy in words but seeing it unfold is breathtaking. When Sam Witwicky unknowingly buys a car that is actually the Transformer Bumblebee, he becomes entangled in a plot that could destroy life on Earth, but when Optimus Prime and fellow Autobots arrive on Earth looking for The Cube, they realise Sam has the key to it's location. <br/><br/>Shia Labeouf is very funny as this rather dumb teenage character, he does tend to sulk and moan a lot but he's still likable, however during the city based finale he springs into instant action guy managing to avoid robot destruction that even for me who ignores logic I found this part unrealistic yet entertaining. Michael Bay's camera-work is a dream, technically sound and huge in scale Transformers is larger than life science fiction storytelling. The action scenes are a marvel, the scorpion desert attack is my favourite, the moment the alien leaps out the sand whilst army guys run in terror in slow motion my jaw dropped and from then on it's literally an onslaught of gunfire and the odd bit of humour thrown in. You could argue that the story could've solely been focused on the military characters, as they would be more believable in conflict instead of Sam Witwicky but Bay settled on Sam and that's where the human side of the story comes in. Thrown into this monster of a movie is the stunning Megan Fox who plays Sam's love interest Mikaela, a beauty with brains who can fix up cars, Fox' first big movie role and she's brilliant, she doesn't fall beneath the scale and brings humour and grit to her character. Transformers is a must watch movie, turn up the speakers, grab a drink and prepare to be immersed."
"Joxerlives","6","0","0","1 July 2014"," The perfect film for 15 year olds of all generations
","As a kid I never actually collected the Transformer's toys or watched the cartoon show (always enjoyed a lie-in on Saturday morning and we didn't have a video recorder yet). I did stumble across the comics and was hugely impressed with them, fortunate enough to enjoy the British versions which are commonly accepted to be far superior to their American counterparts. Now people of my age-group are the makers and shakers in Hollywood so we're getting films/TV shows based on the culture of the 1980s, both the good (GI Joe aka Action Force/Battlestar Galactica), the bad (The A-Team/Miami Vice, shudder!) and the mediocre (Knightrider TV series/Tron). I'm sure Automan, Manimal, Cover Up and the Care Bears are not far behind. The moment I saw that car ad where it transforms into a dancing robot I knew it was inevitable.<br/><br/>So the good? The robots themselves are just terrific, couldn't ask for better, watching them interact realistically with humans is mind blowing. The speed, ferocity and sheer destructiveness of their combat takes your breath away, the opening attack on the US military base just stunning, you instinctively think nothing short of a tactical nuclear weapon could stop Blackout. Megan Fox is drop dead gorgeous if a little plastic and I would call the shameless exploitation of her body reprehensible if it were not for the fact that she used it to transform herself into a huge star, going from little known sitcom actress to pin-up girl of every teenage boy in the world. It really reminds you of Bo Derek in '10' or Cameron Diaz in 'The Mask'. Love the scene where she's introduced to the hero' parents, his mother delighted her son has found such a lovely girl and his dad visibly impressed by his boy scoring such an incredible hottie. <br/><br/>The Bad? Plenty, incomprehensible plot, why drag the Maguffin from the centre of the desert to the city where the battle presumably kills thousands? John Voight and John Turturro slumming it for the sake of a paycheque, Shia LaBeouf is rubbish (what does everyone see in him?). Josh Duammel is handsome and looks good in uniform but his character is largely pointless. Too many human subplots (what the hell is the point of the hackers?) and not enough giant robots. Disappointing that they change what some of the robots transform into, especially Megatron who whilst the bad guy always had a brutal charisma about him. And why kill Jazz, everybody's favourite Autobot?<br/><br/>So, not bad but could have been a lot better"

","In 2007 Michael Bay delivered us the very first live action Transformers film. Seven years later we are about to see part four of his franchise. Within the next eleven days, before the release of Transformers: Age of Extinction, I am going to review the first three films that Michael Bay directed. So here we go with the very first film, Transformers.<br/><br/>Re-watching this film after having not seen it for about three years, I found myself mostly uninterested in the film. Sure the action is amazing, great use of the CG by Michael Bay, but there really isn't anything great about the film. Certainly not perfect in any department as well. However if you look up the movie term, Summer Blockbuster, I'm sure you will find pictures of Michael Bay films, more so Transformers. The story is light and paper thin. No one set out a goal to win Oscars when they made this film. They wanted a high octane action film for summer movie fans, and frankly in that regard, they succeeded at a high level. The acting is mostly just awful. Shia LaBeouf is simply annoying, can't like his character at all. The only actors who are enjoyable and do a great job are Jon Voight and John Turturro. Anthony Anderson had me cracking up in the few scenes he had in the film as well. While we are on humor here, I must say, the humor factor is over the top. Not as over the top as the sequel though.<br/><br/>Michael Bay, the director of this film, is known for those big epic summer blockbusters, he has been making them for many years now, and with no signs of slowing down. While he never really gave us great stories with complex characters, he does give us amazing action scenes, that we will remember for awhile. Since it was so long in between my last viewing of this film, I was kind of shocked looking back at how many big gaps fill in between the great action scenes. There is a lot of worthless banter back and fourth, and more stupid humor, that really drags this film down. The acting in this film as I mentioned above is overall just bad, minus a couple examples. Michel Bay isn't really known for getting great performances out of his stars, and this film continues that trend. He just likes to blow stuff up, and in the end, he does it very well.<br/><br/>Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman wrote this film, as well as the sequel, and I won't put it lightly, these guys are a laughing stock of their profession. This might be one of the few times you don't want to punch the writers in the head. Watch the sequel to this film, and you will change your attitude. While this story is simple minded it is effective for the start of the franchise. While I do not like these writers at all, I must admit they didn't mangle this film here I am talking about. They weren't perfect either. The characters are very wooden and not really developed at all. I don't really take all of this out on them because of the type of film it is, but it wasn't a great overall effect.<br/><br/>Overall the start of this franchise isn't going to be making any top ten lists of mine, unless of course I make a list of mindless summer blockbusters. The action in this film is amazing, and while there are a lot of boring parts in between, when it goes back to the action, you just keep loving it. Remember, as I said above, this is a pure popcorn summer blockbuster film. If you lay back and remember that key fact, I see no reason why you cannot enjoy this film for what it really is.<br/><br/>7/10"
"darth_timon","7","0","0","23 May 2013"," A Reasonable Beginning
","The first installment in the Transformers trilogy does a reasonable job of setting things up and manages to look the part nicely- for the most part. The technical aspects of the film are incredible, and the Transformers themselves look very real. The battles are well done too.<br/><br/>However, the film suffers from too many human moments. The cartoon was always about the battle between the Autobots and Decepticons. This film, and its sequels, focus too heavily on Sam and his relationship angst, rather than what the focus should be on- massive robots slugging it out.<br/><br/>Another complaint- in the midst of all the battles and and fights, it becomes very hard to figure out which robot is which- only Optimus and Bumblebee (whose 'speech' gets quite annoying after a while) stand out from the blur of samey transformers.<br/><br/>Despite these flaws, it's still an entertaining film- but it could have been a lot better."
"emma8998","6","18","83","29 June 2007"," I find it ridiculous
","Still I can't rate it below 5 stars. If you went for the story, Transformer wouldn't be the best choice -- the structure is loose, I don't understand why Mr Voight would choose to be part of this film, the way the film narrative treated the US govermetn is just a satire -- stupid defensive team, listens to a soldier's opinion. It felt like bits and pieces been put together. I suppose its due to the fact that the film's an adaption from the comic strip. And Sam's parents -- why are they there?! And the omnipresence of the teenagers'-sex-comedy feel really bugs me and makes me laugh. <br/><br/>On the other hand, if you went for the visual and sound effects, the film has brought the ""human technology"" up to another level -- which kind of makes me look forward to Harry Potter the 5th actually.<br/><br/>Summary : Not satiable. Prefer not to see it again."

The sound track is bad,as if its been lifted from the Rock,I'm tired of his shots of US military hardware shot in orange silhouette,slow motion Tony Scott rip-offs. The robots faces are great,and some of the action is very nice,but due to no real character,I couldn't give a S@#$t! and soon due to Bays mega-cutting the effects just washed over me and I couldn't wait to leave.

"mike_seo910","1","3","8","29 November 2010"," one of the best films ever made
","Not. I mean really..........the incoherent/childish storyline, terrible acting especially by Megan Fox, really lame script/sense of humor e.g. ""i think the male wants to mate the female"" or whatever(not worth actually remembering accurately), ""i bet it is Japanese"" (hahahaha so funny). The personality of the main character is just so annoying. He is that typical naive American kid(with little understanding of how complex life is) and ""tries"" to save the world. The climax when mega tron is beating the s**t out of the what's its name auto-bot leader/ the main character then for some magical reason mega tron dies suddenly and they(the ""good"" guys) win the ""battle"". <br/><br/>One of the biggest disappointments i've ever had. The trailer really fooled me in thinking this would be great blockbuster movie to watch over the summer. Also a bigger disappointment considering the fact that Michael Bay is one of my favorite film directors. He is definitely doesn't make films that are cinematic masterpiece (e.g. Gond with the wind) but at least he made some dumb fun films like ""the rock"", ""bad boys"", ""pearl harbor"" but not transformers.<br/><br/>Anyways..if you belong in that group of audience(who rubbish directors make money from) that are brain dead and only watch movies for CGI and ultra-dumb fun action this is the film for you. Or if you want to see your country U.S.A(who would it be) save the world again with ""minor"" help from the auto bots then you better go watch it to make your country proud."
"forrestwrs","3","3","8","15 September 2010"," The Robots Were Astonishingly Bland
","I found myself liking the first third of Transformers and being completely disengaged with the film after that.<br/><br/>I think that the best choice Michael Bay has made in his entire film career was putting Shia LaBeouf in the lead role of this film. I'm not going to swear to this, but I felt like he was improvising at least half of his dialogue. Which is great, because the screenplay was not very interesting at all. I found myself enjoying everything that LaBeouf's characters said more than any other part of the movie. He's funny, quirky, and, surprisingly, a decent actor. I first saw his work in Holes and then again in Disturbia. I must say that I feel like LaBeouf is on his way to making some really excellent work in the future.<br/><br/>Megan Fox, on the other hand, was less than satisfying. Everyone has been talking about how pretty she is and, yes, I think that's the only reason she was in the film. Her character was completely unnecessary to the story and could have been taken out entirely. But, instead, the audience gets about a thousand shots of her ""looking hot"" and very few shots of her actually doing anything important with the story. Still, even though I don't think she's a very good actress, I had to admit that her acting was still much better than Liv Tyler's in Armageddon or Kate Beckinsale's in Pearl Harbor. She's not a *bad* actress, but she doesn't offer any meat to the story beyond being a love interest for LaBeouf's character.<br/><br/>As for the character development in general, I didn't see any. Unsurprisingly. I didn't expect any, and I didn't get any. But, here's my biggest issue with that: these robots should be interesting. But they aren't. These robots probably make up for most of my criticism with this film. The special effects were really good (*really* good), but the robots were astonishingly bland. And I thought they looked ugly. Believe it or not, I thought there was *too* *much* detail to them. There were so many chunks of metal sticking off of them that it made them all hard to recognize. Yes, that was a big complaint I had with the film. Except for two of the robots, they all looked the same! I had no idea what robots I should be rooting for during the fight scenes. I felt like they all were Megatron fighting Megatron. The only two robots I could recognize were the yellow one and Optimus Prime. And that's only because they were different colors from the other robots. I mean, this was not a very good-*looking* film. That surprised me, because Bay's films are at least fairly decent with the art direction, but not here. The colors were too saturated in some places, but not when it came to the robots. And, like I said, all the robots looked the same to me.<br/><br/>And I wasn't very impressed with the action sequences either. I felt like there wasn't enough coherence to it. It was a lot of stomping around and not a whole lot of anything else. And the action starts about halfway through the movie and doesn't stop until the film's over. The rest of the characters in this movie, apart from LaBeouf and the robots, didn't really serve a purpose for the story. There were a few characters who I didn't even know why they were getting screen time. The movie dips in and out of the main plot line at a ridiculous rate. There's an interrogation scene for two characters. I was confused because I had no idea what purpose they were serving. I didn't know why the scene was even in the film.<br/><br/>If I had to sum up Transformers, it would be that there was a lot of decent effects surrounding incoherent action sequences, ugly robots that looked the same, useless characters, little plot, cheap dialogue, and not much else. This is Michael Bay's best film, but that's not saying much since I hated his other films.<br/><br/>3/10"
"cervoy","1","3","8","23 August 2010"," Where are the transformers?
","The movie starts off with with Peter Cullen explaining what the cube (later on renamed the all spark) is, and that a war was fought over it and that it is now needed to rebuild their home world.<br/><br/>Then we get to follow Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and his men as they set the tone for the movie talking about what they miss back home, their kids, etc when they are interrupted by a transformer whom we won't get to see much more than his helicopter form of, his robot form being distorted by objects blocking him, shaky hand held ""action shots"" and sunlight hitting the lens, explosions or other lightning effects.<br/><br/>9 minutes in we are introduced to Sam (Shia LaBeouf) and his teenage problems. The film then continues to switch between military scenes and scenes with Sam until 40 minutes in where Captain Lennox and his squad are fight a huge metal scorpion for 4 minutes, the scorpion for the most part being covered by sand. (doesn't transform) The 2 fight scenes are poorly choreographed and mostly consist of fast movement, shaky camera action, explosions and crouching soldiers shooting at something off screen paired with shots of military command and airplane photography. - A concept that will last throughout the rest of the movie, with the only added addition of robots fighting pasted in.<br/><br/>It gives off the feel of being 2 scripts (a boy and his car) and (Captain Lennox blows stuff up) frankensteined together by someone with a very vague idea of what the transformers brand has been about the last quarter of a century, who had to work the transformers in because he had to, rather than having the story be about the transformers.<br/><br/>Besides the opening speech we don't hear anything from a transformer for 33 minutes when we get 5 lines written out as translated from cybertronian and the first spoken lines from a transformer are 51 minutes in, this also makes up for all the dialog from transformers within the first hour. 9 lines from the actual transformers, a feat usually surpassed within 40 seconds in the original TV series.<br/><br/>Maybe its just me, but if I go to see a movie about the transformers I want to see transformers, I want to know who they are and what makes them tick, instead we have extras getting more lines (and given more personality) than the transformers who are supposed to be the main characters. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie where the main characters didn't say more than 9 lines in the first hour - and for good reason.<br/><br/>If you don't know anything about transformers and enjoy shaky action shots of soldiers shooting at robots and can't be bothered with details such as who or why then you will get a kick out of this movie - if you however were a transformers fan prior to seeing this movie and are looking forward to seeing some classic interaction and getting reacquainted with Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Wheeljack & the others or if you are merely someone who cares about plot and the personality of your movie characters then you are better off watching something like Avatar.<br/><br/>I wish I could give this one more than 1 star, and maybe I would had I not known anything about the transformers and weren't expecting the movie to be about transformers. But as it stands I have a hard time giving it more than 1 star."

"ajaxfetish","5","3","8","18 October 2007"," A Movie with a Lot of Unrealized Potential
","Biggest problem with the movie: they couldn't decide on their target audience. Half of the movie seems designed for kids and half for adults. It's a show that I could see working well either way, but trying to do both at once didn't work. Most of the humor is directed toward a very young audience, I would say roughly 8-12. This includes especially the whole segment with the Autobots hiding from the parents in the backyard, or anything involving Sector 7. As a child, I would have been pissing myself in glee at the sheer hilarity. As an adult, I find it cheesy beyond all measure, boring, and a needless distraction from the plot. Other parts would either bore such young children or make their parents really nervous, such as the violence, the romance, and the remaining humor (e.g. the Mom's masturbation lines). Prime's moral statements and defenses of human potential again would be perfectly satisfactory for a child, but seem incredibly shallow and simplistic to me as an adult. This could have been a great kids' film. It could have been a great adult action film. It ended up being neither.<br/><br/>Other cons: the shallowness and inaccessibility of the main characters. There was no one I really identified with, empathized with, or worried about. Also, there was too much going on. Stories such as the lost soldiers in Qatar or the intrigues of Sector 7 or the female computer analyst could each have been the central plot of a movie. As it was, they were all side-shows which looked more promising than they were able to be in the time given them.<br/><br/>Pros: The action sequences were very nice, and the transformation graphics were superb. Visually the film was very rewarding. The idea of having your car choose you or come to your defense in peril is very cool (part of the appeal of the transformer concept itself). Also, it featured the A-10, albeit briefly. The heroin is easy to look at."

It lost so much of it's potential trying to please everyone. Very few movies can be for both kids and adults and still be excellent. I had a few other problems with the movie as well, like could they make the girl more TAN or SLUTY looking? And her character is kinda unbelievable. Also I found that the movie promoted some racial stereotypes. There were some bright spots in the movie...the back story on Sam's family was cool (although a bit underdeveloped), the actor who plays Sam is very charismatic, and of course the special effects were cool."

All of this in a running time of 2hr 45min, a respectable running time for an epic.<br/><br/>However, all this adds up to just a big, dumb action movie in the end, miles away from the original animated series, and compared to it, this film is very disappointing. The plots and characters are all over the place, losing track of some characters and plot lines here and there, all to make sure all the spectacle scenes can take place without any real logic or reasoning behind them. You can tell that at the pre-production stage the actions scenes were carefully written and choreographed, and the rest (characters, plot, basic story, logic) were added in as an afterthought. While the CGI is okay, the character designs aren't really good at all, the Transformers looking like a mess of mechanics instead of the amazing alien characters they once were.<br/><br/>And this is all spread out to almost 3 hours too! Big, dumb action movies are never supposed to be that long! In the end, Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg just decided to make their own film out of the franchise, they don't really care about the franchise one bit. Even so, it could have been so much better than this. It could have been a decent 90 minute Sci-fi actioner and everyone would have been happy.

","Okay, I'm pretty much of the generation to which this film is aimed. I was a kid when this show was on the air. I wasn't a huge fan myself, though. I was more of a He-Man kind of guy. I only barely remember watching Transformers. My parents were unwilling to buy me the toys because they were too expensive and they broke easily during their transformations. I really wasn't at all interested in seeing this movie, except maybe on video to see how bad it was. But I'd heard a lot of good word-of-mouth reports and my friends wanted to see it, so I caved in. A one word review: Meh. A little more: it ain't terrible, certainly a lot better than I expected. The film sustains itself with a beleaguered and just plain weird sense of humor that, if not hilarious, is undeniably amusing. In general, there's just too much going on. There are like fifteen different plot threads. The story isn't too hard to follow and mostly makes sense, but a lot of it could be cut out (for instance, the second most important piece of female eye candy, Rachael Taylor, and her hacker buddy played by Anthony Anderson). The action is quite fun most of the time, but the giant final battle has so much going on that it gets more than a little difficult to follow. I might have actually given the movie a passing grade if not for the quick and unsatisfying final battle between Optimus Prime and Megatron. Transformers is pretty close to being worthwhile, but in the end it's too big , exhausting and disappointing to really recommend."

The plot was horrible, I mean, they were after a God damned cube! Sure kids may like this movie, because it's shiny to look at, and to be fair kids like horrible movies. I used to like The Mario Bros movie, but now when I watch it I realise just how crap it really is. All I can say for this movie is that Michael Bay has done it again. He has taken something I love (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and flat out dumped all over it. What a jackass. What's worse is he's planned a sequel, what will the plot be in that?! Will they chase down another shape, perhaps a sphere? Who knows?

Unfortunately I'm in my 20's and find myself needing more than fight scenes and explosions. If that's all your looking for from this film, that's what you'll get. A derivative story line, with sub-plots that have been told a million times. Atrocious dialogue that will appeal to the lowest common denominator, and children. Cookie cutter quips, and a chick with a great ass...oh, and some CGI. (yawn) Blockbuster action films can be done well. The first two X-Men films are a great example of action films with crisp dialogue and good story lines. Michael Bay doesn't want to make films like that though. It would involve a minutia of risk and he can only safely spew out a film that's certain to do well at the box office, but will be utterly disappointing to even the least discerning fan. He's making films for a profit. That's fine. I applaud his business sense, but watching his films is like staring at a casino floor. His entire filmography is a soulless coin-op machine."

","I went with friends expecting a popcorn flick and got it... I wasn't bored, but I certainly felt that it was a movie lacking any depth (which is fine).<br/><br/>Comparing this movie to a movie with an artistic angle is like comparing a gourmet meal to a hot dog. The gourmet meal takes much more finesse and skill in preparation and there is a specific design to what the chef wants the taster to perceive. A hot dog is made from a generic formula of hodgepodge ingredients to form something that most people can settle on. Michael Bay uses explosions, sexual imagery, cliché social jokes, and special effects to create the ""hot dog"" of the movie industry.<br/><br/>Just like a hot dog is an appropriate American summer tradition, so are popcorn blockbusters and there is nothing wrong with that."
"rparham","4","3","8","9 July 2007"," Not more than meets the eye
","I was an unabashed fan of the Transformers in my youth during the 1980s. It competed with two other major toy franchises (G.I. Joe and Masters of the Universe) for my attention and my parent's money, especially at Christmas time. I watched the animated series, went to see the animated movie twice in the theater in the summer of '86 and read the comic books. Of course, as time passed, other things consumed my interest over the Transformers, but I still feel a strong pull of nostalgia for that franchise. Now, two decades after the peak of the Transformers phenomenon, director Michael Bay has brought the Transformers back to the big screen with a live-action adaptation of the material, and as much as my nostalgia is piqued by this film, upon watching the final product, instead of mining gold, Bay, along with screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have managed to only produce a ho-hum affair, living up to the Shakespeare line: Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.<br/><br/>Transformers opens in Iraq, where a helicopter lands at a military base and proceeds to lay waste to it, transforming into a giant robot, and attempting to hack the computers. The narrative then moves to America, where high school student Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf) is purchasing his first car, which turns out to be a Camaro that is eerily insistent that Sam buy it. Upon getting it home, it drives itself off and Sam chases it, meeting up with a classmate, Mikaela (Megan Fox), and they find themselves caught in the middle of an interstellar war between two groups of sentient robots from another planet, the good ones named Autobots, led by Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen) , the evil ones Decepticons, led by Megatron (voice of Hugo Weaving), who have the ability of camouflaging themselves as vehicles and electronic equipment. Both factions are in search of a cube named the All Spark that can bring life to otherwise inanimate technological objects; the Autobots want to destroy it before the Decepticons can use it to build an army to conquer the Universe (yes, a character actually specifies Universe in one scene).<br/><br/>Transformers has a number of problems, but it's two principal ones are a padded running length and a lack of any genuine excitement. Much like the Pirates of the Caribbean films, Transformers is too long for the material it has to work with. After the opening battle scene in Iraq, the film runs a good hour plus before anything else of tremendous interest occurs. Most of the scenes in the middle feature Sam getting his car, hitting on Mikaela, and a subplot involving young analysts at the Pentagon trying to decipher a signal detected during the Qatar attack that will hopefully lead to an answer as to what happened at the base. There is some light comedy sprinkled into these scenes, but nothing compelling that hasn't been done before and you find yourself wondering when the giant robots the trailers promised are going to show up.<br/><br/>Finally, the Transformers make an appearance, at which point the film showcases its most significant asset, the rather impressive computer animation of the Transformers. While the quality does vacillate a bit (many of the close-ups of the Transformers look fairly obviously computer generated), the majority of the imagery is well integrated into the real material for a reasonably seamless result. The problem, however, is that the Transformers are not developed at all as characters. Optimus Prime has a significant amount of dialogue, and Bumblebee, the Camaro, has some draw to him, but for the most part, they are just eye-candy. The Decepticons fare much worse, with no sense of menace, no danger to them, failing to cause us to hate them as villains. We don't care about the Transformers or their plight and aside from the fact that I played with them as a child, and therefore recognize the names, you can barely tell one apart from the other in most scenes.<br/><br/>The culmination of all this is that none of the action sequences at the end of the film have any weight to them. There is pyrotechnics galore, to be sure, but none of it matters a bit. It is just scene after scene of explosions and generic, non-descript robots tussling with each other for no real purpose. We don't care if one wins or the other loses and we don't care about the majority of the human characters caught in the middle either (I couldn't give you the names of the characters portrayed by Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson from memory even if I tried). A few shots here and there have some kinetic kick to them, but that is about it.<br/><br/>Shia LeBeouf carries the role of Sam fairly well and should prove to have a decent career ahead of him, but he can't manage to elevate the role above the generic part that has been created. Megan Fox is certainly very attractive, but her character has even less development than Sam and proves to just be one more visual attraction in a film swirling with pretty images. Jon Voight is mostly here to collect a paycheck, Anthony Anderson shows up for a few scenes to do a variation on his usual schtick (which is funny at times), and then there is John Turturro. Portraying a government agent, Turturro must have been told he was starring in a parody film and turns in an over the top performance that you can't even begin to take seriously. He is amusing, but it is just one more hit at giving any depth to this film.<br/><br/>While some may disagree, I believe there is the possibility of a good film somewhere in this material, but Michael Bay was unable to recognize it and build one. Instead, we are left with this loud, overlong, underwhelming film that is definitely not more than meets the eye."

","I actually went into this one with somewhat high expectations. I expected that even if it didn't succeed at being a good translation of Transformers, it would at least be a fun, exciting giant-robots-kicking-ass flick. It succeeded at neither.<br/><br/>I tried to look at it both ways. As a guy who grew up with the cartoons and toys, I wanted it to capture that same fun and action. But Michael Bay, who went in knowing very little about it, and treating it with condescension, took everything he personally didn't get or like about it, and simply changed it. These changes make it hard to like for a real fan of the original. Some Decepticons are cars now? The Transformers can change what they change into? How convenient that all the parts match up no matter what they want to become. The whole design of the robots is horrendous. They should have kept them simple, but they've made them so complex, disjointed, and busy that they look like random globs of metal. There are many points in the film where you can't even tell which robot you're looking at. They've treated the robots not as full characters, but as FX toys. When they make feeble forced attempts to inject personality, it fails completely. They just come across as dumb or obnoxious. One of the main plots of the story is supposed to be the relationship between Sam and his car, Bumblebee, but you get absolutely no sense of any connection there. When they are separated, or when Bumblebee is being ""tortured,"" you don't care at all because they haven't established that connection. If you want to see that kind of story done right, watch The Iron Giant. The movie also makes the mistake of focusing far too much on humans. A little human involvement is to be expected and necessary, but there are so many unnecessary characters and plot lines. The entire military and Pentagon angles could easily be cut, especially horrible pointless characters like Anthony Anderson and John Turturro's.<br/><br/>So the faithful translation was out. So why not enjoy it as just a cool action/sci-fi flick? I tried. But there are just WAY too many horrible attempts at humor and childish sight gags. The first hour of the movie is especially painful to watch, with one bad one-liner after another, and the worst character of all, a small, supposedly funny robot named Frenzy. The action itself is more frustrating than anything. Giant robots fighting and transforming and causing destruction should be cool and exciting, right? Not here. I've always been a defender of Michael Bay's frenetic style and shaky-cams, but here it's just unwatchable. Coupled with the bad robot design, you can't even tell what the hell is going on half the time. The last half hour is a repetitive mess.<br/><br/>If there's one thing I never thought I'd be in a flick like this, it's bored. But I was. Bored and annoyed. I probably checked my watch ten times by the time it was over. It wasn't a completely awful film. It was just a gigantic disappointment on all levels, because it COULD have been such a cool flick. A ten-year old kid would probably love this flick, but anyone else, if they were being honest, would have to admit that it could have been SO much better.<br/><br/>One review I saw sums it up PERFECTLY: ""It's like spending a day at the state fair: a little bit of actual entertainment, a lot of embarrassingly cheesy attempts at entertainment, and the faint whiff of bull crap everywhere."""
"selfparody","5","3","8","6 July 2007"," Do Not Watch This Movie. Please
","I'm not a very big Transformers fan: I never owned the toys or watched the show. I did, however, watch the original movie. I greatly prefer campy commercial to this bloated commercial, here is why:<br/><br/>Sam & Company- As with that terrible GODZILLA remake, the producers apparently decided ""Well, people came to see Transformers, but we have to tag this half-assed 'nerd fantasy romance' onto it and spend 80% of the movie on the humans."" That would be well and good, if the humans were in some way unique or interesting. Instead, we basically get the same crappy types we've seen again and again (young fresh types overcoming authority figures, clueless parents ((think the parents in a very toned down version of American Pie)) and you have the human element. Plus a ""soldier with a young daughter back home"" subplot that pisses me off in the way only Michael Bay's lowest common denominator tricks can. <br/><br/>Autobots: I know I was supposed to be blown away by the fact Peter Cullen from the cartoon is the voice of Optimus Prime (God knows why that would impress a nonfan: his acting is not good) Well, I would have been fine having freakin' Steve Carell voice the character if he his dialogue was good at all. Instead, he spends half of his lines telling us how great Sam the lovable nerd is, and at least a quarter spouting the dumbest howlers I have ever heard. The other autobots got so little screen time that literally an hour after watching it, I only remember that there is a joke about one of them wizzing on a human as a joke. <br/><br/>Decepticons: Incredibly, they are even less developed than the autobots, barely getting to destroy anything or properly present themselves as a menace. I mean, there's EIGHT of them, and we see humans are able to damage them early on. You honestly get the impression the humans could defeat them without the autobots, even if they do use ""the cube"" (An idea so patently stupid it makes the cartoon seem like FIGHT CLUB) People complain about how indistinguishable the cartoon characters are? These guys are so close in design that Starscream and Megatron could stand up next to each other in a lineup and you couldn't tell them apart. <br/><br/>John Turtorro: He is in it, he has lines, and a lot of them. <br/><br/>In short, only watch this movie if you have no imagination. Everyone else is advised to just shut their eyes, and imagine what this movie would be like. You will probably dream up something much more watchable, and it will be all yours."
"MaxBorg89","8","3","8","5 July 2007"," Very slick and fun, but could easily have been twenty minutes shorter
","""It's goofy fun with a lot of stuff that blows up real good, and it has the grace not only to realize how preposterous it is, but to make that into an asset"". This is what Roger Ebert wrote in his review of Transformers, Michael Bay's summer blockbuster based on an '80s cartoon series, stating that after a succession of mediocre films (Pearl Harbor being the climax) Jerry Bruckheimer's former protégé finally got it right with an action film that works because it doesn't take itself seriously. That's exactly how the movie should be approached: the minute someone starts questioning the script's plausibility instead of praising the great humor, there's nothing left to do.<br/><br/>That the concept is, in Ebert's words, ""preposterous"", is evident from the very beginning: a group of American soldiers stationed in Quatar are suddenly attacked by an unidentified, lethal machine, and a few hours later several top secret files are stolen from the Air Force One's mainframe, prompting the Secretary of Defense (Jon Voight) to summon the best signal analysts in the country in order to understand what they are dealing with. Unfortunately, the enemy is neither Chinese nor Russian: the bad guys are Decepticons, alien robots who are able to transform into normal vehicles and therefore ""live"" among us unseen (their home-planet, Cybertron, was destroyed during a war). These droids have a double mission: firstly, they must find their leader, Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving), who disappeared while looking for the Allstar, a mysterious, powerful cube; secondly, they have to retrieve that cube, which will enable them to turn every machine on Earth into a weapon and conquer our planet with no difficulty at all. They are, however, not the only ones seeking the Cube: the Autobots, another Cybertron race led by Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen, who also played the role in the cartoon show), are after the Allstar as well, and Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), a teenager whose grandfather somehow figured out the mysterious object's location, is on their side.<br/><br/>The director originally turned down the film, calling it a ""stupid toy movie"", only to realize he had said the same thing regarding Raiders of the Lost Ark over twenty years ago and subsequently change his mind. And even though Bay is no Steven Spielberg (who coincidentally is the executive producer of this movie) and LaBeouf, as likable as he gets, is no Harrison Ford, Transformers is a genuinely enjoyable ride. Why? Because Bay, having realized some stories cannot be handled seriously (which is the mistake he made on his previous works), delivers his latest blockbuster exactly as it is meant to be: very loud, dumb, unpretentious and, most of all, funny. Rather than playing it straight, he focuses on the comedy that emerges from the film's far-fetched scenario: Sam's laughable yet realistic attempts to seduce his friend Mikaela (Megan Fox), his reaction to the discovery that his new car is actually an Autobot, a hilarious conversation with his parents concerning what he was doing alone in his room with the door locked (unmissable). Not all the laughs come from the leading man, mind: the supporting players contribute a lot to make the movie one of the most ridiculously entertaining of the year, particularly John Turturro as the uptight, idiotic Agent Simmons (""You gonna lay the fate of the world on a kid's Camaro?"").<br/><br/>Sadly, all this fun can't distract from the movie's main flaw: the running time. At 144 minutes, it is way too long for a flick like this, and some of the action scenes (especially the final showdown, which goes on and on for what seems like an eternity) could have been shortened, leaving the movie with an acceptable duration (let's say two hours) and more time spent on the human side of the story rather than the CGI.<br/><br/>Still, Tranformers is probably the year's smartest dumb movie. Plus, any film that's cheeky enough to make fun of its director (""This is so much better than Armageddon!"" a character says halfway through the picture) deserves a look."

The projectionist screwed up and it took 20 minutes before the film started from when it should have but it was so worth the wait. The story line holds very well to the original animated movie even down to some of the lines. ""One shall stand one shall fall"" as Optimus and Megatron prepare to fight for anyone that has seen the original animated movie that is enough to send a chill down your spine.

","I had low expectations when i went to this movie. I read up on Michael Bay and the kind of movies he made and was fairly convinced it would be another action packed movie with a wafer thin plot line. Too bad I was proved right about that. The plot was fairly straight forward. The bad guys want to get some powerful item to destroy their enemies and the good guys want to stop them. This movie actually has so many plot holes that you'll start wondering if you're in a strip mine... So why do i give this movie a 10 rating then? 1. It's really entertaining. The action is mixed with some comedy and viewer bonding scenes that are not annoying. 2. The actors in the movie are eye candy for everyone and they know how to act. 3. The last time me and my friends had such a kick out of a movie was some time ago. All in all it was 8,5 euro's well spent. I can recommend this movie to anybody that just wants to have some entertainment for a night, needs to see a movie that he or she doesn't need to think too much about after wards and doesn't mind overlooking some plot holes."

","I must admit I wasn't expecting anything much out of this movie. After seeing failures such as Fantastic Four, for instance, I've come to the conclusion that most comic-based movies fail to deliver. While you certainly cannot expect a twisting storyline, you can expect a catching movie - especially the fighting. It's mainly an action-entertainment movie, and while I usually dislike the normal boom-boom action-type movies with no regard for a decent plot whatsoever, I *did* enjoy Transformers as I can only describe it as 'cool'.<br/><br/>There are subtle details that I also enjoyed, for instance Bumblebee's gesturing and some various comments. Overall I enjoyed this movie, and I was impressed - however, you shouldn't try and take it all that seriously, I, myself, was laughing through some of the scenes (though the younger audience seemed to absorb them with full seriousness) and the fighting scenes, particularly due to the transformers' superiority over humans. If you decide to see this film, go watch it while it's still in the theater."

The CGI and effects were amazing and definitely took it to another level. The action was cool and choreographed well. Although some of the scenes reminded me of other movies... oh yeah they were all from other Michael Bay movies. It was corny- everything that came out of the robots' mouths was corny but it reminded you that its supposed to be fun and that Hollywood still has some respect for the fans. There were many parts that left the audience laughing due to Shia's acting. Also, Megan Fox is eye candy and great eye candy at that. Her alone was worth the price of admission.

There was a little cursing, but it was nothing to cry about. The special effects were top notch, and the fun factor was excellent. This didn't have the corny dialogue that we were expecting. Overall it was extremely well written, well planned, and produced. I would call it less of a viewing, but more of an ""experience"". Personally I wouldn't see how anyone could give it less than an 8 because it was missing something. I am also happy that this movie did not just jump right in to the main storyline, but introduced the characters, and situation well. THIS IS ONE OF MY TOP THREE MOVIES OFF ALL TIME...PUTTING IT IN LINE WITH: (just to give you an idea) 1.STAR WARS (classic action/scifi flick) 2.CADDYSHACK (you have to have a comedy in the top 5) 3.TRANSFORMERS (in elite company) 4.TERMINATOR (another original classic scifi) 5.HOOSIERS (all time greatest sports movie)"
"spahnrancher","10","3","8","3 July 2007"," This was a fan's dream come true...
","It is interesting that after 20 years The Transformers hold such a resonance in today's world. The premise of robotic organisms that are in search of a life force and will do anything to protect it and not destroy Earth's living beings is an idea that we are truly welcome to embrace. Michael Bay has provided a visual display that culminates around teamwork, survival-ism, and co-existence. This film works on so many levels that it would be futile to list each one. That said, what does stand out is how perfectly tidy the chaos is in every sequence of combat. The elements of destruction are a technical dream. Optimus Prime is exactly how he should be...one beautiful machine. The vocal talent in this movie was executed flawlessly. One very refreshing detail is that the story integrates both humans and auto bots cohesively. Ultimately you aren't made to believe that these are ""aliens"" infiltrating the planet. There is a ton of comic relief in this movie and it is befitting as the television series was nothing if not consistently sarcastic. A film that is dazzling and romantic in it's display without too much political embellishment. One tiny pitfall in my humble opinion as a fan I really longed to see Soundwave brought to life and a little more Decepticon action. The sequel will deliver all the goods I am very sure of that. The wait was well worth it as this film is definitely more than meets the eye...a fan's dream come true."

"hcole-proven","8","3","8","3 July 2007"," I am in awe...
","I went to an 11:45 PM showing last night and I am so blown away I am almost speechless. The special effects were cool (not anymore spectacular than you'd see in Star Wars or Lord of the Rings), the plot was in line with any Transformer episode (if you watched it as a kid) - the movie itself as a movie, was good. What made in excellent was the spirit of the movie.<br/><br/>Michael Bay is a genius. Watching Optimus Prime roll down the highway as a real semi, hearing Peter Cullen's powerful voice telling the other Autobots to ""roll out""...it was like deja vu or pure nostalgia being poured into my senses. I felt 10 years old again...playing in my front yard - being the Witwicky that helped the Autobots whip the Decepticons and send Megatron squealing to his maker. Not many movies take you back to a happier time. And even though the movie is bang, bang, shoot 'em up - to see these robots that I just loved as a child...it just took my breath away. I am in a state of euphoria.<br/><br/>The movie had enough action to keep you on the edge of your seat, enough plot to keep your mind from turning into mush, enough comedy to keep your sides hurting and enough love for both the people and Autobots that I cannot see anyone not enjoying it. It is almost as though these robots are something you could see driving down the street - pun intended. I even got teary eyed when Bumblebee was captured.<br/><br/>And maybe I could attribute it to the fact that we left the theater and 2:30 in the morning, but both myself and my kids think Tranformers may blow Star Wars out of the water - and trust me - we are a nerd family. If it is a geek thing, we like it. Star Wars, Star Trek, X-Men, Spiderman, X-Files...but this movie....this was amazing. I have not felt this way about a movie since 1977 after leaving the theater from seeing Star Wars IV: A New Hope. But this is different somehow. George Lucas' Crown o' Cool has just been man-handled away by Michael Bay and his Autobots."
"drakea83","10","3","8","3 July 2007"," Wow, this was truly....
","MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE. I am a nerd and was a child in the 80's, so I am a little biased towards this movie. I love comics and superhero movies. Last night I had a chance to see a LIVE-ACTION movie of my favorite cartoon of my youth. TRANSFORMERS came to the big screen, and I waited with eager anticipation to catch a glimpse of OPTIMUS PRIME and BUMBLEBEE since I heard about the movie a couple years ago.<br/><br/>This is my thoughts on the flick. This movie absolutely blew me away. Being a fan of the original series and toyline, I wasn't looking forward to some of the changes that were bound to take place. Changes in the names and modes of some of the characters wasn't setting with me too well, but I could look over that as long as the story was there. Trust me the story was definitely there! There is action and there is heart in this movie. Action and heart are something that's sometimes difficult for a filmmaker to incorporate in together. It's also difficult to make a giant robot into a character that you can care for. Michael Bay managed all of this very well IMO.<br/><br/>One thing on Bay real fast... I was really hoping he wouldn't screw this up. I think that about every director who tries to do a movie based on characters that I know and love. Sam Raimi with Spider-Man, Mark Steven Johnson with Daredevil and Ghost Rider, Chris Nolan with Batman Begins, and so on. I think Bay truly stood up to the test of adapting without changing much. I commend him for that.<br/><br/>So back to the movie. Shia LeBeouf was good as the protagonist Sam Witwicky. Despite what you think about him from being in Disney movies and the such, he's turning out to be a pretty good young actor. You see him change and mature in the movie. From a 16 year old who just wants a car and the girl, to a young man who is willing to go up against a psychopathic robot.<br/><br/>Megan Fox... Well she's the love interest to young Sam Witwicky (LeBeouf) and serves two purposes. Purpose one: Eye candy. having a beautiful young lady as one of the leads of a movie for 10-30 year old males is seldom a bad thing for a film. Purpose two: She helps the Sam character grow from a bumbling hormonal teenager to the young man who is willing to go up against a psychopathic robot.<br/><br/>So enough about the human characters, and on to the thing that is really selling this movie. GIANT FREAKIN' ROBOTS! The AUTOBOT characters are very true to their characters that I grew up watching. IRONHIDE was a bit of a hot head with a good heart. JAZZ was the perfect second in command. He did his job, watched over the other AUTOBOTS, and fought valiantly. RATCHET we didn't get to see a whole lot of, but he was caring and the voice of reason. BUMBLEEBEE was always my second favorite robot. He was a lot like Rudy Ruettieger in being a small guy with the heart of a true hero. You root for him to overcome obstacles and be the hero he is. Last but certainly not least OPTIMUS PRIME! PRIME was always kind of a mythical figure to me. He was a strong and moral leader. As a kid hearing him tell MEGATRON, in the 1986 cartoon movie, ""One shall stand, one shall fall."" was iconic! Seeing him in this movie, and having the voice of Peter Cullen, the original voice of PRIME in the series, was amazing. He lived up to any expectations a TRANSFORMERS fan should have.<br/><br/>Since I spent so much time on the good guys, I won't bore you much with the DECEPTICONS. Some of the characters names were changed, and not what they originally were in the series, but that's fine by me. I understand that to change from the median of comic books/cartoons into a live-action movie, that things have to change. The highlight of the DECEPTICONS came when MEGATRON tells his number 1 ""You have failed me yet again STARSCREAM!"" Classic MEGATRON/STARSCREAM relationship.<br/><br/>It's hard to put my personal feelings aside in this movie as a fan. However one of the people that went with me to the movie had not been a fan and came in expecting an action movie, and she really enjoyed it. So if you are a fan, or not a fan, it's enjoyable. I give it an enthusiastic 2 thumbs up!"

","First of all, this movie is AMAZING. I loved it, and so did everyone around me at the theater, clapping at the end while the credits rolled (not a very usual reaction from where I'm from: Winnipeg, in Canada). BUT!!!!!!!! The movie concentrated too much on the Autobots and the Decepticons were left out as just a menacing, violent group of soldiers who can really kick ass. With less than 20 minutes of screen-time, the movie missed the opportunity of showing a crucial aspect from The Transformers, and that is the struggle between Starscream and Megatron. You know Megatron disdains Starscream by the very first thing he says to him (You failed again, Starscream!).. that line made the movie for me, but Starscream's part seems more like a cameo than an actual part of the movie! WE NEED MORE STARSCREAM!!! WE NEED MORE DECEPTICONS!!! I REALLY hope that this is will be fixed in the sequel. Of course, I WILL be there again for the premier next year, or whenever it comes out."

","Before this movie came out, i don't even know what the ""Transformers"" are. Even when i first saw the poster of this movie, i didn't really interested in it. But, when the trailer comes out, i expected it would be great. And when i saw it, i realize that it's more than great. It's amazing.<br/><br/>For people that wasn't really ""Transformers's"" fans, i think, as long as you like fantasy-action movie, you'll like this one too. Like me! The point is this movie can take many new fans, not only the ""old"" fans. And when some people say only boys will like it, they were totally wrong. Even if you're a girl, you will still amazed by this movie.<br/><br/>It's also amazing how they can manage to combine the computer work and the real work. The actors are also amazing. It's amazing how they can act like the robots are really there, while they weren't.<br/><br/>It wasn't really surprising to know that this movie is amazing. Why? Because it directed & produced by two of the greatest director & producer i know, Michael Bay & Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>I highly recommended this to any Tranformers fans or non-fans, especially a fantasy-action movie fans. I think if you like movie such as Power Rangers or Star Wars, you'll like this movie too."

I mean, I went to watch it because not only did it won the MTV movie awards for best yet to be seen summer movie(or something like that) but also my friends' incessant recommendation. At first, I thought its some kind of old school Robo-show with bombs and flashes everywhere but I was wrong.<br/><br/>The whole movie's effects were GREAT, the lighting effects is really dramatic. There are sad scenes and funny scenes, very little ""filler"" scenes. Somehow I didn't quite see some connections with the characters, but who cares??

"bron2b","10","3","8","1 July 2007"," Optimus Prime Rules!!!
","I had seen this movie recently and I was surprised with how exciting and suspenseful this movie really was. I would've thought it would be a simple children's movie much like the original 80s cartoon movie, but this movie can be interesting for not only the children but also the adults and maybe fans of the popular cartoon. I was excited when they finally introduced Bumblebee in a totally new look being a Camaro then the famous VW Beetle.<br/><br/>What really got me hooked was the introduction to Optimus Prime and the Autobots who seemed extraordinary in their own way. Peter Cullen did a fine job of providing the voice of his renowned character Optimus Prime. The rest of the cast did a excellent job expressing the reality of these alien beings like Shia LeBeouf who did a fantastic job of becoming the hero and also Hugo Weaving playing the menacing and evil Megatron leading the Decepticons in their desperation for world domination and destruction.<br/><br/>The graphics and action sequences were astonishing showing the true destruction of what these creatures were capable of and what made this movie interesting to watch. I recommend that anyone that is a fan of the series or just wants to watch it I say grab a ticket sit down with some popcorn and ready to enjoy the Transformers like you wouldn't believe.<br/><br/>I rate this movie 10/10 and you'll see why..."

","I saw the movie yesterday and I was blown away. Not only by the SFX but also by the movie itself. It was so much better then I expected.<br/><br/>I am 25 years old and grew up with the cartoons and toys G1. I thought that the movie would be totally different than the series and of course it has a total different feeling. The movie is centered around humans instead of the 'bots but the subtle references mad to the first episodes of the cartoon are beautiful. I was really pleased with it! I really liked the 1 line story principle and the fact that it was like 5 Autobots against 5 Decepticons, just like every episode of the cartoons! The movies spider-man 3 and PotC are so plot thick that you can't follow the story anymore, this movie has no problems like that! In my opinion this is the best summer blockbuster movie this year till now."

You never get bored watching it and, even if it might not fit the older series, it's amazing.<br/><br/>I'd say that it's like Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade .

"dmjon23","9","3","8","28 June 2007"," Awesome, easily best film of 2007 so far!
","I'll start by saying when I was a kid (I'm 22 now) my life revolved around the turtles, I do remember transformers but i don't remember watching it regularly, or that much, but I do remember of it. I thought TMNT was a solid movie, but nothing special, transformers however, was just insane, the best film i have seen this year so far. This year has to be the biggest winter blockbuster season i can recall (Winter here in Australia) and so far most of the movies (other than spider-man 3) have been a huge letdown. I went into this film without any hope or expectations and just watched it to be entertained, and i was for the whole 143 minutes, there was rarely a dull moment in Transformers.<br/><br/>The special effects were amazing, I would be surprised if this movie doesn't win every special effects award out there. The best part of the movie, it kicks of right away and we see an attack within the first 10 minutes at a US army base in the middle of the desert and from that moment it doesn't stop, in fact there is probably one action scene too many. The spectacular final battle between the Autobots and the Decepticons is amazing. The whole thing is in pure daylight (I'm sick of movies shooting action scenes in the dark to cover costs or lack of decent CGI) so you can see every little detail of all the transformers attacking each other, tackling each other through skyscrapers and of course, all the explosions and gunfire when they shoot at each other and the humans (be amazed by Starscream flying through the buildings being chased down by the F-22's, quite possibly the best action sequence I have ever seen) This movie isn't all just awesome CGI and explosions, the cast is brilliant. The chemistry between Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox and the Autobots is amazing. They communicate with the Autobots so convincingly that even from the opening second I just forgot about the cool CGI and believed this was a real conversation (much in the same way with Luke Skywalker and Yoda). The chemistry between Sam (Shia) and Mikala (Megan) is also well done and not overdone. It doesn't take priority through the movie at all and starts off as a nervous guy trying to get the girl by purchasing a new car, and as you see from the trailer, they definitely grow from there.<br/><br/>The film was really separated into two halves. The first half, like most movies, was an introduction, but thats not to say any of the transformers don't come to the screen and impress until the second half, they are definitely here and there is definitely a lot of action, but the focus is more on the human characters and the US defense trying to figure out what is going on. At times this seemed to drag a bit (especially with Jon Voight as Secretary of Defense) but there is so much comical humor here (some of it quite adult, such as jokes about masturbating) to make it flow through nicely without becoming tedious, the majority of it between Sam and Bumblebee and definitely Sam's parents.<br/><br/>The second half, without spoiling to much, is where all the Decepticons and Autobots arrive, with a nice build up to the big final battle in the streets of LA. The only downside to this second half is that we really don't get to learn much about the Decepticons (Megatron is only really in it for the last half hour) as there is much more time to develop the Autobots and by the end you will find that you care about the fate of every Autobot, even as much as the main, human characters.<br/><br/>Transformers is definitely the successful blockbuster we have been waiting for this year. The CGI is amazing, the cast and acting are perfect and the action scenes are spectacular. The film will entertain anyone from all ages, not just guys born in the 80's. I'm not going to end this with a lame transformers quote, simply go and see this movie."

","Just returned home from a pre advanced viewing here inn Trondheim, Norway. How shall I put this? The movie was brilliant! OK, I might not be any smarter after viewing this mind blowing, well acted, special effects extravaganza, but holy c**p, a big popcorn menu later, I went out of the Prinsen theater with a great big smile on my face. Im 34 years old, but the kid in me woke up tonight, and started remembering Optimus Prime and Co from my childhood. Seening Prime ""alive"" at the screen made goosebumps all over me, and seeing cool Bumblebee as a Camero didn't spoil anything. Even if GM is a idiotic company, they sure makes cool cars. (Not that I will by one) And the Camero was a perfect sub for the VW. I will not spoil anything and tell anything about the movie itself, other that it was candy for the eyes, exiting and funny. A must see this summer. If a action adventure anytime deserved a top score, Transformers is the one. 10 out of 10 from me."

","After seeing the trailers, reading up on the net and discussing with my colleagues, I was convinced this was MY kinda movie: Action, and sci-fi. I was totally convinced this was a great movie. After five minutes my expectations were already met and then some. When the movie was over I was grinning like a moron - action (OK, GREAT action), sci-fi (and actually - umm - ""convincing"" plot) - and (surprise!!!) great humor! So, some robots transformed to other vehicles and some robots did not transform at all into what they did in the the TV series - but so what? The series was a kid's show from the eighties and we are now in an entire new century! Michael Bay gave the Transformers a much needed upgrade. The IBM PC was running MS-DOS when the first Autobot and Decepticon revealed themselves on TV, and nobody had even heard about Internet until well after the original Transformers series ended. Some could not transform because of legal issues - and some items looked just plain dumb in 2007.<br/><br/>I just have to agree with Steven Spielberg: ""Michael Bay was born to make Transformers"""
"conradcarlo_venzon-1","9","3","8","28 June 2007"," Bumblebee did everything he could for Sam
","From the start and until he lost his legs. He did the most for Sam. For me, he's the hero of the autobots aside from prime and the others. At the start, when Sam bought Him, he never left Sam's side, he's always there as his protector from harm and he's there to witness Mikaela and Sam's sweet moment(Wonderful scene)! There is a scene in the movie that I particularly laugh at when I saw it. It was when Sam was 3 minutes late, and he had to get his Great grandpa's glasses, the autobots couldn't wait for him so they went to Sam's house(They're outside of course). When Sam's parent noticed a flash of bright light coming from Sam's room, they checked on Sam and went to see the ruckus at Sam's window. The autobots were hiding( I laughed every time I see this scene even though I've already watched this film for like... 5 times in a row yesterday). Bumblebee is the funniest of them all... I love funny characters. But this movie isn't just for laugh and action, there's also a sad scene. It's when bumblebee got caught and there are sector 7 agents everywhere. I don't want to say what they did.. Especially for those who haven't watched this movie yet. But I gotta say, this movie will make you want to watch it over and over again until the mall closes! And even though your pants are wet from holding a grudge(I mean if you already peed but you wouldn't want to miss a scene from the movie), you'd still hold it. So buckle up your sits, because this movie is one bumpy ride!!!(I mean in a great way!) Great Movie and I'm planning to watch this great movie again with all my friends. 1000 thumbs up!(If I had THAT many)"
"Alex_Priest","8","3","8","28 June 2007"," Michael Bay,King of the Day
","After giving us The Rock,Armageddon,Bad Boys I & II and The Island,Michael Bay surprises again with his latest ""artwork"" Transformers.<br/><br/>Let's face it,Bay is an action director.<br/><br/>His movies cannot be compared to masterpieces like the Godfather,but only to other action movies.<br/><br/>And believe me,he is effectively good in creating action movies. He has proved that nobody makes them as good and thrilling as him.<br/><br/>So,who cares if the movie is not faithful to the 80s cartoon?<br/><br/>No movie is 100% faithful to its source.That is a fact.<br/><br/>Within 2+ hours,Bay manages to leave us stunned and breathless as we watch the amazing effort he put to create this movie.<br/><br/>The CGI,like always,is at its best,much like the action sequences. The Autobots and the Decepticons finally come to life in this movie and they are realistic enough,given the genre of the movie.<br/><br/>The cast is great,with shining performances from Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox in the main roles. <br/><br/>Also,if you watch many movies(hard not to,this is IMDb!)you will recognize many actors in the supporting cast. Perhaps its the first time Bay utilizes such a big cast.<br/><br/>Now,any mature viewer,who is willing to pay the ticket fee,surely knows that beneath the big,flashy explosions,beneath the fast car races and the big robot battles,Transformers is another unreal,all-American,action blockbuster. There really is no need to criticize this movie.<br/><br/>For what it is,it succeeds.<br/><br/>I had doubts when I first saw that Michael Bay was going to direct this movie.I thought it would have been another animation/3D movie like many others.<br/><br/>What Bay gave me,pleasantly enough,was much much more.<br/><br/>So,my final advice would be:<br/><br/>Forget All the Physics you Learned at School,<br/><br/>Forget What You Know,<br/><br/>Forget Who You Are,<br/><br/>Go,see this movie and be Trans-formed!"
"Rooster9","8","3","8","28 June 2007"," Michael Bay Finds His Niche
","Steven Spielberg was right. ""Transformers"" is a great fit for Michael Bay. The king of action, flashy effects, macho posturing, cornball humor and over-stylized photography should have been doing cartoon adaptations from the beginning. What seemed cheesy in ""The Island"" and over the top in ""Pearl Harbor"" mostly works in ""Transformers."" Much of it has to do with Shia Labouf's likability, a quick-paced and often-funny script and amazing special effects.<br/><br/>Of course, the script doesn't offer much in the way of story (good robots plus bad robots equal big explosions). But it does give us some great action set pieces and one truly great Spielbergian sequence right in the middle of the film. Take a few friendly aliens, throw them in a boy's backyard, hide them from the parents and fend off the men in black, and you've got ""Close Encounters"" meets ""E.T."" meets ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park."" And Bay pulls it off with truly funny results.<br/><br/>From that point on, however, it's all action. And that may be the film's biggest weakness... or greatest asset, depending on your perspective. Characters fall by the wayside, big story set-ups get cursory finales, and one particular death scene is rushed and quickly forgotten (especially strange for a director who loves dramatic music and slow motion photography).<br/><br/>Most importantly, though, the robots are AWESOME. And THIS is why Spielberg hired Bay. The effects are real. The Autobots and Decepticons lumber, fly, battle, roar and smash. When they fight, you can feel the metal crunching, and when they fall, the ground shudders. But the frenetic fight choreography is both frustrating and exciting. Sometimes the film is way too cluttered with tangled robot arms and weapons, even if the chaos does add a real-world dimension to the effects' believability.<br/><br/>Anyway, ""Transformers"" is two hours of good looking people shooting at cars and robots, running away from cars and robots, and watching cars and robots explode. And it's pure entertainment.<br/><br/>Best part: check out the producers' ""f**k you"" to Volkswagen near the beginning of the film. Bernie Mac makes the scene."

In all the years of movie-making, I don't think the image of a truck transforming into a 20-foot tall robot has ever been captured on screen. I also want to make a film that's a homage to 1980s movies and gets back to the sense of wonder that Hollywood has lost over the years. It will have those Spielberg-ian moments where you have the push-in on the wide-eyed kid and you feel like you're 10 years old even if you're 35."""
"depthcharge-2","7","3","8","28 June 2007"," My Popcorn Cup Overfloweth
","Michael Bay has sunk a small flotilla of his Pearl Harbour demons with the high-octane, CGI-laden, robopron that is Transformers.<br/><br/>Sure the fanboys will bore us all to the planet Tedium with their critiques of the minutiae and demand some sort of supreme interplanetary justice that the Camaro gets redrawn as a VW Beetle in the Director's Edition DVD-set with Limited Edition Lube Dispenser. But for most of us, who gives a flying box of bananas? The film successfully treads that fine balance between kids-own-adventure-that-will-sell-gazillions-of-toys and popcorn actioner explosive enough and well scripted enough to have the more discerning set checking in for the ride.<br/><br/>Armed with a rudimentary knowledge of the Transformers mythology and an increasingly underwhelming view of modern blockbusters (Spidey 3 and Pirates 3, 300, most other 3's, your number's up), I turned up to the film with low expectations but left eagerly pecking stuff like ""best CGI eva"" and ""Shia's gonna rock it as young Indy"" into my handset.<br/><br/>Though not quite perfect: the goofy Sector Seven team dragged the middle act into high camp territory and the hacking team seemed to get totally lost in the flying climax debris, such flaws only mildly tarnished the metallic sheen of a masterpiece of metal-shredding mayhem. Let's face it, who doesn't drool over squadrons of A-10's pounding searing rounds of whatevernium-tipped shells into 50ft robots, it's bloody great.<br/><br/>Oh and you may want to start updating all your home cinema components to HDMI.

"Ciberus","10","3","8","28 June 2007"," Apart From a Few Minor Hiccups, This is one film of the times
","Now, before I rave on about this movie, I will say that I never had watched the cartoon series of Transformers and had little idea of what to expect. I'd heard the hype but was sceptical with the knowledge that Hollywood hype is nothing to write home about. A few examples include Spiderman 3, The 90's Batman movies, Smoking Aces, Hannibal and almost every sequel of the last ten years that has followed up the original title that was a revolutionary for its time (The Matrix anybody?)<br/><br/>Besides the flawless CGI and visual effects, that have superseded anything of my generation and the generation before it, this movie had several assets that made the movie an experience to behold. Bay and Spielberg were very clever on the selection table with a cast, which may be established within the industry (Las Vegas, Disturbia and anything Jon Voight has done) they chose people who have an ability to act and delivery in a unique fashion and an effective way, over the usual Hollywood big names. The dialogue, which I expected to be filled with one liners and cheesy tyrades from key characters was surprisingly fresh and witty and as I found in the cinema I watched it in, received laughter and found relevance. This is explicitly clear in the way the script takes a ridiculous scene or notion (which is bound to happen in a Transformer film) and made fun of itself and took your mind off the situation with its humour. <br/><br/>Also the change of tone within the script brought action, humour and drama, intertwining all these separate genres into a script that captures your imagination and drags you through these separate emotions. The score was fitting, the transformers themselves were portrayed stunningly and in a modern sense, without destroying the character of the different transformers in this transition. In other words, the only problem that I could really find with the movie besides continuations and goofs which are a given, was the voice of Megatron. Don't get me wrong Hugo Weaving was fitting for the role, but I simply felt that they hid his voice under the disguise of the former voice portrayed in the series. I thought a more Matrix style voice (i.e Agent Smith) would subtly create a more evil formation of Megatron but nonetheless the voice was good at worst. The build up to the appearance of all the Transfomers was captivating in itself.<br/><br/>I never thought I'd hear myself rave about such a film, but the fact that I decided to finally post a review about a movie shows the effect this film can have on even the most cynical and sceptical. In other words, give it a go, forget the hype and enjoy the moment, cause trust me...the hype doesn't get lost in the movie and the film leaves itself open for more to come with a story that gives the basics without giving too much away.<br/><br/>CPF"

"burnit_now","8","3","8","28 June 2007"," Transformers? More like Independence Day vs Aliens vs Predator
","Overall, a great action movie. But it could've been so much more.<br/><br/>As a film, it had everything that people new to Transformers would like. Action, a bit of comedy and a bit of romance with Hollywood A Grade special effects.<br/><br/>But if you knew the storyline of the original Transformers... you'd realize one thing... The Autobots and Decepticons are the main characters. Hence, the reason for my title, as this film is indeed Independence day, mixed with some Alien Vs Predator action. I find it really hard to enjoy an adapted film when it doesn't follow it's source material.<br/><br/>Michael Bay does a good job with telling the action. But since I'm looking at the film in a director's point of view, action and adventure isn't enough. Telling a story is important. Unfortunately, the story is lacking in this film. It is very lenient and even though there was 3 Hours to tell the story, there wasn't much character development, as there were too many parallel story lines and characters.<br/><br/>Robot design as great and realistic. Megatron is as cool as he should be. But screen time for these characters... hhhmmm...<br/><br/>I really do hope that the sequel will be much better. I hope that it will be the Judgement Day of Transformers as it was for Terminator. What was great about Terminator 2 was it's deep storyline, focusing on the Terminator and the mythology.<br/><br/>I'm guessing this film was to introduce to the entire world of Transformers. And I really wish that in T2, they will have more elements from the animation which made it such a hit. As the real protagonists are meant to be the Cybertronians themselves."
"AdrianwithaW","9","3","8","27 June 2007"," Pretty damn good. Will try not to spoil it...
","OK, so it's not that true to the original story and OK the transformers aren't similar to that of the cartoon. But I think making a movie in 2007 with a bunch of cars from the early 80's would've looked a bit crap to be honest... Come on, here's some sort of superior race of robotic beings from another galaxy but they decide they wanna stay looking like (for one) a rusty old Volkswagon Beetle from the 70's? Lets face it, this story was going to need to be brought 20 years down the track or it'd have looked dated. Well I think anyway.<br/><br/>I think this is a great film. It has everything a film like this is supposed to have - humour, a bit of cheese, some epic orchestral music, plenty of action, a little eye-candy, no weird hero- gone-emo sequence (sorry Spiderman 3) but most importantly the never-gets-old battle between good and evil. And it does it all well, after the first joke I thought to myself 'Ah oh.... please don't ruin this movie with crappy comedy' and yet 5 minutes later I found myself laughing along with the whole cinema. I'm a cynical person at the best of times but this movie did everything it should of, did it pretty well and most importantly, reminded me of how friggin cool Transformers really are.<br/><br/>Ever since the possibilities of CGI cinema have been apparent to me, this was the movie I hoped they'd make and I for one am not disappointed. By all means go and see it to decide for yourself but as some one who loved the toys and watched the show when I was old enough to understand it but young enough to not fully appreciate it, I really loved it."
"dbnguyen85","1","5","17","11 December 2008"," The focus of the movie was just plain lost.
","I should say now that I wasn't a huge Transformers fan growing up. Where I lived I couldn't easily get the cartoons and so on, so I only had a smattering of it now and then.<br/><br/>But even then this movie was terrible.<br/><br/>I'm not going to comment at length as others had on the focus on lame human characters in a movie essentially about giant robots. It might even be considered aside the point that these robots have had 20 years of refined character but in the movie were sidelined for horny teenagers.<br/><br/>But what bothered me (though didn't surprise me, considering it's Michael Bay) was the simple extensive focus on American things.<br/><br/>I understand, and it's okay, that the focus is on America. Most movies are. But the movie tried to pretend that an invasion from hostile alien robots only happened to Americans. This is quite silly.<br/><br/>What really got to me though, was that in a movie with, again, giant cool robots with alien technology and so on... Michael Bay was showcasing American military hardware. This could be fine in any of his other random summer action flicks, but in a movie with, I repeat, giant robots, it's stupid at best. We don't need to know, with Tom Clancy detail, about the weapons on American fighter jets. We don't care, or at least we shouldn't, when there are, again, Giant Robots to fill the screen regarding technology and action. It just seems like he doesn't know how else to make a movie if it doesn't zoom in on a fighter and tell you its schematics.<br/><br/>This, among the other points that other commenters have said with frequency, makes Transformers not just disappointing to fans, but just a nonsensical movie which, at its very best, is just bad and not to be taken seriously. Or hilarious, because it takes itself too seriously for the (lack of) quality in the plot."

In a summer filled with CG downers it is refreshing to see a movie that so feverishly holds onto practical elements. Everything in this movie, even the robots of the title, look real, and when the heroes (mechanical and carbon-based) are in perilous situations, you really feel it. It has plenty of Michael Bay-esquire military might, and his pseudo science, but there is plenty of humor and heart to reach the broad audience that it so desperately aims for. The only thing that ""TransFans"" will have issue with are the fact that it is not wall-to-wall robots, such as those featured in the original 1986 film. But for everyone else, it's a blast. Shia Lebouf and Megan Fox are the perfect human surrogates for a Cybertronian battle, and you'll leave cheering."

","""Utter Garbage"" those words I have to use these days to describe Hollywood movies that come out so often. Before I start let me say that I had transformer toys when I was young, and I know what a huge potential the transformer movie could be.<br/><br/>But now with :<br/><br/>'Garbage' that fills Hollywood 'rubbish' directors, 'filthy' movie companies <br/><br/>You can turn a nice car into a scarp garbage that you find in a junk yard, that's exactly what the film does, it turns a mega movie story into a junk yard garbage."

","Today i saw this movie and i can tell you that the story is very simple, no Tarantino or guy ritchie here dudes.<br/><br/>Best is to compare this movie with fast food. It's got to be quick, simple greesy, aggressive, hot and a lot. That is exactly what this flick brings. Hot cars and chicks (mikaela, oh my god) ans superb action.<br/><br/>It's like a roller coaster great and full of action from the beginning to the end.<br/><br/>The critics all have something against Bay i think. Go see the English Patient for crying out loud then.<br/><br/>This is a action movie with no crap in between. Ans i like the Bay style of editing, like Armageddon, great TV.<br/><br/>If you want action, and i mean top notch. Go see this movie, this will be in you're top 5 4 ever list."
"the amorphousmachine","5","3","9","13 July 2007"," More Shia LeBeouf than should have met the eye!
","Michael Bay's live-action version of the popular 1980s cartoon series in 'The Transformers' is quite a spectacle in visual effects and action set pieces. However, unlike the 1986 animated film, Bay's version feels vastly different to the original concept that made the cartoon so loved. While certain characters- such as Optimus Prime and Bumblebee- look close to their original design and had understandable changes, the rest of them seem a mess of CGI and metallic bits that confuses and assaults the eye.<br/><br/>I'll say it, Megatron sucked! Not only was he hardly in the movie, which made him less of a worthy adversary to Optimus Prime, he didn't even look remotely close to the original character. Hugo Weaving's voice over is nowhere near as good as Frank Welker's throaty sinister tone (though I understand that Welker's voice had aged too much for the role). Pretty much all the Decepticons sucked with the exception of the new addition in Blackout. The most annoying Decepticon had to be the bumbling and elusive Frenzy, who kept talking in gibberish throughout the whole movie. Some of the audience members may wonder what happened to Scorponok- who briefly appears in the desert but never comes back. At times, I did find this film a little confusing in it's action set pieces as to what was actually going on. For instance, I didn't know which Autobot Megatron was fighting on the rooftop, until Optimus Prime mentions his name later.<br/><br/>However, the main problem with this movie is the human element to it, and some silly obvious references to the cartoon. You may as well call this movie ""The Annoying Kid from Disturbia fights Alien Robots"" cause Shia LeBeouf- who plays Sam Witwicky- is very pivotal to this film, so much so, that the film seems more about him than the actual Transformers. Sometimes, he's okay, but other times, his dialogue is just silly and unbelievable. The beginning of the film, Shia is doing the usual teen things, getting a cool car whilst trying to lose his awkwardness around really hot girls such as Megan Fox. Of course, with a little help from his really cool vehicle that happens to be an Autobot named Bumblebee- Shia manages to get to know Megan Fox and even manages to tell her that she is ""more than meets the eye"". And if you didn't get that was referencing the original series, he repeats it very slowly for you.<br/><br/>Add in a few army guys, a few sound geeks led by a really bad actress, Jon Voight, John Turturro in an over-the-top comedic secret agent shtick, and not to forget Shia LeBeouf's overly embarrassing clueless parents; then this movie becomes seriously bogged down by human characters. Understandable that we need the human element, but when it takes an hour and a half to introduce Optimus Prime's main arch-rival (as well as other cooler Decepticons), then Transformers seems to lose its robotic edge in establishing itself as the supposedly kick-ass movie of the year. Like Spidey 3, TMNT, Ghost Rider, this film gets bogged down in stupidity and unnecessary comedy.<br/><br/>As for Michael Bay's direction, it was nicely stylised, and with his usual slick flare in showing shot's of cool vehicles. The final battle is quite impressive, but the overall plot seems by the numbers, and there was far too much winking to the audience within the dialogue. I also noticed that Bay even uses the same annoying circular camera trick for an action scene with Frenzy (where the camera does a 360 horizontally around the room) that was already tiresome in Bad Boys II. Michael Bay just honestly lacks the magic that Spielberg puts into his films! All in all, the film does have really good VFX, but I still think the Sandman sequence in 'Spider-man 3' is the best I've seen this year! However, I wouldn't be surprised if 'Transformers' gets a visual f/x nod at the Oscars next year. If that's worth anything, you may as well see it. Right now, I feel like the odyssey of 2007 blockbusters to be extremely disappointing in some regard, and while I believe Bay had a hard task, he seems to have forgotten that the Decepticons had a lot of depth too as characters. With the exception of Bumblebee and Optimus Prime, it seems the rest of the Transformers took a backdrop to their human counterparts in the depth department.<br/><br/>**Â½ out of *****!"
"ispeedonthe405","2","3","9","10 July 2007"," Falls short of all reasonable expectations
","The way I see it there are two problems with this movie.<br/><br/>First, there were a dozen extra characters who served no purpose other than to prolong a barely connected subplot. Threads were begun -- one taken directly from Independence Day -- that had no resolution or real bearing on the story. The result is a good forty minutes you could edit out without impacting the story at all.<br/><br/>Second, this is a Transformers movie in which key players didn't start appearing until halfway into the film. It feels less like a dramatic buildup and more like a floundering story. Only a fraction of the movie contains fighting between the bots and there's even less in the way of character background or development. While most of the Autobot personalities you do see will be familiar to us 30-somethings, we never really get to know the Decepticons at all.<br/><br/>The only positive thing I can say about the film is that the few battles you do get look great. In the end I think it suffers from lack of focus and not delivering enough of what I really wanted to see. Reinventing the story is absolutely fine. But at its core, it's supposed to be about epic Good vs Evil featuring transforming robots. That's just not what this movie was about."

","I was actually slightly motion sick after leaving this film, so my final impression of it is somewhat marred by that, but overall this was dumb summer fun at its best. I was the right age for the transformer toys, but I never really got into them. However, having played with them is not a prerequisite for enjoying the film.<br/><br/>These kind of movies crack me up. They are so obvious in their intentions to traffic in the gut emotions of an audience not used to thinking very critically about what they are watching. This film, like most of Michael Bay's films, is a gussied up military recruitment ad, the kind where all of the soldiers in it are muscled and oily, and where they do a lot of walking toward the camera in emphatic slow motion. There are girls in the film (two of them, to be exact), but they're basically just guys with breasts and nice legs. The government is to be feared and distrusted, because they keep secrets from the American people (like the fact that the Hoover Dam was really built as a facade to hide alien robots and their belongings), while the military is heroic and manly. To make itself feel relevant, the film even throws in some action scenes set in the Middle East.<br/><br/>It was refreshing, though, that for once all of the chest-thumping is not reserved solely for the United States, but rather for the human race in general. The message in ""Transformers,"" other than that geeky teenagers have the stuff soldiers are made of, is that the human race isn't so bad after all, even if we have a lot to learn.<br/><br/>Grade: A-"
"prillyisyourfriend","9","3","9","8 July 2007"," Protects and Destroys
","All right, hands down, in my opinion, this was the best action movie I have seen so far. I sat in the theater speechless, always anxious to see what was next. I loved loved LOVED it, but of course, it had its low points. The fighting between the robots were near to perfection (although very unrealistic when dealing with reactions of citizens and Sam's parents) and were possibly the best parts in the movie. You gotta love those slow-motion transforming parts. However, I absolutely hated the dialog of the robots. They said some pretty cheesy and unnecessary things. I wasn't feeling their voices either but I guess that was as good as it can get. And, I'm starting to warm up to Shia. I despised his role in the Disney series Even Stevens, but seeing his role in Disturbia and now Transformers, I think he will become or already is a great actor. Now about Megan Fox... she's hot. Extremely hot. But I walked in the theaters not expecting much from her character and as soon as I saw the first scene she was in, I knew I was right. She seldom did much to help and she's not a very good actress. She seems like a total girly girl even though she knew a lot about trucks. I don't know about you, but if I was dragged involuntarily to deal with massive destructive robots, I'd be screaming my ass off and not just tragically stare at the scary robots. There were some parts that confused me when I would just be like WTF ARE THEY SAYING but this movie is all about action and Michael Bay pretty much nailed it. And I was expecting Megatron's defeat to be much more... action-y. Oh well. As long as there's a sequel, I ain't complaining. Good job, Michael Bay. 9/10 for me."

"Robert_duder","9","3","9","6 July 2007"," Big, Huge, and downright amazing...throw my thoughts into the argument
","Well this summer is turning into really something. Usually I can pinpoint one great summer blockbuster that I actually think is a blockbuster. This summer I've already been treated to THREE huge 10/10's for me and Transformers was no exception. As with any big Michael Bay film this one appears to be steeped in controversy as warring factions either loved it with a passion or hated it to their very core. I think for once I am in the majority. I am an eighties child and I might have had a Transformer figure or two but I can't ever remember sitting down to watch the cartoons...or reading the comics...it just didn't happen for me. I remember them, I mean they were everywhere so I had no real biased towards or against The Transformers. Still the trailers made it look like an awesome special effects action extravaganza and sure enough it probably is THEE big budget, explosions and just a huge Summer movie. Transformers should and will appease the most adamant Transformers fans and newcomers to the entire subject and just rock them to the core. Transformers creates a decent world and plot line and then throws the most unimaginable creatures into it and where the film could have been campy and ridiculous they pulled off every inch of the exact opposite. It wasn't perfect, it had it's share of short comings but the most important thing is that you won't spend a minute regretting your time in the theater watching this true 'blockbuster.' <br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf, who is really becoming the ""IT"" kid for Blockbusters as of late (Disturbia, Indiana Jones IV), plays unsuspecting geeky high schooler Sam Witwicky. The best thing about LaBeouf in all his roles is that he's very down to earth. He looks like the guy next door, an average joe and to have this incredible thing happens to him is just very watchable. LaBeouf ultimately is always the same in his performances. I have yet to see anything different from him and yet it works every time and it works for this film. He holds the screen well amidst some ""big"" co-stars. Relative newcomer Megan Fox is LaBeouf's love interest who is the typical popular girl who gets thrown into a crazy situation with the geeky kid and pushes them together. Fox is hot...there isn't any denying that but that doesn't mean she fits the film. In fact she sticks out as never really doing anything. She truly is the exact definition of eye-candy because she is always weary short skirts, low cut tops and they even shoot her from very specific angles but never once does she have any real purpose to the film. Even her performance is very dry and low key and just all around rather disappointing. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson play military men bent on protecting US Interests from the Transformers. Both do a decent job although the roles are very small and I would have especially liked to see a bigger from Duhamel who I really like and I think he has a lot of potential for the big screen. The supporting cast includes Jon Voight, John Turturro, Anthony Anderson, and Rachael Taylor. With the exception of Turturro they all do a decent job with their small roles. Turturro is overblown, overacted, and kind of silly for the film.<br/><br/>The human actors in general are not what this film is about and the film makers including director Michael Bay made sure of that by making the Transformers truly larger than life with downright incredible CGI, voice over work from terrific voice actors including Peter Cullen, and Charles Adler both who did voice work on the original Transformers series. The Transformers had personalities and distinct maneuvers and you could easily pick a favorite. You never once got tired of watching them transform which was just downright cool every single time. The special effects where amazing!! In true Michael Bay style things get blown up a lot and some people seemed to wanna complain and moan about that but if it works it works and in this case it most definitely works. Is it shallow at time? Definitely. Plot holes? Well there almost has to be. It doesn't change the world it just is one of the best films of the year for entertainment purposes and will most likely go on to be one of the highest grossing films of all time because it's DAMN entertaining. Despite what people say about Bay I think he has the potential to tell a great story with incredible visuals. I thought The Island was really good, Armageddon, and The Rock, downright incredible action films and Transformers lives up to that reputation. In the beginning of the film I was a little worried that the pace was a little slow considering the film clocks in at a HUGE 2 1/2 hours, some of the comedy in the film is oddly placed and sometimes seemingly inappropriate and the dialog definitely borders cheesy. But there is just something really impressive about the film that makes you overlook all of that. The battles and the action and the special effects are incredible. It pretty much meets almost anyones expectations and knocks it out of the park. See it for yourself and experience a once in a life time film. 9.5/10"

","When I first got word they were making a live action version of Transformers, I'll admit, I got excited. Now I'm not Michael Bay fan, though I do enjoy a handful of his films--so when he was announced the director, I shrugged. I figured if anyone was going to direct a movie about giant robots turning into cars, then who else to make it than Michael Bay.<br/><br/>Anyway--I saw the movie today and felt compelled to write something about it. I've seen that so far it has received good reviews from fans on this site as well as a lot of positive praise all over the internet, which COMPLETELY baffles me! What are you guys seeing that I'm not? Did we watch the same movie or was the cut of this thing I saw some kind of rough cut piece of crap. Okay, let me break it down into pros and cons, because everything has two sides.<br/><br/>Okay--the good: 1.) Hot chicks 2.) Explosions 3.) Cool climax at the end That's it. So many things were happening in this film that annoyed me that I never really felt comfortable about anything going on nor care about any of the characters.<br/><br/>Okay--the bad: 1.) First the Transformers, since most of you seeing this movie are going to see them.<br/><br/>--Stupid stereotypes: Jazz was a ghetto robot, Bumblebee was basically Junkion from Transformers (1986).<br/><br/>--They look stupid and during battles, you can't tell who is who.<br/><br/>--They all have terrible lines.<br/><br/>--You don't care about them, because they have zero character.<br/><br/>--The bad guys die very easily.<br/><br/>--No suspense in the battle scenes, because, well--you can't tell what's happening.<br/><br/>--Shockwave was like the Jar Jar Binks of the Transformer movie.<br/><br/>Now for other bad things: 2.) Horrible script--it was like the Terminator. These robots traveled millions of miles to find a pair of GLASSES ON EBAY?! What the hell?! Who wrote this script? It was so stupid. And people are complaining that Spiderman 3 was terrible, yet are giving this movie such endless praise...man, I must be on the wrong planet.<br/><br/>3.) Bad editing--So much is going on that I don't think anyone involved in this project knew what they were doing. Or what was happening or why. When it came to watching this thing, my eyes hurt! 4.) Horrible music.<br/><br/>5.) Some of the worst battles I've ever seen. $150 million dollars to make it and you still couldn't see what has happening on the screen. The smaller battles worked for me, but the big city climax was a bit over the top and so badly constructed that I didn't even know who was dying.<br/><br/>6.) 2D characters--but that's a small compliant. You don't go into a movie like this for good characters anyway, right? It's a Summer Blockbuster and you go to see the big bangs, the robots, a hot girls running around.<br/><br/>7.) Lame coming of age story.<br/><br/>8.) All the subplots could have been cut--I mean it was like four different movies going on at the same time that you, as a viewer, had no idea who the movie wanted you to care about: Boy and his car, Soldier trying to get home to his wife and kids, a woman who works for the government and her hacker friend who likes donuts, and a dog with a broken leg. Come on, choice a central character and let the audience follow them! 9.) Tried to be funny, but wasn't.<br/><br/>I don't know, maybe I should stop now. I mean it's bad enough I wasted money to see this stupid movie and now I'm wasting more time on it tell you why I hated it. Chances are a lot of you will still go and see it and that's fine, but be warned. This is not as good as people are telling you. People from the ages of 10 to 18 will love it. Men between the ages of 18-25 will love it too, unless they are film majors. If I were you, I'd use my money and see something good like Ratatouille, Live Free or Die Hard, or anything else at the box office. This was a waste! I wouldn't even download this movie for free to watch it again--that's how bad it is.<br/><br/>Well I warned you."
"lambiepie-2","8","3","9","4 July 2007"," A great adaptation of a popular cartoon
","Let me state the obvious and why I scored this pretty high even with my problems in this film: this will go down as one of the best adaptations of a popular cartoon to date. And how refreshing it was to see robots that looked like robots and not men in silly rubber suits. The special effects was top notch and this will be the film to beat in that area come Academy Award time.<br/><br/>And let me say this: this is a guy's film. And that isn't a bad thing, it's rather good except for the blatancy of it being a ""guys"" film with an element of Spielberg magic mixed in - the child with the ""My Little Pony"" stuffed toy (was that Hasbro too? Great joke if so!) and the Decepticon that reminded me a lot of *batteries not included.<br/><br/>For example, I loved the military guys - but their characters were not flushed out enough for me. I think it was because they wanted to get the teen element going. And that is one of the problems I had with the film.<br/><br/>This film spent too much attention on the teen element: Shia LeBouf (or whatever his name was) was adequate. The female teen was as cardboard as most women in Micheal Bay movies (He REALLY needs to work on that). Nothing to write home to mom about.<br/><br/>Speaking out what I think is one of Micheal Bay's biggest problems is that in many of his films, the women are lost in characterizations and they just seem to be there to keep the attention of the guys when the cars weren't screeching, transforming or metal was clanking itself together. Yeah, they tried to give them a story ... but as usually it was rushed and falls flat as a pancake. Be honest - take a minute to think of these women (two ...and the momma) ...and now take them out of the film. Miss them? No. And the tow truck driving at the end? Any male character could have done it. Would have LOVED to see some testosterone there to keep the action going like the military man who grabbed the motorcycle and kicked royal butt! She was no big whoop...except for the reasons I stated above.<br/><br/>I would have given this film a ten if they got RID of the teen(s) and his first car element. If the story focused on the military men - that would have been fine. But the question of who would have gotten the Camaro needed to be solved. With better writing in that area, it could have been without the ho-hum teens and annoying parents.<br/><br/>The other thing that bothered me was the camera work. I was never a fan of the shaky hand held MTV-type camera work and they should have left it alone here. There was some amazing special effects going on that was drowned in parts by this shaky-amateur camera work. Maybe its because Micheal Bay doesn't like Downtown Los Angeles. Everything seems to come to a head down there for him, and speaking as a bi-coastal Los Angeleno - it is a shaky place....<br/><br/>Bottom line: I was hyped up and totally satisfied with Optimus Prime, Megatron, Bumblebee, Jazz and all the rest of the Transformers and transform they did. Wonderful! Amazing! And as many reviewers before me have pointed out - the humans in this film were ...very second tier compared to them. And because of Optimus Prine, Megatron, Bumblebee, Jazz and all the rest of the Autobots and Decepticons is why this film got very high marks from me. <br/><br/>This special effects work of making one of my favorite cartoons come 'alive' was outstanding, well worth the time even over my nit-picky objections and the hope that Transformers 2 (Oh come on - you KNOW there will be one!) story will be more worthy of them, the women inserted will actually be integral to the plot and we'll see some of those ""other"" Transfomers we know will have us screaming in our seats now that we see them in all their glory in live action."

","i personally enjoyed the Transformers film. a lot actually. it was exactly what i expected,a cross between spiderman, war of the worlds, king Kong, and Rambo i think Micheal Bay successfully created an entertaining film. i know i know, Micheal Bay isn't the best director, but if you think about it, his movies are pretty much cartoon like to begin with, only it doesn't work out with movies like pearl harbor...because pearl harbor wasn't based on a cartoon/action figure series. i give this film a 10/10, because, me being a huge transformers fan to begin with, found when optimus prime spoke, it was better than listening to Beethoven's 9th."
"jdd65-1","8","3","9","4 July 2007"," Nothing but ""Edge of My Seat"" FUN!!
","I will concede this movie has a lot of shortcomings such as under developed and needless characters and some continuity issues. However, from the moment this movie started, I felt like I was taken back to my childhood and I had just gotten home from school, grabbed a snack, and stationed myself in front of the TV for an episode of The Transformers. This movie is fun! It won't win awards or be glorified for its stinging social commentary (although I thought the George Bush ""cameo"" was very funny), but if you want to lose yourself for two plus hours, this is a great film to do that. I thought they stayed true to the story and preserved the original feel while providing incredible effects and CG. The robots even made a similar sound when they transformed as they did in the TV show. The effects are incredible! Especially some of the military hardware they use in conjunction with the CG was fluid and fit better than I have ever seen. I would have liked to seen more dialog from the robots (the comments like Prime saying ""My Bad"" were really funny), but when I left the theater I was grinning and laughing like a little kid. I haven't had this much fun at a movie in a long time. The entire crowd at my showing was a wide cross section of ages and backgrounds and every single person was into the movie and cheering and laughing and having a blast! I cannot adequately express how much fun I had at this movie. Surrender yourself to this experience and you will have a blast. Go into the theater to see ""an important film"" and you will be disappointed. I can't wait for the sequel!!!"
"mike_b_nimble","10","3","9","4 July 2007"," It's everything you were hoping it would be!
","Last summer when I saw the very first teaser trailer that showed little more than the word ""Transformers"" I nearly lost my mind. I almost couldn't stand the one year wait, all the while people were posting blogs about Michael Bay ruining the Transformers that we all grew up with. They couldn't have been more wrong. Although some people who feel the need to find things wrong with perfectly good, entertaining and thrilling movies might say otherwise, my experience watching transformers couldn't have been better. Visually the movie was all I could have hoped for and more. I went in with no expectations as to a plot and I was thoroughly impressed with the story. If you, like me, grew up loving the Transformers then you will leave the theatre with after-glow. The first time during the film that one of the Transformers made that famous ""leap"" from standing into a car, the audience could not contain themselves. The transformations are top notch, I was amazed at the level of detail they were able to pull off. If you are looking for great acting go rent a classic Bogart film, if you want to see the most visually impressive movie you are likely to see for a long time or a movie that will make you feel like a kid again; GO SEE TRANSFORMERS!!!!"

","Let me just say, for the most part, my attendance at this movie simply lied in the fact that my five-year-old was so excited to see it, so we took him the first day. Well, my entire family was in for quite a shock. I took my 14 year-old daughter, her friend, and my husband along, hoping for some good popcorn, at the best. As soon as the movie started, I was on for a ride that wouldn't quit. This movie takes you on an action journey that does not stop until two and a half hours later. The players were entirely believable, and the characters of the Transformers were extraordinary. I was not a Transformer fan growing up (Thundercat gal, here), and I am not a fan of action movies either; therefore, I was not really looking forward to this movie. I have NEVER enjoyed a movie like I did this one. There were too many fantastic scenes to name just one. Shia is a fantastic actor, and ALL of the roles were filled perfectly. This movie had something for everyone...action, special effects unseen before, drama, a love story, and humor. All of these elements were not isolated into their own packets of timing, but spread throughout the movie PERFECTLY. If you want to see an unbelievably entertaining, wonderful uplifting movie, go to see this one before it is off of the big screen! -Tait Klein, 37, mother of two"

","Body I totally agree with you. This was honestly the sickest movie i ever seen in my life. Well I don't know about others, this movie got me so excited that I couldn't even lean back and watch the movie. Im at my mid 20s also, I used to watch the cartoon and I consider this movie at a whole different level of creation. This movie is far beyond what we have seen until now, and its a total new experience. I enjoyed watching it and I want to see it for the 2nd time. I was at the edge of my sit during the whole movie and to be honest, there are no words to describe this movie. The way to robots transformed and the battle between the autobots and the decepticons was very impressive. I loved the backyard scene, where they were trying to find the glasses. The movie had jokes all along, but it never took me away from the movie. I would like to thank Michael Bay for his awesome movie."
"sky_bull","10","3","9","4 July 2007"," The BEST Action Movie of the Summer is Finally Here!
","Well, I grew up with this whole series, and I'm proud to say that I'm glad I stuck with them throughout all of these years! As much as I loved their first big screen adventure, they have evolved into a tremendous action extravaganza! Sure, there were a few flaws, and the toilet humor could have been bagged; however, the excellent military footage made me proud to be an American! And the TRUE stars of the movie were my beloved Transformers! It was a great honor to hear Peter Cullen taking the mantle of the illustrious leader of the Autobots. He has practically patented that line, ""One shall stand; one shall fall!""(The same line he used 21 years ago. I must further congratulate the writers for finally making a story that doesn't require Optimus Prime getting knocked off in order to achieve victory! ILM never disappoints, as usual, with the constant in-your-face special effects. These aliens were so real that I had to check my truck before getting into it when the movie was over! Even with Michael Bay directing, this epic has earned a sequel. I sure wouldn't mind if they show less humans and more Transformers, with the exception of the military hardware, of course! Either way, it looks like the ""Robots in Disguise"" has started a real gem of a franchise this time. Let's all hope it continues to accelerate!"
"MidnightWarrior","10","3","9","3 July 2007"," Stunning!!!
","After seeing this movie, I am completely stunned. Wow! The cast and crew have done a FANTASTIC job in all areas of this film.<br/><br/>With a big budget and pop culture iconic movie like this, there's an enormous risk for things to go completely wrong that would result in the film flopping, to say the least. Films such as the Hulk movie, or King Kong are a prime example of Hollywood flops. Both films have a great subject matter, but beyond that, there really is nothing else. And I think the producers and the director were constantly aware of this definite possibility of royally screwing up, and as such, felt a tremendous pressure to make Transformers successful, believable, entertaining and enjoyable.<br/><br/>One thing anyone who's seen the film will tell you is that Transformers doesn't try to be a reincarnation of a comic book it once was, or a ""live action"" 80's cartoon Transformers film. Sure there are one liners that the characters say that bring back memories from the original source, but this film paves newer ground and firmly stands it's ground.<br/><br/>Now before seeing this film, I wasn't very thrilled about the changes that I had heard that Michael Bay had made. But after viewing the film, I say why not? Are his choices daring? Somewhat. Do they work? I think so. And apparently, so did the rest of the people in the theater with me. Everyone clapped at the end.<br/><br/>The film's success shouldn't come as a surprise when you have head honchos like Michael Bay, Steven Spielberg and Don Murphy attached to this project. Of course the excellent subject matter (which, again, is really a big part of our pop culture), decent script (oooh, Hollywood got something right) and a respectable cast, aid in providing a film recipe for success.<br/><br/>My only film gripe was **SPOILER ALERT** that one of the good guys had to die. Granted I didn't like the car he was to begin with and even though we learn so little about his character, it's easy to side with him and consider him a part of the Autobot team. And with this particular Autobot (him being one of the good guys) well, it just wasn't pleasant to see his demise. **END SPOILER** The film has great direction, gobs of action and humor. And the very last scene was a total kick butt ending in the history of action films.<br/><br/>I also really liked the fact that this film puts away any personal self bias towards people and their ranks, personal stature or social status. Usually in films involving the military and the middle east, certain people are depicted as terrorists and they are the enemy. **SPOILER ALERT** But Transformers steers away from that. The film actually shows Americans and Middle Easterners coming together to collectively fight the Decepticons and their brethren. <br/><br/>The same thing reoccurs when the massive Autobots work together with the small humans. Again when the Secertary of Defense works with the lowly journalist. Again when the top dog of sector seven works with the average high school student and the juvenile criminal. And again, when the journalist comes together to work with the highly intelligent black male who lives at home with his grandmother. **END SPOILER**<br/><br/>When was the last time a big budget film brought together such a diverse group of people, working together for the same purpose? It's been a long time and that's what makes this film so cool! One of the underlying messages of the film is that regardless of our personal background and beliefs, we all have something to contribute. And once we contribute collectively, lowering the walls of our social rank roles, there's no limit to the goodness of what we can achieve when we come together. **SPOILER ALERT** In the case of Transformers, it's the fate of humanity and it's very survival. **END SPOILER**<br/><br/>Now should they decide to produce a sequel, I'll bet that it's going to be very difficult for them to make it as good, if not better, than this first one. People's expectations for another Transformers have been raised phenomenally.<br/><br/>I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a film so much. Think of Transformers like something along the lines of Terminator 2 meets Bad Boys II, but 100 times better. And you definitely should see this on the big screen - don't wait for the DVD."

Full of entertaining and excitement.<br/><br/>Of course, let's dun pick the problem on plot and story. Bay is never been good on this. The selling point is always on the CG.

","If you're are looking to just go to the movies and have a hell of a good time, this is the movie for you. And if my memory serve me correctly, thats why we go to the movies. Its not a thinker, and it doesn't have a complicated plot. And besides, I don't think anyone minds watching Megan Fox run around the screen. If i could sum this movie up in one sentence it would be this: Its and orgasm for the senses. well.....sight and hearing at least.<br/><br/>this is what entertainment is all about. its easily Micheal bay's best film, its badass, the visual effects are the most impressive of any movie to date, it has realistic humor and dialogue (I.E. bedroom scene), and hell.....its just cool. easily worth my $5.50. its the early bird special."
"darkangel_7","10","3","9","3 July 2007"," Simply Flippin' Awesome!!
","So I went to the premiere of The Transformers last night, turned out my theater was the first in North America to see the film! The reel actually showed up in a combination lock for God sakes! Now I went into this film a fan of the Transformers, having watched the G1 and Beast Wars series' growing up, so I like the many in the theater with me sporting Autobot/Decepticon attire were gonna be a hard crowd to win over. Well lets just say it was the first time I have ever attended a movie where the audience actually applauded at the end.<br/><br/>Now granted the story was a total tear down from the original series, but I felt it still was respectable to the franchise making the Allspark the cornerstone of the plot. There were great one-liners and comedic moments as well as little digs at itself such as when Shia's character accidentally mentions the ""More Than Meets The Eye"" slogan as he nervously talked to Meghan Fox's character and then says how stupid it was. There were even little lines made by Optimus and Megatron that paid homage to the original G1 series.<br/><br/>As for the CGI, it has to be the best I have ever seen in a film thus far, making the interaction between the humans and Transformers totally seamless, and providing the platform for some of the greatest fight scenes in cinema history.<br/><br/>Thank you Michael Bay! A definite 10/10!!"
"fortey","7","3","9","3 July 2007"," Michael Bay Still Sucks
","I enjoyed Transformers, I suppose, but at the same time can't help but feel somewhat dumber after watching it. That's the same feeling you get after any Michael Bay movie, however. The robots more or less look cool, except for the mouths which was some foolish stylistic choice which was already proved a non-issue with movies like Spiderman where we know the movie can play without seeing the character's face, nevermind needing to see a giant robot's lips when he talks. But whatever.<br/><br/>On the upside, much action chicanery abounds. Stuff blows up and there's giant robots. Huzzah! On the downside, I'm not sure anything in the movie really makes sense if you even try to ponder it. Since it's a movie based on a cartoon based on toys, I let that slide and still give it a 7 out of 10. But really, why was part of Megatron's plan to take over all the machines on Earth if he showed up 12,000 years ago? How many machines were hanging around back then? And when did Megatron learn English? Did he have a wi-fi connection in the ice there? Were Scorpinox and Starscream just sort of ignored at the end of the film because, despite what they said, they fully intended to make sequels or were those just loose ends no one considered because Michael Bay is a poor filmmaker? I put money on both being true.<br/><br/>The magic box that turns any machine into a fully armed robot probably sounded good at the time, but...what? I mean really, what? All of that is easily overlooked of course. What isn't easily overlooked is the dialogue. Because even when I was wincing, I could still hear it. I think it's entirely possible that every line that comes out of Optimus Prime's little metal mouth is the stupidest line ever. This makes for an interesting paradox of logic, as he has more than one line and, logically, they can't all be the stupidest line ever. But somehow they are. I wish this movie had a script editor who wasn't a 7 year old with head trauma. That would have really improved things.<br/><br/>That said, maybe in the sequel the robots won't be so cheeseball when they talk and perhaps the Decepticons will have some manner of personalities. It's kind of sad that a modern filmmaker can get away with not including that in a multi-million dollar film with the promise of maybe getting it in a sequel, but meh. What ya gonna do?"
"ashkul88","10","3","9","2 July 2007"," Brilliant - true Michael Bay with a touch of Spielberg masterclass!!
","I walked into the theater expecting a great movie, but even I was dazzled by the sheer magnificence of what hit me. From the opening massacre up until the end credits rolled, I physically was unable to move from my seat. The best directorial combination I have seen in years - Michael Bay's best decision was to be advised by the big man himself. Spielberg's touch is evident in the development of the characters and pardon the repetition of the relation between Bumblebee and Shia Leboeuf being a throwback to boy-and-ET. Computer graphics can not go unmentioned in relation to this movie, and dreamworks really outshone themselves. Great acting as well by Leboeuf. I felt he was one of the brightest things about Disturbia, and he's brought that same depth, innocence and intensity to his character in Transformers. While relations between the Transformers themselves could have been developed a wee bit more, it wouldn't improve much on the movie as it is (I'd mention scenes, but I'm keeping this review spoiler-free). Also detracting from sending this movie down in history as one of the best was probably an abundance of humour, which I believe was slightly overdone. While certain moments (think ""pheromones"") were pretty original and appreciated, some others were just cheesy (think ""S7 vest"") and, in my opinion, and provoked unnecessary giggles while they could have furthered characters. That being said, the movie still comes out smelling like roses - Michael Bay is here to stay. Last but definitely not least, no review is complete without a mention of the soundtrack. While I have heard a couple of people complain about how the soundtrack could have been more grand and less hip, I feel that the relative lack of orchestral scoring was well in keeping with the not-too intense mood of the film, and that at appropriate moments, the right kind of music (including some grand 'Lord of the Rings' stylised tunes) was used. As an Australian movie-goer commented, ""this movie couldn't have used those songs and still been what it was. It was amazing. Truly awesome. The music DID match the film very well. If I'd seen this list before I saw the movie I probably would of agree with all of you but the fact of the matter is that a lot of the songs break from each respective band's usual style. It worked. Believe me."" Let me conclude by stating firstly, that this is the first movie in which I stopped halfway through the movie to recognise just how perfectly the music flowed with the mood generated on screen. Secondly, the Bay-Spielberg combination was a marvel, but I believe they should leave well enough alone, and in my opinion, neither should agree to a sequel, as it can only disappoint after the stratospheric standards set by this film. Lastly, while this is no Lord of the Rings, look for a couple of Oscar nods, and a massive box office taking.<br/><br/>To summarise - Not flawless, but as close as humanly possible!!"
"voyagerbandi","10","3","9","1 July 2007"," Excellent
","The first thing that jumps at you at the beginning of the movie is that ... this is not a kid's movie (Helicopter scene with the squad playfully bantering with each other in the first 3 minutes).<br/><br/>The movie is militaristic and definitely adrenaline pumping. The scenes flow fluidly from one part to another, with little delay. You get pulled into the action, not merely the bystander.<br/><br/>There is chemistry between the characters. There is comedy. There is tragedy. There's a lot of eye candy, no doubt! But what makes it work is the balance that puts all the elements together. Ultimately a Great Job!!"
"top_gun_436","10","3","9","1 July 2007"," This is probably going to be the movie of the 2007, nothing else comes even close to it's amazing graphics, story line and acting
","Round of applause to Michael Bay, what an astonishing movie he has managed to bring to the big screen!!<br/><br/>A while ago i went to see the 3rd installment of the Spiderman series and like everyone else i was expecting it to be fantastic and mind-blowing, but i came out of it completely disappointed and let down!<br/><br/>After this shocking display given by Spiderman 3 i went into Transformers expecting the same result, a huge movie which has been given so much advertising and glorification that it was bound to crash and burn!<br/><br/>I couldn't have been more wrong!<br/><br/>I came out of the movie babbling incoherently for hours about its amazing CGI graphics, its masterful plot/humour and the acting delivered by a relatively young cast of main characters.<br/><br/>The battle scenes between the Autobots and the Decepticons were amazing! This movie has taken the visual graphics that we thought were possible, to an entirely new level!! No wonder this movie had taken so long to make, these guys covered every inch imaginable for the transformations of these characters and they way the presented themselves on the screen. Great work!<br/><br/>The trick to a movie like this was to develop a storyline that was continuously moving and was never in a state of submission. And that is exactly what the writers did, there was not a single dull moment that i could find in this movie! The humour was great, nothing stale and nothing over the top, great humour that we could all relate to!<br/><br/>And finally the acting, great job done by Shia as Sam, and Megan Fox alone adds a star to the rating (WHAT A BODY!!) It was great having actors in there that weren't overly famous, just good ones who do not draw attention to themselves in the real world.<br/><br/>In summary i think this movie is a step-up from the rest, it basically blows you away and makes you think ""Wow, there are actually some amazing movies being made!""<br/><br/>I can guarantee that whether you're a die hard fan or not, you'll come out feeling very satisfied!"
"Dan-121","10","3","9","30 June 2007"," Incredibly Entertaining
","If you are a Transformers fan, this is definitely not a movie to be missed. Seeing CGI Optimus Prime in a live action movie on the big screen just gives me the chills. It is every fans' dream come true.<br/><br/>The CGI is extremely well done and believable. It is almost as if real robots are being used. Although, understandably, the focus is on the robots, the cast does a good job. A good dose of humor is also injected into the movie. I particularly love the cameo by Bernie Mac. There are also touching moments particularly those between Sam and Bumblebee.<br/><br/>This movie is non-stop action from beginning to end. If you are an action fan, you won't be disappointed. Suffice to say, I love this movie. In fact, the only thing disappointing was that the movie is only 2 hours 20 minutes long. It should be longer!!<br/><br/>Bring on the sequels!!"
"andrewbradyclark","9","3","9","28 June 2007"," if you don't like this you're a cynical purist or you grew up
","1) There are lots of consistencies and inconsistencies between this flick, the cartoon, and the animated movie...guess what? It's not 198whatever anymore. We're in the Iraq war, not the end of the cold war.<br/><br/>3) It IS one GIANT commercial for the US army and several car companies (and, of course, Hasbro).<br/><br/>4) IT STILL ROCKS! In some reductionist, populist way it promotes the theory of the just war. It hearkens back to the childhood of any 20something male in this country. Peter Cullen (of eyeore fame) is STILL the voice of Optimus Prime, so you'll get shivers and start cheering when he speaks for the first time. The whole theater was cheering last night, when Prime made his first appearance.<br/><br/>The special effects are amazing which makes me disappointed that the promo has been lacking recently. The movie prolly won't bust blocks profit-wise.<br/><br/>Finally, the comic relief is reminiscent of lots of live-action remakes of cartoons from the 80s-90s: Teenage Mutant Ninka Turtles, He Man, Super Mario Brothers. It's GOOFY, but you'll love it."

","To be honest before I saw this movie I had my doubts about it, I was worried that it'd follow down the path of AVP, I was also doubtful about how the changes from the cartoon to the big screen, my expectations were very low and I though it would flop.<br/><br/>Then I saw this movie and in short: ""IT FRIGGIN ROCKED""<br/><br/>The combination of perfectly directed Action sequences and three way story lines later intertwining into one as the movie entered a very climatic action sequence<br/><br/>Bumblebee really stole the show early on bringing up songs on his radio that normally you wouldn't do just made the scene hilarious<br/><br/>There were a lot of nods to the original series from the original transformation noise, to a hilarious take on the classic quote ""More than meets the eye""<br/><br/>There were only two things that I am nit picking at; First is Megan Fox's character Mikaela she didn't really do much other than stand around and look pretty, Second was due to the Transformers incredible size during the action sequences it was a little difficult to figure out what was going on in some scenes,<br/><br/>But those aside, my Summary described it ""Best film this year so far"" <br/><br/>Oh and one more thing: DON'T DOWNLOAD IT OR WAIT FOR IT TO COME TO DVD, This is a film that's MADE for the big screen, on a TV screen even if you have a Plasma you won't get the enjoyment as much as you would on anything but a Cinema screen<br/><br/>Well done Michael Bay, your best movie ever!!!!!"

"jessegehrig","1","2","5","26 March 2014"," An entirely positive review for this movie
","Here is my four point plan for understanding this piece of sh*t movie: 1. Some studio actually chose Michael Bay to direct Transformers, like that was their best idea. 2. Shia LeBeouf is the lead. When people tell me Shia LeBeouf is good at acting, I've found that these same persons also don't watch very many movies. Its like if all the food you ever ate had rat feces in it, you might assume that food with rat feces in it is perfectly acceptable, but you would be wrong. 3. The humor of this movie is like that of a wealthy rapist,who by virtue of his vast wealth is able to evade any and all legal repercussions for his many rapes. 4. Its a movie about a cartoon series about talking cars that transform into robot-men from outer space. The cartoon existed solely to sell toys. It was an absurd show kept relevant by nostalgia alone. So when Transformers is turned into a live action movie its not filmed as an absurd satire, but rather as a serious action movie. A sad self-important bore featuring a dead-eyed Megan Fox, way to go everybody!"
"BA_Harrison","5","2","5","6 June 2012"," Transformers: adverts in disguise.
","The original 80s Transformers cartoon series was all about shifting toys from shelves, so it shouldn't come as too much of a surprise to find that Michael Bay's prime directive for this live-action blockbuster also seems to be making money through selling stuff.<br/><br/>Transformers has been designed to leave kids longing to reenact its bad-ass auto-bot battles via Hasbro's new range of authorised action figures, whilst giving adults the urge to load a top-of-the-range Apple iMac, Hewlett Packard laptop, an X-Box, and a crate of Mountain Dew into the back of a brand new GMC TopKick truck.<br/><br/>But blatant product placement isn't the only thing that Bay mercilessly bombards the viewer with: he also pummels his audience into submission with an onslaught of complex CGI effects, endless loud explosions, awful dialogue, rapid fire editing, cringe-worthy moments of comedy, and lots of shouting from Anthony Anderson as an irritating gluttonous hacker. Plot development and logic are almost non-existent.<br/><br/>Granted, for many people the sight of giant alien robots transforming into vehicles and battling each other will be entertainment enough (even I can appreciate an awesome heavy-metal smack-down), while others will welcome the sight of a sweaty Megan Fox bending over a car to fiddle with the engine, but for a movie costing $150 million, I expect more than what is essentially a visually impressive two-hour long advert for kids' toys and luxury goods."
"aldris247","Null","2","5","23 January 2010"," I expected nonsense, but there's more to it than meets the eye,,,
","Excuse the horrid joke above, I couldn't resist. <br/><br/>I have never been a fan of Transformers, I never even had the toys as a kid, but I decided to see this on the basis of being a Linkin Park fan. I wanted to like it, but feared I wouldn't have the option. I was anticipating utter rubbish. I was expecting an ultra-predictable plot, annoying actors, glaring plot holes, cringe-worthy dialog and, of course, an abundance of mindless action. Only the last of these was present.<br/><br/>True, as far as the storyline and script go, it's not exactly The Godfather, but it's not dumb enough to damage the fun. I know I may be overusing the ""pleastly surprised"" line, but I was pleasantly surprised by Shia LaBeouf. He managed to be a perfectly convincing nerd, and while he and the other characters are blatant stereotypes, one can identify with Sam throughout. The humor comes constantly and in decent quality.<br/><br/>I haven't even mentioned the Transformers themselves. They do look very impressive, particularly when changing. The scenes of combat and destruction are downright kick-ass, notably when a roller-blading Decepticon smashes a bus in half. The overblown budget shows in every action sequence, and is matched only by the use of state-of-the art US military hardware.<br/><br/>So, I recommend this movie without hesitation. Don't think of it as a movie for children, consider it entertainment for one's inner child."
"TheLittleSongbird","7","2","5","11 November 2009"," Well worth watching for the visual effects alone!
","When I saw Transformers, I will admit I wasn't expecting much. And you know what I thought it was a good movie. It is far from the best movie ever made, but it is well worth watching for a number of reasons.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie was the visual/special effects. They were absolutely mind-blowing, and the whole movie is worth the look just for them alone. And the robots especially Megatron were convincing enough, and the movements weren't jerky in any way. The sound is absolutely terrific, and the music is great. The storyline is original, fast-paced and gripping on the most part. There is some nice humour thrown into the mix, however the dialogue for me was a little too cheesy in places.<br/><br/>The performances are spirited and bring a sense of fun to the proceedings. Shia LeBoeuf brings some charisma and appeal to the title role of Sam, and Megan Fox is hot. John Tuturro has fun in his role, and Kevin Dunn and Julie White are both hilarious as Sam's parents. Hugo Weaving is superb as Megatron, and Peter Cullen makes the most of his character Optimus Prime. In fact, the only weak performance came from the talented Jon Voight, he just seemed out of place. And while there are plenty of visual thrills, I wasn't a massive fan of Michael Bay's direction, it just seemed as though the visuals, story and performances were doing the work and Bay was just there making sure it was all going to plan.<br/><br/>Overall, it is flawed but Transformers while not the best or worst of its genre is worth the look, especially if you are looking for terrific visuals, great sound and a good story. That way, if you overlook the flaws it does indeed have, you are in for a treat. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
"criticus1","4","2","5","30 June 2009"," Like watching a junk pile dance to hiphop
","Okay here's long and short of it. Transformers is a terrible movie that seemed to get a blood donation from the greatest hits of bad movies over the last twenty years. The aroma of Godzilla, Independence Day, and yes, Batman and Robin makes it presence known by way of helter skelter editing, unearned buffoonery from the characters and a perfunctory plot lost in the computer blur. Even the famous ""One shall stand and one shall fall"" line from Optimus Prime is robbed as Bay chooses to focus on dorktastic Shia Lebouf as he tries to evade artificial laser blasts while good 'ol Optimus fights.<br/><br/>This is the type of directorial choice that seem to lather the film in soda pop. I mean, the humans had Megatron locked in ice and all they could do is run around like children while this wire robot, possibly the ugliest robot I've ever seen, turns and looks at the camera and says ""Melting!"" in a baby giggle. Who likes this cybernetic nonsense? I cringed when I heard Optimus Prime say ""My Bad."" The robots didn't even have any identity to them. Their designs looked like someone detonated a car engine and put a boom box on top for a head. I couldn't identify with them at all and the constant whizzing around them done by the camera didn't help. Only Optimus Prime stood out as an anchor in the film as voice actor Peter Cullen provided gravely weight to the robot's presence. You only wish the robots were better formed and had more purpose. In fact you could say that about the whole film. The feature is like one of the robots in reality. It is a loosely connected set of gears that only on occasion transforms into a watchable film. The things that stick are the base level pleasure groans that come from both the robot wrangling and watching Megan Fox whip her hair around and gasp.<br/><br/>What I would like to know is how come movies with such obvious defects, the robots when fighting looked like a ball of tin foil, can make such huge numbers and have so many people willing to forgive its immaturity?<br/><br/>This movie seems perfected for the under 18 teenage crowd. Every adult is a simpleton and every great-grandfather is a heroic explorer. The adults, even the president, must rely on the super smarts of the sassy teenagers invited to the pentagon asked to decipher an alien language like a father asking his kids how to reboot a computer. One blonde chick in particular typified the computer hacking, code breaking fashion models that gave the adults a run for their money. The fat black kid is there as a throwaway joke, but also is a computer expert mind you. Everyone relies on a wee-wee joke in order to diss someone else, even the robots! <br/><br/>Except for perhaps Bernie Mac who actually is kinda fun the B actors seem to all be stereotypes including the two military guys who dive in head first with machine guns against metal aliens that can throw lightning! The president is an old sage of course. The secret ops fellas knew about transformers all along and *of course* based all our technology off of them, which serves to explain how we could find the right caliber bullet to knock them out. The cube that gives transformers life can, implausibly, turn cell phones and other goodies into robots, which was *of course* a buildup into showing all our favorite brands turn on us in fun ways.<br/><br/>The film is commercial through and through, loaded with references that seem to have been recommended by a mall shopping thirteen-year-old. For this, the stuck up human characters and the aforementioned hack job done to the robot's designs the movie feels like you're watching a bunch of teenagers give the play by play while King Arthur battles for the holy grail in the background.<br/><br/>The sad thing is that I actually read the script to the Transformers and although I was poised to dislike it being that I am an admitted fan of the cartoon I actually saw some promise in the script. I felt that the script relied heavily on the humans, but I was willing to forgive that since I knew that the movie would be star heavy and the producers aren't going to risk the capital. That aspect kind of downed me overall but I set aside my hopes for what was on page. The script read a lot like ET, except instead of the boy encountering a scared alien he is befriended by warrior bots from the stars. The script ends like the movie, with Optimus sending out a beacon to other transformers. But when I saw the film and when that final scene rolled up, Peter Cullen's voice sounded exactly as I imagined it in my mind, except for the rock music placed over it, and the ugly paint job on Optimus, and the kiss between nerdy Lebouf and Fox that made me think she must have had her brain zapped by the energon cube, and all the slo-mo's of hicks on a farm, and did I mention the rock music? It was the sugar crystals of excitement loaded onto the film that did it for me. The artificial, eye grabbing, vomit of color and bombs and electric music laid at the feet of mousy actors is what spoiled what could have been a triumphant confrontation between million year old robotic foes."

","Christ.<br/><br/>Look, I know this movie was preceded by cartoons, comics, etc., but let's cut the bull: all of this was reverse-engineered from a fun fad toy line where a car/truck/gun changes into a robot. When your story's genesis is a children's toy, how serious of a movie can you expect to make out of it? I mean what's next, ""Hungry Hungry Hippos: The $200 Million Summer Blockbuster""?<br/><br/>The biggest problem here is that this movie is not a hair smarter than ""Power Rangers: The Movie"" -- it just has a bigger budget. Other than that, it has a similarly nonsensical non-plot, typical characters without any motivation or credibility, cheesy hero-villain morality dialogue, and plenty of product placement shots to sell more crap.<br/><br/>Just as bad is the fact that nobody told the characters that they're essentially in a cartoon universe. The fact that anyone involved in this movie worked with a straight face is amazing. A bunch of dillweed army guys suddenly partner up with the Secretary of Defense to become the lovable rag-tag force that singlehandedly repels an alien invasion? With backsliding motorcycle stunts to boot? Whatevery you say! Amongst other problems:<br/><br/>-The ghetto thug Transformer.<br/><br/>-The peeing Transformer.<br/><br/>-The idiot robots idiotically creeping around the kid's backyard... ""My bad"" UGH<br/><br/>-A top secret government agent that talks and looks like a loan shark/car salesman/child molester.<br/><br/>-Megan Fox and Shia's romance not only has zero chemistry but also zero motivation and makes little to no sense: ""Hey I'm a hot girl and I've been dating this toolbag jock like most hot girls do but yesterday I saw him make a typically obnoxious comment to this geeky virgin and decided that I will leave him and then fight in a robot-alien battle with said geek... Traumatic, stressful events like that naturally make me sexually attracted to the nerdiest losers around so let's make out afterwards""<br/><br/>-Hey, Megatron can't be a gun because that would violate conservation of mass... so let's make him into a Cybetronian jet (an excellent disguise by the way, because who on Cybertron could possibly suspect that a jet might actually be a sentient robot?)... oh wait, but then let's throw that obstacle out the window when it comes to the Allspark... something the size of a house and weighs multiple tons somehow ""folds"" (you heard me) into something the size of a toaster oven. Oh gee whiz.<br/><br/>-The climax is a solid half hour of non-stop eyeglazing crash/bash/explode scenes needlessly set in downtown LA to maximize destruction. ""Here kid, take the Allspark and get to the top of the roof with it so that we can put it on a chopper and get it out of downtown LA because now that I think about it, bringing the Allspark from the Hoover Dam to downtown LA was a really stupid idea.""<br/><br/>-Tired, cliché conversations between Prime and Megatron about how Prime is weak for trying to preserve innocent life, to which Prime responds: ""I see a lot of good in them."" Note to Michael Bay: this is the hero-villain conversation in EVERY SINGLE SUPERHERO MOVIE EVER MADE. How about spending a sliver of your gargantuan CGI budget to pay someone to write something a little bit more original?<br/><br/>-Optimus Prime and Megatron are brothers? What the hell? So does that mean they came out of the same robot mother's robot vagina? What in God's name.<br/><br/>Okay Michael Bay, I know what you're going to say: ""Cut us some slack; the movie after all is based on a children's toy line""... No, Bay. You get no slack, because... WHY MAKE A MOVIE BASED ON A CHILDREN'S TOY LINE IN THE FIRST PLACE??? And moreover, WHY ATTEMPT TO GEAR IT TOWARDS ANYONE BUT CHILDREN??? An infantile basis will give you an infantile script will give you an infantile movie.<br/><br/>And it fails even as a popcorn flick: the action's all over the place -- by the end you can't even tell which robots are dead and which are still alive but you end up not caring because they all look and sound identical in apprearances and personality."

","As an old-school fan of Transformers, I can't say I was too excited about seeing it transition into a big-screen Michael Bay production. The results are actually not as bad as I had anticipated, but some of the characters' dialog is so downright awful, while watching it, I myself wanted to ""transform"" -- by which I mean extend my limbs and transplant myself out of the room in which the film was playing. (Get it?!?!?) <br/><br/>*tumbleweeds roll by* <br/><br/>The special effects are good for the present moment and there are some pretty sweet action scenes. I do kind of love how they're badass robots but end up fighting with typical grappling martial arts. The music is adequate epic Hollywood action-adventure symphony stuff, but then interspersed with random segments of ""nu-metal"" riffs during cheesy action sequences. And then for some reason the film ends with a Linkin Park song. Which is funny because the film already ends on such a cliché, sappy note and then gives you permanent low self-esteem with the song that plays during the end credits.<br/><br/>Ah, I guess that's to be expected of a film that flashes Mountain Dew and Pepsi every 10 minutes and is one long commercial for GMC and the (then) new Chevy Camaro. From what I understand, enlightened cybernetic beings will one day be made from superior industrial products, which you should buy now. Oh yeah, and enlightened cybernetic beings also use dated American street slang, like ""roll out"". Natch.<br/><br/>Pretty entertaining stuff, but so empty and cliché it's almost incredible. Everything in this movie is a macrocosm of Megan Fox's presence and role: really nice to look at, but with absolutely nothing to say at all. I mean, it's basically X-Men, but with Transformers: Blahblahblah, ""Transformers/XMen/Gargoyles/Spidermen are bad! Send in the military!"" ...rabblerabblerabble... ""Stop!

"michaeljharvey","5","2","5","27 June 2008"," Plays it safe and, not surprisingly, ends up being mediocre
","Transformers follows the standard ""box office blockbuster"" formula very closely. Throw in a lot of special effects, some simplistic humor, your standard good vs. evil battle and a hot girl. What you end up with is a watchable, but utterly forgettable movie.<br/><br/>As a kid I grew up with the Transformers toys, comics and animated series. I was excited to see the robots brought to life with high-end special effects. In this respect, the movie does not disappoint. Each Transformer is an elaborate, well-thought-out machine. Their transformations are incredibly intricate, believable and well done.<br/><br/>So what's wrong with the movie? Well, beyond the special effects, it doesn't really try to do anything special. The Batman series is a good example of taking a story intended for kids and making it more sophisticated for the big screen. Tim Burton's original was an all-time classic and ""Batman Begins"" was an unexpectedly dark, realistic interpretation of the comic book character. Transformers doesn't aim nearly as high as either of those movies. It sticks with a very basic, straight-forward interpretation that would have been right at home in the kid's animated series.<br/><br/>The Transformers themselves have wooden, unlikable personalities. In many ways they seem completely interchangeable. The central human characters are weak as well. Megan Fox is unbelievably attractive, yet her acting is laughably bad. The writing is at least partially to blame; nearly every character from human to transformer is under-developed. The humor is for the most part juvenile and the plot never really goes anywhere. The viewer simply waits for the next dramatic battle and hopes the cheesy dialogue and predictable plot development in between won't be too painful.<br/><br/>In the end, not much reason is given for the actions of the Transformers. Some are simply evil and want to rule the universe, others are simply good and try to protect all life. Even the animated series offered a little more insight into the motivations of the Autobots and Decepticons. Rather than develop a more interesting story, the movie seems intent on cracking lame jokes and constantly showing Megan Fox in a tight skirt. This is certainly not a terrible movie, but there's nothing memorable or special going on here either."
"brian-931","Null","2","5","15 May 2008"," Transformers......ummm WTH. My take/review, spoilers!
","Like many I grew up with the 80's Transformers, but unlike many I did not over hype myself for this movie. The movie was entertaining, with that said let me move on.<br/><br/>What in the hell is with the overly used humor? Seriously, this movie should be categorized as a comedy. Some of the humor was just way too stupid, stupid to the point I felt embarrassed( Jazz's introduction and dialog, bumblebee taking a leak on a man, the knock on President Bush etc, etc). But then wait, after all the humor being shoved down you're throat out of nowhere we are given a heart felt scene with bumblebee being captured( this won't be the first time you are forced to have feelings for bumblebee). Mix in a little adolescent sexual overtone with the ""kids"" that this movie needs to revolve around, and you'll get the idea.<br/><br/>The story is also weak IMHO. It really felt ""rushed"", almost like it was the last thing created for this movie. The writers apparently were confused as well, seeing as a movie titled transformers and is suppose to be about ROBOTS simply revolves around the human characters way too much. Nothing really more to say on that.<br/><br/>Now we move onto the robot designs. While good, I felt they were a little too complicated and destroy any notion that megatron couldn't be a gun because he shrinks & unshrinks when he transforms. These robots definitely are ""more than meets the eye"", a LOT more.The over complication of the robot designs made the battle scenes a mess to watch half the time I wasn't even sure what the hell I was looking at. Even in HD it still looks messy. Not to mention Megatron looks like a mighty morphin power ranger villain and when I see Ironhides head I immediately think of a cat.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why Hollywood always insist on having movies revolve around teenage characters? Transformers is no different. Not only are we going to have teens the movie revolves around, but where going to kill a few birds with one stone. We are going to make the movie revolve around them and there subtle attraction for one another, THEN we are making her the ""popular"" girl who eventually falls for the geeky underdog on top of the fact that shes really a bad girl with a record and he's a sensitive yet goofy man. I couldn't make this **** up if I tried. I also really don't get adding Anthony Anderson or his character to the script? ""The woman( character name escapes me ) proclaims He's the guy who can break the code, even though the she has already said no one on the planet could"". Guess what, he doesn't, he just explains what ""it"" is.....which has already been done. Seriously what the hell was the point of adding him? Did they need to balance out the movie with a funny black man since they already had a serious one? The battle scenes between the robots really seemed short and rushed as well and none felt epic. The fight between bone crusher and prime was the best believe it or not. I would have hoped that the battle between prime and megatron would have been something to remember but the battle is one of many that are very forgettable in this movie. The over complicated desing of the robots makes the battles a real eye sore( literally ).<br/><br/>What is with the panning dramatic camera angle on the humans faces for? Transformers........robots. You would think there would be some of Bays signature epic panning camera on the transformers especially at the start when blackout is introduced. But no, we'll use that feature for the humans. Why the hell exactly would marines want to hide the cube in the city where the risk for casualties is immensely high? I understand disbelief needs to be thrown out for any movie but damn if its not completely destroyed on this flick. Last complaint. WTH is with Bay and his obsession with sweat? Seriously looks like he had the actors sit in the heat for two hours before shooting. Air conditions apparently don't exist in Bay's movies because this isn't his only flick where he does this. Everyone has a constantly sheen and in some cases drenched look. The last three times watching this I'm thinking through the whole movie ""damn, I feel like taking yet another shower"".<br/><br/>Now we draw near the end, the secretary of defense and company are trapped in a room trying to fight off a little tweaker robot( the comedic humor for this movie in case you didn't get any of the other humor throughout the movie ). The rest of the robots are battling it out in the city while managing to not really be too confrontational with each other( a shot here a shot there ). Then the secretary of defense is addressing the nation...wait wha, did I blink? Did they even show him & company get out of the room or deal a final blow to the tweaker robot? Seriously, I can't remember. Also what the hell happened to barricade at the end? The decepticons were sorely underused to begin with, I'm sure in favor of more screen time our teenage lovers."

","I am a fan of the cartoon and comic book, but this movie was a lame effort to recreate such a plot with phony characters and cheap dialog. What bothered me the most was the masturbation joke. Whats wrong with the writers today, they all think sex sells and this is a PG movie. Its not a big deal for me because I'm mature, but a 6-8 year old who sees the movie will ask questions. This is just a clue that this movie was a marketing scheme looking to make a buck with no effort in writing a intelligent movie- Michale Bay makes high production movies with no plot. I will be more hesitate towards watching his next feature, and those two writers are on my do not watch list. The only selling prospect of the movie was its animation and clichÃ© phrases from the cartoon series, such as: 'Autobots, roll out'. This movie was too long. Jon Voight must be hurting for some notoriety or money to make such a crap movie."
"hnt_dnl","2","2","5","4 May 2008"," Very uneven; just barely entertaining
","TRANSFORMERS is a long, 'epic' film that unfortunately is an example of what is wrong with a lot of movies nowadays. I just find them very big on special effects, and very small on character development or even entertainment value. And that's the irony b/c it is all these great modern special effects, the CGI type stuff, that is supposed to blow the audience away. But I find it all very distracting and overdone.<br/><br/>TRANSFORMERS has a promising start w/ a prologue describing the longstanding battle between aliens from a faraway planet, the good Autobots and the evil Decepticons and why they must bring their battle to Earth to find a mysterious cube that will affect Earth's future. The action is immediate as a Decepticon advanced party attack force destroys an American military outpost in the Qatar desert, leaving a few surviving soldiers who band together to try to get word to the Pentagon of the impending attack. This group is led by Capt. Lennox (played by modern day hunk Josh Duhamel, who is stuck with a thankless role).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, 2 other parallel stories are told. One is the Pentagon itself who are aware of the Qatar attack, but only have the recording of a strange, foreign signal from the attack to go by. The Defense Secretary (played by Jon Voight who dons an unnecessary Southern accent) musters together a group of expert computer hackers from around the world to decode the signal. The best of these hackers is Maggie Madsen (Australian sexpot Rachael Taylor; is she supposed to be a high school student?!), who quickly figures out that the signal is alien and warns the Secretary of impending attack.<br/><br/>The 3rd parallel story is of the real lead character of the film, high school student Sam Witwicky (played by the engaging young actor Shia LaBeouf, who ironically comes off looking good given the crap dialogue he has to work with; he has such enthusiasm and energy that he draws you in to the story). Sam holds the key to everything as his great, great grandfather was an explorer, one of whose old keepsakes contains the information to the location of the cube. Sam's father buys him a car that turns out to be one of the Autobot transformers who leads Sam to the other Autobots, led by Optimus Prime. Sam also has an assist from his sexy girlfriend Mikaela Banes (played by Megan Fox). I found Sam and Mikaela's story to be the most entertaining, if that means anything. Eventually, all sides (military, government, Sam and his buddy Autobots) come together to try to save Earth.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film has several boring and unnecessary scenes and waaaaay too many characters that distract rather than entertain (John Turturro in particular is annoying as a weird government agent that is part of a secret agency that knows something of the impending alien attack and Anthony Anderson just looks bad as 'the best hacker in the world'). Sam's parents are excruciatingly annoying as well, especially the mom who just plain never shuts up. Actually, virtually all of the minor characters are annoying, mostly due to wooden dialogue from a terrible script. Probably every scene in this film has lines that are supposed to be funny, and MAYBE 5%(if that) of the lines in this movie that are supposed to be funny are actually funny. Additionally, of the lines that are NOT supposed to be funny, about 99% of them are so cringe-inducingly bad that they make you go, ""Huh! Where'd the hell did that line come from!"". This unfortunately is why many big movies now are failures: too much focus on special effects and action and not enough on good scripts and characters. And even the action between the warring robots at the climax is not all that impressive. Oh, and the robots get some pretty bad lines, too. Even they couldn't come out of this mess unscathed.<br/><br/>The film reminds me a lot of INDEPENDENCE DAY, a movie that I will forever despise. But actually, I prefer this film (barely) to ID, maybe b/c I find the leads LaBeouf and Fox both promising and engaging (I pretty much can't stand Will Smith and Bill Pullman was perhaps the WORST portrayal of a U.S. President in any film ever in that movie!) and I find the Transformers aliens to be more interesting than those whatever-the-hell-they-were aliens in ID. Also, I expected more of ID with its more accomplished, well-known cast; but in its own way, ID is much worse than this film, and that's saying something, b/c this 'film' is not good."
"epicedium-1","4","2","5","3 March 2008"," Lots of action, lack of imagination
","If you are a fan of acting or suspense, this is not your film. This film comes across at times as a 2 hour infomercial for Hasbro, GMC and Hostess.<br/><br/>If you've outgrown being a teenager, this film may be a bit too juvenile for you; for children under 12 - this film may be inappropriate because of the unnecessary dialog touching on masturbation, sex, and flat out disrespect for the elderly (which was really disturbing, considering this film is directed at least in part towards the young consumers of hasbro's toys - see their website for transformers products ""as seen in the movie""; how many teens still play with toys?) The line from Bernie Mac (""Bobby Bolivia"") directed at his grandmother is a stellar example: ""If I had a rock I'd bust you in the head, b*tch."" Try explaining that one away to a kid. This along with the American Pie style masturbation conversation between Sam and his parents was also particularly out of place. Is this a movie about a boy growing up, or a battle between robot-invaders? The awkwardness of Sam may strike a chord with a few people in the demographic, but comes across in general as overdone, and for the plot, completely unnecessary. Terminator 2 had the same demographic and managed to pull of a great action movie without the cheap laughs.<br/><br/>Highlights of the film were really the action sequences and the flawless CGI work. The transformation of the machines themselves was very well done.<br/><br/>The plot was loosely stitched together and lacked the real imagination needed to pull-off a movie like this. The Autobots have mainly standard weaponry (bullets, rockets etc.) at times they use some kind of pulse weapon but that was about it. You'd figure advanced beings from another star would have a couple more tricks up their sleeves. The explanation of how the ""signals"" used to break into government worked was weak and just looked like a second-class visualization of an mp3 file. To show pictographs floating around in a virtual data stream was a bit goofy - and the fact that this American hacker had written code to read the pictographs encoded by the alien beings was also a bit unusual.<br/><br/>The constant movement from location to location and action was really necessary to keep one from asking himself too many questions about just what was going on - because it really doesn't make much sense if you look at it long enough. Aside from the transformers conventional weapons, the fact that the transformers not only speak English to one another but speak slang (e.g. Optimus Prime's ""my bad"") is hard to overlook.<br/><br/>All in all it is a mass-marketing phenomenon that made a lot of money for those that financed it. It wasn't much of a thrill ride, but probably sold quite a few toys (hi George Lucas!)"

","I'm always a bit on the defensive when it comes to making movies about things i remember from my childhood. Mostly i guess because my memories are probably not that accurate, and in the case of ""Transformers"" i was also mostly interested in the toys and not so much the comics. What made me watch this was mostly the fact that a lot of things were actually changed from the ""old"" Transformers. Especially the look was completely different, and i guess more adapted to live action as opposed to the cartoon-look.<br/><br/>And what did i think? Well, after watching this movie i was happy i did. I have always been a bit of a sucker when it comes to really nice-looking movies, and this is definitely one of those. It's no surprise though since it's Bruckheimer behind the wheel. He might be about as subtle as an earthquake, but he does deliver the goods when it comes to high-octane action. And it doesn't get much more high-octane than huge robots fighting it out in the middle of a city. Also Bruckheimer has started to get his stuff together now. Previously i thought he was probably the worst budget-waster in Hollywood. And i guess in a way it's true, but he still seems to get a lot more out of his money today than a few years ago. The 150 million dollars they sunk into ""Tranformers"" gave them what is arguably the best special effects i have ever seen in a movie. And as far as blowing money goes, that is a decent deal.<br/><br/>And what about the rest of the movie? Well, i guess that is where you might object. Aside from the effects there isn't much of a movie left. There is a little love story here which is cute in a ""80's high-school-movie""-way, but other than that it's mostly just action all the way. And lousy comedy. That was my main complaint with this movie actually, the lousy comedy. There is in particular one scene that shames the whole movie. It's the lowest form of silly comedy with huge robots reduced to clowns. A real mood-breaker to say the least. Also one of the robots has clear Jar-Jar Binks-tendencies with silly noises and moves.<br/><br/>In the end though this movie is all about the robots, huge ones. They fight, they transform and they talk and scream with deep voices. There are a few truly huge scenes here, not least the battle scenes in the desert in the beginning of the movie. I would have liked more time with Starscream and a deeper story, perhaps based more on the comic. But in the end this is a huge blockbuster the way one of those are supposed to be. And as long as you don't think too hard about it, it's mindless entertainment at one of it's best.<br/><br/>7/10."

","Reminds me a lot of Independence day however it has better-special effects (as you might expect), gags (was not expecting that) and reasonable story line. I had read that the female leads acting was poor but I thought it was OK. Don't want to hype it too much as it might set unfair expectations. This film was awesome. Definitely a film to be watched at the cinema unless you you have an amazing home cinema. I tend to rate films by 'would I pay to see it again', this one definitely meets that criteria. I'll leave it there as it's something to make your own judgement on. I did come out of it thinking this is definitely a boy's/man's film however the stats on here show that females have given stronger ratings. Never judge a book and all that....."
"dan-hoegh","10","2","5","6 August 2007"," This movie should suck... but it doesn't.
","I watched transformers in the early eighties. I loved the series as a kid, so naturally I feared that the movie would belittle the epic battle that is going on between the two opposing forces. Fortunately this isn't so.<br/><br/>This movie is meant to be entertainment and nothing else. The writers didn't try to embrace any deeper philosophical standpoints which would have been nearly impossible with so little screen time available. Thumbs up!<br/><br/>The visual effects are NICE and very dynamic and the sound is awesome - when Barricade bellows ""ARE YOU LADIESMAN217?"" the whole theater trembled. (Yes, the theater, not the people inside the theater, it wasn't a metonym).<br/><br/>""What about the plot?"" - you say. Well... It's a war-movie: ""Search and destroy"".<br/><br/>I have a 7 year old kid who has watched the G1 series on DVD and has collected Transformers action figures since the age of 3. I am VERY pleased that his introduction to non-animated Transformers is through this movie. The very thought takes me back to when my dad took me to see Return of the Jedi in 1983.<br/><br/>A new shiny version of a known universe has just popped into existence."

","As a hardcore fan of the Transformers G1 era, I guess the first thing I expected was to see some relation either in the content or in the making. Pretty much to say that it is not the case, this movie has what you could say its own sort of phenomena. It is a 2007 generation of Transformers, not G1. <br/><br/>The plot itself is a mixture of a romance in the making, a battle for power and greatness, which at the end gets the viewer a fascinating enjoyment. It sure has modernity pasted all over, you expect an amazing effect for the transformations. It left me awestruck and agape when I saw the Autobots come in, I really imagined myself going into the screen and wanting to blow up Megatron. And when you know what happens at the end, you wish it was another ending but hey, its great as it is.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, as one of my personal favorites I recommend you get your favorite popcorn or chocolates, and enjoy Transformers.

","this movie is awesome its one of the most spectacular movies of the year, a two hour adrenaline rush. It has lots of adventure, the action sequences are simply breath taking, and a lots of funny moments and references from the 80's. The cast is simply fabulous, Shia Labeouf is great, a serious role with moments of comedy, just a flawless performance, this young actor is growing so fast in his career, Megan Fox a lovely new actress, her acting was very convincing, she is that kind of actresses that are so beautiful and that doesn't fear of getting messed up in an action movie. Jon Voight performance was also very good,John Turturro was funny in his role as the sector 7 agent and even Bernie Mac with his short appearance as a car salesman was really funny. The transformers voices were very well selected Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving as Optimus Prime and Megatron are incredible. The CG effects of this movie are perfect the best ones in years. Micheal Bay's direction is flawless, doesn't disappointed us. Bay's vision about the cult-comic and animation of the eighties is great and he puts it to the perfection on the movie, Without exaggerations, he is the master and ruler of action movies nowadays. In conclusion, Spielberg and Bay created a gigantic, spectacular and funny summer blockbuster movie and I just have to say that Transformers is more than meets the eye!"

A must see for transformers fans as it can be related to the animated series as well as a great movie for action lovers as it has been modernised and knocked up a notch so it's suitable for almost an age. The end of the film leaves you for hungry for more, finding yourself reliving the moments in your head throughout th next day.

"cosmic_quest","6","2","5","28 July 2007"," Bring on the nostalgia!
","I have to admit I loved this film and, perhaps, as someone who was a child in the Eighties at the height of the Transformers craze has some bearing on that. I was a tomboy who loved the toys and watched the cartoon on Saturday mornings so there is a certain amount of sentimental nostalgia when watching this film. However, that doesn't detract from the fact this was a very enjoyable blockbuster.<br/><br/>The premise of 'Transformers' sees war between two robotic races-- the Autobots, who are good and honourable, and the Decepticons, who are evil and cruel-- on the planet of Cybertron as they are vying for control of the powerful Allspark weapon. The weapon eventually finds its way to Earth but, in his search for it, the leader of the Decepticons, Megatron, is frozen in the polar ice cap. Years later, seventeen-year-old Sam buys his first car, unaware it is Bumblebee, one of the Autobots who have come to Earth to find the Allspark. War again is looming between the Autobots and Decepticons, this time with Earth as the battleground.<br/><br/>The human characters of Sam, his girlfriend Mikaela, the military and government people aren't irritating distractions from the robots. Sam is old enough to realistically be embroiled in this situation without coming across as some precocious little moppet who should be tucked at home in bed and we should be thankful they chose the main character to be seventeen instead of ten. Shia LeBeouf, who played Sam, brought humour and the human touch to the film. It also made a pleasant change to see the military portrayed to have some brains instead of carrying on like a bunch of reckless fools who make moronic decisions time-and-again.<br/><br/>As for the robots, the CGI used was of excellent quality. The visual effects were able to re-create them in a manner that doesn't leave the audience sitting there thinking, 'this is so fake', which would have ruined the film. The robots were also depicted in a manner that gave them individual personalities that brought their characters to life, which was essential because these aren't meant to be mindless drones.<br/><br/>This film is, ultimately, a Hollywood blockbuster, not some deep-thinking epic. People do need to remember that when judging 'Transformers'. The plot is involving without requiring a vast intellect or powerful thoughts and yes, there are plenty of explosions and fight scenes. Take it for what it is and I imagine many people upwards of twelve who just want to see a fun film will enjoy this. It is definitely a must for those in their twenties who grew up with Transformers; nothing like re-living your childhood once again!"

Ha ha. Anyway, you would think that a movie of this magnitude would start off slow so that people that haven't been into Transformers could get some background, but you couldn't be more wrong!. It still gives a detailed background of the alien beings but slow is definitely not the case! The Action is from start to finish. You need to actually watch the movie to know how good it is, the wit, the action and special effects are top of the range and will be hard to beat. This is most definitely going to take some prizes this year i am sure of it.<br/><br/>This has to be the first movie that at the end, the audience clapped loudly hoping for a encore... and the adrenaline rush was mad it flowed through us like blood.<br/><br/>I can't even begin to describe it for you, but if i could give a higher rating than 10 it would be 101."

","I go to the movies to be entertained. And this movie entertained me... a lot.<br/><br/>Don't listen to all these people who are railing on the movie and decrying Michael Bay. The bottom line is that it is one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. If you're just a regular person, who knows that you don't go to see a movie about machines from outer space that turn into giant killing robots for the enchanting dialogue and brilliant complex plot then you will enjoy the movie a lot. Unlike a time-period, sensitive piece like ""Pearl Harbor,"" which Bay mutilated, this is right in Bay's wheelhouse.<br/><br/>And if you are upset that this movie was not true to the original cartoon series, you have to get over it - that was like twenty years ago, and if it troubles you that much, then you're probably a pretty big loser. Sorry to break it to you. There are new cartoons out now that you could probably get into that won't be adapted to cinema for a while.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that this movie has everything I'm looking for out of a Hollywood summer movie - great action, hot chicks, and a surprising amount of humor. I was pleasantly surprised by Shia Lebouf, who going into it was my number one concern about the flick. Anyway, if you like movies for the escapism and aren't a Transformers nerd, you need to see it right now."
"garynorton","6","2","5","27 July 2007"," $147,000,000 and a need for a script Trans-plant.......
","I had high hopes for this one, more so when I read a couple of reviews from normally reliable sources, such as Empire magazine and Dark Horizons. Sure they made excuses for it being a big, bombastic blast of mechanical carnage and you could overlook the childish silly story.....Well I couldn't. And I am equally surprised to find seasoned reviewers who could. They left out the words bland and unengaging! <br/><br/>The battles-particularly the slow-mo sequences in the city toward the end-were superb, although at times the hyper-kinetic moments in real time were far too overwhelming for the eye to take in at times. Roll on the DVD, as some of it needs to be watched at 1/8th speed!! But how on earth does a movie with a $147M budget and a certain producer called Spielberg ever get made with such wanton disregard for a story or script. It is inane; the human character's acceptance of these alien robots is so matter-of-fact; the ""reveal"" of the decepticons plot and the ""cube"" plain lazy. Even if the story is just an excuse to create mecha-Armageddon, you could have invested a little more time in making it interesting and reasonably more realistic than the effects themselves.<br/><br/>Aside from the mega battle in the last 45 minutes, Michael Bay's credentials as an action director are also questionable. The Barricade/ Bumblebee car chase is a damp squib; poorly edited and just as it looks like it is about to get going- it ends as day turns almost immediately to night! It gives the impression that they have been chasing one another for an hour or so but could not be bothered to show us any of it. The look of the film is a total Bay-ism, that Tony Scott ""80's"" touch. Lots of sunsets and sunrises etc.<br/><br/>Shia Lebeouf does a fairly good job of fleshing out his smart-mouthed nerd character who blossoms into the hero (is there any other in American Teenagerville). Megan Fox brings little to the movie other than some smoother curves to the robots sharper edged contours.<br/><br/>The humour is very uneven, going from pleasing the average 10 yr old with visual gags- such as autobots playing hide and seek in the garden, through to Porky's style coming of age comments and swearing. Seeing as the Transformers scriptwriting duo are now working on the new JJ Abrams ""STAR TREK"" is causing me to break out in a cold sweat.<br/><br/>Michael Bay riposte to Bruce Willis' recent childish verbal outbursts; stating his film knocks Die Hard 4 out of the park for action is like saying ""Pearl Harbour"" is better than ""Lawrence of Arabia""- both dealing with the subject of war, but doing so on different levels. My enjoyment of the final Die Hard was partially down to a lack of expectation- but at least they tried to give the silliness a sense of reality. Just because Transformers is based on toys and a cartoon should not start you thinking that story does not matter- just because you are throwing over $100M in FX at the audience.<br/><br/>Its a shame to get caught up with the marketing push of the Hollywood machine. Unfortunately, it seems to be happening more often nowadays- even the actual critics we rely upon seem to letting us down as well. Perhaps I, and other more discerning movie goers, should look before we leap!Otherwise they will keep chumming the waters with this crap and getting us hook, line and sinker every time. Not that any of my comments will matter to Michael Bay as he sits on a mountain of money, smoking a fat cigar!"

Also to have the same voice for Optimus Prime was just another great thing for the fans. The rest just followed the cartoon format and it worked. I would watch it on a TV series if they made one. The fact that they could take any vehicle and make it transform gives me the feeling we will see this happen again maybe on TV or a sequel. And to comment on people who say they didn't have a story line, well do you watch a ball game for a story line or the action and excitement?"

"reclined","8","2","5","16 July 2007"," Like EPCOT, only louder
","I heard awhile back that EPCOT center in Disneyworld is really the result of two different theme-park ideas really ""pushed together"" by Disney's Imagineers into one sort of impressive but over-reaching whole.<br/><br/>Okay-- now fast-forward about 20 years or so, and you have an explanation of how this film feels by its conclusion: 2 different segments linked together into one impressive but over-reaching whole.<br/><br/>Arguably, the film has two major ""Acts."" In Act I, we have our ultra-slick but geeky teen protagonist getting his first wheels and the hottest too-old-for-high-school-but-we'll-buy-it-anyway-girlfriend in recent film history, and the focus seems to be a humorous one. Teenage lives are ""complicated"" enough, we're reminded, but the mix of new car, new girl, and old, suspicious parents works here to lighten up the complexity of how Bumblebee and Co. are going to figure in to the rest of the story.<br/><br/>Then, Act II: Autobots and Decepticons really ""taking it to the streets"" in urban combat. Loud and louder chaos ensues, as we're forced to figure out exactly which Transformer is taken out by its enemy (I guess there's just too many silver-colored ones on both sides). The focus now is upon the intensity and excitement we feel at seeing robots smash each other up at eardrum-busting decibels. Where's the humor of Act I? Never mind, just duck and cover (your ears?) for now.<br/><br/>If you're willing to suspend reality for awhile (like the existence of a super-secret ""Sector 7"" government agency that even the military doesn't know about, that Hoover Dam was originally built to cage Megatron (uh, duh!-- why not just build a smaller, cheaper, and much more isolated base atop the polar ice cave where they first found him?, etc)), you'll enjoy the show. If you like more continuity in your action-adventure flicks (like humor and/ or action intensity throughout, then just watch either half of the movie, and you'll be fine.<br/><br/>Transformers is still the best action film out this summer-- just bring your patience. Oh, and your earplugs, too. ;-)"
"Chrysanthepop","Null","2","5","15 July 2007"," robots, cars, trucks, action, hot chicks...a rough but somewhat dodgy (visual) ride
","Just two days ago I went to watch 'Transformers' with my brother. As a kid I initially hated the cartoon but later grew to like it. My summary pretty much explains the movie. I enjoyed the film because I liked some of the comic scenes, special effects, the action and funny appearances of famous actors. Also, all the robots and cars were pretty cool and fun to watch. About the plot, well who cares? The acting...well who cares? I wasn't expecting a great screenplay or standout performances. But if 'Transformers'scored high on those two, I really would have liked it a whole lot more. There weren't really that many hot chicks (which you expect in this kind of films) but the two I saw were hot enough. Visuals, special effects and sound were brilliant. Lots of action which slows down a bit in the second half until the end. An excellent background score (with two tracks from Linkin Park). Like I said, it's an enjoyable but dodgy rough visual ride (for many)."
"richman12722","7","2","5","14 July 2007"," A movie you want to like more than you can.
","Since this film is directed by Michael Bay, I went in expecting it to be terrible. And it wasn't terrible. Just sloppy.<br/><br/>The strongest element of this film was the story line. The pacing is very nice, and with the exception of the opening sequence dragging on a bit, the film flowed exceptionally well. Unfortunately there were many flaws in the script that really brought down the quality of the film. The most noticeable problem was the dialogue. You have to feel bad for actors when they are given lines drawn from a hat, which get used over and over again, and have to make them come out naturally. A lot of the dialogue seemed forced and unnecessary. Many of these lines could be simply cut, for the words say things that we already understand the characters are thinking or feeling. There were also secondary plot lines that were introduced and not sufficiently wrapped up. The stories of some characters were left up in the air.<br/><br/>The characters also were greatly underdeveloped. The only human character who the audience begins to care about is Sam (Shia LaBeouf). Everyone else is, simply put, just there to push a wheel-barrel. The Transformers draw more sympathy from the audience, which may or may not have been the intention of the filmmakers.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf does stand out among the cast. He has a great deal of talent and is excellent in the film, considering what the script gave him to work with. Hopefully this will open the door for him to do some really promising work in future films.<br/><br/>Anyone who studies film knows about the reputation of director Michael Bay. He has a knack for being flashy, focusing all of his attention on the look of the film. In this film, he continues to show that he has a hard time giving actors helpful direction, as well utilizing an effective array of shot selections. He seems to not understand the idea of motivated shot selection, where the tone of the scene dictates what shot should be used. Not every angle of a character needs to be a close-up, which Bay always overuses. This is unfortunate, because if he could have progressed his directing skills, this film could have been very special. But with so much attention on creating a flashy, CGI driven spectacular, a good story was left misunderstood.<br/><br/>As for the special effects, a lot of effort went into creating the Transformers and the action sequences. It does look very nice, but in my opinion, the CGI seemed to be a crutch to hide otherwise poor cinematography and principle photography. The images seem to detract eyes from very unrealistic lighting. There was also a noticeable discrepancy between the CGI and effects done in photography (i.e. some explosions, debris, etc). The filmmakers obviously could not destroy downtown Los Angeles, but it seems very clear that the structures were in a completely different layer from the CGI. Maybe I am a stickler, but this made the film seem even more sloppy to me. The impression is that principle photography was rushed just so the robots could steal the show in the end.<br/><br/>But technical stuff aside, the film is largely enjoyable. There is a great deal of humor (some fitting, some pointless) to keep the audience entertained during the ""slow"" portions of the film. And like I said earlier, the storyline keeps the audience at attention as well. And as far as epic Science Fiction films go, Transformers is able to stand the test of time. The idea of aliens being at war with aliens, and Earth is caught in the crossfire, is an idea that has not been exhausted like many sci-fi themes. It is a fresh take on the ""interstellar war"" story.<br/><br/>To conclude, the average movie-goer will likely enjoy this film at face value. Those with a more intense eye in film making will undoubtedly have a lot of criticism. But for me, this was at least the most enjoyable film by Michael Bay thus far, and I have to say that I am glad that I saw it."
"helmutty-1","10","2","5","14 July 2007"," Great movie!
","Excellent movie with heavy music, what can go wrong? Michael Bay is best for directing big action with exploding things. We get intense action scenes which will make time go pass by very fast and by the time it ends, you will not find yourself on the cinema's seat. You would want to pay money to watch it again. That is what I feel like. After watching it, I feel like going back to watch it a second time. I can easily say that this is one of my favourite movies. It is cool, it will blast your head off.<br/><br/>The music makes this movie more interesting. With heavy music following the action-packed scenes, this movie can be the best action movie of 2007. That is what I can say. Now we come to the story, the story, Sam falls in love with a hot girl, Mikaela. He buys a car which transforms into Bumblebee, one of the Autobots. Then from there, the evil Decepticons start chasing Sam for the glasses that leads to the Allspark. The story is simple. Bay can't handle complex storyline, his style is the all time big action. No wonder he was asked to direct a robot movie. Steven Spielberg thought Transformers should have big action. If he wants that, then he had called the right man. Bay managed to make the modern Transformers. The designs don't really look like the old cartoon but at least they are realistic in our world. You don't want to see old cartoon designs with big blocky hands and legs in our world.<br/><br/>What can I say? In the end you have the final say to whether to watch it or not. You want to see robots banging each other with bare fist or weapons, this choice is yours. It gets pretty fun when you see the Autobots and Decepticons smashing each other's ass. Action fans or transformers' fans will like it. This movie is not only for Transformers'fans, people who like action or robots will probably catch this too. Definitely a big blockbuster movie! We are hoping for a part 2."

The story wasn't half bad either, it could have been better but i think it was good enough to not ruin it.<br/><br/>The reason people may bash this movie is because they expected it to be too much like the original cartoon. And the fact that all the decepticons were not really colorful. I think that a red and white starscream would have looked retarded.<br/><br/>One of my favorite parts is where starscream fights the other F-22 Raptors. How he transforms, shoots some guys, transfomes and jet further ahead, transforms, shoots some guys, transforms, goes further ahead, transforms, shoots some more, transforms and blasts away. It was awesome."

","WOW! Its a one of a kind movie.. I actually didn't want to watch the movie, because i predicted that it was gonna be childish to watch a movie like this after taking a look at the movie posters that gave me the ""cartoon"" type of image in ma mind, but i have to admit that i have been proved wrong by myself after watching the movie. It was like a roller coaster ride, not one second in the movie made me yawn. The graphics was excellent, the storyline was superb, every scene in the movie was very detail and the auto bots was designed very carefully. To those of you that still have the doubt whether if its gonna be a worthy movie i would like to clear your doubts that this is a worthy one indeed."

","I have seen other movies directed by Michael Bay (Bad Boys, The Rock and Armageddon), so I knew going in that there would be non-stop action and explosions from beginning to end. Boy, the man doesn't disappoint. The action scenes were impressive, the actors were good and the CGI was top notch. I also have to say that just like her last name, Megan is a ""Fox""!! Of course some people are going to kill the movie because of the script, clichés, etc., but when I go to see an action movie I expect to be entertained, which the movie does from beginning to end. Usually in movies that run over two hours, you have lull moments, but that was not the case in ""Transformers"". I can't wait for the DVD and I will be first in line when ""Transformers 2"" comes out. I give it a 9 out of 10 (I gave it a 10 to boost it up)."

","In my opinion this movie was definitely the movie of the year so far.. For me it outshines Pirates of the Caribbean; At worlds end and Harry Potter and the order of the phoenix, by far! To the producers, I take my hat of to you! Not only were the actual robots were brought to life in spectacular fashion but there were so many action packed scenes that the movie was not boring at any moment. I absolutely found the movie thoroughly entertaining and loved the little dish of teenage humor on the side, even the older ladies in the cinema laughed at a certain crack from Sam's mother after she'd had a few drinks! Excellent job!! I've seen it twice now and will probably be going again soon!"

","When I heard that there was going to be a Transformers movie I pretty much rolled my eyes and assumed it would be yet another comic-like movie with bad acting, corny love-scenes and over-done special effects.<br/><br/>However, after hearing several rave-reviews from friends, I figured I'd give it a go...after all...I wasn't paying! The opening scene with the narration had me going...""Oh God"", thinking it would be one of those movies! But not long into the movies I was in awe as how brilliant it was! The special-effects were brilliant, acting was pretty great and Josh Duhamel was drool-worthy.<br/><br/>Much better than I ever thought it would be, I'm considering seeing it again!"

","I'll never forget going to see the original 'Transformers; The Movie' in the late eighties and loving it then. Of course back then only cartoons could create such a title. 20 years later I could not realise how a tiny little piece of my mind had been neglected for so long. As the film progressed it woke that part of me that loves the story, the characters and all the action. Lets face it, Transformers are for the kid in all of us, the person that rates this badly has turned their back on that child. I however, have not.<br/><br/>So firstly, The cast of this film aren't amazing but Shia LaBeouf is a real character in this show. I've been a watcher of his for years and he is a naturally funny guy and a great choice for Sam. Having said that, its not about humans further than Sam. The Transformers are all without a doubt spectacular and created with such care and detail. I have never witnessed graphics of this nature on film or even on computer. Its simply a masterpiece as far as computer graphics go.<br/><br/>If I could change one thing in this film it would be the 'Armageddon' style music and camera work. They are 2 different films and should remain so. I felt a little let down by that but given the highs of this film the lows were leagues below.<br/><br/>If you are reading this and deliberating watching this stop reading and get it immediately. I will actually buy a HD TV and HD Video with surround sound just to play this title in HD and call it money well spent. God I cant wait for the next one."

","After a lackluster start of threequels (most notably, Spiderman 3), Transformers is a breath of fresh air...and so far it proves to be one of the better summer movies of 2007.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf does a good job as lead actor, supported by the hot Megan Fox and a few other notably good actors, including Jon Voight and John Turturro. The characters, along with the transformers, provide us with enough humor to be...well, humored.<br/><br/>The action as you may have guess is completely bad ass and awesome. The special effects are just about incredible, and I could almost never find myself saying, ""that looks fake"". It looked very real, for the most part.<br/><br/>What can I say, this is a Michael Bay film and that means lots of summer fun...and their is enough of a plot to carry the film.<br/><br/>8/10, one of the better outings of summer 2007.

Everything is wrapped up very well, it all fits into place.<br/><br/>I went to see this movie with great doubt, recent highly anticipated movies I saw were all big let downs, Spiderman 3 and Xmen 3 were blow outs, Superman Returns and Batman Begins failed to go off the ground.<br/><br/>I am happy to say that this movie finally breaks the barrier and delivers greatness."

","Transformers as a movie is completely breath taking and has a large fan base to make it a box office hit. People will go and watch this movie, heck I went to watch it because it reminded me of when I saw it on the telly. This is my opinion:<br/><br/>Adapting something from a classic is never easy, but the directing team has aimed more at strong human emotions, than the actual robotics. In a breath I'd say Transformers must have touched every half a teenager in the audience.(""Hey I know that guy"") <br/><br/>Thus ""The Transformers effect"" will make every Greenpeace activist wish that they had seen Lassie saves the cheerleader instead.

","I just watched it for the second time now and still loved it. Yes i WAS a die hard fan of the G1 series and even loved the 1986 movie. Since that movie i lost interest in all the other incarnations. Now at the age of 25, i find the cartoons very boring, stupid and kiddy. Thus i went into the movie hoping that it wasn't a movie just for kids.<br/><br/>As soon as the first action scene with the helicopter was over, i didn't know what to think...it was just so...awesome. But the real surprise was that it gets better and better. The action and special effects were better than anything i have seen to date. The score was epic and touching at times and certainly goes very well with the movie. The acting was okay except for Shia, he did an outstanding job. The most surprising thing about the movie to me, was the amount of humor. Luckily most of the humor worked. in fact, the people in my cinema were actually laughing out loud at all the funny parts.<br/><br/>After watching this movie and having time to think about it...i realised that there were some parts that could have been done better and the plot was really basic. However the good greatly outweighs the bad, and to me, while watching the movie none of that matters cause it was just too entertaining! It was certainly more entertaining than the movies being released so far this year.<br/><br/>Overall, I recommend this movie for everyone - except really young children and the G1 die hard fans who refuses to except changes."

","The audio in the film rocks loud and crisp to keep your heart rate up. The CGI is actually quite good. I thought I'd have to do some overlooking to buy that there were giant robots fighting on the screen and then transforming into vehicles, but the graphics don't miss a beat. I would have like to see some more character depth in the transformers. Watching the old cartoons I got connected to various characters and I had hoped to see more of the personalities that I remember from then. But, overall I was impressed with this movie.<br/><br/>Bay manages to fill the entire film with nonstop action. So much so that you don't even have time to realize that the script isn't very good. As long as you don't read too much into it you will have a blast."

But I saw the previews last week and was instantly hooked. So I went to see it on the big screen, the day it opened here in Shanghai (yesterday). Well, I have to admit, I am looking forward to seeing it again. See, it's so full of details, it's so fast, it's so OUT THERE, special FX are rich and seamless, I just couldn't take everything in. Plus, I hadn't been to a movie theater in more than 7 months, so I was really blown away. I was a fan as a kid, and I am not disappointed by the movie. The Transformers and Hasbro have definitely secured the next generation's follow up. On a down note, watching the movie, I kept thinking ""Any second now, they're going to show a larger-than-life US banner floating in the wind"" ... Sure, it wasn't as thick as in other films of the same caliber. So I finally gave it an 8..."
"Bosch","6","2","5","11 July 2007"," Meh....Not Bad but not Great Either
","You get the impression that the word ""cool"" was uttered many times during the making of Michael Bay's port of the TRANSFORMERS TV cartoon to the silver screen. After seeing the trailer a few times before other features and reading some reviews, I'd have to say my expectations were met. I saw it with Code Monkey (ex-work) and Ken (work) at Hoyts Melbourne Central. We grabbed some pints of beer at the Lion beforehand, during which Code Monkey revealed the Transformers T-shirt lurking beneath his office attire. That was a funny moment  in a good way or bad way, Ken and I aren't so sure yet.<br/><br/>On to the movie itself, well, there is a lot of CGI animation that is too fast and busy for its own good. Often I couldn't figure out what was going on because the action was just too fast and choppy, thus defeating the purpose you'd think. Code Monkey explained his theory on this syndrome to me on the train coming home and it seemed plausible enough: audiences are not given enough time to analyse the action and perhaps see flaws, so they just assume it kinda makes sense. Whatever the deal is, you know by now it's a pet hate of mine. It is a pity, because in many sequences the animation and special effects really are convincing, even beautiful. The story and characters are more problematic. For starters, TRANSFORMERS takes a long time to get going. Related to that point, we don't hear the Transformers themselves talk until the half way point or later. From then on the narrative flows better, since the machines take on actual personalities, albeit totally one dimensional, but at least we get some motivation and basic exposition. Then again, the interactions between the humans and the robots suddenly becomes awkward, plus you have ridiculous moments where massive hulking killer robots can't snatch a little box off a wussy teenager who is more than likely still a virgin, fer chrissakes.<br/><br/>As with most of Michael Bay's movies, some of the supporting characters (human and non-human) are amusing. And once again for Bay, his military types are for the most part cardboard cutouts: either steroidal Neandertals, humourless top brass, or lovable rouges. Also, this is yet another action picture that depicts violent scenes but avoids any bloodshed or one-screen deaths  any nastiness is rapidly blurred from sight by something computer generated flying past. So there it is. Heavy on spectacle, light on logic, with a few chuckles, and some female eye candy to enjoy for the blokes. A bit more restraint (or less caffeine, speed, cocaine, steroids) on Michael Bay's part could have turned this into a great blockbuster. Oh well. Bring on DIE HARD 4.0, which was apparently censored before release. Why bother at all if it's not going out with a US R, like the previous three DH movies? Don't get me started."
"alex-2410","10","2","5","11 July 2007"," Surprise blockbuster of this year?
","I saw the new movie Transformers few days ago here in my country of Finland. In the theater was a handful of people including myself in the early of the week. First of all this is a totally Action/Sci-Fi movie and nothing cartoon in this film. Only the characters from the popular Transformers series are brought on the screens with modern technology and good awesome great special effects. I'm a big movie watcher. I have expectations of this movie. I saw episodes of the Transformers cartoon series which was show on television and i heard there's a movie of it coming later. I was very surprised it really got to hold me on the edge of my seat. The actors played really well 9 points for that.<br/><br/>The beginning was a bit slow, but overall it was all but best action i've seen so far. When Sam Witwicker (Shia LeBeouf) the main character tells the class he's grandfather searched the cube in the ice. Later Sam was not aware that he's life about to change. The robots came in the planet of earth and search for a code on the grandpa's glasses. I must describe that there were a planet called (the IMDb suggest other so i clear it). Deceptions get the auto-bots to the planet earth. The auto-bot leader Optimus Prime has excellent/more sound voice that I've seen so far in the movies and definitely impressed me by it's creepiness and give me the chills. My favorite characters were Optimus Prime, Ironhide and Megatron. That's all i'm going to reveal because you'll have to see the movie.<br/><br/>Especially the entrance of the robots is something that special effects hasn't influence me before so much. When the film ended my hand was like half hour stiff because of the excitement. The hand was OK later. I recommend it to all, but as the character Optimus Prime says Quote: ""unwise"" don't bring your under 12 year old to theaters. I saw youngsters in front of me when i was in theater they hold hands across the face in some parts. Some hold a bag in front her so it wouldn't be so scary. I'd say if you are a movie or action fan you definitely would not be disappointed when you see this. It's awesome film. My favorite of all."
"dsharp-4","9","2","5","11 July 2007"," Transformers on Steroids!!
","Transformers is a must-see, and not on DVD - in theatres where the full effect can be seen and heard. Flawless CGI, a decent plot, and action throughout makes this a winning formula for all ages.<br/><br/>FOR ME I was just amazed at what a good job they have done keeping alive the Transformers legend. I was a lukewarm fan when younger, and this was so much better than the show ever was.<br/><br/>FOR KIDS I took my 6 and 8yos to it. I was concerned about the M rating it received in Australia, but after reading comments realised that was an unusual and inappropriate rating. In the end, the main violence/fighting is between the robots, and my kids both loved it. There were no nightmare-inducing scenes, but plenty of memorable funny moments that my kids have kept recreating since. Overall a great experience, especially since one of my kids is named after a Transformer (Jazz!).<br/><br/>FOR WIVES I had to drag my wife along to see this movie - she really didn't want to go. In the end she said she was very tired anyway and so could enjoy the sleep. Not a chance! She stayed wide-awake from start to finish and loved the movie. Now I'm easy to please when it comes to this sort of action movie, but my wife always sleeps. The fact she stayed awake AND loved the movie speaks volumes.<br/><br/>Really looking forward to a sequel, and many more! There are plenty more characters yet to be reintroduced to a new generation..."

","The Transformers movie is, hands down, out of this world! This motion picture really kept me on the edge of my seat. I was impressed with everything that was contained within the presentation. Transformers is jam-packed with action and suspense, not to mention its fair share of laughs. The cast members here deliver astounding performances sure to please citizens everywhere. The heroes are highly compassionate while the evildoers are exceedingly ruthless. This movie has a lot of authority people in it and significant number of them appear to be egocentric, irascible, and restless. These self-centered figures will not rest until they get what they want. Authorities are everywhere in this extremely intense adventure movie! The special effects crew really outdid themselves here with all the work that went into creating the elements that make the picture worth viewing. If you want to see a film that perfectly balances suspense and comedy, your ticket is Transformers."
"eye-shuh","9","2","5","10 July 2007"," Transformers is a Go!
","To put it short and sweet: this movie was AWESOME. Go watch it right now or you will forever regret it! When I first heard that they were making a Transformers movie I was really disappointed. I thought for sure it would suck. But then as the reviews from my friends came in I had hope. I went into this movie expecting it to be good and it blew me away. The special effects are incredible (of course), it's hilarious (a giant robot flicks a guy into a building), and the expected few corny lines are totally worth it. I absolutely loved it.<br/><br/>There were worries about the directing of Michael Bay. We held hope that with the supervision of Steven Spielberg he wouldn't completely ruin the movie and it turned out that he tried to but it didn't work. His horrible directing actually turned out pretty good. There was a moment in the theater where my friend leaned over and whispered, ""Haha, look at that! It's Armageddon!"" And literally two minutes later a character in the movie says, ""This is better than Armageddon!"" No lie. Needless to say we cracked up. Not to mention the main character had to wave a flare on a roof top -cough-The Rock-cough-. Other than the moments where I would have given my very limbs to have the camera zoom out so I could fully experience the mega robot fighting, it was still pretty good.<br/><br/>THE ROBOT FIGHTING! I was not disappointed. I went into this movie wishing for sweet giant robot fights and Transformers wins with flying robot parts! They were incredible! I will be dreaming about awesome explosions and giant weaponry tonight.<br/><br/>The movie also stuck really well with the cartoons when it came to Optimus Prime vs Megatron. I mean, let's be honest, in the cartoon Optimus Prime was a frickin pansy. He didn't even hold a candle to Megatron. The movie reflected exactly that! It was so great! When they did their little one-on-one I couldn't help but giggle madly as Prime got his butt kicked! Throughout the whole movie he was the exact Optimus Prime that I remember. I take off my hat and salute the writers. I love them.<br/><br/>Perhaps one of the greatest things about this movie is that they show mankind fighting back and kicking some robot butt. They don't paint us as weaklings; our weapons work and we figure out how to get under the robots armor. The Autobots were not alone in their fight! MAJOR SPOILER: Starscream gets away in the end (hello Transformers 2!) which was also great since him and Megatron were always in a power struggle over the Decepticons.<br/><br/>Some people say the plot was too childish, but I thought it worked fine. I didn't go for plot I went for giant explosions. The plot kept to the beauty of the Transformers and in the end it was Spongebob logic: kids will save the day and grown ups will always mess it all up until they finally listen to the kids.<br/><br/>There were a couple downers in the movie, but they weren't anything that really took away from the movie, just stuff I wished went a little different: a Mountain Dew machine turns evil. Come on! Mountain Dew would SO be an Autobot! Also, they never played the Transformers theme song. If they had played it during the credits it would have made the movie absolutely perfect. I was highly disappointed to not hear it at all before, during, or after the movie.<br/><br/>My last regret was that Megatron didn't turn into a giant gun. He turns into a jet. Meh. Giant gun was way cooler.<br/><br/>Now, one hilarious thing about the movie: THE BLACK GUY DIES! There's a moment when Bumblebee gets trapped and everyone is all depressed about it. Then Jazz, the Autobot that sounds like a ghetto black man, gets ripped in half and nobody cares. Not only that but he was the ONLY Autobot to die! How messed up is that?! Hahahaha! Classic Hollywood. The black guy robot didn't stand a chance."

","Before I speak on the film I must say that I was never a Michael Bay fan. On several occasions I've even said that he is the worst director in the history of film. After seeing Transformers, however, I can see why he started making films, and more importantly, why he should keep making films. This film is more then just a loud, dumb, uninspired action movie; It's an edge of your seat, balls to the wall thrill ride that hits the ground running and never stops. It also may be the best argument for the use of CGI in films, as this is one of the best looking films ever made and could not have been made without the use of cutting-edge technology. Michael Bay uses the technology(and the 150+ million dollar budget) in the most amazing ways possible. This movie is truly an astounding cinematic vision come to life and everyone should experience it."
"hchais","10","2","5","8 July 2007"," Transformed me by surprise
","This was a hell of a lot better than I thought it would be. The first trailer for it came out last July, a year before the movie premiered. You really had no idea what it would be about. I am only 14, so I did not grow up in the 80s. At the time I did not want to see it. A couple of months later, in November I saw a trailer for it. That showed me that it was action packed and looked like it was very intense. In May, I went to see Pirates 3.(Which was great by the way) Anyway, the trailer explained the whole ordeal. Lots of action, great special effects, and of course, Shia Laboef. He makes the world go round. After I saw that trailer, I knew immediately that I wanted to see this movie the day it came out. I saw it one July third. I was caught completely by surprise. I did not expect it to be as good as it was. I was Transformed.<br/><br/>I was in awe at the end of the movie. It was so surprisingly good. I thought would just give it a seven, an eight at the most. But this clearly would get higher than that. Let me just say all the good things right now. The action was practically non-stop. It was one of the most entertaining movies I have seen in a long time. There was action from beginning to end. The special effects were the best ever. Literally. The transformations were the most realistic high quality visuals ever shot. The next great thing was Shia Labeof. He made this movie. He is a great actor. There was also great acting by Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel. It also had a great supporting cast of Jon Voight, Anthony Anderson, and others. I loved this movie. Another thing that caught me by surprise was the comedy. It was incredibly funny throughout. That was very surprising. Almost everything about it was good even the story and script. Now, for the bads.<br/><br/>There were very few bads, but they were some major details. The main actress just can't act. Also, the dialog for her was pretty bad. But I think that's about it. Michael did a great job directing this movie. This has been his best movie ever. I used to think that my favorite movie by him was The Rock. It's not anymore. Now, it's Transformers.<br/><br/>This was a great movie. I think that it is the best Sci-Fi movie ever. I think that it's better than Star War, The Matrix, and Terminator 2 combined. This is a lot like Independence day. Its a saga of people all over the US and they have to unite to beat the things from outer space. The movie was actually even dramatic in parts. Its kind of like the rock. How its really funny, but also turns out to be really dramatic towards the end. I loved this movie. I think that it is the best sci-fi movie of all time, one of the best action movies of all time, and quite possibly, one of the greatest movies of all time. Maybe not but I think it is because I loved it so much. I loved this movie and that's all I can say. I have been transformed because it caught me completely by surprise. I have been Transformed. 10/10."
"xprecipice","8","2","5","8 July 2007"," A whole load of fun
","A load of fun this movie delivers as it hits the big screen. With the amazing CGI effects and a list of fresh cast, much is to be expected of this film.<br/><br/>This film will entertain most movie goers. The action does not disappoint, with the robots transforming as they are drifting, running etc etc. One never gets sick of watching their transformation. I bet my 2 huge nuts most people will not be able to leave the theater without gushing excitedly about the movie and reminisce about it. The quick-witted jokes gives the movie many laughing moments.<br/><br/>The plot is simple and easily understood however it does not feel ""enough"". The satisfaction of having a strong plot was not felt in it. There are some scenes whereby the mood of the movie switches between the serious and ridiculous. For people who are totally unfamiliar to transformers, they may not be able to keep up on which robots are which as the fight scenes are very fast-paced.<br/><br/>In short, serious movie goers who pays attention to the story and are easily upset by small details would most definitely dislike the movie and find the jokes lame. However, if one just likes pure fun with a make-do storyline (as i am), the movie will rock! I for one will be re watching this movie an exaggerated number of times when it comes out on DVD!<br/><br/>8.5/10. and a whole lot of entertainment it brings!<br/><br/>PS: Won't hurt to know the robots and their names before watching the movie"

","Nothing I've ever seen in compares to the sight of Optimus Prime turning from a truck to a robot and blasting the hell out of the Decepticons to the tune of YOU GOT THE TOUCH by Stan bush. I remember seeing the 1986 movie with my friend, Richard. We were the oldest kids in the theater and what a great crowd to see the film with. Everyone cheered and shouted all through it.<br/><br/>So, I'm a Transformer fan.<br/><br/>I'm not a Micheal Bay fan.<br/><br/>After PEARL HARBOR, I swore to never darken my eyeballs with another Micheal Bay film. It was easy with BAD BOYS 2 and THE ISLAND, but that jerk just had to make a Transformers movie. You can imagine how nervous I was about the film. For every good bit of news, (Peter Cullen plays Optimus Prime!) there was bad news.<br/><br/>I saw a Monday night preview with Lindsay and not only was it great, but it wiped away every shitty thing that has ever happened to me. <br/><br/>SHIA LA BEOUF plays Sam Witwicky. Sam was called Spike on the cartoon and I never thought too much of his character. He seemed to just there to bounce lines off the robots. Here, he's a fully realized character thanks to the filmmakers and Beouf. He's very likable, funny, and has a place in this world. Sam unknowingly has the key to save Earth from an invasion from the Decepticons.<br/><br/>What I was afraid of was that this film would turn out like the American Godzilla movie. Where boring people would take up most of the movie saying boring unfunny things and we'd only get a little of the robots. That didn't happen. In the first ten minutes we get an attack from Blackout on a army base. bay wastes no time getting to the mystery of what has landed here and what do they want.<br/><br/>The scenes with Sam, Mikaela Banes(Meagan Fox), and Bumblebee are almost exciting enough to be a film all by itself....but then, Optimus Prime and company arrive. Just like in 86, the crowd I saw this with went nuts at every turn. They cheered when Optimus shows up, when Bumblebee first transformers to fight Barricade, and all throughout the film. <br/><br/>The Autobots themselves were in character and quite funny when they had to sneak around. Peter Cullen is the only actor I wanted to play Optimus Prime, I'm so happy that they didn't get some A-list star. His voice makes James Earl Jones sound like Eddie Deezen. <br/><br/>WHAT WAS COOL:<br/><br/>HELL! ALMOST EVERYTHING! Hearing the Transformer sound when Blackout attacks. The Prime/Bonecrusher fight. Frenzy sneaking around Air Force One. Bumblebee taking a robot wiz on Agent Simmons(JOHN TURTURRO).The fact that there weren't any big stars. Keven Dunn and Julie White as Ron and Judy Witwicky! They were smart enough to know that the robots were the stars.<br/><br/>NOT SO COOL:<br/><br/>No Soundwave. Not enough character stuff with the decepticons. Megatron and Starscream have only one exchange.<br/><br/>Anyway, go enjoy this summer action movie, and to all you fanboys out there, leave your attitudes at the door.<br/><br/>ROLL OUT!!"
"jreafilms","10","2","5","7 July 2007"," The perfect July 4th Movie
","Let me start this off by saying that I'm one of these people who thinks of himself as a film critic. If I dislike something, I'm honest about it. If I feel something is contrived, cliché, or well-worn territory, I'm vocal about it. Transformers is a movie that blatantly violates many of my 'good- movie-criterion', and yet I've seen it twice already in the 4 days since it's premiered. And I plan to see it again. It's fantastic. Whether you grew up on the cartoons like myself, or if you don't know an autobot from a decepticon, Transformers is the ultimate crowd-pleasing July 4th blockbuster. I can't find many people who don't start smiling as they watch massive transforming robots fire missiles at each other in slow motion on a two-story movie screen. I think I saw everyone in the theater half- stand up out of their seats when Barricade chased down Bumblebee while ""Pretty Handsome Awkward"" by The Used assaulted our senses. And, twice now, have I seen a standing ovation given to a movie as the credits roll. Normally, like many of you, I'm in the mood for a film that makes me think, makes me question, and features profound writing and acting. If you want to take a break from that for one night, however, and enjoy some massive action that will leave you dumbfounded, strap yourself into the theater seat, and watch the best guilty pleasure flick of the past three or so decades"

","This movie blew me away. My heart was racing throughout the entire movie. My eyes were glued to the screen. It was a good ride. The story line, the characters, dialogue, the intense and phenomenal fight scenes, unequivocally, the best movie I've seen this summer. I could not take my eyes off the screen =) I felt like I was 7 years old again playing with the ""Autobots"", ""Dinobots"", and ""Decepticons"". I watched the cartoon, so this did bring back some childhood memories. Awesome. This is a movie that I will add to the collection. My heart is still racing. I called a friend of mine as soon as I got out the movie, he'd just seen it as well, we both couldn't stop talking about it. A great movie."
"kmillervir","7","2","5","7 July 2007"," an overall entertaining movie
","when you think about what to expect walking into a movie like transformers, its basically what you get. There's no fancy dialogue or complex story lines, its just a fun movie with lots of action. The battle scenes are very cool and well done, and every time you see a Transformer move and fight, its a sight to be had.<br/><br/>There is mild humor throughout the movie that seems to fit right in at the right point. Not sloppily done. The special effects of course are great and very exciting, i'm not sure if it was released in i-max but it should be. Im sure kids will love this movie, and it will become an instant kid classic.<br/><br/>So when your thinking about a good movie to go out and see with your 12 or 13 year old child, this movie is perfect. Its lots of fun and it has lots of action. A nice little flavor blast for a worn out movie goer.<br/><br/>7 from me."
"topgun_spartan_tranzytra","10","2","5","6 July 2007"," See transformers if u haven't yet 10/10
","This movie is definitely worthy of being in the top 250 list of greatest movies. The movie starts off with a bang, and I was hooked the entire time. The CGI in the movie is the best I have ever seen. Growing up watching Transformers as a kid, and to see it evolve into a brilliant movie like this.<br/><br/>Along with the awesome CGI, the movie is actually really funny which adds to the entertainment.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this move beats out all other blockbusters that have come out this year, if you have not yet seen this movie I highly recommend you do. I can't wait for the sequel!!!!!!!!!!!"
"causeiwantto2001","7","2","5","6 July 2007"," Better then most, but was missing something
","The movie was better then I expected it to be. It showed why it's worth turning some cartoons into live action films. I thought it was a nice touch that they used the same voice for Optimus Prime, as I remember when I was a kid. I can't put my finger on it, but it was missing something? The fx were fantastic, and the pace was fast, but it was alittle thick on the jokes made by human reaction, to seeing the Transformers for the first time. It was like watching the reaction Godzilla would get, but one to many times. The relationship between the lead character and his car was alittle less caring then it should have been. The movie was however, a great way to set up a second film etc. I think Transformers will be a great franchise, now that the introductions to humanity are out of the way, and we can get to the actual stories. The battle scene between Prime, and Megatron didn't lack any action, but it did lack the emotion, there battles showed on the cartoon. All that said, it is worth a view. Maybe not waiting in line, but surly worth the 140 odd minutes."
"Snespy04","9","2","5","6 July 2007"," Transformers succeeds with technical aspects and story
","This film I was completely skeptical about. It has dazzling visual effects but was that the only thing that it had going for it? The answer to that is no my friends. This film beats out the other blockbuster hits or busts in my case such as Spider-Man 3, POTC 3, and Shrek The Third. It appears that this summer had so much promise with the movies above that I was in a downfall. After seeing Ratatouille hopes were back up and after watching this film ""Transformers"" I feel satisfied.<br/><br/>The film starts off with a alien, metal like cube with engravings all around it. A voice over kicks in of Optimus Prime explaining in detail but brief, the magnitude of the All Spark. Needless to say it is powerful and that the Decepticons want to retrieve it for complete domination and the Autobots plan to destroy it so that the Decepticons don't succeed with their plan. The All Spark reaches the planet earth remain hidden in a secret military base which is discovered later on in the movie. No worries it's not a spoiler.<br/><br/>Now we are introduced to Shia's character Sam Witwicky. Junior year at high school who is your typical average male. He wants the car and the girl. Same predicament I am in. Noice! He obviously gets the car, I mean it would be pointless if he didn't then the story wouldn't further. What's great about Sam seems to get in these unusual situations where it includes some humiliation on his part but non-intentional. I will talk about the dialog later on. Sam represents the average typical male with delight. He is a character that everyone loves and cheers for when the epic battle between the Autobots and Decepticons occurs. Supporting role is Megan Fox who plays Mikaela Banes. First off, you have to be a fox if your last name is Fox. Well golly gee, Megan Fox is definitely eye candy for the male community. At first I wasn't too sure of her role for the movie. As the movie continued on I realized her purpose was to fuel Sam's character for motivation. Since Sam is very intrigued by Mikaela, his inability to impress her is ""rescued"" by his car who is named Bumble Bee. One of the best things about this film is that the cars, especially Bumble Bee, is treated with respect. Despite the problems it supposedly possessed Sam always believed in the car making him even more likable. Back to Mikalea what is great about her she is not the typical damsel in distress. She was able to carry her own weight around without being too needy and annoying. As you may notice there is Josh Duhamel as Captain Lennox and Tyrese Gibson as USAF Tech Sergeant Epps. Surprisingly Tyrese was able to keep his shirt on. Character wise, he was someone who could of lived or died and the story wouldn't change one bit. Epps was more of a supporting character for Lennox. I liked Duhamel character's more due to he had a wife and kid appearing to be a great husband who looks forward to spend time with his new born daughter.<br/><br/>Since Shia is in this film you know he was going to execute the dialog in a enthusiastic and sarcastic manner. The delivery and the emphasis was well thought. Sometimes a movie has those one liners where you cringe and go that wasn't needed. Robert Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and John Rogers were able to avoid that. None the less Shia has come a long way since his debut on Even Stevens. He was able to execute the dialog in a suitable manner making that moment enjoyable whether content, disappointed, intrigued etc.<br/><br/>This movie provides a great score provided by composer Steve Jablonsky. He also did the blockbuster bust The Island which by the way is one of personal favorite movies. It busted due to bad marketing. Jablonsky was able to capture the moment of the film with his thumping moledious feel. Aside from the score, the film included various bands such as Disturbed, Smashing Pumpkins and Linkin Park giving it a edgy feel.<br/><br/>One thing that my friend Ryan pointed out that the negative aspect of this film is the camera work. I know it's an action flick but you wanted the camera to stop shaking or take a breather to get a still shot. Otherwise the film was completely entertaining.<br/><br/>Another thing that I am proud of, Transformers could easily entered the cheesy territory and it was able to avoid that. Thank you!!!!! However there were moments that bordered the line but quickly disappeared.<br/><br/>You don't have to be a long time Transformer enthusiast. I watched the shows, but it's not one of my favorites. It is something worth checking out. One more thing, ILM has set a higher standards of visual effects.<br/><br/>Very enjoyable, fun, entertaining. The characters were great. The story worked for me. Transformers is worth watching! 2 1/2 hours, kept me engaged the whole time. Michael Bay has achieved victory!"
"kirkintha26","8","2","5","6 July 2007"," An ""A"" For Effort
","""Transformers"" is everything I expected it to be: funny, silly, technically spectacular and... juvenile.<br/><br/>If you expect this movie to be anything other than a hot-rodded Saturday morning cartoon, then this movie is not for you. Mostly Transformers is loosely tied, effortlessly predictable, stereotypical and has no real sense of a story line. The characters and actors merely ride along with us in our chairs as the action roars by.<br/><br/>The whole point of Transformers though is to be a great Saturday morning cartoon, and Michael Bay has the flare to do it well. I am really glad I saw this movie, you should absolutely watch it if you are a fan. If you are looking for depth though, stay away."
"sabresaw","7","2","5","6 July 2007"," Surprisingly Good
","When I first heard that Transformers was going to become a live action movie my first thought was ""Oh no, How will they ruin this one?"" After seeing the trailers i decided to go see and was extremely surprised. The story/action ratio stayed in a good range with just enough story to keep the movie entertaining and enough action to keep you wanting more.<br/><br/>Though I have to say some of the plot holes can easily be overlooked, some just stand out. Not downing the movie just the people who made it. I have to say the characters were done so well I almost believed that they were real and not just CG. Bring back the original voice of Optimus Prime just sent this movie over the top. I highly recommend seeing it if you haven't already. Its not as bad as the other reviews show it to be."
"Nicholas-v-lootens","7","2","5","6 July 2007"," Fun Family Film
","While the film caters to an audience of teenage boys, it was quite entertaining for the whole family. The visual experience is like nothing else. The CG transformers blend flawlessly with the natural environment and the actors making it enjoyable even for adults. Because the film relies so heavily on CG the action sequences are a bit hard to follow because of there detail and speed making it difficult to really see what happening, especially if you see this film in a theater not using digital projection technology.<br/><br/>The story is fun, and the humor is appropriate for all ages. The film solves the problem of what to watch when Dad wants to see ""Die Hard"", and Kids want ""Ratatoille"", sorry mom...""Evening"" is next door."
"worleypanterafan22","9","2","5","6 July 2007"," Whats with all the naysayers?
","This movie gave me goosebumps the whole way through. Yes I watched Transformers as a child and the movie still blew me away. My only gripe is it left me wanting even more. They can make Harry Potter movies and LoTR 4 hours long(and they were terrible) but a movie I enjoyed cut off when I was crying for more!<br/><br/>One thing I really don't understand about all these other ""critiques"" is that all they do is compare Transformers now to Transformers back then. The movie is edgy, interesting, action-packed, and hilarious. The TV show (if you watch it now) is complete crap with colors done wrong or voices done with the wrong characters. Get used to it people this movie is going to make some serious bank. <br/><br/>I took a few friends of mine to the sneak preview when it hit America on the 28th of June and EVERYONE in the movie theater left with a sense of satisfaction. I bet you complained that Jean Grey's hair in Xmen was not red enough. To these people I say grow up, things are not the same since you were a child. Some things you watched when you were a child would not work as a live action movie. All ranting aside I really have to say the character Sam was extremely likable and Mikeala was attractive and interesting. The whole movie theater was dead silent watching the awesome fights and even cheered for 20 mins when the movie was over.<br/><br/>I hope the second one is as good as this one was. Micheal Bay you have out done yourself.<br/><br/>And thank God there was no emo dancing."
"mberie","6","2","5","5 July 2007"," Grown up CGI with a little kids script
","I'm an 80s kid and almost everybody I know was excited about this movie coming out. Who doesn't love giant fighting robots? Michael Bay's website has an awesome t-shirt available, it's black and says on the front ""Giant F-king Robots are Coming."" A movie like that doesn't even really need a script.<br/><br/>What it needs is one single minded direction in all aspects of all movie production and promotion. Based on what I saw from the previews, I thought it was going to be a revamp of a cartoon, shooting for the 13-31 male demographic with lots of action to boot. With that it mind it did an excellent job updating the look of the transformers and the way they fought to satisfy anybody with ""OMG Giant Fighting Robots"" in mind when they walked into the theater.<br/><br/>However, as I was enjoying this movie I kept on being slammed back to earth by unnatural dialog, weak character motivations, and a superficial character arc. Some of the scenes stuck me as odd and conflicting while watching it, but it didn't hit me until afterwards that the script wasn't bad, it was just meant for kids. If you're looking for the next Terminator 2 this isn't it. Every character has one purpose and is obviously striving to get it once it has been narrated to the audience. This is summed up perfectly when Sam (Shia) says ""Okay, I got a car, now all I need is a girl"" or something to that effect.<br/><br/>I have also heard people complain about John Turturro's character pointlessness within the movie and must agree that he is pointless within a ""grown-ups"" script. Almost every single kids movie has some good character in authority who impedes progress of the protagonist for really no reason and eventually comes around. It is someone that needs no explanation to kids because they already know what's gonna happen and what that character is about even though it made me feel unsatisfied.<br/><br/>Same thing can be said about robot hiding scene. The silly humor there in definitely reminds me of characters in an animated children's film, especially so with the ""lubricating"" scene. While the scene is overly long for my tastes it would be an important scene in a kids script helping them to identify who are good guys and bad guys almost immediately.<br/><br/>This movie is not bad, and definitely has some action sequences worth seeing on a bigger screen. If you're looking for well polished script that has intriguing characters to back up that action you'll find it lacking. I gave it a 6/10 for what I was expecting, though I think if it had been pitched as more of a kids movie through the trailer and buzz I would have been able to overlook what I didn't and enjoyed it more."
"ceogar","3","2","5","5 July 2007"," Michael Bay returns
","First of, i often neglect IMDb's forums because, honestly there are to many dumb people here. I don't know how often i read 10 this 10 that, honestly 9/10 is a GREAT movie, if it would be granted a 10 it should be the best movie in the history. Saw Transformers earlier and me and my friend said to each other on the way to the cinema that this movie was going to be full of ""shaky action scenes"" where it is hard to even See whats happening. And yes i know the purpose of that type of scenes.<br/><br/>The movie contained a lot of that stuff and just like every movie where Michael bay has had his foot inside the door everything is so American. I don't say that is is a bad thing, he just makes it that way in uncool way and it just gets lame in the end. The music i have to say is one of the best parts of this movie. You recognize Steve Jablonsky easily and his music. He saves the movie in many ways, scenes that would have feel totally unnecessary. This movie has been on the waiting list for lots of Transformers fans (including me) and i have to agree that it was a thrill to see all the old friends in real nice animations. However i really dislike the way the robots act many times and the how many people seem to be deaf in this movie.<br/><br/>Overall one of Bay's better movies and was well worth to see and i think i can see it again. I Would rate it 3/5 due to the animations and the music. Shia LaBeouf played his part really well, showed that he actually can act unlike many other ""main characters"" Bay has worked with."

","Let my start out by saying this movie freakin rocked. The action was top notched the actors were perfect for their roles and this movie was very humorous thanks to a great job from Shia. Basically the plot is a group of soldiers in Iraq are attacked by an unknown highly advanced technological enemy who are after top secret file. Meanwhile Sam a high school student buys his first car after a series of strange events. Optimus Prime and the rest of the autobots were each given a different and great personality. This people who are saying OMG THIS MOVIE SUCKS on the boards but it is really quite awesome so don't take their word for it until you actually see this movie. This was easily better than Spiderman 3 and all the other flops this summer ( which in my opinion has been every movie this summer so far besides this and Live free or die hard). Go see it!"

","Michael Bay the king of special effects keeps us all awake from the beginning to the end. The ""ahhs and oohhhs"" and how did they do this were running rampant in the theater. And prototype Camaro was cool. But I can not honestly give this movie a 10 because effects alone can not carry a movie and Michael should know this, after all he was on ""The Lot"" critiquing.<br/><br/>This movie's script has dated cliché lines from years ago and the actors seem like high school play actors reciting the dialog they put together. The parents with their comedic focus on their son and his doings fall a little short,maybe the actors, not sure. The fight scenes are far too many during this movie and boringly drag on and on, maybe I should blame the Editor...too much of a good thing is not so good. I found myself hoping there was more to the climatic end. I also thought based on earlier in the movie, if the cube was put in the chest it would cause death, but it obviously didn't. And speaking of the end, we see TRANS2 in the future and for variety maybe Michael Bay will give other automaker's prototypes a try."
"bluntsmoke05","8","2","5","5 July 2007"," This movie was amazing!
","To call this movie anything other than astounding is absurd. I went into this movie as a true fan of the original Transformers. The special effects and overall development of the actual Transformer's characters was done brilliantly. I must say that the level of humor and child-like moments throughout the movie were disappointing, but every movie has it's downsides. I was truly amazed at the level taken to visually capture the transformation of the characters when turning into there various cars and plane counterparts. I was also happy that for the people who didn't know about Transformers the movie did a great job of explaining and also visually showing what was going on. A must see."

It has stunning special effects paired with extraordinary sound and a bunch of recognizable actors. <br/><br/>Even if you don't know about the show you should know that Optimus Prime and his buddy the autobots take on megatron and the decepticons. In this movie their is a cube that has the power to turn things into robots that the bad guys want to harness to destroy the world and the autobots need to stop it. The first part of the movie sets the stage and their is some great humor paired with some skirmishes. The Real action starts when the big battle between the autobots and decepticons begin fighting.<br/><br/>At some points their were too many robots and i didn't know who they were and the decepticons personality's were not shown at all. It wasn't that big of a deal as the big picture is the battle between good and evil. Transformers is a great movie for anybody to see not just the fanatics of the show.

","A special military outpost detects an aircraft that's way off course. Two leaders on the team, Sergeant Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Tech Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson) are present with the troops to greet the aircraft, which by military record, crashed and burned some time ago. All havoc breaks loose when this aircraft reveals itself not to be what it appears. When most of their unit is wiped out in the resulting assault, the sergeants are less concerned about making a report to superiors and more concerned with making it home with the other survivors in one piece. Meanwhile, on the other side of the planet, fast-talking high-schooler Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBouf--in just about every movie this year) is prepared for an important rite of passage. His dad Ron (Kevin Dunn) has agreed to buy Sam his first car. However, Sam somehow settles on a beat-up yellow Camaro, not realizing that there's--ahem, ""more than meets the eye"" to this car.<br/><br/>Okay, let me start by saying that this is very much a Michael Bay film--and as such, we know what to expect. (See the title) Grand doses of horrendous dialogue. Extreme twists in logic. Editing that would make most of us run screaming to the nearest kung-fu flick. That's all here, but it's far from the point. THIS is a summer movie in the way we've come to expect! High action, incredible pacing, and way cool music played very loudly. Bay channels a little David Zucker as well--there's some dead-on, rapid-fire humor that's actually funny! Note Lennox's frustration as he runs across tech support in India in his attempt to contact Washington. The one-liners we'd expect from him are also accounted for, but he has wisely stocked the cast with a who's-who of expert one-liner delivery personnel. (LeBouf, Gibson, Anthony Anderson, and John Tuturro to name a few.) Of course, the center piece of the film is the Transformers themselves, who are a sight to behold. I grew up on every incarnation, from TMS to Sunbow to Mainframe and beyond; and while I'd often say ""That's cool"", I knew in my brain of brains there was no way to make me believe cars and planes were capable of such transformations. Now Digital Domain has shaken hands with Industrial Light and Magic and...well...let's just say I'm now in the market for a car, and I'm going to scrutinize those puppies VERY closely. You needn't be a fan, you just need a desire for solid summer diversion. If that's what you want, roll on out."

","Well first off i really enjoyed the movie, and it was very well made i'm a big fan from way back in the beginning, so i was looking for some of the things from the TV series that made the show so great and they were there with some upgrades, such as 1#. Primes faceplate its there but only in battle. 2# Bubblebee was a camaro but they did pay a small homage to the VW style Bubblebee, which i think is cool that they have upgraded a bit and still acknowledge , the fans who love the show , and if you pay attention to the movie you almost get the feeling that Bubblebee was the VW Beetle at some point but choose to ditch it for the camaro look ( watch the movie and you'll see what i'm talking about) OK moving on 3# Megatron, i didn't really care for his design i think they should have went for the Galvatron design since he does turn into a jet in the movie ( And yes i know he evolved into Galvatron in the animated movie) but i thought they could get more play in his transformations as we know that Galvatron a.k.a. Megatron does transform into a jet and a tank and yes the infamous big gun, (Oh another homage moment Megatron does form his big gun in his fight with Prime) 4# i'm not sure what to make of the decepticon that transformed into a boombox but i hope it was just and homage to to the great decepticon ""Soundwave"" and the it was not actually suppose to be him. well thats all i have to say about that great movie. Just gonna wait for ""Transformers 2"""
"krazynutz","8","2","5","2 July 2007"," And the Crowd Went Wild...Literally!
","I'm just simply going to say that this is probably THE best summer blockbuster movie of all time. I'm a child of the 80's and had two-dozen G1 transformers growing up and can easily say without hesitation - Transformer fans and Mike Bay haters, you have absolutely NO reason to bash this film. I'm not a huge Mike Bay fan myself. I just saw the film with a group of friends (Mike Bay bashers and huge Transformer fans themselves), and we all agreed that Mike Bay just redeemed himself and delivered in every way imaginable. Optimus Prime has lips? The nerve! I had my doubts, yes, but once you see the human factor in him because of it, you'd want him no other way. Besides, when his mask is up, you know sh!t's gonna get crazy. I love it. And the emotion they give to Bumblebee tugs at your heart. Anyway, the projector broke during the climactic fight and was down for about 10 min. We picked up where we left off and the ending was worth the wait. Holy Jesus. We all got free passes afterward and the 4 other guys that went with me all agreed - when we can use 'em, we'll use 'em to see this movie again. To put it simply: It's THAT GOOD. Well-written comedy (no really bad one-liners for a change), brief romance (which usually rode shotgun to the comedy thanks to Bumblebee), unimaginable animation and compositing, insane action sequences, and the Transformers get so much screen time, they should be nominated for a supporting actor(s) Oscar. Shia LeBeouf and Megan Fox (oh is she ever) have great screen chemistry but Shia (aside from the TF's) really stole the show - definitely one to watch out for. For almost three hours, I was 11 years old all over again rootin' hard for the good guys - and so was everyone else in the theater. I've never heard a crowd get into a movie as much as this. Laughter, cheers, ""Oohs"", ""Dohs"", and clapping surrounded me throughout the show. Hands down - BEST movie going experience EVER. Dad, can I see it again??? Wow."

PUH-LEEEZ!!!)<br/><br/>less than impressive acting by several principles most notably Jon Voight and Megen Fox (yeah, she was damn hot but that's not enough)<br/><br/>Some shots - especially a lot of the important CGI action scenes were shot SO CLOSE to the camera I couldn't tell WTF was going on<br/><br/>Michael Bay and his thrice-damned, now severely over used shaky-cam<br/><br/>bad... well I should really say bland and unimpressive score - with one instance of blatant and shameless THEFT of the menacing ""bum bum bum bumbump"" drum cadence from TERMINATOR (as if we wouldn't notice??)<br/><br/>earsplittingly crappy closing credits noise... uhh I mean ""music""<br/><br/>Too long of a run time. Just too too much explosions, crashes, buildings collapsing (all lovingly filmed too close with the aforementioned shaky-cam), etc.<br/><br/>I will say this: I never watched the original cartoon. I never saw the 80s vintage movie. I never owned or played with a Hasbro Xformer toy. This was my very first full exposure to the franchise (probably my last, too, as I was sufficiently unimpressed with this one to feel compelled to watch the sequel).<br/><br/>Oh... I also have to ask: How the hell does a 30 foot-tall, 50 thousand pound bipedal robot turn into a 16 foot long 3000 pound CAR? And if these things could transform, why choose the inefficient shape of a biped if they could convert instead into helicopters or jets carrying similar armament? Why do robots gasp and grunt like WWF wrestlers when they take a blow or fall down????? Are in-line skates the best mode of transportation when chasing an adversary who has taken the shape of a tractor-trailer?<br/><br/>Stupid. Stupid and mindless but more or less entertaining in that turn-your-brain-COMPLETELY-off-and-just-let-it-happen way. I'm very glad I didn't drop $10 to see this in the theater; my computer monitor was sufficient. And one viewing was sufficient, too. This one gets a 55/100 on the ablebravo scorecard."
"CuriosityKilledShawn","9","3","10","28 July 2007"," Best film of Summer 2007.
","Despite the fact that, in my opinion, Michael Bay has directed two of the worst films of all time (that would be Pearl Harbor and Bad Boys II) I knew, from the beginning that his glossy, high-key style of film-making would be PERFECT for a live-action Transformers movie. Since The Rock in 1996, all of Bay's films have been 2-hour plus epics and that is surely the kind of treatment that a Transformers movie deserves. No 90-minute piece of crap here.<br/><br/>I was a fan of the animated show and toys as a kid, but viewing them now I can see how clumsy, poorly animated and just plain impractical it was. There was no reason for it to exist other than to market toys, which is fine when your five-years-old, I guess. Despite the family-friendly rating, the showing I went to had absolutely ZERO kids in the audience as it was mainly made up of twenty-somethings who had watched the show in their childhood and who would appreciate it better.<br/><br/>Well, where to begin about how good it is. I regard this as an 'Event' movie way more than endless, tiresome Spider-Man and Shrek sequels. The Transformers movie was anticipated for a long, long time and only in the past few years has the technology to realize the giant, alien robots on film been advanced enough. The Transformers are so photo-realistic that I'm beginning to suspect that they actually exist and are being kept secret by Sector 7. This film will SURELY win the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects next year. Nothing can rival this.<br/><br/>The story (written by the team that wrote the Goonies II video game, would you believe) and characters are rather medium-sliced. Nothing superficial yet nothing heavy enough to slow the film down. The Transformers mythology has been altered somewhat from the TV series but only to tie-up loose ends and plot holes and to give it a more contemporary feel. If you were really cynical you say that it's just a big chase movie, but so many plot threads building at once there's enough complexity to keep most cynics quiet.<br/><br/>Shia LeBouf (who seems to be Hollywood's biggest young star right now) plays Sam Witwicky, a nerdy high-schooler with dreams of being a popular ladies man. His dad buys him a mysterious, banged-up yellow Camaro for getting good grades but the car seems to have a mind of it's own. Of course it does-it's Bumblebee and he's been sent to Earth to protect Sam from the Decepticon's who want an old artifact of Sam's that belonged to his great-grandfather, an explorer who discovered the long, long frozen Megatron in an underground Arctic cave.<br/><br/>Over the course of his adventures Sam encounters a showcase of actors including Jon Voight, Josh Duhamel, Anthony Anderson, John Turturro, Bernie Mac and, eventually Optimus Prime, who is a star in his own right. All of these actors try to run away with the film, which helps since the characters, like I said, are not densely written so their energetic performances make up for this. Though Megan Fox looks a bit older than her years and has an unlikeable 'attitude'. Did she really have a good reason to be knitting her eyebrows like that for the whole film or is she just posing for the camera?<br/><br/>My only other complaint is that Steve Jablonsky's dull score is basically a carbon-copy of Klaus Badelt's score for Poseidon. Both men are protégé's of Hans Zimmer I believe and their imaginations have so far proved to be rather meagre for every film they have scored. Transformers reminded me a lot of ID4. Now how cool was David Arnold's score for that? Steve Jablonsky could have really made something out of this but instead he just goes for dull synthy sounds and jarring sound effects. Yeesh! <br/><br/>Transformers is definitely an epic, must-see movie and is surely bursting at the seams with amazing set-pieces and breathtaking action. I impatiently await a sequel and look forward to owning it in glorious HD. The best film of the summer, no doubt."

","To this day, I remember the first Transformer my parents ever bought me. As a kid, I was a huge Transformers fan, and although I might be called a Transformers fanatic, let's not get that confused with ""fanboy."" It's like this: The people who give this movie a ""1"" rating are the same type of people who were mad that the X-Men didn't go into space and team up with aliens to fight Dark Phoenix - since, in 2007, that would have been dumb (granted, the movie didn't turn out much better than that, but still).<br/><br/>As a movie, certain things have to be altered regarding the Transformers in order for it to work. Some people wanted a campy revisit of the 1980s, complete with Stan Bush and Weird Al songs. Well guess what, most people would have laughed at such a film and it would have been an embarrassment to anyone who went to see it, aside from that select few.<br/><br/>Instead, here's what you get: Big robots who can turn into vehicles and such - they're aliens and they fight each other. That IS Transformers. Period.<br/><br/>Don't listen to the whiners and nay-sayers, they probably downloaded a crappy quality version of the movie with a bittorrent client anyhow, instead of paying to see it, just before attempting to perform a movie critique in their traditional pseudo-intellectual style.<br/><br/>Shia really shines in this film and even Fox's semi-competent acting doesn't really hold it back. The Transformers themselves look excellent - a wonderful vision of what a live-action Transformers movie SHOULD be.<br/><br/>It's not perfect, but it sure is fun."
"Elswet","10","3","10","12 July 2007"," This is NOT the Transformers of your childhood!
","As a member of the group bearing the dubious distinction of the title, ""Baby Boomers,"" I caught the animated Transformers series at the end of what I call ""My Belated Youth."" I was a fan. When I got to know the story line and the characters, I was hooked. Now, I'm not here to tell you that the old animated Transformers series was the best thing on television, because it clearly wasn't. But what I AM here to tell you is that it was ONE of the best things on television...at least as far as the story went. I tend to hold the Transformers in the same light as ""V"", Battlestar Galactica, Dune, the Thundercats, Flight of the Navigator, the Last Starfighter, and the Masters of the Universe, all of vaguely the same period. These were the ""greats,"" and still collectively hold a special place in my heart.<br/><br/>There were other, larger, more successful events such as Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, ET, and the X-Men animated series, the Dark Knight animated series, and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle phenomenon. And while these were hugely popular and imminently successful, the previously mentioned works are superior, in my opinion. They feature some of the same heart and some of the same style(s) but there is some element present, which connects to the humanity of me...oh, inimitable me...which none of the aforementioned works possess.<br/><br/>Transformers carries with it the same hope for salvation most religions offer to us as a people. These are characters with a solid moral center, an other-worldly understanding of the cosmos and its implications/impact on the various life forms inhabiting it, and a sense of the greater good - salvation through redemption, redemption through action and personal responsibility. It carries non-human biological machines, which demonstrate individuality and presence of heart and such a strong moral center, as to render the mechanalities of their beings almost superfluous; cool, but unnecessary to the story.<br/><br/>The present blockbuster counters that condition with even more humanity within the technological characters, which assists in creating more admirable characters, lends to the story a fluidity it may have otherwise lacked, and generates an appropriate level of suspense that was missing from the animated series.<br/><br/>The visual effects are absolutely stupefying (that's a good thing) but of course they were...Spielberg knows how to put together some stunning visuals, which complement (rather than negate) the story itself. He is a Master of...Illusion (?). The pacing is great - we were never bored, even for a moment - and the story is richly executed.<br/><br/>This is NOT the Transformers of my childhood. This is better - vastly better, and not due to the almost ethereal visuals, but because of the moral strength, the state of heart, and the gripping story to be found herein.<br/><br/>Watch it. It will enamor you.<br/><br/>It rates a 9.8/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

","I just saw this movie this afternoon at the Power Plant Cinema. What I saw was the best 2 hour plus film this year since Alpha Dog. Despite some rather ludicrous lines between some human characters and absurd bloopers - some of which I will leave to your discretion - let me just say that Michael Bay deserves an Oscar. This is one of the best films of this year. The direction, visual effects, sound effects, etc are the best. First, there was Armageddon, then Pearl Harbor, and now this. Michael, don't stop. I know that a MB film has to be entertaining to some extent, but this was just incredible. Simple story line, awesome effects. This film is not only for children; or maybe it's not, I don't know. But grown ups will enjoy it. I've never seen a robot act almost human. And that Megan is a good find. More, please? Bravo, all!"
"helmutty","10","3","10","30 June 2007"," Best movie of 2007
","I considered this as one of my best movie. Is this consider Michael Bay's best? I think so. Although, you can see his usual big and loud action with exploding things. When we first heard that Michael Bay was going to direct this movie, we all knew that it would be loud and had a lot of action. Michael displayed his action types. Exploding things come smashing and big robots chunking themselves at each others. So when you are watching this in cinema, it will be very loud. Michael made the robots' designs cool with the modern touch. Those who complain that the robots do not look like the usual cartoon, Michael made the robots to look cool, they are modern, not to look like the old cartoons.<br/><br/>The story is dead simple, you get a young man, Sam Witwicky falls in love with a pretty girl, Mikaela and bought a old car which transforms into Bumblebee. From there, the Decepticons chase them and Optimus Prime told them that they want the glasses which has the location of the allspark. The robots smashing each others start here.<br/><br/>The fightings are intense, smashing and hurling at each other, it means you get to see brief moments on how the robots are fighting. The Decepticons are disappointing, most of them only come to screen at the last half and hour and do not show their true powers, I mean, they are huge and evil-looking for no reason. You will get to see Megatron fighting Optimus Prime, the longest fight. The final fight is the best but the whole movie is good with the heavy music.<br/><br/>This is for all, fans or not. Those who are not fans of transformers may like this too as this is not about the robots, it is the action. Those fans of action, you also will want to watch this. Worth the price of the tickets."

"Faena","3","3","11","29 August 2007"," Their War. Shia LaBeouf's Movie.
","By my estimation, 40% of the humor in Transformers is comprised of racial stereotypes, flatulence, pee jokes, disrespect to with the intent to hurt women, drug use, and masturbation jokes. Real classy. Since the screenwriters of Transformers are the same bigots hired to script the new Star Trek, is anyone else as horrified as me? The ""future"" doesn't look good. I'm sure we'll hear these pinheads on the DVD commentary regaling us with comparisons to ancient mythology and the like, flouting whatever frivolous degrees led them into their lucrative film careers... writing chihuahua gags. That's right, if you thought small animal gags were held in reserve for Ben Stiller comedies, you were wrong. They can also enhance major science fiction epics. Because traditionally, cult fan bases love when their favorite universes are seasoned with fart and pee pee jokes, because it gives them a sense of pride. Pride that a major studio didn't have enough confidence in a 23 year-old property with a built-in worldwide audience guaranteed to shatter box office records that they made a movie not for us thirtysomethings who made Transformers a commodity in the first place, but moreso for eight year-olds. That's gratitude for you.<br/><br/>I thought Shia LaBeouf was supposed to be this wunderkind up-and-coming. Maybe that's apparent in Disturbia, which I missed, because in Transformers he's a total ham."
"GOWBTW","10","3","11","3 July 2007"," The Transformers: MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE!
","It's been 21 years since ""The Transformers: The Movie"" debuted, now this live action version of the classic Good Vs. Evil action. There are two factions fighting: The Autobots lead by Optimus Prime(Peter Cullen) who protect the humans from the Decepticons lead by Megatron, who's bent on world domination. In this movie, the action has taken to a whole new level. There's this goofy, geeky teen named Sam(Shia LaBeouf) who gets a old yellow Chevy Camaro that has a surprise he'll never forget. The Camaro is an alien robot named Bumblebee(in the cartoon he was a Volkswagon) and he did a very good job of taken care of Sam. Then later, more Autobots come to help Bumblebee: Jazz; he was a smooth-talking and hip car. Ironhide; tough as nails, ready to kick some serious Decepticon butt. Ratchet; very medical-wise. And last but not least, the leader Optimus Prime. The action of the movie was non-stop, and the comedy was all there. That helped balance the act of this movie, compared to the cartoons. This movie is off the hook, the cast is super, the storyline is one of a kind! Not kid friendly, though it's old-school to me. This movie can go on for generations. AUTOBOTS, TRANSFORM! AND ROLL OUT!

","Where to begin with what's wrong with this movie? For starters, the plot makes absolutely no sense. In order to somehow stay true to the original cartoon, the ""cube"" concept needed to be introduced but the way this linkage was done made absolutely no sense (put the cube into my chest!)...<br/><br/>The characters were hollow, and the protagonist was whiny and annoying. The romance between him and the female lead was completely unconvincing. The movie was filled with toilet humor. There are multiple sequences which were indistinguishable from adverts; either for Ford or for armed forces recruiting. I get enough of that on television - I have no desire to see it in film as well. At least on TV I can change the channel during the commercials.<br/><br/>All in all yet more evidence that the quality of films being made in the US is going downhill and that Michael Bey couldn't make a good movie to save his life."
"marshmannes","2","2","6","4 April 2008"," A Major Disappointment
","This film takes the cake as being one of the most disappointing films ever made. The biggest problem takes place as some of the worst stereotyped human characters make appearances instead of Transformers. There was more to the source material than just fighting robots. The cult fanbase surrounding the original 1986 animated movie, the multiple cartoon shows, and even comics is nearly legendary. Those did not insult the intelligence of the viewer as they were well written for what they were. The route Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci took for this film was to make a poor action film with a script on par with Bad Boys II. This could have been a cool sci-fi epic as the Transformers were like humans and had similar feelings to humans. Instead, they are backstory much like the aliens in Close Encounters of the Third Kind or the dinosaurs in Jurassic Park. The thing is that those films worked because it was more appropriate to have the human characters as the central characters. The ending has the human character taking charge by using the cube to take out Megatron instead of one of the Transformers makes the ending bad and 85 percent of the film is just talking about the plot with minimal payoff.<br/><br/>Poor humor consists of bad jokes on par with Date Movie, which consisted of bad sex jokes and body fluid jokes.<br/><br/>The action scenes are typical Michael Bay, so I would say they are about average. The CGI by ILM looks great, but the shaky camera angles and close-ups make things difficult to see.<br/><br/>The film is padded out with pointless scenes that include scenes straight out of a Call of Duty game or an Army recruitment ad. These scenes did not belong in the movie and are just an excuse to put more product placement and action scenes in. There has to be some kind of record for the amount of product placement in the movie.<br/><br/>There are scenes that are needlessly sappy too. Why they did that is beyond me. It may not be Hook sappy, but it seems forced and makes me think they were trying to makes this appeal to the largest audience possible.<br/><br/>And what's the deal with those unlikeable characters, they might as well have put Tara Reid into the scientist role that Rachael Taylor got. The decision by Michael Bay to have Shia (who is actually a pretty decent actor just thrown into a bad script) be more of an average character and more stereotypical character than the original nerdier character that was more like Spike from the show.<br/><br/>The musical choices were a botch job too, but that is only really a minor complaint that I won't go into, but having nu-metal tunes mixed with older songs seems out of place.<br/><br/>This film doesn't know what it wants to be and a film that should have not been this confusing is and this can now be take Hook's title of being the worst film that Spielberg was ever involved in. To all the people involved, you messed up what could have been great and this can also be the worst film to have made over 150 million dollars, but not the worst Michael Bay film. That still goes to Bad Boys II.<br/><br/>2/10 PG-13 - Violence, Language, and Juvenile Sex Jokes<br/><br/>Avoid this film is you are really looking for a Transformers movie, but if you are looking for a dumb action film, give this 5/10."

(i'm sure they're not and i bet money transformers had better effects. i think the problem in the end is that the movie in general was so darn bad. at least the golden compass was a movie based on a popular book and didn't make everyone want to throw up in their seats)<br/><br/>that's about all - i hope if you haven't seen the movie yet - you don't... unless you want to see one computer-generated miracle after the next"
"dj_xand325","3","2","6","27 January 2008"," Michael Bay you've done it again!
","This film is based on a series of cartoons that were released 20 years ago. Therefore this was a risky thing for Bay to take on due to all the old fans of it that he could disappoint.<br/><br/>Although the transformers cartoon series wasn't in my time, i still watched a few of my brothers old videos of it and began to enjoy it. Due to this fact i can safely say that this film was a significant disappointment.<br/><br/>The film focuses too much onto the lives on the humans rather then the robots. The characters are poorly developed and are in turn, are clichéd and crude. Shia labeouf's character (sam) is a typical American teenager who happens to be chucked into the story. Sam is alongside another flop of a character played by Megan Fox. She plays a blunt and pointless and character who is only there for eye candy (although i don't mind). Much like other Bay films, the army characters are big tough guys who will kill and shoot everything in sight. There's even a cheesy sub-plot for one of the soldiers of him wanting to go home and hug is new-born child. The character's have been hand-picked from pearl harbour and American pie and chucked into a cage with some big machines. This doesn't work.<br/><br/>As for the story, well the lack of story. the story is about a war between the autobots and the decepticons about capturing a cube which holds the ultimate power. The whole of mankind is at stake. the story is very poor and is very unfaithful to the cartoon.<br/><br/>Michael Bay is the king of americanising films and this is what hes done to the transformers series. Hes threw in some slow motion, unfunny humour and boy loves girl into one film thats meant to be a sci-fi thriller.<br/><br/>This is not a sci-fi thriller like its supposed to be, its a teen flick with some robots in it.<br/><br/>I've said a lot of bad about the film but i give it 3/10, why? Well i thought that the visuals and cinematography were at times breathtaking and intense. The fight scenes were fantastic and they were in my opinion the only good scenes of the film.<br/><br/>While this film is watchable, the flurry of cliché's and the extremely unoriginal storyline and characterisation were simply too much for me to really enjoy this film. <br/><br/>Bay brought a fantastic idea to mediocrity.<br/><br/>We're bombarded with stylish visuals but there's a serious lack of originality<br/><br/>3/10"

","Simply put, the toys were fun to change back and forth, but I have never understood how that would translate into a show or movie. The back-story is odd, and I am a sci-fi fan, and the concept of the alien life is never really clear, like why can't they be repaired from any damage, and what is their vital organ(s) to kill them. Can they feel pain and why? Mainly, trying to make a story out of this silly concept is in my opinion pointless, since their is no compelling reason for these things to bother transforming. Why would they hide when they are highly resistant to human weaponry? Then they took the small amount of sense about them mimicking our machinery and added the animal and insect forms."

","Transformers was definitely one of the big summer blockbusters of 2007, but I never bothered seeing it in the movie theater because I never watched the cartoon when I was a kid. I was a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles girl; so basically since I never watched Transformers or played with the toys I figured I would never understand the movie, so why bother? But my friend and her boyfriend saw it opening night, and she's the same as me where she never watched the cartoon, but she said that this was a great film. So I figured I would just wait until the rental just so I can say I wasn't part of the hype that was this summer of the Transformers. So I watched Transformers last night and I have to say that I am amazed, I really did like the movie. It was filled with exciting action sequences, cool dialog, and amazing effects. The story also worked very well and the actors seemed to enjoy doing the movie.<br/><br/>Sam is a teenage boy who is just looking forward to getting his very first car, his dad helps him get a used car that looks pretty busted up and not very special. But that proves to be a wrong theory, one night Sam thinks his car is being stolen when it is driving off. He chases after it and finds out that the car is an alien robot from outer space. He then finds more of these ""Autobots"" who are at war with the ""Decepticons"" and are after a box that will give them unlimited power and could possibly destroy Earth. So the Autobots are there to help Sam and his friends to save the world before the Decepticons can destroy it.<br/><br/>Transformers is a great action movie, it occasionally has it's little flaws here and there, I mean when you really think about it, this is just one of those kick butt action movies. But it is a very well done film and I was really impressed on how great job the crew put this movie together. To be honest I now wish that I saw this in the theater because it must have been more exciting to see on the big screen. I would recommend it though, but watch it on a large screen television if you get the chance, I think you'll get the better effect, because that's the only way to watch an action movie.<br/><br/>8/10"

Mostly his movies are brainless but full of actionsequences that are nice to watch on the silver screen.<br/><br/>Not so with TRANSFORMERS. The Script was a rag rug put into existence in such loveless ways that your brain just had to kick back in and produce all those thoughts revolving around the word BAD. Everything on the storyside made the impression of a not well thought out shortmovie script. On the Acting and (actor-)directing side ... All of us know Michael Bay is not great in directing actors ... but in this movie he proofs HOW bad he can be and how much even the best actors depend on a good director ... if they don't get one ... you get TRANFORMERS.<br/><br/>So ... what about the Action? The strong side of Michael Bay ... not much to impress here either. There are some VERY NICE Action scenes (very nice, not mind-numbing, what it should have been) with a lot of stuff getting blown up ... so often ... this seems absolute senseless and 20 to 30 percent of the actionscenes ... are just ...

After seeing the theatrical trailer I thought that it wouldn't be that serious but was still gonna be a cool action movie. <br/><br/>First, Michael Bay. I couldn't understand why people hated that guy that much, now I do. His direction was the worst thing of the movie. The action sequence were... well, lets just say everything exploded and bullets and cars were flying everywhere. And I couldn't understand what the hell was going on. When Optimus Prime started talking I lost my hopes for this movie. Yes, the special effects, and the sound were excellent. But Michael Bay screw that up by showing stuff that were practically like ""Very nice, but I think I have already seen this, can we continue?"" The story was stupid, it had no sense at all. Now, enough for the bad stuff. About the rest of the movie. It was very, very funny to watch. Until the autobots and the decepticons were introduced. I like the middle of the movie, but I dislike the beginning a bit and specially the end. The acting was OK, but wasn't superb. Shi LaBeouf and John Voight were pretty good. And I laughed a lot with them. As I said before the special effects are amazing but the action sequences were not captured very well and there were many dull times.<br/><br/>Overall I thought it was OK, but it wasn't that good as everyone was saying...<br/><br/>6/10"
"Anduin13","3","2","6","31 July 2007"," Michael Bay does it again
","I was a huge Transformers fan as a child, so with the latest developments in CGI I was truly looking forward to this movie, until I realised that the man at the helm was Michael Bay. This is the man who unleashed Pearl Harbor, Armageddon and The Island upon an unsuspecting world, so I knew fear. I went into the cinema hoping that it would be good, but expecting it to be bad. In the end my expectations won and my hopes were shattered.<br/><br/>Firstly, the good. The action is mind-blowing, there are some set pieces that truly make you gasp. The transforming sequences are beautifully done, and the robots are the most life-like CGI characters up to date. When we look back at the history of CGI and live-action, this film will be one of the true innovators, and its technological achievements are worthy to be mentioned in the same sentence with the likes of Jurassic Park and LOTR. Whenever the Transformers are on screen, the movie becomes something else. Those scenes are precisely what a Transformers movie should be all about: robots beating the daylights out of each other.<br/><br/>However, the problem with this Transformers movie are the large chunks of time when the robots are not on screen. The acting is ludicrously bad, Bay manages to squeeze more emotion from Optimus Prime's little finger than from his entire human cast. John Turturro portrays the wacky black-ops operative, one of the many failed and feeble attempts at comic-relief, but he looks embarrassed by the script. Bernie Mac has become a movie cliché all on his own as the ""funny black man"", a cliché reprised poorly by Anthony Anderson, who is probably the worst ever hacker on screen. John Voight is clearly bored by playing yet another hapless authority figure. Oh yes, and we also get the ""little Arab kid"", Bay's scraping of the cliché barrel knows no boundaries.<br/><br/>This is a movie clinically tailored for the male teenager. The female cast has been hired just to look pretty (which they do, with the exception of the adequately embarrassed mum). I do not know where the producers hang out, but female hackers do not look like Rachael Taylor. And don't even get me started on racial stereotypes. Blacks eat a lot, white suburbians only care about their lawns, Hispanics are superstitious and go into Spanish rants all the time.<br/><br/>The dialogue is painful at times, and the supposedly comic scene where the protagonists look for the glasses while the Transformers wait outside has got to be one of the most contrived and ham-fisted scenes that I have had the displeasure of witnessing. I literally groaned at how completely parochial it all seemed. The world is threatened, yet we stand around talking about masturbation.<br/><br/>This movie is a clear spawn of the post-911 genre. The military are given a bumped-up heroic role, which had the same lame effect in the overall result as it did in War of the Worlds. We are hit over the head time and time again with America's military superiority, but the fact that the Transformers are vulnerable to conventional weaponry completely steals the thunder from the heroic Autobots, who end up being nothing but large support cast. This is the main flaw in an already flawed film. The climax could have been the same if you had erased the Autobots, just let the marines handle things. Oh yes, where were the Decepticons in all this? Yet another wasted opportunity at complexity.<br/><br/>This movie had a lot of potential, but unfortunately Bay and his ilk clearly do not think highly of their audience. They know what to give them, and seeing the comments in this board, they are always going to get a positive response regardless of the drivel they produce."

I've come to the conclusion that films like this are a major reason why people out-with the US dislike America so much: every world disaster centres around the USA; Every teen in the USA has a vocabulary almost entirely consisting of the words ""bro"", ""dude"" and ""awesome"" (and the complete script for this garbage could have been written by an American teenager); the American military are in some ways competent and well-prepared at dealing with crises (patently not so); Americans are uniquely brave in adversity (again a lie). This film is more cynical than any WWF wrestling smack-down you could imagine. Don't get me wrong, I love the States and many people there but none of the folk I know would endorse this crap. Come on people, rise above this rubbish. I saw another corny film this weekend - ""Pursuit of Happiness"" - it wasn't brilliant and again, it sugared the American Dream, but at least it had someone who can act a bit (Will Smith) and it also had some heart and soul - this had none.

","As a fan of the original cartoon as a kid, I was really looking forward to a grown-up, serious motion picture treatment of the Transformers. Instead, Michael Bay's version (as is the case with so many of his movies) was an embarrassment. Aside from the battle scenes on the highway and in the city at the end - which were, admittedly, pretty amazing - I can't find too many positive points. All of the forced moments of humor (Independence Day all over again) took away from what could've been a cool storyline. The scene where the Autobots were in the back yard seemed to go on forever, and was only missing the Three Stooges. Michael Bay seems so intent on trying to please every audience, that his film-making takes very few risks. Yeah, I understand that it was based on the original line of toys and the cartoon, but the kids who enjoyed those two elements are now in their 20's and 30's. They don't need this story to be kid-sized for them anymore. This is simply a case of studio execs, producers and a director who couldn't decide if they should make a Transformers movie for today's kids (who will buy their new line of toys) or for the original fans (who deserve a story minus the kid gloves). Instead, they made a movie that lands disappointingly somewhere in the middle."

I was expecting a dark/serious movie aimed at adults with real substance. I shouldn't have expected so much, as, after all this is a Michael Bay movie. Explosions, action, dumb comedy, silly camera angles, hard to follow action scenes centred around an over charismatic lead 'kid' who saves the day by somehow avoiding gun fire and crumbling buildings. But don't forget, he also picks up a bird along the way, who by the way is incredibly hot. It is so ridiculous and clichéd its almost a parody of an action movie. Its either that or Michael Bay is actually taking the p**s out of himself and his previous movie attempts. I sat there in dis-belief for the most part relentlessly asking myself why? Why on gods earth did the owners of the transformers franchise give the reigns to that unimaginative fool. <br/><br/>Now, don't get me entirely wrong, it is entertaining and the kids will love it, but thats the problem, its just completely and utterly devoid of any sort visual emotion or substance that it simply doesn't qualify as a proper film.

This one wasn't.<br/><br/>The Cube has crash landed on earth, and both the Autobots and Decepticons are looking for it. Without a doubt, the robots look absolutely awesome, these are simply the greatest special effects in a film to date. That said, the Decepticons, the bad guys, essentially all look the same. Honestly, this doesn't matter, because nothing in the script or the story does anything to distinguish any of them anyway. The Autobots on the other hand, are drawn to show plenty of character individually, but only two really get any attention from the film makers development-wise. Perhaps half way through the movie was just too late to start introducing the good guys.<br/><br/>It's impossible to tell if the acting is good or not. Like the Star Wars sequels, the script is just that bad. I'm pretty sure Megan Fox was pretty weak, though. LaBeouf has a style all his own, the way he delivers lines, he kind of attacks naturalness, but once you get used to it, it's actually easy to like.<br/><br/>Don't expect any surprises in plot. Don't expect any sort of sophisticated humor, besides a decent attempt when Sam (LaBeouf) picks out his car. Other than that, it's all pee jokes and boy/girl awkwardness. Dramatic lines like, ""Megatron must be stopped no matter the cost,"" and, ""Freedom is the right of all sentient beings,"" come off painfully banal and unjustified.<br/><br/>Halfway through, I realized I didn't care what happened, or, I already knew what was going to happen, and just didn't care to watch a story I could have told in 20 seconds.

Also, what is the deal with that City that the battle took place in? It sure as heck wasn't Las Vegas, Nevada! If you go from Phoenix to Las Vegas you go right THROUGH Hoover Dam. Also, remember when the Decepticon's activated and said ""All Hail Megatron!""? It seemed like only 10 minutes before they all DROVE from various parts of the globe and ended up at Hoover Dam.

I finally got a chance to see it last night with 5 of my friends. And we all agreed that it was indeed a good movie. The battle/ war between the decenter cons and auto bots was very exciting and went almost the way I imagined it or how I thought it would go. At first I thought that this movie was just going to have the robots walking about the fighting like it was in World Of The Worlds. But not it wasn't that. And it was a good thing that it wasn't. It wasn't pointless action either, there was a good balance I think between dialog and action. This movie was just spectacular in every way possible. It in my eyes is the best movie for this year yet. Finlay a good summer flick that everyone seems to like. It is truly a summer blockbuster that everyone can enjoy even if you aren't a Transformers fan. If you haven't seen it yet and you want too, go and see it. It is very much well worth it. If you didn't like this movie it's to bad. Cause it really without question is a good movie. Only spoiled little brats would hate it. Bravo Bravo!! Thank You Mike Bay You did a great job!!!"
"kalin12351","3","2","6","14 July 2007"," Plot outline: Come see movie, robots it has
","I mean like whoa. That's as far as they thought it through. That's it. Big robots, they talk, and transform into human vehicles. This is the movie. It's not a spoiler. Just the truth. If you're into big robots and big booms go see it. If you're a movie maniac you will not buy the DVD. If you saw even one episode of transformers ever in your life, you'll be disappointed. Bigtime.<br/><br/>What they didn't think was to give them personality. Instead they shoot one corny line after another and no dialog exists. Bumblebee could have been funny and interesting. In this movie he's just a stupid, big robot who delivers another predictable and sooo corny line at the end. All robots, Autobots and Decepticons could have had tons of personality injected in them. They had none. Their role in the movie is to create big fireworks. That's it. Optimus Prime should have been the most interesting of all, up to a majestic level, not a corny, suicidal, half-witted brute you idiots.<br/><br/>Anyway. The actors.... sucked. I'm not sure if it's them or the script. I'm pretty sure i hate the script so it might not be their fault. But! Shia LaBeouf should not have a lead in this movie. Or any movie. Megan Fox is the stereotype pretty but hard life girl that falls for the dorky idiot. All characters are only stereotypes and none of the actors can deliver a good performance.<br/><br/>The scenes are overly crowded, awfully put cut and put together. They could have been great, but it's a sudden mix of.. of... everything ! If you look at any 5 minutes of the movie you see 80% of playing characters. And they end in the worst places. I had like 20 scenes that ended before i felt i would have wanted them to end. Something nice, or cool, or adding to the plot should have been right around the corner. But no. We go to the next scene.<br/><br/>And the soundtrack... You know the music that comes up when heroes arrive at the scene, and they move slowly, saving the day. That's the only kind of music. And there's nothing appropriate on screen. Almost never. they hit some spots just because that music is like forever on.<br/><br/>See this movie with no expectations, a big bag of popcorn and don't get expect to be sucked in. Just enjoy the special effects. Those are the only things in this movie worth seeing."
"frogcollector06","4","2","6","12 July 2007"," Ridiculously Overrated, Terrible Acting, But Watchable
","I went to see this movie expecting a great movie with a great story, and of course some great action. I'd have to say that the action was the only part of this movie that kept me watching, and it still was disappointing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it didn't. The movie is way too long, with a plot full of holes and unexplained turns that left me asking ""WHY?"" The acting was overall terrible, with clichés and insincerity throughout the whole movie. Much of the dialogue was downright dumb and ridiculous. A conversation between a boy and his parents about masturbation? Where is the decency? Why would such a thing even be considered in this movie? Extremely ridiculous! The only things believable about the main character was that he was a teenage boy desperate for a car and a hot chick, typical of most teenagers. Nothing special. And what about that hot chick? She was unbelievably unbelievable, totally shallow, totally pointless, and totally cliché (the hot chick always hangs out with the cocky jerk type guys, then suddenly goes for the geek for no apparent reason). The government officials were transparent. Many of the actors I knew, but their roles seemed totally pointless. Basically, there were too many characters, and the focus changed so many times that I didn't know who I should care about. The characters had no value and their scenes were over-dramatic. I thought the vehicles and transformers were impressive, especially during their transformations. It did seem though that the vehicles were placed in front of the camera as advertisements. This is very clear with the showcasing of the Camaro Concept and the classic duel of the Camaro vs. Mustang. I'm sure eBay made a bunch of money with the use of their name over and over. And what planet do they live on that changes from daylight to darkness in an instant? The action could have been 10 times better by cutting the action scenes in half and saving us the headache of the over-done shaky camera. It seems like this movie was made for people as shallow and insincere as it's characters. Too much media hype and ridiculously overrated, but watchable at best."
"Kelly-130","3","2","6","11 July 2007"," Complete juvenile nonsense
","I went into this movie thinking that it might be some mindless action flick. The opening sequence seemed to deliver on that but when that ended and the story (and I use the term story lightly) started it quickly descended into complete juvenile nonsense.<br/><br/>The end result is an action flick that doesn't have enough action. A muddled ""story"" that most likely was written as an afterthought. The moment Anthony Anderson appeared on screen I could accurately predict every bit of dialog which would come out of his character. I have trouble believing that anyone with a maturity level higher than a 12 year old would find any of the humor funny.<br/><br/>I actually felt embarrassed when the movie ended and left before the lights came on.<br/><br/>I originally rated this a 2 but decided to bump it to a 3 because as I said the opening sequence showed promise."
"BeastWarsTransformers","10","2","6","10 July 2007"," Transformers is the BEST movie of 2007!
","Yes, I said it, Michael Bay's Transformers, more than exceeds and meets the public's eye.<br/><br/>Fans of the old cartoon, as well as fans of the Beast Wars cartoon are going to be very pleased with Michael Bay's updated transformation of one of the most beloved cartoons in history.<br/><br/>Transformers, for most who are not familiar concerns a group of robots from the planet Cybertron. The good guys are called Autobots, and the bad guys are called Decepticons.<br/><br/>I had not seen the first cartoon series since I was too young to enjoy them but I had seen Beast Wars a decade ago, and I have to say, that this movie made me a believer in the original transformers more than I could ever hope for.<br/><br/>This movie was absolutely fantastic, and the crowd I saw the movie with cheered and applauded again.<br/><br/>Thank you, Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg, this movie was terrific!<br/><br/>Give me G1 Transformers over Beast Wars anyday!"
"paulisphotoman","9","2","6","9 July 2007"," great summer movie !!!
","Just got back from a matinée and WOW, what a great summer action flick...I never had Transformer toys, I was a child of the 70's, but loved this movie...It had great action (it is Michael Bay), also had lots of great comedy moments, plus an interesting story, but never seemed too much, I actually wanted more...I thought the potential love story didn't go overboard and acting was superb... Megan Fox as a newcomer was cast perfectly, a model that can also act and do action scenes...I graduated from film school and really thought they did a great job with all the production elements..Praise to Josh Duhamel for doing a great job, he is after all from my hometown !!! The pace of the film was very fast, but it is after all an action film, so it felt like very good pacing...I do wish there was more to the characters of Maggie, but then the film would have been too long..It definitely was ""more than meets my eye"""
"MadWatch","8","2","6","9 July 2007"," Exactly what meets the eye.
","I was expecting an exciting science-fiction/action movie about giant robots that transform, and that is what I got.<br/><br/>Transformers is very entertaining movie. This movie had humor, action, great special effects. The basic story: The American military seems to be under attack by strange forces that is trying to gain information from their computers. As they struggle to find out who is behind it all, a group of giant sentient robots comes to earth to battle with their evil counterparts. The humans and the good Autobots side up to defeat the evil Decepticons. Caught up in the struggle is Sam and his friend Mikela, because Sam, unknowingly possesses the secret to the power that the Transformers are battling over.<br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/>-The special effects were incredible. It is great to see thatCGI has developed to the point where it is really difficult to tell what is an effect what is the actual background in a movie. The robot characters were awesome looking.<br/><br/>-The acting ranged from decent to great across the many characters. Overall, I would have to say that the acting was well done.<br/><br/>-The story was interesting and compelling. I was really engrossed in the movie when it was portrayed the conflict that was going on as something that was affecting 'the world', or at least got the attention of the world. This made the movie feel more 'epic-like'.<br/><br/>-The movie did not go into too much detail about the alien characters background and history, which I class as a good thing, since that would probably open up too many nitpicks.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/>-I like seeing attractive female characters as much as the next person. However, I would like to see them as an actual character. I am tired of the female characters that are put in movies, *just* to be a male characters girlfriend.<br/><br/>-On that note, I am also tired of movies telling men/boys that their lives MUST revolve around women. I am tired of the message to men/boys that their lives are meaningless unless they have some (attractive) woman/girl in their life.<br/><br/>-I don't think that the movie made good use of the alien character's ability to ""transform"". Throughout the whole movie, they chose one form and stuck with it. I just thought that it would have been better to show the characters actually changing forms more often to suit a situation. <br/><br/>-The movie focused TOO much on the humans. I mean, the movie was about 140 minutes long and it wasn't until 50 minutes into the movie, that the ""main"" robot characters were introduced. Even after that, the robots were secondary characters to the human characters, which did not seem right.<br/><br/>-I thought that the Decepticon, Frenzy, was way too ""bizarre"". I think they should have toned down the 'bizarreness' of that character.<br/><br/>-I thought that the robot 'urinating' scene was totally inapprorpriate.<br/><br/>-There is a scene where the giant robots are trying to 'hide' in the backyard of the house was too goody and WAY too long.<br/><br/>Overall, I would have given the movie a 9/10 rating, but there was enough 'low' points to drop that to 8/10."
"dark_faith69","9","2","6","9 July 2007"," A child of the 80s loves this movie
","Transformers gets my vote for best movie for the summer of 07. Now, I was skeptical when I first heard of this movie. I was holding on to the memories of childhood; playing with the toys (we totally had Optimus Prime!), loving the cartoon, crying at the animated movie (Autobots died?! What?!) I planned to boycott, to moan about Hollywood snagging and ruining my childhood. Then I saw the preview and heard the sound. If you ever watched Transformers, you know what I mean. The awesome 'transforming' sound. And it's there. In the movie. And so is Peter Cullen, the original voice for Optimus Prime. So I went and I watched and I fell for the Transformers all over again. Optimus Prime was calm, and yet bad ass. Like a Kurosawa samurai. The Decepticons were mean and...deceptive. And yes, I got a little blurry eyed when the Autobots gathered. Shut up. This movie is great because it really is a story with good guys and bad guys. And the writers stayed away from ""stupid US government gangs up on all Transformers, good or bad."" Which was good, because I hate when alien movies go all ""Mac and Me"". I thought the effects were great, and didn't do too much of the quick jump edits that action movies insist on using today, and that give me such a headache. They even do some stuff in slow-mo, which is effective. Of course, some people are mad because Bumblebee was a Camaro and not a VW Bug. Well, talk to VW, people, because they had their chance and they said no. And sorry, the Camaro is SWEET!! Deal. Without GM,you wouldn't have movie at all to complain about on IMDb, then you'd have to live productive lives, and no on wants that. Some people are also 'upset' that the robots don't look exactly as they did in the cartoons. These are the same people that wanted the X-Men running around in brightly colored Lycra, so I'm ignoring them. All in all, I'd go see it again, and at $6.50 a pop for a matinée, that's saying something. Sure, it's not going to change the world, but it sure is fun to watch."
"gouge_away","9","2","6","9 July 2007"," Best Action movie to date
","I went to see the summer actioner called Transformers last night and that was before I read the headline from Variety Online (see below):<br/><br/>'TRANSFORMERS' DOMINATES BOX OFFICE Robots set seven-day record Transformation complete. Quickly rising to become a summer hit, DreamWorks and Paramount's robot actioner ""Transformers"" scored the best seven-day showing for a nonsequel in history, clobbering previous record holder ""Spider-Man.""<br/><br/>End Variety piece ***************************************************<br/><br/>I am a self-described movie buff meaning that the purview of my movie watching covers a wide swath of land from Dumb and Dumber to Glengarry Glen Ross. Thus, it is and was, that I looked forward to catching this movie and predicted to anyone that would listen that it would be the best action movie of the summer. (""Best action movie of the summer"" is like saying ""tallest player of the basketball team"" and does not necessarily mean the best movie of the summer.)<br/><br/>And it delivered. Apparently, as can be deduced from the Variety headline, others agree with me. Of course, the first question that came to this mind as I considered plunking down the hard-earned coin for a kids movie was: how can a cartoon (Hollywood has put out a few of these recently.) transcend all of the baggage that usually drags these movies into the predictable and, hence unwatchable, zone?<br/><br/>Perhaps, it was the iconoclastic touch of director Michael Bay who, no conservative by a long shot, is nonetheless scorned by the Hollywood elite because of his identification with the fly-over set's aesthetics. Or maybe, relatedly, it was the mostly positive portrayal of the American military and DoD in an era when the media seems hellbent on vilifying anything in camouflage. Maybe the opening scene which - doing exactly what an opening scene is supposed to do - grabs you by the throat and sets the bar very high for the rest of the film, and then, by consistently matching the standard set for itself, allows you to settle in and enjoy the ride. Or maybe the choice of ideal leading characters in the ideal sense of Platonic forms. <br/><br/>Not that the film was perfect. It is, after all, just a summer sprint along the beach, and ironically, I thought that the denouement was predictable and banal. But the first hour-and-a-half ride was an above average romp full of laughs and impossible situations punctuated by popcorn-dropping special effects."
"nate-204","5","2","6","9 July 2007"," Great special effects; too bad Michael Bay directed it
","If you're a 15-year-old boy - this movie ROCKS! If you're in your 30's (like me) you're wondering why did he have to make this so cheesy? <br/><br/>The special effects are worth seeing, but everything else is so ""campy"". The lead women are so good looking and done up - it's just funny, the dialog practically makes fun of themselves and the plot, well... See it for the special effects, but don't expect much else. <br/><br/>(unless you're a teenage male)<br/><br/>I was expecting more from Michael bay, but got what he delivers. Shooting, car chases, hot women, explosions, poor plot development and repeat.<br/><br/>On the upside - it was great seeing transformers back in the mainstream after 20 years. :-)"
"rootieboy","4","2","6","8 July 2007"," Robots were cool, that's about it.
","It's been a long time that I have actually had to agree with critics. This movie was just another Michael Bay film. I even told myself that this was going to be just a good action film before I went in but it wasn't even that. I didn't need more action. I needed better story telling.<br/><br/>You had this hot girl that knew everything about cars. You had another hot girl that knew everything about computers and defense. You have your typical young weird nerdy guys that know more than the old nerdy guys. You have a bunch of models playing the military roles. You have pointless stunt scenes that just don't make any sense. The camera shakes all over the place because you don't know how to use a camera.<br/><br/>The only things good I can say about this movie are The Robots were cool and Shia Labuff was great as Bumble Bee's Driver. Other than that I wasn't very impressed with the way the story was told. This movie though cheesy could have been so much better. Autobots, Roll out of this movie. Get rid of Michael Bay."
"fallenepitaph","5","2","6","8 July 2007"," nice for kids of 90s
","Lets start at the top ; this is not a good movie. The storyline is inconsistent , the genre is vague , the scenes are not well tied together, dogs follow the kid, dogs disappear, kid loses his pants, and they are back on him again , soldiers take a cube that holds the fate of the world to take it to a safe place, and they also take two childs to come with,for absolutely no reason , a kid is fast enough to outrun a f-16like plane, but not smart enough to think that getting in a chopper when there are flying robots around is not a good idea,some girl is stupid enough to follow,not escape from, evil robots,vs. vs..<br/><br/>But it was Transformers. it was what i watched for all my childhood, come to life! it was so much fun to watch them transform , move and talk (but not fight,the battle scenes are awful,sadly:()it was really funny to watch Sam go through all those things,it was cool to see megatron,and stuff..<br/><br/>the battle scenes were really disappointing. except the one that prime kills another robot with his sword, you cant really understand who is attacking who,who does what,and things like that.scenes are too fast and camera never stops shaking,so all you see is metal clashing and shaking.this was the real disappointment.the rest doesn't matter because it is not a deep movie,it doesn't try to be,so a consistent storyline and stuff like that aren't really important;the goal is to see a car becoming a robot and talk.<br/><br/>well, the comedy was too exaggerated ; they try to make you laugh at almost every scene,and when they try to be sad,they fail miserably..<br/><br/>still,it was Transformers.it is a great choice for anyone who ever loved the cartoons and for people who are just looking for a plain fun&funny,mindless entertainment."
"the_crow007","8","2","6","8 July 2007"," The best movie released for 2007!!
","Let me start by saying that, those of who were born in the 1970s like me and who grew up in the 80s and 90s watching those great cartoons that they used to show back then (unlike now where most of the cartoons are a load of crap), Transformers was one of the best cartoon show of the 80s and not to mention one of the best cartoon show of all time.<br/><br/>I always wondered whether they would be able to make an actual Transformers movie with amazing CGI, good action, some humour and last but not least a good plot. Well they finally have. I saw this movie about an hour ago at the cinema and I have to say I am blown away. By far Transformers would have to be the best movie released for 2007. All those elements mentioned above that are required in a movie are in this film.<br/><br/>I think I speak for most movie buffs out there that this movie has more action and intrigue within the first 20 minutes than Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End, Matrix: Reloaded and Spider-Man 2 combined. Even after the first 20 minutes and beyond Transformers delivered what movie watchers were after. There was action, there was explosions, there was laughter and victory. Other good points about this movie is that it displays no matter what obstacles that humans may face, it is the spirit within us that helps us to victory.<br/><br/>Shai LaBeouf performed well as Sam Witwickey and Megan Fox delivered a good performance as Mikaela Banes. For all the guys (and I mean guys and not girls) she is another good reason to see this film. She is beautiful. Actually beautiful is an understatement, she is breath taking.<br/><br/>The bad points that I can think of are that I wished there was more fight scenes between Optimus Prime and Megatron, Megatron's facial appearance did not look at all much like the 80s cartoon and there should have been more Transformers characters introduced. But apart from that a great film for all ages."
"tpaladino","9","2","6","7 July 2007"," Truly the most awesome movie of our generation.
","Yeah, it was all that and more. Sure there was a dubiously thin plot. Sure the entire premise was questionable at best. Sure the dialog ran into some pretty hokey territory on several occasions. And sure, the entire movie revolves completely on special effects and CGI. But all of this adds to the sheer awesomeness of the experience. You know it, the rest of the audience knows it, the actors know it and Michael Bay sure as hell knows it. Because he used every trick in the book to make a movie that people will be in awe of for a very long time into the future. Not for its artistic value or for its contribution to society, but for the sheer pleasure you can take in its vapidness. Its fun to the extreme, and doesn't even try to make any apologies for what its not. Not many movies can say that.<br/><br/>Sure, people will point out continuity errors, or explain that the love story was somewhat forced, or that most of the cast achieved Shatner-levels of overacting. But these people are fools and snobs who need to loosen up and get a sense of humor.<br/><br/>So yes, go see Transformers; the first episode in what is sure to be a long line of sequels. Worth every penny."
"animehead","8","2","6","7 July 2007"," Roll Out!
","Transformers will always be ""More Then Meets the Eye!"" with me. I've been a huge fan since 1984 when I was 8 years old and first saw a bunch of cartoon robots turn into vehicles to hide themselves (robots in disguise). After a long time of following the different story lines, comic books, and series incantations the this concept has brought to life over the years. I have to say that the creators of this new film did a very good job of providing yet another chapter in the Autobot/Decepticon battle. Not only a new chapter but maybe even an all new book. Kudo's. Go see it, if you're a fan from the original series that started back in 84' or someone who's never even heard of Transformers. This movie holds something for just about anyone who loves action, effects, and a good fast paced story about good versus evil. It even has Peter Cullin, the original voice of Optimus Prime staring as such. Awesome."

","They have all that money and great special effects and no imagination! Maybe they were going for the Transformer fan. Obviously not for the sci-fi or fantasy fan.<br/><br/>They even threw in a few cute factors. After I saw the first one, I almost left the theater. I was thinking, ""You've have got to be kidding me."" Cute is one thing, but the tooth fairy bit, that was lame. I think Spielberg has been hanging around Lucas too much.<br/><br/>Seriously. Find a ""writer"" next time. This was obviously written by marketing. If it weren't for the cast and special effects, it wouldn't have been worth my time and money. This movie's story/plot is like water in a sieve. Perhaps the Transformer fans could see the Transformer story bits, but that is all there was. They tried adding other alien urban legend type of references, but it didn't help. In fact very contrived.<br/><br/>Perhaps a different director would've worked, unless this one's hands were tied.

"KeylaLee17","Null","2","6","7 July 2007"," Transformers, Exceeded my Expectations!!!
","I have been anxiously awaiting the arrival of what seems to be the biggest summer blockbuster, Transformers. After seeing the trailer, I became more excited than ever to see this movie. I expected to see a lot of action and some slight humor. I had very high expectations for this movie. And it surpassed all of them.<br/><br/>Though in a competition with some of the biggest summer blockbusters in history, most of which were sequels. Transformers held it's own and exceeded expectations. Which is impressive in itself, seeing that Transformers is held to such high standards. It was not a short movie, by any standards. Two and a half hours is more than some can take in a theater. But, I personally don't have a problem with a long movie, as long as I am entertained. And I was.<br/><br/>Half way through the movie, I was curious to see if the movie could sustain its steam. And didn't know if any more excitement, and laughter could come from this movie. But, I was very pleasantly surprised to find, that it didn't lose it's steam. Transformers was incredibly entertaining throughout the entire two and a half hours.<br/><br/>I expected very large action scenes and incredible effects, and it transcended all expectations. The new effects, were outstanding. And made the action scenes so much more exciting and captivating. But, what surprised me was the incredible humor that this movie contained. I expected to laugh, and I expected the funny ""one liners"", but I did not expect to laugh so often and with such intensity. Transformers was hysterical, I loved every minute of it. Even more surprising than the incredible humor, was the heart behind the movie. You begin to care for the ""Autobots"" and can't wait till the ""Decepticons"" get what is coming to them.<br/><br/>This movie was also very well acted. Adding another notch under his belt Shia LaBouf made a charismatic, funny, lovable Sam Witwicky. While the always charming Josh Duhamel added a great performance as Captain Lennox. Both men were a good add of ""eye candy"" for the ladies to enjoy. But the men have plenty to look at as well, with the gorgeous Megan fox as Mikaela Banes, the girl of Sam's obsession. And Australian bombshell Rachael Taylor as Maggie Madsen.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie exceeded all of my expectations. The action scenes were even more than I expected. The humor, was funnier than anticipated. And the movie in all was exceptional, and worth the money to go see it. And I am a person who can't wait for the DVD, so that I can take Transformers home with me."
"kemicon","6","2","6","5 July 2007"," Someone stole your childhood memory and turned it into an army recruitment film sponsored by GM
","There are a number of good things about Transformers the movie. Good special effects, some funny dialog, and mostly good acting from the cast. Unfortunately there is so much product placement it nearly ruins what would otherwise be a decent summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>The biggest violation of all is that they changed most of the autobots from the original forms. Why does this happen? Because the movie was sponsored by GM. So forget seeing Bumblebee as a VW, and forget Jazz being a Porsche. Now instead you have a new Camaro and Solstice respectively. A freakin Solstice! The product placement doesn't stop there either. Many scenes will have a giant billboards behind them, and sometimes someone will just blurt out a product name.<br/><br/>That being said, there are some positives. The special effects for instance were quite good, although sometimes it's hard to tell what's happening. Most of the actors put in pretty good performances as well, with Shia LaBeouf being the stand out. Megan Fox is also pretty easy to look at, and she puts in a solid effort so no harm done there. John Voight on the other hand is border-line terrible as the secretary of defense, but he was probably just getting paid. He was WAY better in Zoolander.<br/><br/>So if you are 14, have low expectations, are a big fat comic book nerd, or you just want to see cool robots with lots of stuff blowing up, then you'll find a lot to like in Transformers.<br/><br/>Otherwise with so much blatant product placement it's hard movie to recommend.<br/><br/>Lastly I need a final WTF! for the absence of Thundercracker and Skywarp. Oh well I'm sure they will be in the sequel."

","After all the hype n hoopla,its finally here and believe me this movie fails to disappoint.After all the big movies released so far,namely spidey3 n poc3,this too could've gone their way n not hit the mark.But what u get in ""transformers"" is just pure entertainment,what we call in India-""a masala flick"".<br/><br/>Kudos to Maichael Bay and the rest of the team for somehow weaving the plot in such a way so as to incorporate humans into this story of the robots.<br/><br/>The acting as such isn't great and i came out thinking that the robots gave a much better performance than any of the humans.Turturro's humor comes out extremely dry.Megan Fox satisfies us with her beauty and nothing more.Shia is OK.But this movie's gonna be remembered only for its action and S.F.X.<br/><br/>Anyways this movie's just a feast for the eyes(and so is Megan fox).Just make sure you carry enough pop corn into the hall at the start cos there's no way your going to feel like getting out of your seat once your locked and loaded.Get ready for one wild ride where spider-man meets the NFL meets terminator meets every other action flick ever made.This is truly one of Hollywood's greatest entertainers."

","This movie is a Decepticon plot! It's so subversive with it's military violence, and extreme loud explosive sounds, and blurry action scenes that I had to leave the theater because of the intensity of the events shown on screen, and the way to loud volume of the explosions and gunfire. <br/><br/>The plot is simple, as are the main characters. Yes, the special effects are sometimes awesome, but they only occur in about 15 to 20 minutes of the total 2 hour and twenty minute movie! There are a few good laughs, and jokes. The usual battle between good and evil/ heaven and hell/ angels versus devils is depicted. The GM product placement in this film will not save GM! Little children don't buy cars! The theater was half filled with kids. I'd give this movie a 6, but because of the overly high ratings others have given it, I'll only give it a 3 to help to offset the overall ridiculous high average rating!<br/><br/>I fear for the entire populations hearing after suffering through this overly loud movie. The next time, I'll take ear plugs! geesh!"

","'Transformers' - A really splendid adaption of the once 1980s toyline and spawner of numerous TV animated series. The movie takes a little time to get started, a slow introduction, but it picks up pace very quickly and there's no shortage of robot-mashing action and explosions throughout the film. There is actually a decent attempt at character development with some humorous moments between Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and his would-be girlfriend (Megan Fox). Basic plot is pretty simple as it is throughout 'Transformers' lore... Autobots and Decepticons came from the planet Cybertron after it was torn apart by war to the Earth to find a new source of energy for machine-based life. Witwicky is a decendent of a colonial-era sea captain who had found Megatron inadvertently frozen in the Arctic and who had accidentally left an imprinting of the power-source's location on the great-grandfather's glasses which are now in Sam's possession. Sam and Mikaela team up with the Autobots to destroy the the source-cube and fend off the Decepticons with the help of the military and a cagey Secretary of Defense (Jon Voight who has become LaBeouf's real-life mentor). I was pleased to see the robots not coming off goofy or over-wrought. Michael Bay has done a great job bringing the old-school toy series to realistic life on the big screen."
"mooseboulders","8","2","6","4 July 2007"," Good family fun
","This was a non-stop action film from the very beginning. The explosions, car crashes, bombs, and loud noises come at a break-neck pace. Fans of Bay's style will not be disappointed. The action was punctuated with just enough comedy to keep things from getting too repetitive. Sure, there were parts that were a little corny, but I felt they were staying true to the original Transformers style. They were do-gooders who constantly uttered corny ""save-the-world hero type"" lines. This is kind of a love/hate film. Some kids behind me didn't like it and I get the feeling it was due to some of the corny lines. People unfamiliar with the original cartoon series may not get it, but for those of us over 35, it was a visit back in time. I really enjoyed this film."
"moviemanMA","8","2","6","4 July 2007"," Batteries not included
","Explosions, computer effects, guns, global annihilation. If a film has any or all of these parts it is most likely costly and will reel in a hefty load at the box office. But outside of the cinema gross and DVD sales, the film is most likely lost in the mix of the action-adventure genre. Sometimes, a film breaks out of the jumble and gets noticed.<br/><br/>Michael Bay is known for big explosions, CGI effects throughout, big and nasty looking weaponry, and of course, the threat placed on our planet of total and complete destruction. After six films using and abusing all of these elements, it was time for a change. He found his answer in the unlikeliest of all places: A toy.<br/><br/>Transformers have been a kid favorite. The ability to make a car or a helicopter ""transform"" into a alien robot has dazzled the minds of youngsters for years. Now this concept, this world of alien robotics has made its way to the big screen in a big way in Bay Transformers.<br/><br/>The battlefield is Earth and the humans are caught in the middle of an intergalactic war between the Autobots (good guys) and the Decepticons (bad guys). Each side is after the All Spark, a cube that contains the power to transform a machine into a fierce warrior robot. Megatron, leader of the Decepticons, wants to use this power to take over Earth and create the army that he needs. Optimus Prime, the leader of the Autobots, wants to destroy the All Spark before it gets into the hands of Megatron.<br/><br/>Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is the new owner of an old Camaro which just so happens to be Bumblebee, one of the Autobots. His plan was to impress Mikaela (Megan Fox) but ends of bringing her into this ordeal. Sam and Mikaela are dragged into the thick of things because Sam holds the key to finding the All Spark in his relative's belongings. Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and the rest of the Autobots, vow to protect Sam and to find the All-Spark before it gets into the hands of the Megatron and his gang of Decepticons.<br/><br/>The film right from the get-go starts off with a ""BANG!"" and doesn't let go until the final frame. The action in this film is comparable to few films that I have seen. Transformers interact with the real environment and wreak havoc everywhere. Cars are tossed aside like used tissues and the ground is as soft as butter where this metal goliaths roam. Destruction is unavoidable with these guys around. Bay's blend of real-time explosions and effects mixed with the power and awe of the transformers is stunning to say the least.<br/><br/>One thing that films of this caliber usually lack is weak acting due to a weaker script or just plain old bad acting. The cast seems to fit nicely in their roles and the dialogue isn't too unpleasant. Action films are full of clichés to begin with but Transformers has a nice balance of action, story, and comedy.<br/><br/>From start to finish, Transformers just won't ease up. It is a joy ride that will leave you dumbfounded and simply amazed at what Bay and his team have created. This is more than an action film. Be careful, these toys could be hazardous..."
"Tiberius476","10","2","6","3 July 2007"," Holy Crap
","As an '80's baby, I can safely say that one of my favorite cartoons was Transformers. This movie is ""OFF THE HOOK"". It's exciting and loud, and funny, and Optimus Prime is still ""The Robot"". Hugo Weaving makes a perfect Megatron (although there just isn't enough of him). Tyrese is Hot and the kid who plays the hero, is absolutely adorable. There is nothing not to like about this movie except for the fact that in the soundtrack you will hear music from ""The Terminator"", ""Armageddon"" and ""The Matrix"" (come on Mr. Bay, all that money and you couldn't get a better score?). All in all, I'd have to say that (and it makes me sad) that it was better than Spiderman 3."
"GHCool","9","2","6","3 July 2007"," Michael Bay's best film yet
","Transformers is surprisingly a really, really good movie. Sure, its camp and cheese and the plot doesn't make sense for even one second, but as far as movies like this go, Transformers is made with a certain precision and style missing in either of the Fantastic Four movies. Also, surprisingly, Transformers is quite funny too. I've laughed as harder and as often at the jokes and gags in Transformers as I did in most of the comedies I've seen this year. Again, they're certainly better than the gags in Fantastic Four.<br/><br/>Of course, the visual effects and sound design are the real stars of this movie, and boy do they deliver! The Transformers look like they are really in the environments they appear to be in. The sound design will probably go unmentioned in a lot of reviews and stuff, but they deserve a nod too because they managed to find create a new and interesting aural feel for giant robots built on past archetypes, but still completely original. There's one Transformer that transforms from a briefcase into a biped about 5 feet tall that has this voice, look, and way of moving like a little animal that I found fascinating, funny, and cool at the same time.<br/><br/>So in short, if you buy a ticket to this movie, you will be seeing probably the best Michael Bay film there ever was and perhaps ever will be. If you're looking for more than that, then this isn't the movie for you."
"Bacio83","10","2","6","3 July 2007"," A first for any ""robot movie"" Will pave the way for others
","Transformers has opened the doors for many filmmakers to come. The plot, which some have described as limping its way out the door was just perfectly paced with Shia at the helm. What can you ask for in a movie that has broken all barriers and set us up for a summer blockbuster. To me this movie is in the same family as Independence Day with an array of characters taking little bits and pieces of this film as their own. While some characters dwindled towards the end I think time constraints was one of the only factors in that regard.<br/><br/>If it was a 3 hour movie Bay might have been able to include more of a conclusion for those loose ends that left us hanging in the end. Overall there was nothing lacking in this movie. If you wanted an emotion and character driven movie go see Evening. If you want to see a fun action film that will have you ready to get right back in line to see it again see Transformers.<br/><br/>Speilburg's thumbprint was all over this film and it's good to see Bay actually flex his muscles and come out on top for once.<br/><br/>Now we can wait patiently for other filmmakers thinking about such live action movies like Gundam Wing and Escaflowne all inspired by manga and anime. This has truly shown the public not only can live action robots be done, but done well.<br/><br/>There was nothing campy about this movie, head out as soon as you can it's worth every red cent.<br/><br/>A homerun for Transformers I can't wait for the sequels."

","Michael Bay isn't exactly notable for Oscar-worthy plot/character driven films, but he sure does know how to make one hell of a fun and aesthetically pleasing movie. Bay has taken the immensely popular Transformers franchise which had previously only been seen in the light of comic-books, toys, and cartoons and has brought it into the realm of the real world with this movie.<br/><br/>The storyline is very straightforward in its structure as the quintessential, thematic Good vs. Evil piece: Two polar opposite factions of a robotic alien race (The Autobots led by Optimus Prime and the Decepticons led by Megatron) duke it out on our lovely green planet in order to retrieve a cube that holds the power of the universe so that they can destroy it to keep the evil-doers from abusing its powers or use it with evil intent. Stuck in the middle are the two humans, Sam and Mikaela, who become entangled with these (incredibly cool) alien beings. The story goes on from thereon out detailing how the Autobots and Decepticons try to find the cube along with the help of Sam and Mikaela.<br/><br/>Now honestly, coming into this movie, you really can't expect it to be American History X or Schindler's List dramatically uncovering deep flaws or triumphs in humanity, but what you should expect is loads and loads of fun, which you will surely receive. From the get-go we get an incredible action scene that has a helicopter transformer wreaking complete havoc on a military base somewhere in the Middle East. Simply put, it's amazing. However, being a Transformers fan as a child, the most thrilling scene was when they introduced Optimus Prime and the other Autobots, which is pretty self-explanatory.<br/><br/>The movie is unbelievably captivating--it's stunning visually and the CGI/special effects are flawless. Every single action scene had the audience cheering for more and more of the jaw-dropping effects and ""wow"" moments in the theater I was in.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox do well in portraying their characters, despite some moments of awkward adolescence. There were some questionable plot holes in the movie, such as some times when certain characters were left in a cliffhanger of a scene and then never heard of again. However, that's totally okay because I don't think anyone actually cared or paid attention to those characters as they only became roadblocks to the next awesome action sequence. Also be forewarned, there is a whole lot of product placement in this movie. Every few minutes you'll be sure to find some kind of product that companies have sneakily endorsed into the movie.<br/><br/>9/10 because it achieves what it is meant to be and never tries to be anything else. It is consistent in its structure not to mention (yet again) completely awesome and action-packed despite some problematic storyline details. So be sure to catch this movie, because it's probably going to be the most fun you'll have in the theaters this summer."
"killer3000ad","9","2","6","3 July 2007"," Quite pleasantly surprised
","When I first saw the teaser trailers a year ago, I had reservations. A mecha live action movie with big Hollywood production? I could so easily see that being ruined by Hollywood executives. So I went into this movie with no expectations or hopes, which may account for my high rating. For the record I was a casual fan of the original TV series, and never followed the various offshoots like Beastwars etc etc.<br/><br/>For starters the transformations are a marvel and truly fun to see for all the different robots. The transformations never comes off artificial or cartoonish like The Hulk movie disaster was. And the action whether it was between Autobots and Decepticons or against humans is well done and quite suspenseful in some instances, though some of the slow motion parts seems to be hashed from 300. Nevertheless, I found it fairly entertaining and a welcome break from the huge plethora of CGI kiddy movies we are being inundated with nowadays, so it's refreshing to see what was essentially a cartoon given a serious treatment and look. There is violence and death in the movie of both humans and Transformers, though I privately wished there was more gore in it.<br/><br/>Of course there are flaws. A bit too much time is spent on the romantic development between the human characters. This results in some of the Autobot interaction seeming out of place and hard to relate to. Indeed, I did not find myself grieving much over the demise of some Transformers. I think more time should have been spent on the character development of the Transformers, especially the rivalry between Optimus Prime and Megatron.<br/><br/>All in all, I am quite impressed and satisfied with the movie and hope that a sequel is in the works, and that the sequel will have more gore and action and not get it's violence watered down like Die Hard 4.0."

"daniel_waddell01","10","2","6","2 July 2007"," A Complete Package: Writing, Cinematography, CGI, and More
","I would like to start by saying, that I usually do not review movies in a positive light. I am typically the ""warn others"" kind of person, because I know what false expectations can do to an otherwise good movie. However, I am also an advocate of voting with your wallet. And with great movies, I am glad to do a little campaign work.<br/><br/>As for my review, I would like to begin by giving two thumbs up to Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman for creating such a great screenplay. Transformers contained enough sophisticated dialog to keep me interested in what people had to say, and an occasional one liner to keep the attention impaired laughing. But, lets face it, this was not a movie centered on banter, this was an action movie centered on CGI. In that department Dreamworks did not let us down. The action was enough to keep everyone on the edge of their seats, with some amazing live-action/CGI hybrid shots to blur the edge of classic cinematography and 3D animation.<br/><br/>All of this, however, would not have earned a review from me. The icing on the cake, was the nostalgia that the production team included into the story. I must say that I felt like a child again, waking up to a bowl of cereal and the Saturday morning cartoons. That is not to say that the style of movie-making or character development mimicked the old cartoon; I mean I have grown up and my sensibilities have matured. Instead, the movie had just enough old school elements to spark connections in the deepest recesses of my brain that haven't fired since the mid-80's, bringing back those childhood memories. Case in point: they even got the cartoon Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) to resurrect his role as the the leader of the Autobots.<br/><br/>I am going to digress for a second, because what is a movie review that does not address the negative. Because I could not identify anything markedly wrong with Transformers, I am going to be forced to argue nostalgic semantics. Bumble-Bee is a yellow and black (VW) Bug, there is a little irony in that, which is lost on a yellow and black Camaro. I understand that there might have been some marketing issues that made VW look bad, but it was a missed element. You can tell the original story had a Bug, so the writers can't be blamed (Who calls a 75 Camaro junk?).<br/><br/>Once again, I am writing this not to seek a career as a writer, but to inform other movie fans, that this is a great movie, in my opinion the best so far this year. For those of you who feel jaded by a plethora of bad trilogies, go see this movie and vote with your wallet for a blockbuster. At least it will negate the votes that you may have already cast on the other movies that you were disappointed in. With that regard, I have to vote for it at the theater a couple more times.<br/><br/>--Daniel"

This movie has the best special effects I have ever seen. There may be some movies that are on the same level (like Lord of the Rings), but none is better. This movie shows where special effects is going in the future. Michael Bay is a genius... if they could do a three picture deal (which is rumored), I pray that it will live up to this one. The movie itself was great. Acting was impressive. There was humor and comedy throughout, which is a nice change of pace. The love story did not interfere with the movie, in fact it was nice to see. The only thing I would have changed about this movie is that Starscream and Megatron and Barricade did not have more to do with the movie. This movie is a must see in the box office (at least once); and you must own a Blu-ray or HDDVD player when this movie makes it out. It is that good."

But I wasn't so sure until he bought the entire Generation 1 series on DVD and we all watched every episode and I was literally like, I had no idea what I've been missing!"". Until finally the day came, the four of us drove to the theater, and when we got there, the lobby was packed with THOUSANDS of Transformers fans, from old to recent. And they were the ones who grew up with the original cartoon with their kids who got into the G1 series, including newer ones that were teenagers. Until finally after many minutes, we went into the room, the projector rolled, and we all watched it. And after two hours when it was over, the four of us and some people liked, some of them thought it was okay, and some are no longer Transformers fans. And I didn't care if the robots didn't resemble to the cartoon very well, it's just a solid Michael Bay-popcorn flick, and the sequels that proceeded this film (Except for Bumblebee), they will never top like this one.

"Samiam3","5","1","2","10 July 2017"," The beginning of an expensive bombastic gimmick
","Ten years ago, Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay kick started what would eventually become one of the most financially successful and bombastically dumb summer franchises in film history. So putting aside any thoughts or premonitions about the function of this fiasco, it's worth looking back and asking how the original Transformers bodes as movie.<br/><br/>In the first hour, Bay succeeds in summoning some laughs out of Shia LaBoeff and his new car (the autobot Bumble-Bee in disguise). Keeping this a secret from his parents makes the hiding of ET look like a piece of cake. Enter Megan Fox, the potential love interest. When we meet her, she is inspecting a car engine, bent over it as if posing for a playboy cover. She goes through the movie with almost as little to do as she has to say; a reminder that the women in Michael Bay movies are objects. <br/><br/>Bay's floating swirling camera work signifies everything that is simultaneously right and wrong about him; he is a exceptional pornographer. The focal point of his direction has always been making the shot look good. In terms of performance there is nothing wrong with the camera work, but ironically its perfection is distracting; as is the application of slow motion. LaBeoff has enough energy and tongue-in-cheek to make the first hour of the movie tolerable. Halfway in we meet Optimus Prime in all his chrome bodied glory, with the sombre godly voice of Peter Cullen. He gives a cue card explanation of his job and his enemy the Cybertrons. These moments may conger feeling of nostalgia for anyone who grew up on the 80's series. For the rest of us, Optimus' lecture makes you realize how cheesy an idea Transformers really is.<br/><br/>Bay stages a loud numbing climax that is the film's greatest undoing. It starts with a punch that catapults an eighteen wheeler so beautifully that it would have been more thrilling to have seen the actually rigged effect on set. he may have a good eye for camera, but when it comes to editing he is virtually blind. The action takes place in the kind of dense metropolis where all the buildings are the same colour, and there is no sense of orientation. It feels as if every shot is only two frames in length, and at the speed of the unfolding chaos makes it impossible to distinguish the Autobots from the cybertrons. <br/><br/>Perhaps more than anything else, Transformers' biggest problem is that is that the Transfomers themselves are nothing resembling characters. They have no feelings, and their dialog seems manufactured. Certain lines are exactly what you expect to hear when you press the button on the toy."
"theandrewahern","4","1","2","27 June 2017"," Transformers (2007) Movie Review
","With the recent release of the fifth installment in the extremely profitable yet critically maligned 'Transformers' franchise – 'Transformers: The Last Knight' – let's take a road trip to July 2007 and examine the film that began the worldwide phenomenon. Titled simply 'Transformers', the first film in director Michael Bay's loud and fast franchise suffers from a lot of the same issues that plague the later movies in the series, but at least manages to breathe life into a beloved cartoon franchise in a unique way.<br/><br/>Chief among the issues that plague Michael Bay's 'Transformers' movies is the amount of time spent focusing on the human characters instead of the titular robots, and the first film in the franchise does not escape this issue. Instead of using the entirety of the films screen time to highlight the story of the massive metal monsters, the audience is ""treated"" to a story revolving around a set of human characters with the Transformers taking something of a backseat in their own movie. While the human element provides characters that the audience can relate to, most fans and critics alike agreed that the movie would have benefited from far less human screen time and far more Transformer time. The fact is that moviegoers paid money to see Transformers transform and fight – not humans running around.<br/><br/>There is something of a ""saving grace"" in regard to the humans, however, in the form of Shia LaBeouf's Sam Witwicky. LaBeouf delivers his lines in exactly the type of way you would expect a quick-thinking high school junior would, and his timing and expressions inject an over-the-top yet surprising genuine sense of humor and wittiness into the film. The other human lead in the film, Megan Fox's Mikayla Banes, does a fine job in her role as well, although it is obvious that her occasionally over-sexualized character is just there to draw in an audience. The rest of the human cast – Josh Duhamel, John Turturro, Rachael Taylor, Anthony Anderson, and Jon Voight, among others, all do fine but don't offer anything particularly substantial or fresh to the movie.<br/><br/>As for the Transformers featured in the film, a few stand out while the others all blend together into a pile of metal in the background. Peter Cullen – voice of Optimus Prime in the original cartoon series – lends his voice to the same character here, and does so in spectacular fashion. Prime is easily the most recognizable Transformer in the movie – part of the reason being Cullen's deep and commanding voice that fits the character so well. Opposite Cullen's Optimus Prime is Hugo Weaving's Megatron as the primary antagonist, and while we don't get to spend too much time with him, Weaving makes him feel menacing and iconic. Bumblebee is the other Transformer that stands out, acting as Sam Witwicky's guardian throughout the movie, and although he doesn't technically speak, he's the emotional core of the Transformers team – evident through his expressions and softer facial design.<br/><br/>Speaking of character design, this iteration of 'Transformers' is vastly different from every other version seen to-date. Whereas the classic and modern cartoons and toys have typically featured robots made up of simpler geometric shapes, Bay and his team of mad scientists have come up with far more complex designs for their versions of these characters. While the idea is sound – if cars, trucks, and planes had the ability to transform into giant robots, they'd have millions of individual parts to consider and showcase – it may not have been the best idea to make this concept a reality. Due to the extremely complicated design of the characters it is often difficult to tell exactly who or what you're looking at, and near impossible during all the action sequences in the film. It tends to just look like a lot of scrap metal flying around aimlessly while characters make stupid jokes. 'Transformers' is not driven by plot or character development, but instead the desire to put cool action sequences on film. Unfortunately, it doesn't even do that very well.<br/><br/>At the very least, Bay's 'Transformers' and its many sequels offer fans of these characters a unique version of the franchise to watch and more toys to buy. Ultimately, however, that fact doesn't transform this movie into anything more than the pile of scrap metal that it is."

This is definitely one of the best efforts in bringing an old television cartoon to the big screen, and it does so in great style. Shia LaBeouf leads this movie to stardom, with an exceptional performance, even though his character is a tad annoying at times. Sure there is dumb humor and almost too much action, but that is Michael Bay for you. All in all, it's one of Bay's best!"

","Okay, So as the title suggests and if you haven't seen the film yet, the CG is pretty much the cornerstone of this movie. While it probably will blow you away, the novelty eventually wears off and then you wonder: hey, where did the plot go?! But then your attention is quickly drawn back by a giant robot slamming into an office block - or a wonderfully shot car chase; probably some of the most impressive action sequences to ever grace the silver screen.<br/><br/>A hefty dose of cheese seems to have been added to the movie, but most of it can be laughed off. One particular scene was reminiscent of the fighter jet in the movie Stealth downloading songs off the internet. A few loose ends in the thin story probably suggest a sequel is coming - but how can anyone have a problem with that! It has its laughs (even if some are cheap) but the 2.5 hours go fast; I'm sure most people will leave the cinema on a high note. Hopefully this movie gets Bay the credit The Island didn't.<br/><br/>And a postscript for hardcore Transformers geeks: go with your expectations at your ankles because you're probably going to cringe when something isn't as it should be (although even a minor fan like myself noticed a lack of original transformation noises). But on the whole this movie has plenty more to offer, and appeals to many more people."

","A high school student, Sam (played by Shia LeBeouf), buys his first car. The car turns out to be a Transformer, a robot that can transform itself into many different things (but mostly vehicles). The car is a benevolent Transformer but there are evil ones out there...<br/><br/>The fact that this is directed by Michael Bay should tip you off that this is going to filled with many spectacular explosions, and nothing else. Spectacularly bad, just like Pearl Harbour: weak plot, laughable dialogue, wooden acting. <br/><br/>Clearly made for kids. Ironically, it is 2.5 hours long, making it a bit too long for kids' concentration spans. Mr Bay clearly has not even adhered to the first rule of movie making - if you can't make a good movie, make a short movie."
"Skipper81","1","1","2","9 January 2016"," Michael Bay can't tell a decent story to save his life!!!!
","I mean seriously!!<br/><br/>Huge back-story and amazing characters from the original series all the way up to Beast Wars and beyond! Instead Michael and team shitty cherry pick good and bad points of the back-story that best fit around the many explosions and fighting scenes. I was reading in an article that Michael Bay refused to have Optimus as a red truck! that who he is, and Shia LaBeouf is a waste of space, who cares about his school project or pimple popping decisions or his best friend who he dumps on the side of the road. Horrible, absolutely terrible.<br/><br/>Now for the positives, Peter Cullen voicing Optimus. Fantastic, absolute gold, Hugo Weaving did a credible job voicing Megatron shame that Frank Weller wasn't invited to the party but ah well that can happen. Megan Fox is pretty hot, I'll admit the scene of her checking out Bumble Bee's engine is hot, hot hot. Shame Shia was there, and the army team did very well, Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson put in a solid performance. I also thought Rachael Taylor did really well.<br/><br/>Still even with these guys holding up the weight nothing can save this movie from the resounding abomination that it is. the Autobots look pretty crap in robot mode with overly unnecessarily complicated transformation scene (again Michael's love of CGI on display) the Deceptions are a rather weak villain group. Starscream looking even more pathetic then the original series, he's had thousands of years leading the Deceptions and still sucks, and there's not a single Deception who's a capable enough leader to challenge inept and backstabbing Starscream. Megatron looks terrible in his jet spaceship mode.<br/><br/>So in conclusion I gave it one star because I loved Transformers as a kid, I don't what this sh!t is but good it ain't and Michael Bay and team shitty should hang their heads, Transformers and all the follow ons are digital fertilizer that nothing good can grow in"
"Tyson14","8","1","2","15 August 2014"," Don't take it seriously it's just fun!!!
","I wasn't going to watch this film because it sounded like such a cheesy cash-in of all the other comic book and 80s cartoon revival films going around. Which technically it was. I'd heard it was a no-brainer with great special effects. Luckily I love enormous CGI, and someone else had bought it so I watched it for the hell of it. And loved it!<br/><br/>I wasn't disappointed by the visual effects - they are tremendous! So good, in fact, that the detail sometimes makes the fight scenes confusing - more so than watching LOTR The Two Towers from the front row of the cinema! But why I enjoyed it so much wasn't down to the graphics, but the dialogue - shocking but true. It's one of the funniest movies I've ever seen which in no way professed to be a comedy! For starters, one of the Transformers is a bright yellow Chevrolet sent to protect our young Shia LaBeouf - though apparently not from getting laid! I hadn't realised the Transformers came to Earth in order to become match-makers. Anyone ever tell them three's a crowd?<br/><br/>OK, I was initially right and this is a completely formulaic story wrapped around a load of mouldy cheese; an old plot rehashed and straining for some kind of deep and meaningful backstory - at least in any scenes involving the Autobots and Decepticons (see how I was paying attention?). As long as the robots don't talk, you've got a great movie. Really. The dialogue was cringe-inducing, but only from the Transformers themselves. The human characters were fine. Better than fine. Bloody well funny, I say!<br/><br/>Also a little note about how styles of acting change over the years: Look back at a film from the 1930s and you'd be forgiven for thinking it a little OTT. (But they all came from the theatre, so we can forgive them.) More recently - and as this film seems to show - we're getting into the truly ""natural"" side of acting, where people DO talk over the top of each other when arguing, or joking, or simply behaving as normal people do. In reality people don't wait for one person to stop talking before saying something - that is truly reading lines from a set script. But I think actors are now trying to sound genuine on screen.<br/><br/>However, It doesn't always work, sometimes it's confusing and distorted unless you have an ear for it. I'm putting this in as a warning, because I watched this with my mum and dad and got different reactions. Dad was fine - thought it was hysterical and loved the explosions. Boom boom. But my mother struggled with everything, and in the end believed she must be entirely out of touch with the world because they seemed to be speaking a different language to her. I suggested she was just old and going deaf as well as not being down with the kids. She told me to get stuffed. But anyway, just a warning in case you have that era problem where you can't discern one voice from a crowd: the party-effect, or whatever.<br/><br/>But for anyone else - as long as you don't take the film seriously, you'll enjoy it emmensely. Forget the awful moral message delivered by the robots and just giggle your socks off!"

Michael Bay has directed his actors very well. The acting is wonderful as well. Now on the the CG, that, is something to talk about. The CG is AMAZING. And the fact that its so hard to tell that the robots are not real, is a reason to praise the actors. There isn't a scene in this movie where i don't wonder if they are actually scared or not. A lot of people also judge this movie on authenticity to the animated TV show. I haven't watched the TV show but i know that you cannot make a movie about a ANIMATED TV show and use real people and make it as good as the ANIMATED KIDS TV show. This movie is not supposed to follow the little kids animated TV show so don't get your hopes up on that. It is an adult version. Hence all the explosions. Not supposed to be realistic. At. All.

So I am sure I miss all the fun because the robots seem like wrecked garbage whereas they are nicely designed seen on a theater screen! <br/><br/>In spite of this handicap, the movie is still great, not exceptional but great. It's true that the suburbia feeling is a great door to plunge into this robotic world. Another good point is the talented cast: for me, Labeouf and Fox are newcomers but they are promised to a brilliant future (see Indy IV).<br/><br/>I remember to have seen trailers but they didn't appeal me. So, another time, you got the proof that trailers aren't trustworthy because a bad one can make you miss a good movie.<br/><br/>I am not a die hard fan of transformers so I can't judge the storyline, but it's a pity that is too much militarized.

But in a way, like someone said, it changes from suits, boots and wings! <br/><br/>The big final action sequence is very well directed so I keep a good memory finally! <br/><br/>NB: and yes, as a kid, I dreamed to have a lot of transformers toys but I remember to play with only a green harrier plane and it belongs to their concurrency, the GOBOTS!"

","I wasn't expecting a lot of a movie based on a TV show (which I've never seen) based on some toy. But Transformers look cool in advertisements so when it came to TV I decided to check it out, and it's actually a pretty decent movie. The action scenes are well done, the movie has a fast, consistent pace and I found myself surprisingly interested in what was happening.<br/><br/>At the same time, this is not a great movie. The robots themselves are just silly stereotype caricatures, and the dopey humor doesn't jibe with the cleverer humor earlier in the movie (i.e. the car that plays songs appropriate to the situation. The robots fail to generate any real personality, so Shea LeBouf's emotional attachment to them doesn't make any sense. Although it might make sense to undemanding 10 year olds, who are probably this movie's primary target audience.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, I found the movie less interesting as it proceeded from a cute action-comedy to a big action spectacular. The final scenes of mayhem were competently filmed, but there are none of those ""wow"" moments you get from really good big budget action pix. In fact, the most impressive thing in battles is the smooth transformation of robots from one form to the other, and by movie's end you've seen that enough to no longer be impressed.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is a bit of a hack job, but it's a very entertaining hack job, and sometimes that's all you really need."

But I was very surprised by how quickly it drew me in, and kept me in the action at all times, with never a dull moment.<br/><br/>Although the plot seems a bit out of wack to me, everything else is very well-done. The acting is great, especially by Shia LaBeouf (also rest in peace Bernie Mac, who had about two minutes of footage). The special effects and battle scenes are really well done, and there are a lot of captivating subplots that all eventually tie in to the main plot seamlessly. The movie's suspenseful at times, action-packed at others, and downright hilarious also.<br/><br/>So overall, this is a good movie, bordering on great.

","From the opening sequence this movie never let up. I never followed the cartoon series, but what surprised me the most about this movie was the realistic intensity of the military sequences.<br/><br/>I would have been tempted to give this movie 10 stars in the same category as Bourne Identity, a personal favorite. However, at times the movie took on an Independence Day cheeziness as the heroes consisted of a bunch of misfits clashing with the stereotypically inept g-men which amounts to little more than political statements that I find particularly bland and stupid. However, it is partially redeemed by the efforts of the special ops forces in the end. But rather than watch Shia Lebouef be transformed from his experience, he simply ends up with the girl in the end.<br/><br/>Also, what's the deal with the glasses?

"dfle3","6","1","2","20 March 2008"," Good popcorn movie
","This is an entertaining action movie concerning the invasion of Earth by living robots that can mimic Earth technology, like cars and planes etc. Parents should be warned though-the movie is based on a cartoon show which was based on toys...which means small kiddies will want to collect the ENTIRE ""Transformers"" collection of toys, cartoons, etc. So, this movie is potentially dangerous to your wallet and mortgage.<br/><br/>Firstly, seeing as the genesis of this movie is so rooted in children's' toys and cartoons, the movie is quite adult in parts-with matters concerning sex and masturbation...so, it's quite odd to see this kind of material in a movie which is presumably not suitable for its child consumer audience.<br/><br/>Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised to find the movie quite funny in parts, especially as I groaned at some of the early 'humour' of one of the ""Transformers"" (a car, in this case) playing certain songs on the radio which shadowed the car's driver's expectations (in getting laid).<br/><br/>The movie features the Italian Dustin Hoffman, John Turturro, as well as John Voight, who both bring the occasional B movie melodrama acting in a self-conscious way...to good effect.<br/><br/>The movie is pretty much non-stop action, but yet not in a bad way, as some action scenes/movies can be (like the mass fighting scenes in one of the Planet Of The Apes movies as well as Attack Of The Clones, the second Star Wars prequel). The special effects are excellent in this movie...from the transformation of cars etc. into humanoid looking fighting robots, as well as the scenes of destruction brought about by the Transformers in urban environments.<br/><br/>I doubt that this movie is something that can be enjoyed so much on a second viewing, but you cannot fault its entertainment value on first viewing.<br/><br/>Its saving grace for older audiences is (apart from the action scenes), is, as I say, the humour. From teenagers, to parents (especially the Transformers themselves), each brings some comedy to the proceedings.<br/><br/>However, some of the 'philosophy' in the movie is painful to listen to-the ""Transformers"" spout some non-sense, which is presumably to guide how children play with their toys or something. It's a very ODD combination of adult material and material for children. The movie can't seem to make up its mind on what its target audience is."

When I heard that they were going to make a Transformers live action movie I got pretty excited. When I was younger I never thought it could ever happen. Aside from the story which stayed pretty true to the old TV series and the CGI Transformers looking amazing, this movie wasn't good at all and failed to live up to my expectations.<br/><br/>Director Michael Bay emphasized way too much on the cheesy human story. Sure the humans should be important characters in a Transformers storyline but there was so much stupid dialog like ""I don't like girls who work on my engine"" or scenes like the one involving Glen and the donuts. Now I am not expecting this to be an Academy Award. Another huge problem is all of the long action sequences which are entertaining at first but just drag on and on after awhile.

Michael Bay, deliberately or not, made an attempt at it with Armageddon. Mr. Spielberg, consciously understanding these ""thin"" moments in cinema, has got the feel for it.

","There is a mystery to cinema because it is an illusive art. It is an artistic collaboration and for that reason it resembles a labyrinth with no center. In viewing a film it's nearly impossible to pin down where a given creative touch is coming from and the result is that the aesthetic heat of a film is generated as from a house fire instead of a single match. This analogy holds true that a good script is doused in gasoline and a talented director is like a propane tank in the basement, such that a burning house can take on the impulse of dynamite. And in the absence of explosive potential a movie can simply burn up resources and create a mild spectacle. <br/><br/>With this comparison in hand, a Michael Bay movie is like taking 150 million dollars worth resources, assembling them in a huge special effects pile and lighting it ablaze, then stand back and watch it for a couple hours. Yes it is mildly entertaining, and lots of people who happen past will also stand and watch the massive fire, you could even charge admission. But is it art? Well I guess that depends on what you call art. <br/><br/>I enjoy watching building demolition. To see a large formidable structure give way by the force of a controlled explosion and crumble into dust and rubble entertains me. I know that these demolitions require a high degree of technical prowess. The buildings structure is taken into account, charges are set with explosives which is not a simple task, and controls are enforced to insure things go smoothly. The result is something that I find entertaining to watch. Do I consider it art? Well sure, why the hell not? It involves degrees of ingenuity and creativity, but it's safe to say that there is no Matisse of building demolition. This is because building demolition is limited by its practical application, which is to take down a building rather than express a higher degree of cultural relevance within the practice of demolition. In the same way a Michael Bay movie is limited by the practical application to make as much money as possible. Can't really hold that against him, but at the same time there is no need to give him more credit than what's due. So to say that Transformers is anything more than an explosive semi nostalgic money grab is similar to saying cotton candy tastes great and won't rot you teeth. That kind of talk gives you cavities."
"SilentJerry","7","1","2","10 November 2007"," Half good, half bad.
","The first half of this movie does nothing and goes no where. We're stuck with Shia LaBeouf acting goofy, hanging out with his parents and driving around in his car. Really, you can skip to the one hour point and you would be able to pick up from there. There are a few funny things in the first hour, but not really worth it. Ultimately, too many humans who aren't John Turturro and not enough Transformers. Like getting stuck eating vegetables for an hour before the steaks are ready. Also there's all the stuff with the cube; which to me didn't make much sense. It's been on Earth for thousands of years; but the two factions show up at the same time looking for it. Geez, you'd think one faction could be off by a few hundred years or something...<br/><br/>The second half is a rousing, exciting and fun action movie. The second Optimus Prime finally shows up, the movie receives a huge jolt of electricity. It takes a really long time to get to the battle between the transformers; which I think everyone really came to see. I hope in the sequel that they don't spend so much time with Shia LaBeouf and skip right to the Transformers, there was no LaBeouf in the TV series and he's just not really adding much to the movie.<br/><br/>The effects are first rate. The editing, like all Michael Bay movies, seems to have been done by people suffering from ADD, although it's never as bad as it got in Armageddon. The production values are first rate. The girl is kinda hot, although not my kind of hot, looks like she has anorexia or something. The military and government stuff is over the top, unrealistic and exactly what to expect from a Michael Bay movie. Any movie with a secret branch of the government keeping a dangerous secret is OK with me.<br/><br/>So yeah, it's all good."
"steve2901","6","1","2","20 August 2007"," Good for Michael Bay.
","I hate Michael Bay films. Seriously. I don't know why he is still allowed to make them.<br/><br/>When I saw the trailer for Transformers, I wasn't a fan of the franchise but I have to say I was excited until I saw Michael Bay's name on the screen. I had a gut feeling that he would just ruin the movie with his cheesy directing style. Also, I wasn't sure how he and Steven Spielburg could make a movie as challenging as this together and make it good. And I have to say in the overall product there is a slight clash of their two styles, but it doesn't really subtract from the overall experience.<br/><br/>The story, if a bit cliché, is well structured and there is a great development of the plot. However, for the first hour or so when the Transformers aren't a large part of the plot yet, the pace is slow and sometimes it can be very dull, but Autobot Bumblebee is very entertaining as he helps Sam in his day to day life. The actions sequences, while entertaining, can be very confusing as the fights are either too close or too far away to realise what is going on, for example when Jazz is killed by Megatron myself and half the audience hadn't realised until it was actually stated. It's also confusing because many of the robots are coloured the same, and the only really distinguishable figures are Optimus Prime, Bumblebee and Megatron. Also at times, it can be rather predictable, but I won't go into details there.<br/><br/>However, like Bad Boys, this is one of the only good films Michael Bay has made. Here's hoping he isn't directing the sequel."

","I was a big fan of Transformers as a kid and I can't begin to explain how excited I was when I heard that they were going to make it into a full on live action movie.<br/><br/>Transformers tells the story of the Autobots (the good robots) and the Deceptacons (the bad robots). The deceptacons are out to get a device known as the Allspark, a device that has the power to destroy human life on earth. The Autobots are there to make sure that doesn't happen. The leader of the Autobots Optimus Prime forms an alliance with Sam Witwicky, a teenager who has the key to finding the Allspark...blah blah blah.<br/><br/>First of all, the praises: the special FX in this movie are seamless. You could almost believe that they created these robots from scratch just for this film. The film is also quite respectful to the original cartoon. Optimus is still a truck and is voiced by the one and only Peter Cullen, Starscream is still a jet, but some have been changed, and the changes are very welcome. The humour has also been given special treatment, with a fair share of laugh-out-loud moments.<br/><br/>Now the complaints: although this is an action film and people don't normally care about the story for a film such as this, that still doesn't make it right that it was pretty much ignored. There are some blatant plot holes in this film and the script could have been further fine tuned and tested before they decided to say ""oh what the hell, let's just get on with the action!"". Also, Michael Bay's directing is...difficult to follow. Yes, the action comes in thick and fast, and there is no shortage of explosions and metal crunching, but, my God, can't you just pull the camera back a bit and let us see what's going on? The editing is too fast and often you are left gritting your teeth because he simply won't show you what's happening in the whole picture! So, they have green-lit two sequels. This film was a very decent stab at it. It was a good way of seeing the Transformers in life action mode and there are moments when you want to jump out of your seat in amazement. I just hope that in the new ones they fine tune the script a little and please let us see what's going on more!"

The image of a jet fighter plane transforming and turning against the squadron it hid with is quite something.<br/><br/>Structurewise, there is little here that is different from any summer blockbuster - slightly superior teen flick standard. But just as LotR declared year zero for visual effects, Transformers give us a perfect blend of live action and CGI. The transformations are stunning, and I never grew tired of watching them.<br/><br/>The film is not too dominated by its many set pieces; nor is it ruined by squeezing humour into the bits where proper dialogue should appear. In summary this is somewhat short of real film making, but it achieves its aim of entertaining for its entire length."

It lost 2.5 because of the following reasons: The Director tried to get the viewers to feel for the characters, e.g. the captain of the navy phoning his wife to say every things going to be OK etc etc, all seemed a bit Armageddon like.

","This is going to be a cliché review of a cliché movie. First of all, I really really like the movie. The FX is awesome, the pace is non-stop, the jokes are funny. However, all of these are to be expected when you go into the theater. So I'm going to focus on the unexpected.<br/><br/>First of all, there are no bad guys. Well, no bad humans, that is. Everyone is trying at their best to stop the real bad guys - the Decepticons. Sure the Section 7 secret agent starts out like an @$$, but in the end, he still kinda redeem himself a little when he's fighting the Decepticon spy Frenzy.<br/><br/>Second, the humans are not dumb. This is good. I'm particular delighted that the special forces quickly figure out the enemy's weaknesses, and are actually able to lend a helping hand to the Autobots during the fights.<br/><br/>Now the bad.<br/><br/>Way too many characters. Is it really necessary to throw in a Black hacker-geek? What's the point of the boy hanging up-side-down on the tree? I guess Michael Bay wants to show there are lots of stuff going on, many are just mundane, so it adds a layer of believability. However, what it does is added 20 extra minutes that could make it a lot tighter and better film.<br/><br/>Too much time spend on the second chapter, around Sam's house. I understand it is important to build a relationship between the Autobots and Sam, but it drags on and on and on. So even though the movie's 140min, I was not really satisfied with the last battle. For me, it's too short, especially the fight between Optimus Prime and Megatron. And the way Megatron was destroyed was a total let-down.<br/><br/>Which brings me to Megatron. Hugo Weaving the voice acting is bad-ass, but Megatron's design is way too grotesque. He looks more like a giant metal Freddy Krueger than an evil general or an evil king, which is actually what he should be like. And what's with the transforming to an airplane? All the Cybertronians get their looks from some kind of vehicle on Earth, so where did Megatron get his disguise when he's been frozen for thousands of years? And why doesn't he transform in to a giant kick-ass laser canon? Being a plane, it was actually hard for me to tell Megatron and Starscream apart.<br/><br/>Anyway, a really exciting movie, lots of enjoyment, with some giant holes as well."

He did a great job delivering some cheesy dialog and he has a natural talent that sells the story.<br/><br/>Aside from him, it's the toys that steal the show! Those GIANT ROBOTS are AWESOME!!! This movie had more action than all of the other summer films this year combined! (The only exception may be Die Hard 4, which I haven't seen yet.)<br/><br/>I was one of those kids who purchased the very first Transformer toys back when Optimus Prime was a gun, and one of the characters was a cassette player. So my affection for the Transformers franchise goes way back.<br/><br/>Without making this very long, suffice to say that it is well worth your money as long as you can appreciate that it is a Michael (explosions) Bay movie, full of cheese dialog, a ridiculous story, and its main purpose is to sell toys.<br/><br/>Heck, I bought four Transformers after watching this.

","This is an enjoyable ""leave your brain out of the door"" type of movie that tried to give an updated version of one of the loved cartoons of the 80s. For a ""TRUE"" fan of the franchise (and not just G1), the updates were impressive and grows on you (would you rather see them in their ""Beast Wars"" identities? ...shivering...). Besides, during the course of the cartoons, many changes were made along the way and some are bad, but some are also cool.<br/><br/>Going back to the movie. The robots should have have more on-screen time where the Autobots should have been the heroes saving the world and us humans from being obliterated by the Decepticons. The robots should not be subject to giving out too much comedic reliefs (respect, people!). Too much focus on Sam (Should have changed the title to Sam and the Transformers) and the ""sentient being""'s side. That the plot was a rip off of Independence Day also added to the down side of the movie.<br/><br/>Respecting the source material, a good story, and awesome CGI pays more dividends. (Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Spiderman 1..ok and 2) So I gave it a 6, because the effects were wicked; Shia's acting was impressive as well as John Turturro's; and Optimus Prime's voice IS Optimus Prime.

","A seemingly unending war rages on between robots who are literally able to transform into most anything you can imagine (primarily cars and planes). The heroic Autobots and evil Decepticons take their war from the fledgling planet of Cybertron right to the middle of Earth. Now the fate of the galaxy and all mankind is left in the hands of Autobot Optimus Prime and his robotic soldiers. ""Transformers"" came about in 1984 and made a splash in the United States with a popular toy line and cartoon series. While definitely nostalgic and effective to a point, the concept is somewhat limited and simple-minded. This is what happens with this mainstream box office dominator which has cleaned up financially, but critically it needs a lube job. A wide range of actors have less personality and heart than the special effects-laden robots which are more reminiscent to those corny 1950s Asian monster entities than to 21st Century cinematic live animation. The film is too long, it lacks substance, it has no tone, it is short on brains, and its pacing is a total train-wreck. Even the visual effects and sound are annoying, distractive, and migraine-inducing. Director Michael Bay continues to make films that please audiences who just want to see lots of explosions. However, he fails to show any growth when it comes to mandatory cinematic elements like screenplay, characterization, storytelling, and even rudimentary aspects of cinematography and editing. Chaotic, loud, and ultimately pointless, ""Transformers"" was better left in the obscurity of its Japanese animated time capsule of the 1980s. 2.5 out of 5 stars."

Extremely impressive CGI, as should be seen in cinemas only and probably not enjoyable on a small screen. Very loud music and sound, at times intrusive. Shia LaBeouf was perfectly cast.

"T-ZER0","1","2","7","2 August 2019"," Be Honest
","Nostalgia and lack of wanting to admit that all the Michael Bay Transformers movies are bad. That's why most of the reviews on IMDB are positive. People are entitled to Nostalgia and I understand. But this movie is god-awful, no matter how much people try to make it. It is really not a adaption of Transformers. It's more like a movie about Alien Robots who learn Earth customs and try to defeat a rival Robot group. Sort of like a terrible West Side Story.<br/><br/>I know people like my Aunt and my friend love this movie. But I cannot root for a movie that forces you to laugh When Bumblebee pees on another human being. The Autobots are supposed to represent the good of alien life, and even though that guy was a jerk. Peeing on him is not the right comeuppance. There is no Spike Witwicky on this film. Instead we have this horny whiner teenager named ""Sam"" Witwicky. Who is not a great character.<br/><br/>His father is not even a big part of the movie like he was on the cartoon. He's made to be an idiot. Which is very saddening. I guess Paramount didn't care about how much Michael Bay butchered the franchise as long as he sold a ton of Hasbro toys.<br/><br/>None of the characters, not even the Autobots are likeable on this film. They curse and have hardly any regard for preventing destruction. Speaking of which, Michael Bay when he got this franchise thought ""You know what would really sell this franchise as well as toys? Sexy women!"" So we have Megan Fox in this film. A woman who honestly wears way too much makeup. If Bay loves her so much I wonder why they are not married, and I'm honestly wondering!<br/><br/>So we have inappropriate scenes of Megan Fox. Which are disgusting, I'm not saying this because I'm not attracted to women. I'm just not a horny guy like most dudes who watch this film.<br/><br/>Megatron is not even the main villain. Well, he is. But he doesn't come until the end of the film. It's really frustrating. I remember when my classmates in school saw it. All they could talk about was Bumblebee shooting a bunch of Decipticons on the truck, or my cousin wouldn't stop saying how ""hot"" Mikaela was. It made me realize that Bay doesn't care about the original Transformers. He's just trying to make money by advertising and showing off women. I'd rather go back to the old days of the 1986 Transformers and that awesome soundtrack.<br/><br/>I dislike that they made Bumblebee lose his voice. He was my favorite Transformer in the old series, and now they made him a useless bug who pees on people. So in summary, please don't say this movie is good just because it's better than its sequels. Because, I hate to say it. You're lying to yourself. It's not."

This plot line can be summed up in one sentence: a bunch of morons hectically running around, shouting inane things and acting in incomprehensible ways. <br/><br/>The special effects are great but one-dimensional and repetitive and lose their appeal very quickly. After 10 minutes or so they are just boring and grate on the nerves. Noise and movement and colorful explosions are not enough to sustain a film, especially if the action sequences consist entirely of endless variations of the same theme: bulky robots fighting each other and crushing things.<br/><br/>The only redeeming feature of this film is the beauty (not acting capability) of Megan Fox.

","and I'm not one of them. <br/><br/>Transformers had impressive special effects. But the acting ws subpar and plot was written for a younger audience. Megan Fox's sweet bod was, in my opinion, the best part of the film (narrowly beating out the special effects) My roommate rented the video, so i paid exactly the right amount for it (nothing). Perhaps on the big screen the special effects would have been more captivating but i found myself glancing at the clock on the wall wondering how long the film was. I discovered it was 143 minutes long and I felt it was probably about 43 minutes too long. I can't believe that the entire story couldn't have been condensed at some points.<br/><br/>Overall Transformers was an average film that had decent special effects to keep it from being a stinker. I give the Special Effects an 8 and the film as a whole a 4. Not good, not hideous and possibly better than anything i could have watched on TV tonight.<br/><br/>Edit-After reviewing other comments, I realized that for many Transformers were part of childhood/growing up. I also remembered that in the 80's I was in high school and i was far more concerned with how to get into Tracy L's (I'll refrain from using her last name) pants than anything concerning toy robots. So I when into this film unbiased by childhood memories. ((Unlike when I watched the re-release of episode 4 (known as STAR WARS when I saw it back in 77-78)The trouble was that the kid that saw Star Wars was grown and the magic was lost in the tide of life)) Anyway, apparently lack lack of bias didn't help much, the film simply wasn't very good. At least I didn't feel part of my childhood memories were being violently tread upon (like others have implied). I also learned that a lot of the charm of the Transformers, the development of their personalities was apparently too (tedious? frivilous? unnecessary? expensive? useful? ) to be added to the movie. Shame."

I can forgive it for being an ad for Hasbro, but the other product placements and cheesy pro-military statements (""you're a soldier now!"", ""these men never give up"") were too much. I enjoyed the special effects, although I don't understand how the transformers gain in mass when the get bigger. The toys I had as a kid transformed, but they did't grow! Also, why was that little one (the radio/cell phone) able to take on just about any shape? If that's the case, why didn't Bumblebee just grow his legs back, or Prime become a plane when they needed to go faster? Too many plot holes for me."

","OK, for start I haven’t expected too much from this movie. I’ve watched cartoons regularly when I was a kid , liked them. When I heard that movie is coming to theatres I wanted to take mine little cousin to watch it. Dear god. Although cinema was pretty OK, comfortable chairs, those 2 hours turn out to real torture. After hour and a half I even felt sleepy, but I couldn't’t sleep cause of all that noise and flashes. After couple days have passed I can shortly describe it as Boring and dull movie with American sense for humor. <br/><br/>Plot: The movie has quite OK base idea. That’s for a simple entertaining movie it’s OK. Typical teenage-catastrophically happy end movie. They could make it much better by dropping those jokes ?!? and perhaps make it less obvious. And its details and side stories that have made quite mess of movie, but of course well known American sense for humor doesn’t help.<br/><br/>Acting: Hmm, it was strange that they haven’t take some famous actor to take some side role, or give voice to bots. Acting was average. I can’t even remember any bright moment from some actor. Actors who gave voices to bots were average too, but there’s the problem with high distortions made to voices to look more like human. At least they could give deeper and stronger voice to Optimus Prime. <br/><br/>FX: Well, this is all that movie is about. Effects of transforming is pretty rapid, hard to follow, but OK, they are highly advanced robots  Even though this is FX movie, there is way too much of it.<br/><br/>Directing: The worst one I have ever seen from Michael Bay. And I believe that there are hundreds of directors who could make this movie much better. I have no idea who is target group for this movie. It goes from kindergarten kids, through teenagers with a slight attempt to communicate with older SF fans. This aiming is done pretty poorly and they have missed a lot. During whole movie audience is blinded with FX. It’s hard to even follow base idea with all those FX. It would be nice to measure what part of time is spent on special effects and what on so called acting. So many battles, which are not even continuous, final battle in city is rubbish. I wonder if they even make battle plan on map or some model. It looks so uncoordinated. <br/><br/>I believe May tried to make movie dynamic with all those FX, but it failed a lot. I’ve gave it 3* cause of effects  and effort. I haven’t seen anything else in this movie."

The humans are really of no interest whatsoever, save perhaps the two central characters. The scripting is dire, there are no memorable lines and it would seem at times that if you were to read the script every line would end with an exclamation mark (even the questions).<br/><br/>That said, the effects are jaw-dropping! The fights are spectacular and the sound effects whizzed, whirred and pinged appropriately and for once, loudly. Kudos to Bay at least for realising that an on-screen explosion should rock the theatre, not sound like someone passing wind! However, the battles at times are tricky to follow, particularly when the Auto-bots and Deceptocons (TM?)are fighting each other, as they are just a frenzy (sic) of gears, pistons, wires and hardware, intertwined and knocking seven bells out of each other. Bays frantic camera work (Cut/new angle/zoom/pan/tilt/cut/zoom out/pan - all in 2 seconds) does not help at all. It just adds to the confusion.<br/><br/>One last minor barb is the fact that, although the Autobots are introduced, they are not fleshed (automated?) out and the Deceptocons are not introduced at all - they are just there to kill everyone. It seems we are expected to remember their personalities from the 80s cartoons and carry on from there. Extremely lazy! So, no real story, no dialogue, no characterisation, amazing effects. Oh, and way to long! Two hours and twenty minutes is too long for an action film, but it seems to be a trend in Hollywood at the moment.

Humans outrunning transformers, the transformers looked cack IMO.. Too scrawny and not blocky enough with enough colour. They were weak. The voices weren't great. The music was terrible! Nothing Transformer-y about it. And what was with the crappy humour? The biggest thing was probably the focus on humans throughout, which was one of the biggest mistakes possible, IMO. Who cares about humans when there are Transformers!! <br/><br/>The film was bad because of: - bad acting - typical soppy scenes.. very cliché - totally Americanised in the worst way possible - Crappy plot - Sometimes couldn't tell what was going on in the action scenes.. way too FXed up.. more story and character development, please. <br/><br/>Everybody came out saying it was great, but then they didn't look like the type of people who would think full-stop.

However, the Transformers barely did some low-grade demolition work.<br/><br/>Most of the film (I assume to save money on not so special effects) is spent on a not so enticing ""back story"" where the characters do one of the worst ""misunderstood teens"" movies since ""The Blob"". There is the usual ""The military, secret government knew about it all the time"" conspiracy and few ""explicit"" references to teen sex that are typical of modern teen comedies, but, the characters (especially the hero) is completely unengaging and he has no sexual chemistry with the pre-requisite girl friend.

The Camaro results to be a Transformer. An ancient civilization devastated by war between the Autobots (that defend the liberty) and the Decepticons (that defend that the stronger must command). They search a legendary artifact: the Cube, that will unbalance the war to one side. Well first of all it is compulsory to congratulate the fantastic special effects that are on the movie. They not seem CG at any moment and sometimes it is like the robots are also actors. The landing of Starscream or the skating of Barricade are good examples. All the action scenes and all the moments when the robots fight are just impressive. It is clear that Michael Bay knows how to do this things. The main problem is the fact that the movie has nothing more than that, the story is childish and it has some little holes with the size of an Death Star. Many things happen without any reason, the good ones solve many problems just because they are the good ones, there are lots of stupid jokes in order to make people laugh (only the robots hiding in the garden is good). Thinking about the fan side, the fact that Bumblebee is know a Camaro, well is kind of heretic, but once you accept this, it is good, the movie is like the comic totally, it is as it should be if the comic was a movie.

","The action is good in Transformers is good and it is funny at times, which keeps the film from being horrible. However it is weighted down by too nonsensical plot points, clichéd filled plot, cheesy writing, under used characters, some horrid dialogue, and product placement overkill.<br/><br/>The premise is bit outlandish to begin with, but given that it is science fiction that is expected. However there are scenes that just defy belief too much. For example there is a scene where the Autobots (the good Transformers) are stomping around a house, including one stepping on a fountain and some how no one sees or hears them.<br/><br/>The writers uses a typical approach to developing the relationship between Sam Witwicky (played by Shia LaBeouf) and Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox). The approach leads to some good moments, but overall it isn't anything memorable.<br/><br/>The movie also had some astonishingly lame moments. A prime example of this is a scene where a little girl goes outside and asks one of the Transformers if it is the tooth fairy. Those that made the film were trying to be cute and funny, but just ended up with an awful scene.<br/><br/>For a movie that is about Transformers, the Transformer characters were disappointingly under developed and under used. It would have been better had they gave more time to characters other than the two main Autobots, Optimus Prime and Bumblebee. It particularly would have been better to show and develop the Decepticons (the evil Transformers) more.<br/><br/>It was disappointing that Megatron (the Decepticon leader) only appeared toward the end of the movie and when he did appear he was given some awful, overly simple dialogue. An example is when prompted to say why he wants to kill the humans, Megatron just says something like ""They deserve to die."" Another example is when chasing Sam, Megatron asks him if he is ""motivated more by courage or fear."" It was as if who ever wrote it was determined to make Megatron sound like a character from a movie about cavemen.<br/><br/>Then of course there were all of the product placements. I find product placements annoying as it is, but I understand that is something that is a part of movies that I will just have to deal with. However there was so much focus paid to particular car company at times it seemed like I was just watching a long television ad. Then to compound that there were many mentions or shots to highlight particular Web sites, computers and other companies.<br/><br/>Overall, Transformers is on par with mediocre movies like Independence Day and Armageddon."
"richardgrieco87","3","2","7","15 July 2007"," Why Does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies?
","This summer blockbuster stunk worse than the bathroom of a Mexican restaurant on ""All-You-Can-Eat Fish Taco Day."" The acting ranged from acceptable (Shia Lebouf) to horrific (Jon Voight). As expected with any action film, the character development was lacking. It seemed that to make up for this, Michael Bay had the soundtrack play for what seemed the entire movie. If I have to listen to that Linkin Park song one more time, I am going to lock myself in the closet and listen to My Chemical Romance until my ears bleed. The corporate sponsorship was very apparent in the movie as well since 90% of the script was written about E-Bay or GM Products. The lines were cheesy and awful. The voice overs for the robots, or ""row-bits"" as Jon Voight refers to them, were terrible as well. It felt as if we were actually in the cheesy eighties cartoon at times.<br/><br/>Overall, wake up and smell the coffee fan boys. This movie stunk. If your heads weren't so far up your asses regarding your childhood robot fantasies, you would have noticed it too. Quit focusing on the CGI and try to remember how horrible it actually was. Remember this, if you find yourself saying that this is the best movie ever, it speaks volumes about you as a person and your intelligence. It may also cause your friends to remove you from their ""five"". Hmm, there is another shameless company that could have been promoted more in the film. Maybe the sequel.."

","In the eighties there was an animated series on television called Transformers. In the eighties I was a kid. Unhampered by the things that make an adult life so boring at times I liked the series. Somewhere in 2006 the trailers for a Transformers film were released and I could be nothing but skeptical. For who would the film be made? The kids of the eighties or the kids of the current era? Driven by curiosity I decided to go and see for myself, by seeing the film. It turned out to be one of the better choices I've made this year.<br/><br/>The film is very clearly based on the animated series: the same set of characters, the same story line, the same idea basically. It works as well as it does because it combines the raw action of the robots clashing together in war with the fact that it doesn't take itself very serious. In fact, it doesn't take itself serious at all, often using self deprecating tag lines between the rampaging action sequences.<br/><br/>In effect, it works like a charm. It's a good barrel of laughs with plenty of CGI based action, most of which is worked out well enough not to cause too much friction on the viewer. So, there you have it. Simple minded but effective action with a good laugh in it.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 rampaging robots in disguise"

And John Turturro was easily the best actor and character in the entire film.<br/><br/>Still, when the plot has even less substance than the original 1984 film, you know something is just not right.<br/><br/>For the most part this is just Michael Bay poop filled with poor editing, camera work, music and a whole lot of nothing.<br/><br/>Let's not even mention the product placement.

"exchronos","10","2","7","4 July 2007"," Best Movie Made Thus Far
","This movie was an experience, and one of the very few and rare films I have seen where the theater audience actually clapped at the end in admiration. No prior knowledge of Transformers is needed to see and enjoy the film, and it can please those of all generations, not only the ones who have or are growing up with Transformers being active in pop-culture.<br/><br/>The greatest thing about this film is the story and how each subplot seamlessly unfolds making the human aspect of the story shine through glorious CGI action. I did not expect the film to be funny, but humor threads the film beautifully. The plot itself was ingenious, and has the right mix of human character story lines and the Transformers themselves-something I was initially afraid would be off balance leaning towards the human characters more than the Autobots.<br/><br/>The only precaution I'd suggest is not to take any children along that may put yourself in an awkward position if you haven't had ""The Talk"" with them yet. One scene between the teen owner of Bumblebee and his parents mentions a sexual act which may get younger children asking you about what they're talking about-and a few parents/grandparents after the show were a little frustrated at that scene due to having to explain it to their kids/grandkids appropriately, or get around explaining it due to not being prepared for it. It's a funny scene, but if you're a parent or grandparent not wanting to explain the facts of life to a small child after the movie, at least now you've been warned.<br/><br/>To me, it was probably the best movie I've ever seen, and I hope more fantastic action-packed character driven films follow its lead and expands the imagination of what can be done on film, and how the awesome, no matter how improbable, can still entertain when done right.<br/><br/>Sincerely, Exchronos"
"brandnewthursday3","5","2","7","4 July 2007"," Although a bit over the top, still a great movie with some superb acting from Labouf.
","I grew up in the late eighties/early nineties so Transformers(especially the toys) were something I'm familiar with. Fast forward to 2007 and I'll admit, seeing that the little cartoon from my early childhood was going to be made into a Michael Bay blockbuster got me a little giddy and weary at the same time. Giddy because I figured, Okay, robots on the big screen. That should be cool. The weariness came from hearing Michael Bay would take the directing chair. I went in thinking this movie would be all action(which it mostly was) but was pleasantly surprised by Labouf.<br/><br/>His comical timing, wit and true-to-life scared shitless-at-these-alien-robots acting was superb. I enjoyed the scenes he was in the most, obviously. John Voight was not at his top game, but still pretty good. And John Tutoro is always a treat to see in a movie. The rest of the cast was good, with all the side stories coinciding. Anthony Anderson was hilarious as a hacker with good intentions. Megan Fox is smokin' hot, and she's a decent actress as well.<br/><br/>The script to this movie was pretty well done, I must say. To take a campy cartoon and turn it into a big budget movie must have taken some balls. It was mostly unbelievable, but it's a movie, so all is forgiven. Some of the dialogue could be considered cheesy, but it was pulled off nicely by the cast. The story was a bit confusing and towards the end it got somewhat convoluted, but overall was easy to follow.<br/><br/>Transformers is a must see this summer. And look for Labouf to be like the next Dicaprio. He went from a kid in a Project Greenlight movie to a full fledged star of this summer's biggest hit.<br/><br/>and it will be this summer's biggest hit. The way threequels are going, it's bound to do better than the other movies that have come out."

","I have got to say Michael Bay truly knows how to make a blockbuster summer movie. With the exception of the Bad Boys movies and Pearl Harbor. He knows how to make a really entertaining film. Michael Bay does a great job of leading up to the Transformers arrival then when they finally show up, they don't disappoint. Peter Cullen's voice really brought back such memories of the cartoon. There was such a sense of urgency and great action scenes in this movie. AND to everyone that finds that Megatron's voice being done by Hugo Weaving is bad, don't fret.

And what you have is only 2As and an unsellable junk of your great-grandfather who claimed to have seen a giant ghost in the Arctic.<br/><br/>Still, you've achieve your mission in getting 3As your dad is looking for you a car. And you've found yourself a Chevy Camaro which costs more than your father wished for, but as Bernie Mac once said: ""A driver don't pick the cars. Mmm-mm. Cars pick the driver."" So with a rusty but awesome Chevy Camaro which enables you to pick up chicks, well sort of, as you've picked a super sexy tattooed babe with some hard edge on her. And one night, your car suddenly drove away from your home. And you tracked far away just to know where your car's heading to. And he reached his destination, something happened. Your car's turned into a giant robot with a weird logo on it. You feel shocked and amazed...<br/><br/>And that's when the action all begins....<br/><br/>Directed by Michael Bay and executive produced by Steven Spielberg, Transformers is one film that could change the face of the 21st century. And i know that the word ""Michael Bay"" means bad luck, but this is an good if not great if not awesome film! It's as if Michael Bay learns a thing or two from Spielberg and the likes of 'redeemed' directors like Martin Campbell.<br/><br/>It's just a pure awesome, balls-filled, pure=-fun piece of masterpiece that's going to land in the top 10 of AFI's 100 Movies list for a decade from now. It's like witnessing a Muse concert. It's just fricking mental! And i, as a Transformers fan enjoyed this film and believe that Bay didn't ruin my childhood, instead he relived it.<br/><br/>The action starts with Blackout attacking a US base in Qatar, and ends with all 8 Transformers(4 Autobots & 4 Decepticons) fighting each other in a city. Now that's how a true Transformers style is made! I like how it begins with a Transformers battle, and ends with a Transformers battle. It's just how perfectly planned it is.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a 10/10 film for me. Great action, great drama and great stuff of awesomeness that'll pee your pants out.

","Okay, probably not, but firstly, let me say this movie gave me chills up my spine the first time I saw it. It is beautiful. The special effects were absolutely breathtaking. That's where it ends in terms of top quality film making.<br/><br/>This movie is silly, it's big, loud, over budgeted, overblown, over-everything, riddled with stereotypes (which really p*ssed me off sometimes) however it's damned good fun. And it's funny. The acting is good - Shia Labouf definitely has acting chops, as do the rest of the cast - a mixture of big names and unknowns in acting, music & modeling and the story.. well don't expect anything overly original, but in the end, it probably doesn't matter. The music is great - big orchestral sounds accompanied by choir although there are sequences accompanied by rock which kind came from left field and really annoyed me. The plot line does get muddled up - the editing is pretty ordinary and lets the movie down a little, but in the end, it's the Tranformers and their cannons that really get me going.<br/><br/>They look fan-tiddly-astic - Optimus and Bumblebee are the only two who really get any character development, which kinda sucks, but, hey, it's official - two more sequels to go, so there's always hope. The actual action sequences - incredible, BUT, I had to see it a second time around, because everything moves so damn fast and camera is so damn shaky that, for me, it was really impossible to really see anything and the first time I saw it I actually got bored during the final battle, which meant the ending came about pretty abruptly and basically the movie fell flat on its face.<br/><br/>But the second time 'round, is much better - you have more of an inkling where to look during the action sequences and everything is a helluva lot more coherent.<br/><br/>Overall, awesome movie. Loved the transformers, the chicks and the cars (and that badass truck that is Optimus Prime). A great Saturday night out at the movies."

"girlsarequality","10","2","7","29 June 2007"," Transformers!
","""Megatron, by the end of this day, one shall stand, one shall fall"", Optimus Prime <br/><br/>OK. So let me just start off by saying this is now easily one of my favorite movies ever. Seriously. It is fantastic. It is by far Michael Bay's best movie.<br/><br/>It is Transformers. If you are any at all familiar with TF, then you won't be sad. There are changes madebut the changes make sense in 2007 vs. 1984. Every character is spot on their counterpart. Yes, Megatron isn't a gun, and Bumblebee isn't VW Beetle.but who cares? They are still very much the characters we have come to love over the years.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a VO of Optimus Prime describing Cybertron (yes, you see Cybertron.very cool), how the race of Transformers came to be, the war, and why they are scattered all over the galaxy. There is a something called a ALL SPARK cube which is an alien artifact responsible for creating a sentient race of robots. Thousands of years ago, a group of them called DECEPTICIONS, led by Megatron wanted the All Spark cube to ""take over the galaxy"" which started the war. The planet was decimated and the cube was lost into the far reaches of space. (guess where it landed?) So, the Decepticons track it down, and the Autobots follow in pursuit. START MOVIE, etc..<br/><br/>I was afraid that Bay would PEARL HARBOR this movie, and by that I mean he would get caught up in the human drama that he would forget the robotsmuch like his PEARL HARBOR moviewhich to me was like a 3 hour long distance phone call commercial.<br/><br/>All the human characters are great. They fit. If you are supposed to like them, you really do. If they are supposed to be funnythey are. If they are supposed to be an assthey are. Even the dialog isn't as corny as you would expect it to be. By far, the MOST intense dialog comes from Prime himself. He is a military leader.knows good from bad, right from wrong. Some of his dialog is simply amazing. And the fact that its PRIME'S voice from our youth makes you all giddy! Shia LeBeouf is now one of my favorite actors. His sense of comedic timing is spot on. One to watch to be sure.<br/><br/>The CGI.wow. These things transform at 90MPH. It is amazing. And the SOUNDTHE SOUND IS THERE. KKEEE KOOO KOOOO KEEE KEEEEE Were there things wrong with it? Of course. There are some plot holes, sure. Sometimes the action is SO fast that you get lost in it. It's hard to see who is fighting who. And there is not enough time spent with the robots. Of course, this movie was full of a LOT of development and expositionso perhaps for the inevitable sequel..<br/><br/>All toldI am more than surprised about how much I like this movie. DO NOT miss this in theaters.<br/><br/>And it is OK to get goose bumps when you hear Optimus say "" AUTOBOTS.ROLL OUT!"""
"cybortrip","10","2","7","29 June 2007"," More than meets the eye
","Just like every other adolescent boy back in the mid-80's, I was a big fan of the original Transformers cartoon series. I was so much of a fan in fact, that I have since steered clear of any of the other spin-offs: from the CGI version to Beast Wars to whatever else is out there. I felt that nothing could meet my standards since the bar was set so high. Then I had proof in my 6-year old son: he has seen some of the newer versions and did not seem to liken to them the same way everyone else did to the original. One day my son told me he saw a preview for the new Transformers movie and he could instantly tell I was excited (...any reservations I had about this potential flop, I kept to myself). We rented the original movie and my son was hooked after watching it. There is no single thing I can point out that makes it so good (so I'll take the easy way out and say), it just is.<br/><br/>So anyway, I went to the screening in DC last night and had reservations about the whole thing right up until the opening scene...and then I was blown away. The movie was everything that I had hoped for plus more. First, the visuals: anytime you have the likes of Bay, Spielberg, or DreamWorks working on a film, you're golden. Put them all together and you are left with your jaw on the floor. The sound effects were great too. When the first robot transformed (very early on in the film), it made that sound that has been ingrained in my head since the 80's and gave me chills. At that moment, practically everyone in the audience roared in unison. The only pauses in action (and there was a LOT of it) came during the comic relief. With a movie like this, one would normally expect the comedy (if any) to be mediocre but in this case it was top notch. I laughed out loud more watching this film than I have watching some comedies. For any parents out there though, just a heads up - there is a masturbation joke (I personally didn't mind it even though I was there with son...you sort of have to anticipate this sort of stuff being that it's rated PG-13). The writers really brought their A-game for this one. For me, dialogue is one of the most critical elements of a film and can easily make or break it. It wasn't the typical cheesy or dumbed down material you'd expect for a movie based on a comic book or cartoon series. The dialogue largely contributes to what makes this a solid movie as opposed to a mere special effects free for all. And there are definitely throwbacks to the original scattered all over the place, with my fav being when Optimus says ""Roll out!"" Transformers is a great movie that every kid at heart will enjoy. It extends beyond the greatness of the original series in many ways and will easily create a new generation of Transformer fans. I can't wait until it hits theaters so I can go see it again."

The BEST and MOST ENJOYABLE movie I have paid to see since Batman Begins in summer 05. I have always been a Transformers fan, never a rabid die-hard one, but I watched the original series and had the toys etc. People are very critical of Michael Bay calling this film ""Bayformers"" and accusing him of ruining their childhoods etc. That is bogus, if anything this movie made me re-live those great moments of yesteryear. He throws in plenty of references to the G1 cartoons and pays homage to the original series which die hard fans are sure to pick up on and enjoy.<br/><br/>CGI: the best I have ever seen. The Transformers have plenty of screen time with the real live actors and it was amazing how photo realistic they all looked.<br/><br/>ACTION: non stop never ending. From 10 minutes in to the rolling credits. Explosions, robots, military, guns, BOOM BOOM BOOM FANTASTIC!<br/><br/>STORY: surprisingly good. Everyone on these boards knows what to expect. Autobots are good and must stop the Deceptacons from finding the All Spark. The pacing of the plot is done very well and there are never dull/boring moments.<br/><br/>COMEDY: actually really funny. Shia did a great job, and Bernie Mac and Anthony Anderson were great in their minor roles.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: This visual feast will live up to the hype and I can't recommend it enough.

"rage10898-1","10","2","7","28 June 2007"," THE action movie of the year, hands down.
","This was exactly the Transformers movie I wanted to see and every geek fanboy like myself was desperate to have made. There was a fantastic mix of action and humour, with the Autobots actually retaining some of the personality quirks that I remember from when I was a kid. (And from re-watching the G1 cartoons in a desperate bid for Transformers of any kind in anticipation of this film) I felt a lot of trepidation when I heard that Michael Bay would be directing this film, but I can't think of anyone else who could have got the action set pieces to come out like they did, yet he still did a great job on the slower paced sections of the film. The romance between Spike and Mikaela was always signposted, but not in a Pearl Harbour kind of way. There were also some moments of laughter in the cinema, but all intentional, not a typical Bay ridiculing laughter. (And that may sound harsh, but I'm actually a big fan of Bay's work) The change in vehicle forms actually works within the bounds of the script, with each of the Autobots being quite faithful to their G1 roots, but updated to 2007 and beyond.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have, and it's not even a complaint, so much as an observation, that the two greatest Decepticons (Megatron and Starscream, obviously...) didn't share a lot of screen time, nor did they actually get a lot to do. The CGI required to get these two character models on screen would be a huge task, but well worth it to see them go toe to toe. Hopefully the second film will see Starscream get some more screen time (and hopefully some behind the scenes as well).<br/><br/>All up, this is a fantastic movie, brilliantly paced and exactly what it's meant to be, an action movie with giant robots who transform into cars and helicopters and trucks, who look and behave like they're actually real. Trust me, after seeing this, you will never look at a Hummer or Peterbilt truck in the same way again!! You will walk out of the cinema counting the days until the next one is released."

","Just been to see it last night at the first public screening in New Zealand,and i was blown away. I think this movie totally lived up to the hype surrounding it and was in no way a let down. Great acting, a surprisingly funny script and flawless effects had the whole movie theater in awe for the whole of the film.I also think they really aimed the film at the average teenage boy who was a loyal fan of the cartoon. Although if you've never seen the original don't worry it explains everything.Easily Micheal Bays best, but one has to wonder how much influence Spielberg had on the film. I was also happy to see only two or so cringe moments in the whole film other than that the movie is excellent. Much better than any of this summers previous blockbusters, and leaves room for a sequel (maybe),(hopefuly)...<br/><br/>Overall I found it amazing and recommend it to all, but mainly the teenage boys (stoners classic)<br/><br/>p.s Megan fox is a mega fox.<br/><br/>10/10."

","If your male and under 25 you'll not find a better movie this year, possibly this decade. F-22 Raptors, A-10 Warthogs, AC-130 Spectres, a '74 Camaro, giant transforming robots just forget that other stuff it has  GIANT TRANSFORMING ROBOTS. I was a little worried when I heard Michael Bay was directing, I've enjoyed some of his movies in the past, and I've hated others (I'm talking to you Pearl Harbor). But as Transformers star Shia LaBeouf has rightly pointed out in interviews, ""the man is a visual genius"". Many directors try, but none succeed in pulling off the sort of shots Michael Bay gets. And even though that shot of a bomb falling in Pearl Harbor defied physics, it was pretty cool. There's at least ten of those type of shots in Transformers - shots that make you say ""s**t!"", shots that make you feel like your 15 years old again, and what more could you ask for? Nobody does action better (maybe John Woo). I now find myself wishing he'd have directed War of the Worlds.<br/><br/>COMPLAINT: I only have one really. It's a scene near the start where one of the robots start running around like he's Jar Jar Binks. He even seems to turn and wink at the camera and does some over-the-top sneaking around like he's in a Tom and Jerry cartoon. I understand why it's in the film  It helps make a smooth transition for an audience to see robots acting with character. I just feel they may have overshot the mark a little bit in establishing robots with human qualities. Thankfully he's not in it much and becomes less annoying in subsequent appearances. <br/><br/>The special effects are amazing and the sound effects are even better. The Transformers felt real. Peter Cullen. You rule. <br/><br/>I only wish there was more of a story underneath all the incredible effects to make it more interesting when I see it again. And I will see it again. Two and half hours never seemed so short. <br/><br/>(There is a story but it's not quite as epic as the old Transformers story)."

","What a movie.......the brilliant words to sum it up will take me forever to type, so i will instead just tell anyone reading this to get up and get down to your nearest cinema if you haven't seen it........Because if you too were disappointed with the big budget (long awaited) so called ""blockbuster"" movies this year like myself.... then don't worry this movie will not disappoint.....Michael Bay has again delivered with not just the mind blowing visuals but also a great cast who bring out fantastic emotional viewing. I think the most important thing of the movie is that the action and special effects don't take over the storyline...so watch and enjoy as Transformers will transform you into thinking maybe 2007's big budget movies can produce the goods!!.....not a 10, because i cant say it was perfect, but a high 9.....i give it heaps of points for just finally giving me something to cheer about from the action titles this year!!!"
"goliat555","8","2","8","2 July 2007"," Best Blockbuster of the Year
","The expectations to the movie were not that many, which probably was a good thing. The story is well somewhat 2 dimensional and shallow. Well, it is transformers so of course how much can you expect? However, the result of trying to squeeze as much contents into the movie as possible without that much background information, actually leaves you with too many loose ends and makes the story somewhat boring. The characters are also somewhat two dimensional. Some better than others but generally not developed well enough to give them credibility and sympathy. And those army guys are mighty easy to persuade even by a teenage high school student. Even the bad guys are not given enough time to really show their evil. Actually for my taste the villains are too scattered, and give the good guys to much room to manoeuvre. A better storyline would make the movie a classic. Unfortunately to some extent I think that Michael Bay glorifies war, probably not intensionally but never the less... Raging war, for my taste, is not a glorious thing, it is a last resort. However, war scenes are pinkly sparkling in Michael Bays universe.<br/><br/>Given all this, I still firmly endorse the film and award it the best blockbuster movie out this year. Why? Simply because when the movie finished I already couldn't wait for a sequel. The CGI probably plays a big role. It is the best CGI I have seen (ever?). The story is basically funny enough and hair raising enough (but just barely enough) to make you want more. The pirates franchise is nice and the cast is exceptional, Spider-man is able to thrill (a bit) and Mary Stuart well she is a fox. But, Although these movies are OK I wouldn't mind if there wasn't a Spiderman 4 and another pirates tale. However, given all the flaws Transformers still thrilled me and I want to see the next episode. So for me a success.<br/><br/>It was actually interesting to hear comments from the production team that it was a low budget blockbuster of only $150mill. Only 10 years ago a $150mill production was huge. I think this development is unfortunate. Its all about the money. Well it has actually always been about the money, but these days look at the story line. What do you actually learn from Pirates, Spider-man, and Transformers. Nothing, you get entertained for a couple of hours and that is it. Pretty boring in the long run actually. I am of the generation who likes to see a story folding out. Starswars, Lord of the Rings great story lines? In the case of the Lord of the rings YES, Starwars little yes. But with Starwars there is a message. A good message, which like it or not we all can learn from if we want to. The desire to tell a great story has been replaced by the big bucks, this is a shame.<br/><br/>Conclusion: a better storyline and more in-depth characters, and the 10 would be given. But still looking forward to the next movie."

I went to this movie expecting certain things, and It gave so much more. I wanted Transformers to take me out of the theater and make me feel like I was there, and it did that. I loved the whole ""Searching for the glasses"" scene. I have never laughed that hard in a theater before... except for Borat. Oh, and that leaked script that was ""fake"", isn't.

","Congratulations to Michael Bay for transporting us into a world of fantastic fantasy. TRANSFORMERS is the best summer movie since 1993's Jurassic Park. I really enjopyed it.<br/><br/>Here are my favourite scenes from the movie : - The opening attack scene from Blackout. WOW! - Sam running for his life from ""Satan's Camaro!"". - Sam's encounter with Barricade. Barricade's voice was scary! - The arrival of Prime, Ironhide, Ratchet and Jazz to earth. The music was so involving. - The Autobots at Sam's house. Look at how Prime hides himself to avoid Ron (Sam's father). - Bumblebee taken down and captured. It made me cry. - The army escorted Bumblebee to Mission City and met Prime & gang along the way. - The battle between Autobots and Decepticons in the city. Destruction everywhere! Cool! - Starscream chases, converts and smashes a few Raptor jets.<br/><br/>Having to watch most of my favorite characters such as Optimus Prime, Megatron, Bumblebee, Starscream, Jazz, Frenzy (not as a cassette), Ironhide and Ratchet come to life gave me the goosebumps.<br/><br/>Characters such as Blackout, Scorponok, Barricade, Devastator and Bonecrusher instead of Soundwave, Ravage, Laserbeak, etc. are not a disappointment at all. They really fit the purpose of bringing destruction... Yes, there should be more characters from the animation but come on, open your mind and take it as a new story...Besides, what can a cassette player do anyway?... Level a car?"

Every robot has their own style. The amazingly well done character I like is Megatron. Even he has a little scene, but all of the scene has shock me! You know that in a half of the movie. I need to go to the toilet, but I hold it for a while because the spectacular movie is shown in the slide and I can't interrupt it just because I need to go to the toilet.

What i do have to say about this movie is that it is not just a movie but an experience! This is the most kick ass action/sci-fi whatever kinda movie you wanna call it i've ever scene. You CANNOT be disappointed there is nothing to be disappointed about when seeing this movie. Yes, some of the dialogue is a little cheesy but you can't even think about it because the rest of the movie is just so freaking good and intense. You feel like you want to jump out of your seat and be in the scene it's so intense! It's also really funny. Even though like i said some of the dialogue is cheesy a lot of it is really funny. We were rolling around in our seats with some of the stuff that is said but it doesn't over do it if that's what you're thinking. This movie is sooo definitely worth it. My friend is a die hard fan he's been talking about this movie since it first got mentioned, and he was not disappointed. he was blown away (a true devoted fan he is). This is something you're gonna wanna see over and over in theaters. The intensity of this movie is overwhelming and i was so wired when i left the theater i can't even sleep cause all i can think about is all the battle scenes and how bad ass everything is. Oh my god!!!! I loved it. The autobots are insanely diesel looking. It's so real when they change I just i dunno i can't even explain it but you HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE!! and you have to see it theaters, it won't be the same if you don't see it on a big screen with the surround sound.<br/><br/>all right well guess that's it for this time so go see it and enjoy :)"

"Chalice_Of_Evil","8","2","8","27 June 2007"," A little bit more than meets the eye...
","This is a pretty decent action flick. Yes, it's mindless exhilaration, but what more do you honestly expect from a movie based on toys? Anyone looking for some in-depth, character-driven drama is probably going to be out of luck. That is not to say the humans in this film are totally worthless. Quite the opposite, actually. The two leads (Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky and Megan Fox as Mikaela) help ground the film (as much as a film about robots disguised as vehicles can be). I didn't find the two of them the least bit annoying (which is always the danger with these sorts of movies, where no one's really interested in the human characters, they're more interested in the big CGI creations). Thank goodness the film has these two actors. I thought they did an admirable job of keeping us interested in the storyline when the focus was shifted from the Transformers back to the humans.<br/><br/>The first half of the film has quite a delightful sense of humour to it. Sam is a decent guy. Not in that irritating goodie-two-shoes kind of way, just a regular everyday type who people can relate to. He's a believable character and doesn't camp it up. Mikaela is not the usual run-of-the-mill damsel-in-distress either. Like the robots in this film, there's more to Mikaela than meets the eye. Her character proves to be quite resourceful and not just a pretty face. If these two lead characters had been a failure and miscast, the movie would have been extremely dismal. Thankfully, that is not the case. A lot of the humour in the film comes from Sam and his beaten up Camaro (Bumblebee), that he purchases as his first car. To go into detail about all the humorous bits would ruin the fun, but suffice to say, there's no shortage of comical moments (fully *intentional*, of course) in this film. Even Sam's parents get a few laughs.<br/><br/>The other humans? Eh, you could take them or leave them. They're not cardboard cutouts or anything, but neither are they as well-developed as the two main characters. The Transformers themselves tend to vary in how effective they are on screen. The evil Decepticons don't get much to say/do. Though they *do* get to trash lots of stuff (which, I guess, is what Decepticons do best). Their leader, Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving - not that you can really tell it's him) isn't in the film as much as some might have hoped. The Autobots, however, get a good deal more screen time. They're far more developed and actually have personalities. The most memorable, of course, being their leader (Optimus Prime - voiced by Peter Cullen). Though there have been considerable alterations made to the appearances of the Transformers, they still look good on film. You certainly believe that vehicles can turn into giant robots, when watching this movie. The CGI is indeed impressive. It's just too bad that the editing in the action scenes is all over the place, making it extremely hard to tell what's going on.<br/><br/>At first glance, this film appears to be nothing more than a fun roller-coaster ride of action and robots blowing stuff up. There's actually a bit more to it than that, if you look closely, and this is the reason why I found the film to be successful."
"diveclass101","10","2","8","27 June 2007"," More than meets the Eye.
","After staying up till all hours to watch the movie last night,i've decided that although they may have left out some of the better characters, Michael Bay did an awesome job on bringing the Transformers to life. Although I cant figure out why they had a boom box but it wasn't Sound Wave!!! If they truly are going to turn this into a trilogy then leaving some of the characters out of the first movie makes sense. I'm also glad that although there was a love story, it wasn't the main story line and didn't take over the film. And at least they kept the morphing sound. I'd say it would be about the awesomest movie i've seen so far this year."
"DICK STEEL","10","3","16","28 June 2007"," A Nutshell Review: Transformers
","Growing up in the 80s, you can't help but take notice of the Transformers toys which can change from various vehicles to robots, or the cartoon series which had a pretty good run, with its fair share of spin offs having different character variations (Headmasters anyone?), settings in outer space, 3D animation (Optimus Prime as a mean looking gorilla), all great symbiotic marketing strategies between the toys and the cartoons. But one thing about the animated series though, both the Autobots and the Decepticons had lousy aim, which the Movie (1986) sought to correct, and ""traumatized"" (well, at least me when I was a kid watching this) kids with mortality for the beloved bots.<br/><br/>When Michael Bay was announced to have taken over an updated movie version of Transformers, I was a bit apprehensive, especially when character designs started to leek, and I admit, they were not really pleasing to the eye, and most, if not all, had vehicle model updates. So if anyone's a stickler that the characters must look like their animated originals or the toys, then it is likely you'll probably not enjoy the movie since you can't stand the sight of blasphemous character designs. There are some liberties that the cartoons take, which the movie tries hard to address, especially with the transformation bits, designing which part goes where instead of hiding unwanted bits (especially wheels) magically, though broad strokes for certain characters were maintained.<br/><br/>But I'm glad to say, this IS a Transformers movie, albeit a little updated in Michael Bay style for the big screen, a worthy summer popcorn blockbuster which delivers and satisfies. It bears Bay's signature style, and truly, it was one heck of an adrenaline ride from start to finish, pausing only to allow you to breathe a little (with some comedy which might not be everyone's cup of tea, like that call-center bit), before ripping everything up again. It's loud, it's noisy, with the usual camera work you'd come to expect from Bay's brand of total mayhem when he unleashes the action. There are times when the intricate character designs work against the movie in the action sequences though, with too many details on screen, and the robots seem to be collapsing in a heap of metal when they clash head on. But these scenes of robots clashing in an urban landscape were mighty realistic, as are the slick transformation sequences, and will leave the fan boy inside you whooping for joy.<br/><br/>Fans should be pleased with the effort that went into the live action movie. I was grinning from ear to ear with the little sly bits of references incorporated, like the classic transformation sound effects inherited from the cartoons, and if you keep your ears peeled, you might pick out lines here and there which were reminiscent of the cartoon series and the animated movie back in 1986. The scene in the autoshop with Bernie Mac was fun, especially with the jab at having an actual Volkswagon Beetle parked beside the new look Bumblebee (which I thought behaved like Herbie the Love Bug for the most parts of its introduction, despite the update in look). There were some inevitable Bay movie references like the flare bit for signalling which was a tad too obvious, and some 360 degree camera<br/><br/>The story's not as bad as I would expect it to be, but it's nothing to shout about as well, being but just a vehicle (pardon the pun) to move the story from action sequence to action sequence. It managed to cram quite a bit in its 143 minute run time, especially in its many human fronts on dealing with a perceived invasion - you have an updated ""Spike"" (Shia LaBeouf) and his new girl Mikaela (Megan Fox) being caught in the thick of things with their direct friendship with the Autobots, a group of soldiers led by Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) dealing with Decepticon attacks in the Middle East, and Secretary of Defense Keller (Jon Voight) trying to understand the situation by enlisting a group of hackers, which includes Maggie (Rachael Taylor). As you can tell, the humans have quite a bit going on, and Transformers allowed them to get in on the action as well, making it man versus machine too.<br/><br/>Plenty of things went right in my opinion. The casting of Peter Cullen to voice Optimus Prime was a major coup in lending this movie some credibility, as is the replacement voice of Megatron with Hugo Weaving's. The filmmakers too addressed the issue of Megatron pretty nicely - the handgun will just not work in a live action film, and would especially be stretching it a bit should the handgun turn into a gigantic robot. The selection of the Autobots was probably ideal in having Ironhide, Jazz, Ratchet supporting Bumblebee and Prime, leaving the rest for possible future movies. Prime's sympathy for humans again gets exploited by Megatron (though most times verbally, which got repetitive), and what was quite lacking, were the weapons. Prime's black cannon, if I'm right, only managed a very brief appearance, as does Megatron's, as the battles are more fist fights rather than laser gun battles (which they might miss!) And was that Prime's Autobot Leadership Matrix peeking out of his chest?<br/><br/>Watching the Autobots roll out on a highway brought out the goosebumps, and with the door being left open for follow up movies, should this do well in the box office, then we can expect more rolling, and the advent of more characters! And if rumours of the coming of Unicron are correct, then we all know what to expect of Megatron."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","9","29 May 2011"," Fun Action Flick
","Transformers (2007) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Bay's action blockbuster pretty much delivers everything you'd expect from this type of film. A teen (Shia LaBeouf) doesn't realize that he's actually got a connection to a couple alien races who are about to come to Earth and do battle. The good guy Autobots need the help of the teen so that they can locate a certain device that will allow them to defeat their rivals the Decepticons. I personally can't understand all the heat that Bay takes because the man isn't trying to deliver CITIZEN KANE type films but instead he wants to make popcorn movies that are loud and feature plenty of explosions and I really can't think of anyone who does it better. I've hated some of his films but on the whole I've enjoyed many and that includes this film, which is about as silly as you can get but who cares? The main reason to watch a film like this is for the action scenes and Bay certainly knows how to deliver. Right from the start we're introduced to some loud explosions and they never really let up through the 142-minute running time. The special effects are mighty impressive with the robots constantly changing form and I must say that they really looked great. The most impressive thing is that they're able to take this CGI creations and make them look real. I'm not really a fan of CGI because I feel it often times looks so fake that it takes you away from the real stuff on the screen but that never happens here as Bay knows how to mix the fake CGI with the real actors and action. One of the most impressive scenes is at the end when the robots, the Army, various government agents and of course our hero teen are all battling in the streets from the ground to the top of the sky-scrappers and this entire sequence just contains one thrill after another. The earlier action scenes are all impressive as well including one bit where LaBeouf and his love interest (Megan Fox) find themselves being chased through the streets not knowing what they've got themselves involved in. LaBeouf is always hit and miss with me but I think he served this character well as he had no problems playing the ""dork"" early on and he was also quite believable as the action hero. Fox certainly can't act but she's not here to win an Oscar. She's here to look hot and she does that just fine. The supporting cast has a lot of familiar faces including Bernie Mac, Jon Voight, John Turturro, Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson. I think the movie could have been better had Bay gotten rid of some of the supporting characters and I'd say the entire bit with the platoon could have been left on the editing room floor. I also think some of the rather obnoxious comedy could have been left out including the bits with the parents who are constantly embarrassing their son. Outside of those things, TRANSFORMERS is a pretty impressive action flick that knows it's an action flick and it doesn't try to be anything else. There's plenty of buildings that explode and get ripped apart and it's this type of action that fans want and Bay delivers more than enough for one film."

","I agree with the others who appreciated this film....STOP COMPLAINING!!!! Saw the film last night and will be watching it again this week. Its THAT GOOD. I grew up watching Transformers, at first I'd have to admit I was curious why Bumblebee wasn't a VW Beetle. After seeing the movie I can appreciate why they went with the Camaro. Aside from possible sponsorship commitments it did make Bumblebee look tougher and cooler than the original BB. So get over the nostalgia and appreciate the design of the characters in this film, they're Awesome. I loved how Optimus Prime seemed more like a Ninja when he decapitated Destructor. Kudos to Michael Bay and the scriptwriters, the right mix of some adult themes and comedy makes this appealing to audience young and old. I don't know if its just me but I can't help but see Agent Smith in Megatron. Maybe its a Hugo Weaving thing but that he seemed meaner than the cartoon version. I also did ask why he wasn't a pistol. Agree with one of the previous comments, how stupid would it be if he transforms into a gun then into a 40ft robot? Loco. Anyway, if you're one of the hardcore TF fans that can't help comparing this to the 80's version of the characters and feel disappointed then you're better off watching the first movie on DVD. You'll get all the 80's Transformers you crave for there. Transformers 2K7 would have to be one of the best, if not THE BEST, cartoon-to-live CGI adaptation I've ever seen. I just hope if there are plans for a sequel (which chances are there would be) that they do as good a job or better. I would love to see the Dinobots and the Constructicons battle it out!!!!"

","The thing about Michael Bay's Transformers is that it tries to advertise itself as some kind of epic battle with every 80s kid's favorite robots, but instead we get boring things with humans. We paid to see a giant rock 'em sock 'em robot film with huge battles, not some boring human stuff! To make manners worse, it has a staggering runtime of nearly 2 1/2 hours, and although runtime isn't a huge problem with most films, but in this film with 20% robots and 80% humans, it's too long.<br/><br/>What's the story? The fate of humanity is at stake when two races of robots, the good Autobots and the villainous Decepticons, bring their war to Earth. The robots have the ability to change into different mechanical objects as they seek the key to ultimate power. Only a human youth, Sam Witwicky, can save the world from total destruction.<br/><br/>I know, I know, tons of audiences appreciate this film, but I'm sorry, I thought it was REALLY bad. The storyline is very uninteresting, and like I said earlier, it tries to be interesting, but most of the time we get Michael Bay's awful choices in directing, ending up to be a more human-driven movie than a robot-driven one. We wanna know about how Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and more came to life. And that's the sad part, because they don't do a great job at explaining their backstories and they leave it to the sequels to do all that. Actually, scratch that! The SEQUELS don't do that EITHER! They're just rehashes of THIS film! Now, of course, not everything is bad about the film, there are still some exciting action scenes (when we actually get to them, first of all), cool effects, and great work on the sound department. But other than that, it's just a total mess.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Transformers is nothing but a giant clash of bad quality. It's got great action, great effects, and great intentions, but other than that, the movie doesn't live up to any massive expectations. I guess if you like the toy brand or the original cartoon, you MIGHT like this movie, but other than that, this is a film to skip. Michael Bay, you've done it again. And don't think that's a positive statement, either."

I had serious reservations when I first heard that Michael Bay was going to make a live action Transformers movie. The CGI looks great. Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox actually work. They have spark and charisma. The action is massive and impressive.<br/><br/>It's the story where the movie has a few problems. It's convolute and too complicated. But nobody watches this for the story. We watch it for the action."

","I finally watched this a couple weeks ago because I've heard nothing but rave reviews from my friends for the last four years. What a disappointment.<br/><br/>The number one disappointment of the film for me was the lack of likable characters. Shia LaBeouf was annoying, Megan Fox was trashy, and Optimus Prime was painfully flat. The rest of the characters varied from uncomfortable to obnoxious.<br/><br/>I felt that the dazzling CGI only served to distract from a boring plot that just wouldn't develop. I spent the last hour of the movie wondering if it would ever end. Cliché plot devices were haphazardly strewn throughout the movie and quickly forgotten. ""When have you had to sacrifice anything in your perfect little life?"" Megan Fox contends, but the issue is dropped in 10 seconds. We hardly have time to wonder about the mysterious ""sector seven"" before it's revealed and then abandoned just as quickly. The would-be epic struggle between Optimus Prime and Megatron (apparently brothers) culminates in some of the worst dialogue ever written. On and on.<br/><br/>I only gave this film 3 stars for a couple of pretty funny moments, but I have no intention of seeing the 2nd or 3rd films."

","This is, by far, one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Everything from the acting and plot down to the editing and color correction of the movie is horrid. You'd think that the one redeeming quality of the movie would be the action, but somehow they manage to mess even that up with shoddy camera techniques and editing such that the entire fight is obfuscated by objects breaking and the dull color palette of the film. I knew that I would dislike the movie from the start, but it fails even as a fun action movie due to the aforementioned poorly done fight scenes and boring subplots that only serve to lengthen the movie.

","I waited 20 years for this!! 20 years for someone to make my beloved cartoon series of the 1980's into a motion picture that would take me back to my youth. Unfortunately, the project fell into the hands of Michael Bay, who indelibly brands it with the mark of what he thinks an action movie should be.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Michael Bay's vision consists of stretching 60 minutes of plot well over 2 and a half hours, shoving two dozen characters you couldn't care less about into a movie which needed 5 or 6 max, and editing action scenes with such quick-fire erratic panache that no one in the theatre quite knows what the hell is going on.<br/><br/>It wouldn't matter too much if you started watching this movie half-an-hour in, as that's when the Transformers turn up. The first 30 minutes consists of something going on in the Iraq war, and an idiot trying to sell a pair of spectacles on e-bay. The same idiot is trying to get into pants of the sluttiest looking girl at school, so he buys a banger from a used car garage which turns out to be an Autobot, an alien machine able to transform from vehicles, etc. (Although it takes over a minute to transform with all the emotive facial intricacies, nice one Bay!)<br/><br/>Cue more autobots coming to earth to battle with the evil decepticons, a subplot involving the FBI, CIA and any other acronym associated with American Defence. John Turturro appears on-screen and makes everyone completely forget what a fantastic actor he was in the early 90's Coen Brothers films. Jon Voight aims for yet another Golden Raspberry nomination, and there's something about these glasses which point out the location of ""Oh, who cares? This storyline is a new kind of bunkum""<br/><br/>How did Michael Bay screw this up? How did the writers screw this up?! All they had to do was take the same story from the 1986 animated picture and adapt it into something similar, but they tried their hardest to make this as different to the animated cartoons as possible. The only thing that stays the same is the names (Optimus Prime, Megatron, etc.) and the sound effects when they transform.<br/><br/>The only positive about Transformers is the special effects, when you can make out what the hell is happening on Michael Bay's canvas. There's too many negatives, most of which are mentioned above, but the key, repeat KEY, K-E-Y, weakest link is that you just don't care about the characters or the cybertronic war unfolding on screen. Even when Jazz gets torn in two, the action moves quickly on to another set piece that the audience has no time to react to the movie's only sense of tragedy.<br/><br/>And what is the big deal about Megan Fox? She's not bad looking, but she would be a whole lot prettier if she didn't spend the whole movie describing the smell of her farts.<br/><br/>Personally, I just hope Michael Bay doesn't get his grubby little mitts on MASK, one of my other personal favourites from the 80's...<br/><br/>...or Thundercats. ...or Master Of The Universe. ...or My Little Pony..."

However from the movie's perspective, it brang the world of Transformers to a whole new level. Particularly why I loved it was because of the action. This obviously came from the destructive robots. They were simply amazing. My favourite was Bumble-Bee. Also, how they moved and transformed from cars to robots was well done. And not to mention the visuals/special effects. They were just out of this world.<br/><br/>The casting was superb. Shia and Megan were the perfect choice to play the roles of Sam and Mikaela. My only negative is their acting.

","Perhaps they should've gone with: 'Go-Bots: The Movie' because 'Transformers,' this ain't. I grew up on the original series/toys/movie/comics, even the United Kingdom ones. They changed so much in this; I don't know where to begin. Bumblebee was a VW Bug not a Camero, the boy's name was Spike not Sam, Megatron was a gun not a jet and transformers had their shape and that was it – they couldn't merely look at something to change to. I have never had so many ""WTF"" moments as I did in this horrible, treacherous insult to humans. Again Michael Bay shows why humans don't deserve to continue on. Sure, I would wanted to agree with all those brainless ""Oh, it's just a popcorn movie, just enjoy"" comments, and I've tried, believe me. But this movie was an insult. From the shameless product placements (every 2-3 minutes,) to the horrid dialogue, to the downright juvenile script, I wanted to throw up throughout. ""This is such a felony!"" and Shia's insistent repeating the same words multiple times; by God, if I heard ""No! No! No! 10x"" or ""Go! Go! 6x"" etc – you get the drift – one more time, I'd break his other hand. And the so called comedy elements (see the Johnny 5/JarJar/Spider transformer hiding while holding one hand up as if a 2-year-old; are you flipping serious? I wanted to think the incredibly bad humor was for minors until they threw in a masturbation conversation (another ""WTF"" moment.) I even despised George Bush, and when they attempted roast him, I felt sorry for him. Oh, and Megatron & Starscream are both MAJOR characters. Who's brilliant idea was to introduce them in the last ¼ of the film? Big budgeted movies do NOT have to be so DUMB. SEE: 'Bourne' Trilogy, 'Dark Knight' for evidence.<br/><br/>Side Note: This was one of my favorites. The military's wonderful idea to hide this All-Spark was to hide it in a big city with lots of expensive property, buildings and best yet, innocent bystanders. Yes, I know it's a cheap shot in bringing another big-no-brain action sequence to a city surrounding - No, Michael Bay, we're not all stupid. But, this is the perfect example of a WAY dumbed down script aimed at the 3-4 year olds. This is like giving a real life Syndrome (From Pixar's 'The Incredibles') a blank check to make a movie."

"AudCritic","7","1","3","13 May 2009"," Watchable but flawed.
","Let me start by saying Transformers wasn't a film I rushed out to see when it was theatrically released. I grew up with the 80's TV series but for one reason or another never felt compelled to see this in a hurry. In fact, I watched it for the very first time only yesterday and honestly didn't know what to expect.<br/><br/>The plot involves two groups of shape-shifting robot aliens from the planet Cybertron, the Autobots & the Decepticons. Both are looking for a mythical object called the All Spark Cube, both for differing reasons. One to protect the Earth, the other to destroy it. Although he does not know it, High School student Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf) is the key to finding it.<br/><br/>So what's good/bad? Well, the majority of the characters are well casted. The return of Peter Cullen as the voice of Optimus Prime is perhaps the most notable, giving a nostalgic link between the before mentioned TV series and this new re-incarnation. LaBeouf performs the role of high school outcast turned saviour of the world better than anyone that readily comes to mind. Megan Fox will never be a bad choice for blockbuster eye-candy. Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson & Jon Voight all deliver the goods in their respective supporting roles. The only exception to this is John Turturro, whose performance as Agent Simmons is ridiculously over-the-top. Whether this is how the character was supposed to be I don't know, but it seems an awful waste of an actor of Turturro's talent.<br/><br/>The comedic touches throughout the film were an unexpected surprise. Kevin Dunn & Julie White who played Sam's parents, along with Anthony Anderson & the late Bernie Mac all supplying moments of hilarity.<br/><br/>The Transformers & Decepticons are a dilemma. They look as authentic as they possibly can. The problem lies in the fight scenes between the two. How can a battle between two giant CGI'd robots be made interesting? I don't know the answer & seemingly neither does director Michael Bay. Unfortunately all they seem to do is smash into each other which, dare I say it, becomes rather dull.<br/><br/>The plot is also a concern. I didn't expect 'Memento'-esque twists & turns but I did expect sense. Why would they decide to move the all-important All Spark Cube from the desert to a major city where civilian casualties would obviously be high? There are other equally frustrating examples all the way through.<br/><br/>Overall, its a very watchable film without being truly memorable. Now the characters have been established I retain great hope that the forthcoming sequel is everything this movie should have been & more.<br/><br/>7/10"
"gigan-92","7","1","3","11 May 2009"," Michael Bay Finally Accomplished Something!!,
","After several mediocre films, Michael Bay finally accomplished something!! This film is his first generally well done film. The story is very nicely done, but the movie's obvious highlights are the incredible action sequences. Thanks to the miracle of CGI, the kids TV show is now looking better than ever. The transformation shots look remarkably realistic, my favorite being being Bonecrusher's on the freeway, followed by an amazing battle. Megatron, along with all the autobots and decepticons, look bad-ass. Starscream, as he was in the show, is my favorite out of all of them, and we all know he's going to be in the promising sequel. They all have personalities and one can actually connect to the giant extraterrestrial robots, as I'm guessing most audiences did.<br/><br/>The cast I find a good one, with Peter Cullen voicing Optimus Prime! Shia LeBouff is excellent in his role, and Megan Fox of course is sexier than ever. I believe the comedy fits in nicely with the action, unlike in ""Pearl Harbor"". Still, there was that scene where where the soldiers lost their little Mexican buddy at the battle with the scorpion thing and later on Josh Duhamel remarks ""This thing is wicked!!"". ""Wicked"" ??? After it killed your fellow soldier right? But since its this type of film it can be let go. Plus, especially at the thrilling climax, it does have its serious moments. The score by Steve Jablonsky is fresh and I love it by the way. All in all, with ""Transformers"", while not entirely free of flaws, Michael Bay finally serves up a film that is exciting and well-paced."
"tburke85","9","1","3","9 May 2009"," Transformers An Entertaining Action Adventure With Some Flaws
","When I first heard they were coming out with a live action Transformers movie I knew I had to go see it and I'm glad I did. It was well worth the price of admission brought to the screen by director Michael Bay who does a great job bringing this film to life. It does have some flaws but this movie was definitely better than expected and the good more than outweighed the bad. I preferred this first film over it's sequel Revenge of the Fallen which was disappointing compared to this one but hey thats me. The movie Transformers is about a young teen named Sam Witwicky (played perfectly by Shia LaBeuof) who finds himself caught in the middle of an epic war between two rival clans of alien robots, the good Autobots and the evil Decepticons after buying his first car an old beat-up Camaro (which turns out to the heroic Autobot Bumblebee). For those of you who haven't seen it yet I won't give anymore of the plot away then that. This film has dazzling special effects including the transformers themselves and just the right amount of intense action sequences that are well executed. There's also plenty of humor that balanced well between the drama, suspense, and action. Shia Labeouf is solid as the lead bringing a lot of comic relief to his role as Sam and he's believable as the character. LaBeouf does sort of sit it out in the beginning (action wise) but once the chase between the Autobots and Decepticons is on he's involved in the action a lot more. Megan Fox is all right as Sam's love interest Mikaela but she isn't given much to do except to be eye candy for the camera. Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duahmel are okay but their roles in the film seemed to get smaller as the film went on because most of the focus is on Sam but they both did a good job in their limited screen time. The movie could've done without some of the side characters played by Anthony Anderson and Rachel Taylor who are decent in the movie but that would've given more screen time to LaBeouf or any of the other characters. Jon Voight does his best as the Secretary of Defense Keller and John Turturro is very impressive as Simmons a wacky agent from Sector 7 a mysterious branch of the government with many secrets that are revealed. The rest of the supporting cast are good including the real military soldiers who are given extended appearances throughout the film. The special effects are state of the art some of the best I've seen in a long time including the transformers of course. The Autobots including Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ironhide, Ratchet, and Jazz all looked amazing especially when they transform because you felt as if they were really there. They may not show up for almost an hour into the movie except for Bumblebee but they're given at least some character development after they're introduced so you do come to care about them especially when the action kicked into high gear something the sequel lacked. The evil Decepticons looked cool but most of them weren't given enough screen time and have little to no dialogue. Megatron and Starscream aren't introduced until late into the movie before the climax in the city but they're effective as the villains. The only Decepticons to get any sort of development were Blackout, Barricade, and Frenzy but even they're MIA for large parts of the film only showing up for several extended appearances. The two characters I was a bit disappointed in were Bonercusher and Scorponok. Bonecrusher has a couple of scenes in the third act including a brief fierce fight with Optimus near the climax but he's rather easily defeated. Scorponok shows up for a few times in the beginning before disappearing for the rest of the film. The character has a 5 second cameo in the sequel near the end before being killed off that seemed pointless which made me wonder why they just didn't kill him off in this one. There's also a Decepticon tank thats credited as Devastator but it's real name is Brawl. The character didn't seem necessary like some of them except for one maybe two action/fight sequences. Devastator was later used for the sequel but unfortunately the character ended up being a disappointing villain like The Fallen. Barricade also disappears later on with no explanation and fans of the character don't expect him to make an appearance in the sequel either because he's still MIA but I guess like Scorponok, Brawl, and Bonecrusher they served their purpose despite only have a few minutes of screen time. The action packed finale between the robots and the military was intense but the shaky camera movements and the close ups made it hard to see what was actually happening at times but they worked for the film. Despite it's flaws Transformers is still an entertaining action adventure. Overall I very much enjoyed this movie and I thought it was just as good as The Bourne Ulimatum that came out that same year. It was better than Pirates 3 and Spider-man 3 which were disappointments compared to those two movies or most recently The Dark Knight which is still one my favorite films and probably won't be topped bu who knows. Even with a lengthy running time of 143 minutes Transformers is sure to please any die hard fan of the genre with plenty of action, suspense, humor, and good performances by the cast."

I still can't believe the quality it reached. The interaction between robots and humans was great also, it was like they were actually talking. But the merits of this movie end there. It has one of the most mediocre plots added with really average performances.<br/><br/>When some people and I were talking, I asked them what was about this movie that they loved so much, and their answers always were: ""The robots looked incredible"".

"johnnyboyz","4","1","3","1 April 2009"," Talking of Transformers, try transforming all that money into something productive or half decent for a change.
","It seems sadly ironic that the film that kicked this blockbuster 'movement' off in the 1970s was based on a book, that film being Jaws. Since then we've had further blockbusters based on books; blockbusters based on comic books; blockbusters based on television programmes right up to the debacle that is the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy which was based on a theme park ride. Now, it seems, and with the imminent release of a 'G.I. Joe' film and a Transformers sequel, we have a new order: films based on action figures – is that the sound of a barrel base being scraped, I hear? It is additionally sad when a viewer must loose count of the product placement a film contains and must feel distinctly bored by impressive enough computer generated graphics, quite literally flying all over the place in slow motion and slamming each other into buildings and highways, but with which very little else is.<br/><br/>In short, Transformers is a pretty terrible film; a film that sets up a scenario, provides us a MacGuffin, introduces relatively limp characters and feeds us bits and pieces of where it's going to go in relation to its story before just descending into near self-parody. I was ready for the film to end after about an hour and ten, but then I wouldn't have got to see Jon Voight very briefly break into a little sprint then later fire an assault shotgun at the latest in computer graphic software. I also wouldn't have got to see the final half an hour of out and out action in which there is a cut every other nano-second and characters, whom up to that point were only capable of realistic enough actions, get to slide off motorcycles under giant robots thus destroying them. I wouldn't have got to see another giant robot leaping over a kneeling girl in slow motion as we get acquainted with what her tonsils look like - then, when all the action has come to an end, there is a really, really God-awful payoff.<br/><br/>The film takes time to set up young adult Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf), who is living with his parents, goes to high school and desperately wants a car because he thinks it will attract the attention of girls. Speaking of girls, there is a love interest in Mikaela Banes (Fox). Trouble is, we don't like Sam initially. His great-grandfather was an English explorer who, along with his crew in the Antartic, has that oddly familiar cockney English accent most American movies possess English characters with. How does Sam honour him? By selling the equipment and spectacles worn by is great-grandfather when he was struck down amidst the ice over a hundred years ago. Wouldn't you know it, he was finished off by Megatron – the leader of the 'evil' Transformers whom crash landed on Earth centuries ago.<br/><br/>LaBeouf plays him with a sense of urgency, a neurotic style which, against all odds, actually works when the attempted acquisition of the spectacles has undergone on the Transformers' behalf. They need it because it tells them where something called the All Spark is located, and that is what the two robotic races want most. But if LaBeouf is passable, then the actress known as Megan Fox is the opposite. She is so magisterially awful that she defies words. The first time she even sees a Tranformer in the form of Bumblebee (aka LaBeouf's car that he purchases), she doesn't even react to it and carries the same, gormless look on her face throughout – she pouts her way through the film, delivering bad dialogue badly and just generally annoys you with her blank expressions.<br/><br/>When we first see her, she leans over a car engine, slightly angelic via the music and gleam that radiates off her body she; is the very definition of objectification. The film is really nothing more than a teenage fantasy to do with getting caught in the middle of these two warring superpowers, and in this retrospect, it's nothing much more than Alien vs. Predator but with a love interest – both film's catalysts even took place many decades ago in the snow and ice. How can a film that cost so much and that has so much going on, visually, be so damn uninteresting? It doesn't want to make a commentary on how the new order to do with fear of North Korea and China is in place whenever an 'attack' on U.S. forces occurs; it's not bothered about robots as pieces of modernity and how they can be used well but also misused: it's all about the attractive, faceless female and the big explosions and the awe of it all. This was $150,000,000 spent on absolutely nothing."

","When I came into the theaters to see ""Transformers"" two years ago, I didn't expect much. In fact I was turned off from the trailers at the physical appearance of the robots and I was thinking, oh great another shoddy remake based on my childhood memories, lowered down by Hollywood and its cheesy remakes. However after the movie was over, I had to eat my words. <br/><br/>In the end I found the film to swift pass all that I expected. A loyal hats off to director Michael Bay for bringing this action thriller to life. In it's two hour and twenty duration, it was never once dull and the action is nonstop, just like the cartoon series from the 1980's. The backgrounds were beautifully nuanced and the human actors had a chance to shine and were not usurped by the giant robots. What adds to the atmosphere is that this action film has a very unique origin to it, the way a debut should always commence. The introduction wasn't rushed like in many action flicks as it provided enough depth to make is easier to follow and it flows through nicely. Even those who never heard or even watched transformers will be able to understand the story of their origins and how the war between the good Transformers vs. the evil Decepticons came about.<br/><br/>The robots come off physically different and their characteristics light up the screen as each of them were highlighted splendidly. The CGI is at its very best here. <br/><br/>Before anyone starts to quip about ""Transformers"", try to take time to realize that there are so many versions of Transformers featured on television for many years, with each one holding a different perspective to the franchise. I suggest you watch each of the series' pilot episode and you can clearly understand that they are all different from each other. This movie is another new series only this time it's transferred from the set to the screen.<br/><br/>Don't be judgmental and just randomly put it down by saying it's stupid and not real. It's a sci-fi action thriller, it's not meant to be real. I would like to add this to my collection of movies as it's finally graced the screen to hopefully enlighten a new generation of fans today as to what it accomplished in the 1980's."

","I became a Transformers fan after watching Armada and fell in love with it. I knew it would be loosely based on Generation 1 and it would be a success. <br/><br/>It has a cast that I recognized, top-notch action scenes and the best of all, Peter Cullen as Prime!!! I watched the entire Gen 1 (from start to finish) on DVD (and I loved it) by the time I'm typing this comment. Even though Frank Welker doesn't do Megatron in the movie, I didn't care. Hugo Weaving is pretty good as the antagonist. <br/><br/>I love the humor in it especially when Ironhide impersonates Dirty Harry. Also love the song selection. ""What I've Done"" by Linkin Park is pretty good for a theme song even though it's released before the movie.<br/><br/>If you love Transformers, go see it. Can't wait to see the sequel."

","This is an excellent movie and Michael Bay does a terrific job directing it. The story is pretty unique and it's not your typical story but it's basically about these groups of robots called the Autobots and the Decepticons who are after this cube called the Allspark which is on earth and whoever's hands it lands into will grant them unlimited power. The visual effects are just jaw-dropping and I don't know how they do it but they did an outstanding job. I really liked the parts at the end of the movie where the Autobots and the Decepticons battle it out for the Allspark but I would have liked to see more battles take place between them which would have made this movie even more spectacular. The acting is pretty good and I think Shia did the best job out of all of them and I knew he could pull it off in this movie. Overall it was pretty good, go check it out."

","my mates and i were so pumped to see this movie. one of my mates actually kept looking on a website that had a timer countdown for the release.<br/><br/>the three of us showed up 20 minutes before the cinema even opened and we were the first three to get tickets for the first screening in that cinema. the lights dimmed and we were going crazy it was awesome! we absolutely fell in love with this movie. one mate saw it about 6 or 7 times in the cinemas.<br/><br/>the acting really was great. Shia LaBeouf is a very talented actor and one i have occasionally seen rising up through his acting career. he is very funny in a quirky way and just a great actor. i cannot picture anybody else as Sam 'Spike' Witwicky.<br/><br/>Megan Fox was just hot and is a fairly decent actor herself. seeing Jon Voight was just cool and he is a good actor. my mate being a fan of Las Vegas couldn't wait to see Josh Duhamel in this movie and he is also a very talented actor.<br/><br/>there are quite a lot of funny parts in this movie. like some of the stuff that Frenzy gets up to. some of the things the Autobots say and do and of course Shia.<br/><br/>pointing out comedians Bernie Mac and Anthony Anderson in this movie i reckon just added to how great this movie was. Rachael Taylor was pretty good but i think she exaggerated her Australian accent a little, we don't all sound that bad. hehe.<br/><br/>the convincing CGI used for the Transformers just blew us away. so convincing, so realistic. even so far as having light and other objects reflecting off their metallic surfaces.<br/><br/>the music score is a masterpiece. it is very good. i wasn't sure orchestral music would work, but it did very amazing.<br/><br/>this movie is just so jam packed with action its awesome. i mean come on, who doesn't want to see giant robots shooting and beating each other and the environment up? the movie doesn't focus massively on character development, which most people see as a flaw, but i found enough to be there it was great."

","Rarely does a film come along that you can watch again and again and never get bored. My friends didn't want to go see Transformers as they labelled it a 'Boys film'. I had never watched the original series as i wasn't born until 1992. Why this film didn't win the 3 Oscars ill never no. The acting was superb especially Shia Labeouf as he had to carry the role of the lead human. The CGI was fantastic it looked like the robots were actually there, and the last battle scene looked like it actually destroyed the city. It was funny in parts, my two favourite characters by far are Sam Witcwickys parents by far, the way they react to things is simply hilarious. The one liners were hilarious mostly delivered by Shia La Beouf 'I bought a car, turned out to be an alien robot...who knew?<br/><br/>Well all i have to say is bring on Transformers 2 and 3 one of the best films on 2007 by far and in my top ten<br/><br/>10/10"

","I must admit when I heard about the film I thought ""oh no, another boy's film"" but it was the best cinema experience of that year and possibly ever. I loved every action sequence and all the characters and considering I knew nothing about transformers I now watch all the old episodes and know so much of the story you'd think I watched it my whole life. It's terrific that the film don't alienate previous non-fans or people who'd never seen it.<br/><br/>Loved the fight with megatron and megatron's new skellington-like form it makes him so frightening ^^ I only find it slightly disappointing that they didn't include the part where both megatron and optimus say ""hello brother"" in the novel version of the film because it's like they acknowledge each other as equals and the same but thats a small price to pay. FANTASTIC CAN'T WAIT FOR NUMBER 2"
"jawk00","7","1","3","19 May 2008"," Simple minded but exciting entertainment
","Transformers is thin on plot and coherence, but it's still a blast.<br/><br/>The action sequences are absolutely breathtaking at times, even though the camera is so close you often can't tell what's happening. It doesn't matter though because the digital effects are so incredible and the action is so intensely done with lots of speed, explosions and great sound effects. Seeing this in the theater with full sound can give you shivers down your spine.<br/><br/>The first part of the movie features the more logical part of the plot, even if it's just a typical and dry high school kid storyline. That's really what keeps it in the realm of logic. The dialogue isn't as bad here and everything makes more sense. It's when the robots show up that everything falls apart.<br/><br/>The auto bots are more or less just there for the kids, which isn't a bad thing on its own. Unfortunately, they have some terrible dialogue and their characters are more clumsy and dimwitted than heroic. It's obvious that they're more just there to be cute and entertaining than actually be real characters. They don't really offer anything compelling, instead they're basically just stand ins there to blow up stuff and provide some slapstick relief. The decepticons aren't much better.<br/><br/>The plot is equally kiddish. It revolves around this ancient artifact that all the robots are after. Fair enough, but it gets so silly you'll be shaking your head at it.<br/><br/>It's still fun though. In all of its simplicity and childishness, you can be entertained. The characters are also likable enough (albeit pretty flat) so that you can care about them, especially Shia Lebouf. He does a great job providing an easily likable main character, and he does a good job with all the comedic bits.<br/><br/>It's a fun movie despite how ridiculous and nonsensical it can get. The action will blow you away and you'll like the transformers, even if they are just marketing tools for the kids. Don't expect anything crafty or complex, just sit back and enjoy the fun."

","because it was so entertaining. I finally saw Transformers and it was much better than I thought it would be. The special effects were awesome. The robots looked real, as though taking up space. I also loved how they incorporated lots of humor. That's what made the movie for me. From the songs the car picks to play with Sam and Mikaela, to the sector 7 agent, and Anthony Anderson. To many funny scenes to name. Humor plus action makes for great film, especially if it has a long running time. This movie used the same formula that made Spiderman so great.<br/><br/>I liked the lead actors in this. In a action movie, you usually don't really care for them, but Shia and Megan work great in this. It's been a while since I've seen a 2 plus hour movie that didn't seem like it was way too long. One criticism I had was at times, it was just too loud, a signature of Michael Bay films. Tone down the hard rock music.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Great action flick. Check it out."
"CthulhuTails-1","7","1","3","14 May 2008"," Best birthday present ever!
","This movie was the ultimate in 07. I saw it opening day and was completely blown away. The robots worked great on screen. The humans though in it a little to much were all great. Except for the sector 7 guys they were real dicks. Perhaps the best part of all was that they got Peter Cullen to voice Optimus Prime for the movie. He is by far the best and one true voice of Prime. I even saw it a second time on my birthday. But sadly even perfection has it's share of problems. As stated earlier the humans were in it far to much. Its called Transformers not military guys. Second the Decipticons were in it for a combined twelve minutes. Sure thats probably an exaggeration. Prime had a mouth, Prime has a face plate not a mouth. The biggest problem was that Jazz died. Sure kill the black guy. All in all this is the best movie to come out in 07. I got it for Christmas and have since watched it six times."
"tsmithjr","9","1","3","13 May 2008"," Outstanding!!!!
","I was not prepared for what I saw. I really had very low expectations for the Transformers. I thought it was a ""kids"" movie, so I waited until it was on DirecTv (in this case, Cinemax). That said, the Transformers was outstanding!!! I want to give it a ""10"" but I can't justify that. That said, it's the best SCI-FI/action with CGI that I can think of. And yes, in a different sort of way, it beats ""The Matrix"". HOWEVER, that said, I'd easily rate ""The Matrix"" higher. But, depending on what you're looking for, the Transformers rules! The CGI for the Transformers is ridiculously perfect. It's better than anything I've seen. It's so realistic. Yes, I've seen many of the ""great"" CGI efforts, but in total, this is right up there with the best. And the acting, which almost takes second stage, is absolutely flawless. Shia LaBeouf is terrific, Rachael Taylor is a great new find and does a perfect job, Megan Fox is also perfect (as is the rest of the cast). I hope this isn't a spoiler (I'd mark my message as such, if I thought it was) but the music is perfectly timed - in a ""Michael Bay"" sort of way. I'm really falling in ""like"" with Michael Bay's stuff. All I can say is that you'll enjoy and are in for a pleasant surprise with the Transformers. It's a great family (older) and adult film."
"bobsgrock","5","1","3","9 April 2008"," Way too long
","After finishing watching Transformers, I was at the same point I was about two hours into the movie: I stopped caring. You aren't supposed to expect much considering the whole trailer was basically a bunch of super robots banging the metal out of each other and the fact that Michael Bay directs adds nothing to it either. Still, I felt that it could be a decent film, and it wasn't. Shia Lebeouf is superb and I hope he has a great career, but even he can't hold this together. Meagan Fox is in this only because she is smoking hot, and pretty much every other character is underdeveloped or completely obsolete. Let's face it: this is all about the robots and watching Optimus Prime take on Megatron. I am not an action movie fan, but even I can appreciate the special effects here; they are truly astounding. Still, there is no story and did I mention this is almost two and a half hours? That is way too long for any action movie, much less one with so little a story. Those who are fans of the toys love it, but those who expect more out of their cinematic experiences should move on to bigger and better things."
"geertvdheide","7","1","3","19 October 2007"," Enjoyable, but nothing else.
","Transformers (2007) is purely an action film. All aspects of the movie are inferior to the on-screen spectacle of massive fighting robots, car chases and explosions. Luckily, most people were expecting just that, as was I.<br/><br/>The intensity of the film is indeed one of its strong points. Another is the incredible CGI. The computer generated Transformers blend in seamlessly with the surrounding cityscapes and create a visually appealing action movie. The camera-work and editing is a bit too fast at times, making some fight scenes hard to follow, but creating a certain dynamic as well. Also the plot is as thin as a single sheet of paper.<br/><br/>But that is not what bothered me about Transformers. The problem is that this movie was catered too much to a single target audience: young males in the ages 12 to 18. The teenage lead characters enforce this by stumbling around in romantic scenes and blurting out jokes that range from horribly unfunny to half decent at best. The acting is not one of the films strong points either. This combined makes the ""human"" scenes far inferior to the action / robot scenes. Luckily there's more than enough action to be seen, which is the reason why I did enjoy watching this film.<br/><br/>I somewhat recommend this film to anyone who can take this movie for what it is: A shallow sci-fi action flick that makes up for its meager acting, writing and humor by giving us a real visual spectacle. Nothing more, nothing less."

"ZekeRage911","7","1","3","12 October 2007"," Worth seeing
","Ah, Transformers, a true trip to nostalgia for all us children of the 80's. So, I expected the movie to be largely a movie to appeal to the nostalgia of the children of the 80's. I was surprised when the movie actually came out decent!<br/><br/>The plot is explained in an opening monologue by the ever-impressive Optimus Prime, which I felt was actually unnecessary, because it detracted from the slow immersion into the fantastic that occurred later. Still, once that bit of fluff was forgotten, we are treated to a surprisingly grounded, well-acted and intelligent story about alien automotons that have been engaged in a civil war for thousands of years over what amounts to a godlike power contained in a cube called ""The All-spark"" that has the ability to give life to otherwise inert machines. (And, apparently, the ability to transform, which I found just a bit silly.)<br/><br/>The visual effects were spectacular. Though the complexity of the transformations were a little overdone, I felt, the overall effect of watching these machines move and fight is like watching a ballet of animation. The CGI is seamless, especially in the climactic scene where Sam Witwicky takes on Megatron with the Allspark. I am a very skeptical movie viewer, but I bought that scene wholesale.<br/><br/>The only real problem I had with this movie was the dialogue. The transformers often came off as just a little too corny to maintain the illusion. For one thing, Jazz irritated me. Just because he's the token black Transformer (Which is kinda funny since the original robot was white) doesn't mean he has to be the token black transformer NOW. He especially doesn't need to be calling Megatron a punk and talking about ""kickin it."" And whoever decided the token black transformer had to die at the end of the movie, and all Optimus has to say is that he was a good soldier and comrade, should be beaten with a switch. It was just a touch on the racist side for me.<br/><br/>Despite Shia LeBouf's irritating, almost Woody Allen like performance, the movie carried off fairly well. I didn't like Optimus's monologue, though. I found it cliché' and unnecessary. In fact, a lot of the dialogue, as I mentioned, was pretty unnecessary. ""I am Megatron!"" for instance, upon the thawing out of the big baddie, wasn't just unnecessary, it was downright stupid. Just one decent dialogue editor would have scored this movie another star in my mind. Obviously, the movie's not perfect, but it is fun. It's an adult take on a kid's cartoon that actually turned out better than I expected. Despite the flaws, it's worth going to see."

","To most kids growing up in the 80s, the word ""Transformers"" had one very special meaning: fabulous vehicles able to transform into giant robots. And when I say ""most kids"", I don't mean only American kids, as this concept, created by the Japanese toy company Takara, became truly a worldwide phenomenon when in 1984 the American company Hasbro launched the ""Transformers"" toy line with a captivating back-story. What started as a toy line became a full fledged epic tale detailing the adventures of the Autobots, a group of heroic Transformers who protected Earth from an evil faction of their own people who called themselves Decepticons. More than 10 years later, ""Transformers"" remains a popular concept, and proof of that is the fact that filmmaker Michael Bay has directed a live action film about it. Sadly, the result is far from being more than meets the eye.<br/><br/>In ""Transformers"", Shia LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky, a young high school student whose biggest wish is to own a car in order to impress his beautiful classmate Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox). Unfortunately for him, all he can afford is an old rusted Camaro with a tendency to fail at the most inappropriate occasions. One night, he watches his car move by itself, and he follows it to a junkyard, where it transforms into Autobot Bumblebee (Mark Ryan). This won't be the last of his surprises, as after this discovery, he'll be chased by another autonomous vehicle, a police car. Bumblebee manages to save Sam and takes him to his fellow Autobots. Their leader, Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), explains Sam that this is only the beginning of a new chapter in their constant war with the Decepticons, but that Sam has the key to something that could end it once and for all.<br/><br/>Developed by writers John Rogers, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, the screenplay for ""Transformers"" essentially moves between two main stories: the constant war between the Autobots and the Decepticons, and Sam's coming of age story. In fact, this last theme becomes the most important of the two, as the film focuses a lot on Sam's friendship with his sentient car, Bumblebee, as well as his wish of being Mikaela's boyfriend. Several more subplots are added, some very interesting and some pretty pointless, but unfortunately, the writers do a poor job in tying everything together and the result is a convoluted story that feels awkward in its poor balance of action and comedy. The writer's attempt to develop their character is certainly commendable, as they truly manage to humanize them in a fairly believable way. Sadly, it's not good enough to save the script.<br/><br/>As usual with Michael Bay films, his style ""Transformers"" is more eye candy than real storytelling, as he puts a lot more emphasis on fast moving action scenes filled with special effects than in the story the writers delivered for him. Of course, I know it's obvious that the special effects of the giant robots is the movie's main selling point, and they are the reason the movie was made in the first time; however, Bay's trademark quick-cut style of editing together with his shaky camera-work make very hard to fully appreciate the work of the special effects team, as Bay seems to believe that to make a dynamic action film he needs to keep the camera constantly moving without a real reason. If there's something to praise in Bay's directing, that would be his decision of making the Transformers look the most realistic possible, as it adds a lot to the epic nature of the storyline.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is pretty much average, with Shia LaBeouf making a very effective performance as Sam, although he is in no way remarkable or outstanding. Mikaela Fox is sadly of the ones who make an awful job, as in this movie she proves that she was only hired because of her looks, not because of any real talent. On the other hand Josh Duhamel is truly one of the highlights of the movie, and one of the few who really adds a lot of power to the film. Hopefully Duhamel will become a rising action star in the future. In a nice detail, Peter Cullen reprises his role as the voice of Optimus Prime, and once again gives his character that the powerful presence it had in the cartoon. Unfortunately, that can't be said of Hugo Weaving, whose great job as Megatron's voice gets lost by an overuse of sound effects in his voice-work.<br/><br/>Personally, the biggest problem I have with ""Transformers"" is not that it's bad (it is not), it is that it could had been a lot better given the elements Bay had to work with. I'm not saying the script is a masterpiece, as it seriously lacks focus and fails at mixing comedy and action, but the approach director Michael Bay used in the film only made it feel even more mediocre than what it is. While the movie has a wonderful visual look (no doubt thanks to Bay's experience making commercials), his frantic editing and sloppy narrative diminish the quality of Mitchell Amundsen's cinematography and the special effects team's masterful work. I won't deny that there are instances where his style works perfectly, and that the movie gets really entertaining in more than one occasion, but I couldn't help but feeling that I was watching a long commercial instead of the epic battle of robots that the advertising promised.<br/><br/>""Transformers"" is one of those movies that provide instant entertainment and give the impression of being pretty cool, but end up feeling shallow when one begins to seriously think about them. That's probably the best advice to enjoy ""Transformers"": not to think too seriously about it, as ultimately it is as shallow as a TV commercial. It's a fun movie with great special effects and some good performances, but it's not the great action movie that it could had been. 6/10"
"thebengalimafia-1","9","1","3","8 September 2007"," The Best from Summer 2007!!!
","Summer of 2006 I heard that Transformers was coming to the big screen, I got excited. A month later, I heard that the film was being produced by Steven Spielberg and directed by Michael Bay, I went ballistic! And rightly so, because Transformers delivers all the way! Now there was an initial euphoria because of the fact that two of my favorite film directors were coming together. Steven Spielberg, enough said. And then I heard the film's director is Michael Bay. I don't care what people say about him, Michael Bay delivers every time, not to mention being the man who has now changed the face of the action film with Transformers.<br/><br/>Two groups of warring alien robots crash land on earth in search of the All Spark, a cube that gives life to machines. The premise alone makes it seem that this film would be a larger than life experience. Transformers starts off in classic Michael Bay fashion; you're thrown, head first into an intense action scene on an American air force base in the Middle East. From there on, it's pretty much going back and forth from the story with the humans and the Autobots and the Decepticons searching for the cube. All of the characters in the film seem to be exaggerated versions of anyone you might come across any day of the week; the school nerd, the school's hottest girl and her jock boyfriend, government agents, etc.<br/><br/>I went into the movie expecting to be blown away by the robots, but I was pleasantly surprised by Shia Labeof's performance. His comedic timing is impeccable and the more serious scenes, like when he gives the girl a ride home, are done with some incredible subtlety. But nonetheless, the real treat is the giant robot experience. The autobots and decepticons duke it out in mid air, hand to hand, with shootouts, the list goes on. You name it, it's there. And I guess it really brings out the kid in you to see and try and understand the characters of the different Autobots. Optimus Prime as the noble leader, Bumble Bee as the loyal protector. From just this I can say that this film is more of a family film than people expected.<br/><br/>The only real downside to the film isn't really a downside at all, but it would've made the film that much better. The film's length is fine but some of the fight scenes require the film to cut back to the humans rather than showing the uncut fighting between the giant robots. The truth is, all we want to see are the robots. Even when the robots aren't fighting or transforming, you're sitting there in total shock and awe of seeing a Camaro turn into a robot.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, Transfomers was one of the few films that truly deliver. Summer of 2007 didn't turn out as over the top as everyone expected, but this film did. Go see this one, now!"

This is not the best movie of all time, maybe it is Michael Bay's best movie of all time. Now we are talking. Bay's credibility has climbed a lot over the last two movies, and there is one reason!!. Bay is not with Bruckheimer Anymore. We Thank God. We Thank DreamWorks!!. (I Don't Know what happened between the two (Bruckheimer and Bay that is)But it has made some of us very happy).<br/><br/>Back to the movie, Every boys dream. This movie has that, and it is great fun to travel back to boyhood. Yes, and it is fun to watch all that action too, but what about the story. Is that not a little of the assembly line, a clone of something that we have seen before. Of course it is. Remember what movie this is. It is Transformers. I have never played with those toys, maybe once but I think I broke it. Seen a cartoon once, but I have no memory of that. Anyway it is a medium experience, no more than that, so my verdict is 6.0 stars. D."
"lau_ghiran","7","1","3","29 August 2007"," Weak story
","I have a few comments about the movie Transformers. The movie it was not how i was expecting. Special effects were extraordinary but the story it was not very strong. in a most parts of movie everything is there were is need. one of this parts is when the girls and the boy goes trough that tunnel and the girl said that the car is ugly. In the same time another car like that (more beautiful) is there and the old car is changing in that car. What about that. Another thing that i don t liked was when they decided to take the cube into the city. Bad idea. The robots said that they must defense the humans, same like army, but they go to the city with the cube. Why? to die a lot of people?(I m not very good at English. Sorry about it)"
"cdfurlong","5","1","3","16 August 2007"," Lots of Good Stuff, Lots of Bad Stuff
","I thought the new Transformers movie was sub par. I am confused as to how close to 80,000 people could have voted it a 7.9 when it clearly had many serious flaws: <br/><br/>1. Soundwave (aka Frenzy) was as bad as Jar Jar Binks. Instead of making him a cool spy, like he was in the television show, the makers of the film decided to make a crazy ""Soundwave"" spy. Why? For cheap laughs from tots. <br/><br/>2. The plot could have stretched over 2 to 3 movies, easily. Instead of developing a complex plot and strong characters, the directors relied on action-plot and special effects. <br/><br/>3. Excepting Optimus Prime and perhaps Bumblebee, the other Autobots and all the Decepticons were horribly void of their television personalities. Megatron, Starscream, Ironhide, Jazz (Jazz died! LOL), Ratchet, Barricade and Bonecrusher all came off more as personalityless soldiers who happened to be caught on film while fighting a war. YOu know, those faceless soldiers of WWI and II. Moreover, Megatron and Starscream, two of my favorite characters from the television show, came off as a couple monsters. In the television they were much, much more than that.<br/><br/>4. The mechanics of the transformers were too visual. Just like in the new Star Wars movies (metachlorian), Transformers The Movie showed me too much. I didn't want to see every mechanical connection, thanks! Granted, the actual transforming scenes were quite amazing, especially when Bumblebee transformed from robot to a car, but it doesn't make up for the fact that the movie lost a significant portion of the mystique that was present in the cartoon. <br/><br/>5. More annoying comedic relief: specifically the secretary of state and government agents. <br/><br/>6. Although I consider the ""autobots hiding on Sam's house from his parents"" a high-point of the film, I also consider it a low point. For five minutes before the autobots hide on Sam's house they are made to look like a bunch of buffoons. This was especially distressing in relation to Optimus Prime, who is suppose to be the wise leader of the autobots. Instead, he looks like a complete idiot. Optimus Prime, the wise leader of the Autobots, is not smart enough to understand Sam when he says ""hide! my parents will see you!"". <br/><br/>Overall, I think this movie is similar to AI. It has many good points that make it watchable, but its bad points prevent it from being a classic. <br/><br/>5/10"
"paddy-2","6","1","3","15 August 2007"," dismal storytelling and direction. So-so spectacle.
","The film - what you'd expect from Michael Bay. Big, brash, dumb, peppered with irritating plot holes. Thin clichéd characterisation, fetishising military hardware, fetishising ridiculous bloated SUV vehicles. Incoherent and confusing action with diminishing returns (by the third hour, we are really getting sick of watching giant robots punching each other). All that regular stuff. Oh yeah - and at least half the movie takes place at magic hour. It's like sucking on a giant chrome exhaust pipe, while someone hits you over the head, while shining an orange lamp in your face.<br/><br/>My point is a small one - but why is that American film makers (and audiences?) find it so hard to accept that other countries in the world have high technology? OK, in the movie we get a crack about the robot probably being Japanese, and about Nokia phones coming from Finland - but what the heck is the point of having a character describe the failed Mars lander ""Beagle 2"" as ""NASA/JPL"", when in fact it was a British craft, carried on a European Space Agency mission! Yes, America, sorry if it upsets you, but Europe (and Japan, and India, and China etc etc) all have space programs!!!!!"

"dada_neso","10","1","3","2 August 2007"," Movie of the year 2007!!!
","At 2 1/2 hours, ""Transformers"" is a impressive movie with a lot of special effects. At stake is protecting whatever parts of Earth aren't destroyed in battles between warring metallic factions from outer space. The film starts off like an alien-invasion picture, telling the Transformers story as though it were ""Independence Day."" The new movie offers a much better time than that one.Transformers, of course, comprise the good Autobots and the evil Decepticons . Both factions are imposing robots who contort themselves to become machines like trucks and supersonic fighter jets. In a dicey bit of cross-promotion, the movie uses the occasion to hawk Hummers, Pontiac roadsters, and GMC trucks, which are some of the vehicles Autobots turn into. The Decepticons become ominous cop cars (""to punish and enslave"" reads the motto) and anonymous military vehicles -- more intimidating but harder to buy.In any case, they've brought the fight on their planet to this one. Both sides are in pursuit of a cubed life-force called the Allspark that in Decepticon hands could turn simple machines into robotic weapons of destruction. But there's a horny teenage boy unwittingly in the way. His name is Sam Witwicky , and to play this smart Aleck on a parental short leash, Shia LaBeouf seems just to have wandered over from the set of ""Disturbia.""Based on a line of Hasbro toys, Transformers puts the fun back into movie-going, blending comedy with the robot action and adding a dash of romance along with eye candy for both sexes into a film that never takes itself seriously yet doesn't poke fun at or offend those who grew up loving the toys. Smartly cast with awe-inspiring special effects, Bay and company have created more than just a movie. Catch it in a theater because on DVD it just won't be the same. Watching Transformers on the big screen is a real cinematic experience. The preview crowd I was with cheered the robot heroes and really interacted with the film (not to the degree it was annoying), totally caught up in what was unfolding on the screen. And strangely enough, the idea of robots battling each other with the future of mankind hanging in the balance almost seems plausible because of how ingeniously the make believe world of Autobots and Decepticons has been brought to life in Transformers. A+"
"christian94","7","1","3","20 July 2007"," More humor than action
","Michael Bay's new blockbuster is doing well in the theater. It takes the 80s cartoons premise and puts in the the 21st century with cell phones and ebay...<br/><br/>The story is not the strong point of the movie. Afterall, this is based on material made for kids in order to incite them to buy toys. I was one of these kids in the 80s and still have some Transformers somewhere at my mother's house, so I was familiar with the concept, although not hardcore--for instance, I knew about Optimus Prime and Megatron, but only remembered of Bumble Bee once they mentioned his name; I recognized some robots, but no other names. This movie was partly targeted to my demographic that regard this as nostalgic of our youth, but also to a new generation of kids & teenagers.<br/><br/>Once you accept that the story is going nowhere fast, the movie is quite successful. It has one-dimensional characters, but excellent one-liners. What surprised me the most from Bay, which I regard highly in terms of action sequences, is that the humor was better than the action. The CGI work was good (not great) and some interesting action finally occurred near the end. I'm thinking of a few great shots in the street like a transformer that jumps over a woman in slow motion... but overall the action was not up to par to Bad Boys, The Rock, Pearl Harbor & Bad Boys II in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>The comedy did work for me and my friends though. We laughed quite a bit and a few nods were there for the casual fans of Transfomers like myself.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was an entertaining summer flick. Do not expect a masterpiece, but expect to be thoroughly entertained for 144mins. Oh yeah, I almost forget for those who care, but the two female leads are hot, very hot. Sure to give a few more tickets sales for a movie like this. But with Bay, it's mostly all jokes and eye-candy anyway.<br/><br/>Lastly, there is quite a bit of product placement, mainly GM & eBay. What can you do in a world that revolves not only around the Sun, but around money..."

","I just saw this movie and i want to tell you i was totally taken aback by the visual feats being shown in this movie . The movie is a bit pacey with a not so extraordinary storyline and a decent performance from its co stars , but it is the special effects which takes this movie to the next level . The special effects being shown in this movie beats the recent releases like spiderman-3 potc-3 harry potter-5 etc by a mile the robots being shown in this movie look quite real. The movie is very well directed . The scenes between the robots and human is really well done . The background score for this movie is quite good. It is a very good comic book to film conversion . I advice all those who are real comic book fans should go for this movie . You wont be disappointed . As for me i am looking forward to the sequel of this great movie , the blockbuster of the summer of 2007 . Hats off to you transformers keep the energy level in the sequel. 9 out of 10 stars"
"Monotreme02","7","1","3","19 July 2007"," Best entertainment of the summer: Light on the brain, but all in good fun
","Is anything in this movie ""more than meets the eye""? Certainly not. If there's one thing Bay is good at it is delivering the goods up, front-and-center, with no subtleties but also no restraints. Is this necessarily a good thing? Not when he's trying to direct something that is supposed to have any sense of seriousness, such as Pearl Harbour. But on a movie like this, anything goes: I mean, it's about giant alien robots from outer space who have come to do battle on Earth. That pretty much opens almost endless array of doors to Bay's disposal, and of course doesn't leave much room for subtleties. This film's characters are flat but believable; the plot is implausible but not ridiculous. Somehow it all comes together and works in the long run.<br/><br/>I give credit to Spielberg, though, for setting the overall tone of the film and ultimately restraining Bay. Quite unlike his previous ""epics"" such as Armageddon and The Island, Transformers unfolds with an always-vigorous sense of light-hearted fun and adventure. The film has many cheesy moments, but never does it get preachy nor kitschy, and for Bay to have avoided such obvious opportunities to sneak in that kind of nonsense, I salute the picture and the producers involved that prevented a moment such as Bruce Willis' sacrifice at the climax of Armageddon. This never-serious tone comes across also in the sly and razor-sharp sense of humour, which I thought was absolutely hilarious and worked wonderfully.<br/><br/>The acting, quite surprisingly, also worked. Sure, actors like John Turturro and Jon Voight pretty much play caricatures, but the true shocker is Shia LaBeouf, the young up-and-rising star who was too annoying in I Robot and Constantine but who delivers a sharp, witty and very human and believable performance as the young protagonist. His turn in this film quite reassures me of his potential in the upcoming fourth Indiana Jones movie. I expect good things.<br/><br/>But this movie has one main central purpose, and I salute it for never once trying to hide it: to entertain and deliver mind-blowing visuals. And it more than exceeds in both of these fields. From the earliest, relentlessly thrilling car chases and all through the final showdown in downtown L.A., this film is a wild, wild ride that grabs you by the collar and never lets you go once. Its speed and pace is impeccable and relentless, and it always keeps you engaged with even more bombastic, even grander, even more insane set pieces and action sequences as it progresses. Bay has of course by now perfected the art of the high-octane action sequence, and with such a broad palette of flashy cars, giant robots, unlimited advanced weapons and the broad, sprawling wide spaces of the American West, Bay, quite unlike some of his counterparts and, dare I say, imitators, knows exactly when to film with intense chaos and when to treat us with a wide, slow-motion long-shot to let us take it all in. In terms of the cinematography and visual style, every shot is flawlessly constructed and gorgeously stylized in terms of lighting, composition, angles and movement. The computer graphic work by ILM is utterly stupefying and probably more convincing than most any other CGI work I've seen lately, as is the excellent sound design by Eric Aadahl, and I wouldn't be surprised if this film nabs an Oscar or two in these categories. And with imagery like a fighter jet flying at full speed only to transform into Starscream in mid-air, grab onto the bottom of a bridge and flip around, landing on his feet on top of it, or a slow-motion shot of Optimus Prime and Megatron literally flying through a high-rise office building, one cant help but sit back and grin.<br/><br/>While watching this film, one also can't help but sit back and wonder: what would it be like had Steven Spielberg done more than produce, and perhaps filled in the director's chair as well. What's for sure is that his mark is more than felt on the movie with Bay at the helm: the whole bond between Sam and Bumblebee is strongly present, and scenes such as the one where Sam goes to his house to fetch the glasses while the Autobots wait impatiently in his backyard are pure Spielberg. Would the film necessarily be better? Perhaps, although perhaps Bay was the perfect man for this project with his loud, over-produced and over-the-top approach. But what's for sure is that it would have been very different. I can imagine the family aspect, especially Sam's relationship with his father, far more emphasized, as well as his friendship with Bumblebee, who as the silent visitor from outer space who forms a bond with the protagonist, is an extremely Spielberg-esquire character as it is. Perhaps the military aspect would have also been far less emphasized. It is definitely an interesting thought, but maybe considering the already-ridiculous nature of the plot to begin with, Bay's easy-on-the-brain-feast-for-the-eyes approach is exactly what it needed.<br/><br/>It's loud, it's over-done, it's exaggerated and populated with caricatures and flat characters. It lacks any value in plot and characters. But it is irresistibly entertaining and undeniably well-made, far more so than the other big event films prior to it this summer. And its overall light, all-in-the-fun tone really allows one to just sit back and enjoy the ride. And what a thrilling, relentless and fantastic ride it is. Ultimately, Spielberg's production along with Bay's visuals match perfectly to create the ultimate brainless summer entertainment."
"Enigmanic1","10","1","3","17 July 2007"," A brilliant installment to one of the greatest sci-fi series
","I grew up on cartoons like Transformers, G. I. Joe and He-man, I had all the action figures and watched almost every episode as a kid. So I have long anticipated a live-action rendition of my all-time favorite cartoon series. And thankfully, the filmmakers did a superb job.<br/><br/>As most die-hard Transformers fans will appreciate, they did the series justice by staying close to the original storyline and using most of the original characters. They even went as far as to cast Peter Cullen, who provided the voice of Optimus Prime throughout the series.<br/><br/>Even if you aren't already a fan of the hit cartoon series, this movie delivers. The acting and dialog deserve passing grades, the action rarely stops and the special effects are through the roof. For instance, whenever a robot transforms, you can see hundreds of moving parts, hinting at the amount of work that went into the effects. The detail is intricate and enjoyable to watch over and over.<br/><br/>In closing, this is an outstanding film based on an awesome franchise, it provides plenty of thrills and excitement for viewers of all ages."
"Irritator","6","1","3","17 July 2007"," The Cartoon on the big screen
","Firstly, I'd like to tell u that I'm Russian so it's difficult to me to write my thoughts in English, but I'll try. When I saw the poster of ""Transformers"" I thought:""Wow! The most favourite cartoon of my childhood is on the big screen! Nostalgia!"" I must tell u that this American cartoon couldn't been shown in USSR in 80s, so firstly it was showed in 1994, when I was 4. So this interesting colorful cartoon became very popular in Russia and I was its fun too, as many Russian children. I had every series of the cartoon, I had some toy transformers and posters of them. But I didn't know then that this cartoon would ""transform"" into full-fledged movie. Now my dream is reality. Michael Bay is very talented director so I expected something very big. Unfortunately it hasn't followed my through. Good things in the movie are firstly sound effects and video effects. They are perfect, I can't say more. The humor. I laughed during this film more than during many good comedies. Crazy small Nokia-robot is simply super. The humor makes more attractive fights and battles. Another good thing is actors especially Megan Fox. This girl is very beautiful, even only this force u to watch this movie again and again. Shia is, in my humble opinion, too simple and weak for the main role. These are all good things. But there are many bad things. For example, the script. Two crazy groups of aliens firstly are searching for the old glasses then for the strange cube. What a blather for high-quality film. It's funny but not interesting! And nearly during the half of the movie many pieces of metal are fighting and fighting and Great American Army cannot do anything! Robots have made well but they haven't their own tempers like it was in the cartoon. They are like godzillas or stupid king-kongs but not the living race. Also the movie advertise too much for example Nokia or GMC. So, my opinion is that is not a bad film, Michael Bay cannot do bad films, but I wanted more and I think old cartoon is better."
"machngunjoe","2","1","3","16 July 2007"," A very good version, but Micheal Bay?
","The movie Transformers is this summers movie box office hit without a doubt. Its amazing to me still that Harry Potter can compete with this 80's toy/cartoon epic. As far adaptation goes this movie hit the mark..well as good as you can get it without ruining the story of how Transformers came to Earth in the first place. The action was even better. A little hard to tell the difference between some Decepticons and some Transformers transformed into entirely different things then its cartoon version, but who cares! For me , I would much rather see Megatron as a flying jet looking thing then have Micheal Bay, who directs this piece, defy physics and have Megatron transform into a hand held gun that any human can carry. Which brings me to my point why this movie with all its intense fighting and awesome screenplay adaptation, only gets a 9 out of 10. Micheal BAY. Micheal Bay is notorious for making great movies just good enough for the theaters and thats it. Micheal Bay has certain elements that appear in almost every one of his movies. He has cameos of a comedic nature, usually done by a black guy or foreigner and there almost never THAT funny. For example Eddie Griffen in Armegedon and Bernie Mac in Transformers He uses the same shots as he does in other movies, for example the 360 pan-around shot in Bad Boys 2 Pearl Harbor, and now Transformers. Point is this. If you were a fan. You'll love this movie as it is authentic, If you don't like Micheal Bay because of his cheese!!! But like Transformers as a kid...well then you'll give this movie a 9"
"SlackerRus2000","8","1","3","12 July 2007"," A Popcorn flick if there ever was one, but a great one!!!!
","I had I hopes for this film when I saw the trailers. I was always a fan of transformers, although never a devoted one. I had a couple toys, watched some shows, know a little of the Mythos, but definitely not an expert and time has faded my memories. Basically, I came in with no preconceived notions of what the film should be, which is good cause I could see how people could take the film in the wrong light. <br/><br/>First and foremost, it's based on a cartoon so expect the story to be wacky, which it is in spades. Crazy loony toon cops, government officials (Sector 7, need I say more) and parental units. Why every American family has to be kooky and crazy in Hollywood films nowadays is beyond me. Fortunately, most of the time the wackiness leans itself well to the overall motif of the film or sets up a good one-liner( transformers is a surprisingly funny film.)<br/><br/>Secondly, the actors are mostly throwaways, Megan fox couldn't me more stale. Even veterans of the industry disappointed, jon voight anyone? There is some miscasting, everyone playing a sector 7 official was too upsurd for my tastes, especially the head honcho. Fortunately, shia labouf is a saving grace bringing humor and good twitchy, overly anxious teenager to the screen.<br/><br/>Now here comes the Transformers, who except for Jazz (why oh why was he so stereotypically black, do African-Americans enjoy stereotypes of themselves on screen in robot form?) are all done exceptionally well. Optimus prime and bumble bee have the most personality and are done amazingly well. I would have like to have seen more deception interaction, but it makes sense with the storyline. Just seeing them lumber around is a special effects treat and wait til you see guns ablazing, the action is an intense roller-coaster ride if there ever was one.<br/><br/>Finally, michael bay as the director. As being a fan of Bay's work, (the island was amazing)I was pleased with his interaction with the film. Some miscasting and overly goofiness aside, he brought a great film to the screen and should be commended."
"tim_d_wagner","Null","1","3","15 July 2007"," I'd see it again but there was lots of room for improvement
","Movie is great concept, but story stalls at a few points, character is generally good but some characters go ""missing"" along the way. The camera work on the special effect shots seems deliberately blurry and jumpy and really detract from this being a great movie, but that could just be me getting ""old"" and not liking the ""new"" style. It seemed to me for many of the action scenes it was just blurry bouncy camera shots with the occasional shot or explosion to break the sequence up but it was like was that a robot, an elbow, who knows. As a consequence you never seem to get a clear view of the robots in action, but there are a few times when they ""pose"" for the camera. I look forward to the likely sequel, and hope I will get to ""see"" more of the action."
"jnjenfield","7","1","3","15 July 2007"," The Transformers at the Drive In
","My wife and I saw The Transformers at the Drive-In theater this week. It's the best way to see movies, especially ones with lots of explosions and larger-than-life characters. I was very impressed by the special effects. Just when you think they have reached the pinnacle of perfection, ILM outdoes themselves. The detail on the Transformers CGI models is amazing. Watching them transform between robot and vehicle modes was worth the $6 ticket by itself (another reason to go to our drive-in is that it's $4 or $5 cheaper than the other theaters in town). Of course, it wouldn't be a Michael Bay film without explosions and this film delivers in a big way. The Deceptercons really tear things up. It's not so much the fireballs, but the way the shrapnel flies around that is really impressive though.<br/><br/>Also very impressive from a visual standpoint was the interaction between CGI and real objects and people. They are getting better and better at incorporating the two so that the CGI looks more real. It helped that the Transformers are made of metal which is easier to model realistically than hair or skin, but it was still amazing how well they blended the robots in.<br/><br/>While the stars of the show, Bumblebee, Optimus Prime, etc. looked really cool, the bots who stole the show were really the little probes. The Deceptercon who transformed into the boombox was especially funny. He and the one that turned into a cell phone remind me a bit of the droids in Star Wars which are incidental to the overall plot but yet are still very engaging to watch.<br/><br/>The whole movie really centered around Bumblebee and Sam though I think they could have used a few more scenes that showed the developing relationship between them. The ""romance"" between Sam and the car thief's daughter ole what's-her-face was even more half baked. True, the scenes of him trying to impress her with his car were funny (a little bit painful to watch for a fellow geek who has never been good with the ladies either, but still funny). I didn't get the whole ""I can fix cars"" bit with her though since she never actually fixes anything in the movie that I could tell. She looks at Bumblebees engine at one point and tows him when he gets damaged at another but thats about it.<br/><br/>Bay does a pretty good job of portraying the military in a positive light. They couldn't drag out the whole figuring out what the threat is thing much more without making the film overly long, but it still felt a bit of a stretch for them to go from having no idea what was going on to rounding up all these brilliant people (why some of them were high-schoolers is beyond me, who learns hacking in High School?) then to figuring out a bullet that will damage the robots.<br/><br/>It was cool that they used Hoover Dam to hide the ""Ice Man"" since I live near there. How they got from there to L.A. so quick was kind of weird though. Also, why would they take the All-Spark to L.A. anyway when they knew the Deceptercons were going to fight them for it? I know that way they could have more carnage for the film, but logistically it didn't make sense. They should have taken it out further into the desert instead. I also didn't get why Sam had to carry the All-Spark to the roof when one of the Transformers could have taken it and him to where ever he was supposed to go with it in the helicopter. Seemed like a bit of an unneeded risk to me. Looked like Sam almost got killed over it too.<br/><br/>The plot was straight out of one of the cartoons which in this case, is a good thing since it's based on one. The ending felt especially cartoonish but that was a good thing for once. They could have done without the sexual innuendos and cussing though. I couldn't tell if they were trying to make it a kids movie or an adults movie. The humor and plot were better suited to a kids show, but the inclusion of all the sex jokes made it unsuitable for kids. Go figure.<br/><br/>Finally, the music, while well done, was not memorable. There wasn't any real theme to it. I don't remember hearing any bits of the classic cartoon theme except a couple of times when a character mentioned the tag line ""more than meets the eye"". I did like how Bumblebee used clips of songs and commercials and news broadcasts to talk though. That was clever. It's been done in alien invasion movies before but it was quite effective here too."

","I never really watched the cartoon, just an episode here and there, but I still enjoyed the movie. It had a good amount of laughs sprinkled throughout the film, and the animation was fantastic. However, in a few spots the movie seemed to stop in order to give a detailed description of what had happened in the past. These long speeches drew me away from the movie. This information could have been better intertwined into the film. However, in this film everything seems to stop in order to let dialog take place. Overall, I thought the film did a good job entertaining all age groups of Transformer fans and the common movie buff alike."

","so before i saw it i heard how amazing it was for all these different people. it was a good amount of people too (including the never wrong IMDb) and nobody said it was bad, nobody said it was OK, nobody even said it was pretty good. all i heard was that it was OMG AWESOME! i had been wanting to see it since i came out so i waited over a week to see it and these comments only fueled that fire....so i went into the movie theater two days ago with very high expectations. i was thinking that it was going to put the matrix and lord of the rings to shame, that it was even going to pass 300. being the idiot that i determined the movie before i even saw it. i had this fantasy in my head that no movie could live up to. and because of that, through no fault of the movie, i was disappointed by the action. and I'm not saying that the action wasn't enough, I'm not saying that this movie didn't give me goosebumps a few times, I'm just say that its not that jaw-dropping action extravaganza that i built it up to be in my head....on the flip side of my disappointment in the action, i was pleasantly surprised by the comedy in this movie. i had no idea that this movie was going to be so damn funny. everyone is talking about how all these other movies have been this year but i think i laughed more at transformers than i did at any other movie this year. i know I'm probably going to have people disagree with me here, but i think this movie if funnier than knocked up or even almighty or any other comedy I'm forgetting....the story was very implausible, but who wasn't expecting that with transformers? the acting and visuals helps u forgive that anyways. this is the kind of movie where u don't ask questions, u just enjoy the amazing things your seeing and hearing....Shia LaBouf comes out of nowhere and comedic genius with his delivery and timing...the robots look as real as they can get...and the actions sequences (although less abundant than i would've like and filmed in a way that made me feel as if i couldn't see anything) were the kind that made u lean forward and shout ""WOOOooo"" or ""DAMN!""....my only problem with this movie was that the Transformers really took a backseat to the humans involved. the only robots that really got significant screen time were Prime and Bumblebee. there seemed to be one too many story lines; Sam's was the only one that really seemed necessary. i would've liked to see more robots instead of Anthony Anderson and that blonde girl he was running around with....they left it wide open for a sequel and i have no problem with that. this movie is all about explosions and jokes and a sequel isn't going to ruin anything....i hope that in the sequel i could get to know the transformers other than Prime and Bumblebee...other than that, rock on ;)"
"anifanmc","8","1","3","14 July 2007"," I don't know what everyone's whining about.
","I for one thought this was a fantastic movie.<br/><br/>Overall although the scripting was pretty weak, that's hardly the focus of a movie about giant robotic sentient machines that can transform into cars. The whole movie had me enthralled, as a matter of fact, and anyone who thinks I'm a bad movie critic can suck on it. I thought the plot was at least reminiscent of the show, and pretty much summed up the feeling of what Bay and Spielberg were trying to convey - a conflict that puts humans in the crossfire and manages to get them thoroughly involved at the same time.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf did much better than I expected, acting-wise, and Megan Fox did a decent job as well. If people are going to movies like this to find some sort of higher meaning or truth in the plot, why the hell bother watching it? Go see other popcorn flicks like the Matrix if that's really what you're after. And hey, the movie definitely had it's share of philosophical rambling, mostly on the part of Optimus Prime. But this begs the question - WHO CARES WHEN YOU'VE GOT A GIANT COMBAT SCENE BETWEEN ROBOTS GOING ON IN FRONT OF YOU? What amuses me the most is that Independence Day was far worse as far as plot and dialogue go, and yet the same people whining about Transformers are the ones who go gaga over Independence Day and its ""philosophical truths"". Yeah real philosophical, bunch of aliens out to wipe the planet of all life. You know, Bay creates movies like these to please the audience... not to bloody make people think.<br/><br/>People either take movies too seriously or they take themselves too seriously. Sometimes it's a good idea to just sit back and enjoy."
"SqueekyGurl","8","1","3","13 July 2007"," Best hero movie I've seen in a while
","This movie is action, action, and more action. Something that I wasn't sure if I actually wanted to see. After driving 20 miles to see the new Harry Potter film, and discovering that it had just sold out moments before my arrival, I figured, ""f**k you, I'm not wasting 20 miles of valuable time driving, and money on gas."" So Transformers it was. The movie started off slow, however, picked up rather quickly. Micheal Bay did a brilliant job at attempting to balance plot and action, as well as slating half-way decent actors that made the plot at least somewhat believable.<br/><br/>A definite recommendation for people who have yet to see this movie, or are having doubts about it.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 8/10<br/><br/>Good for all ages :)"
"giotto80","7","1","3","12 July 2007"," Cutting 20 minutes would have worked miracles
","I wasn't expecting much more than a parade of special effects. Surprisingly, the human actors helped balance the sometimes over-the-top CGI & cheesy plot. Shia LeBeouff was entertaining throughout. The scenes between him & his family were hilarious. Megan Fox? Yowza!!!<br/><br/>The dialog was pretty lame for the Autobots......pretty much like the original cartoon. One thing is certain - Michael Bay is so wrapped up in his ""genius"" that he doesn't know how to edit a film. Less would have equated to more for Transformers. Besides, it's worthy of a sequel. No need to squeeze every possible action sequence into this film. The redundancy tarnished Tranformers' overall appeal.<br/><br/>All the Transformers impressed me w/ the exception of MegaTron. They should have introduced a more ""true-to-the-original"" MegaTron earlier in the story.<br/><br/>But really, this was a fun film. Surprisingly, it was also a great movie-going experience for me. People weren't talking, screwing their cell phones, or getting up throughout the film. It's rare that a film keeps the crowd engaged from start to finish. Transformers managed to do just that."

","For crying out loud would all the editors, and I'm not just talking about this film, PLEASE STOP using the soundtrack from ""THIN RED LINE"", track 3 in particular, as a music guide track! I know it is an awesome piece of music, but the tune is so identifiable that it only makes me spend the rest of the scene wondering what other films I have seen that some poor composer has had to try and redo. This definitely kills the buzz. It's driving me CRAZY and I'm really sure it's driving the composers crazy too! Even ""Saint Hans"" himself, has had to recreate the piece. Otherwise it was a load of fun. Had some great laughs and was lucky that there were a bunch of ""Stoners"" sitting beside me who were really getting into it and I saw it from their point of view and had a ball!"
"joestank15","5","1","3","10 July 2007"," More than meets the eye? The film is EXACTLY what it appears to be
","Transformers - Sam Witwicky (name alone tells you how seriously they took the subject matter) finds an old Camero that uses some Herbie and Nightrider tricks in the hope of getting Sam laid by no-way-in-he11-is-she-in-high-school Mikaela Bane (Megan Fox). It turns out the weird car is *gasp* a ROBOT IN DISGUISE! by the name of Bumblebee. The robot sends out a signal to the coolest Autobot (Good guy for short) ever and step-father to a generation of small boys in the 80s, Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen).<br/><br/>Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving and he11 if I could've figured out it was him, and I loved V for Vendetta) is on Earth and is after a cube. Why? That's not important right now. He's a Decepticon, and if you can't keep them straight it's in the bloody name. DECEPT-icon. Like deception= bad guy. Oh who gives a crap. Look the point is that there are some wonderfully intense robot on robot action sequences. Crap gets blown up. And I hate Bay, but he sure can blow things up.<br/><br/>Transformers is quite possibly the dumbest movie that you may find this summer. Parts of it may also be the most fun you'll have at the cinema this year. Hence I'm torn about this movie.<br/><br/>The music keeps telling you otherwise, but huge chunks of dialog in this film are jarringly awful. Nearly everything is played for laughs. And there are plot holes galore with no logic save action movie logic. Every minute the robots are not on screen is a moment wasted. The script felt like a couple of teenage boys just willed for the coolest stuff to happen in their own alternate universe.<br/><br/>""I only got a B- on a project where all I did was hock my granddad's crap for 3 minutes? I can convince my teacher to raise it to an A-.""<br/><br/>""The coolest girl in the class? Yeah. She's on Maxim's top 100 Hottest Women list, and nevermind her popular asshole boyfriend and my awful attempts at wooing her. She's going to like me eventually, and (I sh!t you not, this actually happens) sit on my lap, just because the movie says so."" Yeah right toy-boy. In your dreams. <br/><br/>The film almost has a mad brilliance to it. It's like Bay knows we'll stomach these laughably tired things he does for the sake of those f***ing awesome robots.<br/><br/>Boy does he know us well. Hook, line, and sinker. Those robots are enormous, kick @ss, and were money well spent. I could watch them transform into robots and back over and over and never get bored. There's one that's a tank, there are two awesome jets. There's even one that's a Mountain Dew machine in perhaps the most shameless product placement in cinema history. A minor problem I had though was that it was kind of hard to tell who was who sometimes. Megatron and Starscream kinda looked alike at a glance. Fans of the series will be mixed on the whole because the robots WERE awesome and true (for the most part) to the series they love so well. It's the humans that gum up the works.<br/><br/>Jon Voight plays perhaps the most inept Secretary of Defense I've ever seen. John Tuturro is kinda ineffective, kinda creepy, kinda lame. Where was the menace I saw in ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" and ""Secret Window""? Anthony Anderson continues down the pathway of ""Chubby Comic Relief"" hell. Shia LaBeouf is alright as the awkward protagonist. It's mostly this god-awful script that the cast has to deal with. Nearly everything is played for laughs. The robots are fine for the most part. Megatron and his Decpeticons ooze menace and Prime is fatherly and the Autobots are likable. It's just shame that the film didn't center around them.<br/><br/>The movie was made for the big screen, and will be worthless by the time the DVD scrolls around, so see it now, not then. Bay is still a hack, but he shore done made them robots and explosions purdy and will doubtless make a bundle from this very fun, astronomically flawed movie.<br/><br/>I give Transformers a B-. Oh, and did I mention how cool the Transformers are?"
"mbsa","7","1","3","9 July 2007"," I'm starting to become a little bit worried...
","My next lines will be about a film that's really interesting, about a film that has almost everything a huge fan of action deserves, it's really enjoyable. But what's going on with the votes? 8.1 with more than 30.000 votes... I guess that it will become one of the entries for the top 250 movies of all time, and that,I don't seem to understand. It's really a good action film and it's an almost perfect adaptation of the Transformers world, It even has all the elements that make Michael Bay a good action director, I love that really cool effects of him slowing down the action for boosting up emotion. But c'mon people it's not really in the same league as Ben-Hur, or even Star Wars The Return of the Jedi. Please don't take my opinion in a bad way, the movie is really cool and it deserves to get praise, especially Shia Lebouef and Michael Bay, BUT I think that a little of the amazing credibility that IMDb had, was lost in the latest months by over-estimating judgements with a lot of the latest movies."
"darkrockslizerx","10","1","3","5 July 2007"," 9.5/10
","This movie is simply amazing. It is entertaining, fun, and the special effects are mind-blowing, even for this age when people take them for granted in every movie.<br/><br/>Of course, all the critics would find many reasons why this film would be bad. They always do that. Regardless, people like it, and that is the main thing. Unlike some other animation/comics-based films, Transformers actually leave the old shell behind and focuses more on making a good entertainment rather than satisfying the die-hard fan's desires for boxy, classic characters. The pacing and editing is also unusual for this kind of movies, resulting in a very realistic environment.<br/><br/>Shia LaBoeuf is simply great as the main character, and stands out the most, whilst Megan Fox, playing the role of protagonist's dream girl, is only trying to look hot instead of acting, sometimes making me wonder if anybody would notice the difference if a poster would be put in her place with voice-over. Her lines are pathetic, but a good (or any) actor talent should have dealt with that. She just doesn't have it.<br/><br/>Overall, a great entertainment. I was very satisfied. This wouldn't have worked without Michael Bay, which made the movie into something more than one would expect from just hearing the name. 9.5/10"
"adhammonds","10","1","3","9 July 2007"," I was a kid all over again!!!
","I've been sitting on pins and needles for this movie since it played as a preview with Mars Beagle video last year. I've been impatiently waiting catching every glimpse of a preview and each one has cultivated to this point the launching and I must say, I WAS TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY!!! The first time I saw the big rig come on screen transform and announce to Sam, ""I'm Optimus Prime, leader of the AutoBots!"" I almost squealed with glee. This movie did an excellent job at taking a franchise from the 80's and making a script most everyone could follow and the fact that they've left it open for a sequel I can only hope the studio will do one.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie go see it you will love it and the action sequences are out of this world! Secondly, if you have seen it and can't get enough Transformers go get the video game on XBOX 360 and enjoy every moment as you change and change back so fluidly it's unbelievable."
"ddixon-6","7","1","3","5 July 2007"," I feared the worst, I enjoyed the finished product.
","OK.<br/><br/>I am one of ""those guys"" - I'm 30, I grew up being a huge fan of the Generation 1 Transformers. I still enjoy the concept, have a couple TF toys on shelves in my home office, that kind of thing. TF was my own ""Star Wars"" - the latter never having appealed strongly to me.<br/><br/>Still, I knew I was going to see the movie regardless, just to see what they had done. Bay's movies have been basic no-thinking popcorn flicks that I haven't hated, so I wasn't biased against the directing at least. My girlfriend was equally excited, also a child of the 80s even though TF wasn't her toon of choice back then.<br/><br/>I'm not going to detail the plot, as so many reviewers have done so before me. I just wanted to point out some things as one of those grew-up-on-it fanboys.<br/><br/>The humor: It was good, for the most part. We all laughed many times in the theater. A couple of jokes were pretty bad (Bumblebee drenching Turturro), a couple scenes a bit too long (hiding in Sam's back yard), and ""My bad"" a gauche line for a noble character; but overall, lots of genuine laughs. Sam was babbling and neurotic (especially in the early parts), like Woody Allen on a speedball, and that got old pretty quickly - but at least he slid in a clever retort here and there.<br/><br/>The plot: Not G1, but acceptable, decently conceived and fairly sensical. Sure, it's absurd to think sentient, advanced technological beings would need the help of a 17-year-old kid to find an artifact, but it was fine. Open end allows for a sequel quite easily, but it's fairly sewn-up as a oneshot if necessary. One plot device that I figured wasn't fantastic, would have been better if it was explained to the viewers (Sam does something crucial at the end of the movie, but we're not told how or even *if* he comes to the conclusion that it would work - a little thinking on the viewer's part is needed there).<br/><br/>And by the way, I was struck by the sheer lack of TOTAL HYSTERIA that would ensue were even one giant robot appear in any city whatsoever. There were people close enough to the robot battles to almost be hit by them. I would assume those streets would have been EMPTY at the first quaking footfall of *any* of the robots.<br/><br/>The bots: Many fans, myself included, were fairly angry at the new looks of our favorite characters as presented in promotional stills. Just not enough of the old charm in the new look, I thought. As for the vehicle modes, I somewhat understood the German car manufacturers' position on Jazz and Bumblebee, but the changing of Prime's truck form so drastically I didn't understand. As for the robot modes - wow, a billion moving parts all at once, huh? Hmmm, I suppose it makes more sense from a robotic-biology standpoint...<br/><br/>Anyways - I came away from the film truly thinking of Optimus Prime as Optimus Prime. His color scheme, vehicle mode, and even that one awful line, were not enough to take the character away from himself. Peter Cullen had a huge part in making that a reality, too, and I hope he reprises again in any sequels to be made. Bumblebee was fun and likable, but not *quite* his old self... Aside from Prime, I'd say Jazz was closest to his original character. Ironhide was okay, but I think I remember the G1 Ironhide being more like an old veteran soldier than a hair-triggered munitions expert. Ratchet was the Spock of the away team here, perfectly functional and without exuberance. I don't really remember his cartoon self as much as the others'. <br/><br/>The Decepticons were similarly almost-there. Megatron was every bit as menacing as, although there wasn't enough time to give him the sinister criminal mind of, his G1 self. Starscream was VERY de-characterized, having almost no personality, especially compared to the classic version. The baddies were plenty destructive, true to form, and at least they weren't limited to a scheme that would have been a 22-minute plot-foiling-waiting-to-happen in 1983. Oh, and Frenzy was annoying as hell - but I'm glad they saved Soundwave for the future instead of forcing the angular spider-bot on us with that iconic name.<br/><br/>Speaking of icons: surprisingly to me, Devastator was the one character I had the most complaint about the change to. In the movie a heavily armed and armored tank, but in the cartoon series a gestalt of five large construction vehicles forming a massive robot. THAT would have been 1. worth the title ""Devastator"", G1 nod or not, and 2. A *very* cool (and large) thing for the viewers to behold.<br/><br/>VFX: Everything looked good, realistic as could be done with so many moving parts... I think they stretched the existent mass as far as could go without actually increasing the amount, sometimes, considering a car the size of that Camaro turned into such a huge robot, for example. When he reverted to car-mode from bot-mode as the 2009 Camaro concept, I really had to ask myself ""Now if all that went in there, how is there going to be seating space for Sam and the girl, guys?""<br/><br/>Additionally, I'm sure you've read it already, but some of the fight scenes were shown too close to see what exactly was being done on the screen.<br/><br/>All in all: I really enjoyed it, and while some of the faults I found with it were fairly big (to me), the overall presentation was good enough to keep the issues at bay. Don't expect Academy awards, don't expect your childhood right there on the screen, just sit back and enjoy. My girlfriend loved it so much she wants to see it again before it's left the theaters."
"chimera-4","8","1","3","6 July 2007"," Good but totally vacuous
","That about sums up Transformers. <br/><br/>What you get here is about 45 mins of totally awesome giant-robot-mashing a$$ kickery interspersed with 95 minutes of Stupid. <br/><br/>I don't know what I was expecting though I mean Transformers is for kids right? OK yeah it was but most of those kids that watched the show when it was in it's heyday have now grown up. Well Transformers hasn't although I don't know if thats a good thing or a bad thing but it will possibly mean that people that remember the source material fondly will look at parts of this movie and think, man is this what passed for cool when I was a kid?<br/><br/>It often feels like Michael Bay has blended two movies together here, you get the stock action movie, with tense war room situations, stereotypical characters, big explosions, cliché dialog etc. And then you get the actual bits with the Transformers in which, while epic in spectacle are clearly aimed at kids with dialog and exposition worse than the original series. Some of it will make you cringe it's so corny.<br/><br/>The opening of the movie where one of the decepticons assaults an army base in the desert is really well done and when you see the first robot transformation your jaw will hit the floor. We're talking thousands of moving parts with panels twisting, hydraulics working, sections coming apart and coming together. The FX are freaking awesome. And thats what carries the movie and keeps you watching cos I'll tell you what, it ain't the story. There's isn't one. Thats right but what did you expect.<br/><br/>Transformers the live action movie was always going to be as successful as the FX and the action and thats what we get here by the bucketload. You can see most of the budget up on the screen. There are a few nitpicky things that fans will probably complain about. Bumble Bee isn't a beetle car since the film makers couldn't get permission to use the car for the movie. Optimus Prime has no faceplate for most of the movie. I didn't think that one was too bad myself but I've heard fanboys really whine and complain about it.<br/><br/>Shia Labeouf puts in the only decent performance of note throughout the whole movie which is the only reason to get behind his one dimensional character. I suppose John Tuturo is alright in his small role.<br/><br/>When the robots aren't on screen doing their thing we're treated to derivative ""seen it all before"" filler crap that aims for clichés and cheap gags to link the awesome bits together. None of them are really so lame as to spoil the movie but it's really totally by the numbers and surely the writers could have come up with something a bit better but they probably figured they could get away with it because with the subject matter they were onto a surefire license to print money.<br/><br/>In the end it's a movie you'll see and most will probably really enjoy it for what it is. A shallow but epic action movie with giant robots galore breaking stuff, destroying buildings and looking really good while doing it. A popcorn movie. Thats about all you get and for a lot of people thats probably enough.<br/><br/>Technology in movies now is getting to the point where epic spectacle and action is fast becoming the norm and if we don't get some story with our eye candy then things could be in danger of becoming very bland indeed."
"jblippman","7","1","3","7 July 2007"," Effects were spectacular, but the story could have been MUCH tighter.
","The difference between this movie and Star Wars - why this will be a cult fave with a certain segment of society and not a timeless classic - is the lack of a tightly crafted story to hold the terrific special effects together.<br/><br/>There are characters that do not forward the story and disappear part way through the movie. There are new characters that should be introduced in the first three scenes that don't appear until mid way through and therefore don't have the impact they should.<br/><br/>Every film maker learns that job one is to make every scene move the story forward, and Michael Bay fails to do this, which results in a 2 hour+ movie that leaves you feeling a vague lack of something instead of a tight 1 hour 50 minute movie that ties up all loose ends and gives every story thread the expected pay off.<br/><br/>It's worth seeing if you love great special effects and ""Independence Day"" style alien a$$ kicking, but don't expect the completely satisfied feeling you get from seeing a great story brought to life on screen."

"mt7176","8","1","3","7 July 2007"," Transform This!!!
","1st I would like to say...<br/><br/>(spoiler) the masturbation reference was way out of a line for a film based on a children cartoon. Hey its just me...but I don't think that had to be in there.<br/><br/>With that said everything else in this film rocked. This was not a kids movies for every generation but one specially made for those who grew up watching the original cartoon. Now I've read several fan boys whining how the new movie wasn't 100% faithful to the source material...but keep in mind the source material was a cartoon serial based on a toy line...Really not much to go on, but still the film makers referenced the key elements that endeared a generation to the Transformers of old. <br/><br/>Optimus Prime was still the GIANT HERO with that same strong voice who faced the most dangerous foes to save humanity. He's like George Washington as a Big Rig. He leads on the front lines.<br/><br/>The Autobots (though not identical looking and sounding as their cartoon counter parts) still have distinct personalities and styles. The cars are all GM vehicles too...though not accurate to the cartoon...Bumble Bee is better as a Camaro than a Bug and Jazz is still cool looking as Solciste. <br/><br/>The action was very big. Like a transformer movie should be and like its more adult counterparts (Terminator movies) people get hurt and people die. Buildings are demolished, vehicles cut in half, explosions huge. The editing was a little too fast paced and left me in need of my bottle of Advil but still pretty solid.<br/><br/>The Decepticons are lethal. They're not cartoon villains here. They kill. They want you dead. They find your existence disgusting. In other words ""evil."" No gray areas here. I think they spent more times on the Autobots design than they did on the Decepticon because they look a little generic and it was hard to differentiate between Megatron and Starscream which in the cartoon was no problem. I thought Megatron's voice, for not being the original, was pretty good, but they could have gotten a little closer to Starscream. In many of the episodes, he stole the show with his scheming and his weaselly voice. <br/><br/>Lastly the story is essentially ripped from Independence Day...but then Independence Day was ripped from War of the Worlds. In other words, typical sci-fi, good vs. evil storyline. Good, solid and works well for the blockbuster film. The human character-development in this film actually helps in the audience connecting with the CGI characters (Transformers). The simple storyline of a boy and his first car (Bumblebee) is quite endearing. After all, the Autobots of old weren't just the good guys because they fought the bad guys they were good because they liked the people they protected and cared for them and in return the humans were grateful and help them. <br/><br/>Over all if you're 13 and up you are going to want to see this movie. If you're a 30 something kid who wants to relive the glory days of your youth in the 1980's (the best decade ever to be a kid) then get in line and see this movie."

"darktrainfilms","9","1","3","7 July 2007"," Transformed with reason and nice...but still flawed....SPOILER ALERT
","So...twenty years in the making. Sort of.<br/><br/>So, let me begin about the likes and dislikes of a movie I have been hoping to make myself, to be perfectly honest, but alas, i don't have the clout at this point in my career. LOL<br/><br/>Who cares about the plot? You want a detailed plot, look up other reviews. Good robots VS bad robots on Earth. <br/><br/>Enough said.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film. I had VERY low expectations, and came out happy. <br/><br/>I detected a very Speilbergian scent on this film. A boy and his first car. Sam buys a yellow 1970's Camaro. It was parked next to a yellow 1970's VW bug, a nod to the Generation One fans. Other nods throughout as well.<br/><br/>Including having Leonard Nimoy in with his voice in the film, but not as any character. As Spock, cause Bumblebee's voice is damaged, so he ""talks"" TV to the kids. Another nice touch is the John Wayne voice at one point, a subtle nod to E.T.<br/><br/>It was nice to see Optimus Prime. Finally! His voice. He's a big truck! Whoo hoo! I had a geek orgasm. <br/><br/>Oh yeah. Mr Bay LOVES to portray the military in a positive light. Sometimes, I felt this was a recruiting film for the Air Force. I was impressed how much the military cooperated with this film. Of course, since the target audience is most likely young males, that makes sense. <br/><br/>Megatron doesn't make an appearance until late in the game, which makes you wonder if his appearance in the obvious sequel, if his look will change.<br/><br/>Ah the robot designs.....<br/><br/>Mathematicians probably saved some of the reality factor. A problem with the old cartoon series was that the robots proportions changed a lot to fit the plot. This was cleverly explained away in this film, with the robots looking like the size of the vehicles they transformed from. For example, Bumblebee changed at one point from a 1970's Camaro to a 2008 concept Camaro. <br/><br/>Purists will bitch that Bumblebee should have been a VW Bug, but people, even if he is a robot, a 1970's VW BUG, or even a modern Bug, would have trouble racing around against a Dodge Charger Cop Car. The octane level is high. So, I understand the desire to get the muscle car for the car chases.<br/><br/>And in the old cartoon, Optimus Prime had a trailer attached that magically disappeared when he went to robot mode. Understandibly, his Peterbilt truck in this film did not have a trailer. Problem solved.<br/><br/>Who knows? They might have Bumblebee VW Bug be in the 2010 concept, depending on how soon they scrape up the coin for the sequel.<br/><br/>OK..so anyway..the robot designs. <br/><br/>They were a little too busy. Optimus was pretty much the guy we know and love. Yay. Except for his face shield! He had a mouth...no...he has to have that cool face shield, and he does get it during on of the action scenes. <br/><br/>Soundwave....er...whatever his name was, a small GPX CD boombox. He looked like an outcast from the Star Wars kiddie robot fare. No accident, since ILM was the only FX company with enough Macintosh Computers on hand to make this movie work. But he was my least favorite robot. He sounded like the buzz droids from Episode three, for the most part as well. Ugh.<br/><br/>The rest of the Autobots, looked a little too, well BUSY. They could have made their faces more human like the cartoon. I mean, if they feel pain, go ahead and give them human features. Square jawed. Anyway....<br/><br/>The action is pretty up there. i am glad they didn't always pull away from the the transformation sequences. They were pretty cool. <br/><br/>On the other hand, the Prime VS Megatron fight was pretty clipped. At point, Prime utters his famous ""One Shall Stand...One Shall fall line...."" Just like in the 80's film. <br/><br/>But the shot was on the kid and not Prime facing Megatron! I had a hard time believing this....but then I thought about it. Maybe they spent all the effects budget by then, and couldn't afford anymore shots. These FX movies are tedious to make.<br/><br/>The important thing to remember though is that the back story from the cartoon makes cameo appearances. I feel they tried to make the film stand on its own. There is not a TV series worth of history going into the the drama of these guys. <br/><br/>The other main gripe is Megatron's look. I know, having him change in to a big gun for Starscream to use is silly, but his look supposedly was inspired by the Decepticon Logo. Well, he looked, like yet again, a Star Wars baddie recycled for this. He is probably my biggest disappointment and his voice. <br/><br/>So what if Frank Welker has aged. So has Peter Cullen! Frank Welker had the character for years. A bad call on Mr. Bay's part. He probably would have been cheaper than Hugo Weaving, who is still good. Anwyway, my gripes aside. Megatron was still very mean.<br/><br/>The action you can decide for yourself. I thought it was hyper active at some points very hard to keep up with. Just as I said on SpiderMan 2 and 3.<br/><br/>Slow down!<br/><br/>Overall, popcorn munchin fun."
"sullibrandon","8","1","3","7 July 2007"," What plot? CGI and Action Carries It All
","Remember about 11 years ago, when some giant flying saucers hovered over Earth, people in computer labs intercepted signals, and a few protagonists around the globe slowly marched toward their role in saving the Earth, with plenty of involvement from the military along the way? Transformers, not surprisingly, nearly duplicates this plot. To call it an homage to Independence Day maybe be giving director Michael Bay too much credit, but in any case it doesn't really matter. I would call Transformers more exciting, more visceral, and ten times more pulse pounding than the patriotic Earth against aliens film of 11 years ago. True, it does lack in coherent plot and character development, but all that will be completely forgotten once you see these titanium titans clash.<br/><br/>Shia LeBeouf, as always competently playing a young affable teenager, plays Sam Witwicky, a high schooler who has a crush and purchases a car to impress her. Little does he know his car is actually an Autobot, the good guy half of a race of biogenic aliens, on Earth to investigate if something called the Cube is there, a super-powerful object that could enable the Decepticons, the bad guy half, to destroy all life on Earth and create their own robotic planet. Several subplots abound, including a middle Eastern one with a young general played by Josh Duhamel and a Pentagon/Washington one with the secretary of Defense played by Jon Voight (good, of course, but not very memorable).<br/><br/>Oh, Jon Voight could have easily given a full-out performance, but he's not going to kid himself. It's not about him. It's about the bombastically bad-ass battling bots. The crashing metal and strangely modulated towering voices. The leaning forward in your seat to catch every detail during the fantastic battle scenes, which, had they been done wrong, would have made the movie a complete flop. Fortunately for all of us, the effects do not disappoint in any way. I got exactly everything I was expecting, and then some. The effects and action are perfectly entertaining and serve up a healthy platter of adrenaline-pumping, pulse-pounding, teeth-clenching robot butt-kicking. The final battle scene is so mind-blowing and perfect in its execution that the robots almost seem graceful as they smash and crash all over the place. This isn't art, it's entertainment, and it's wonderfully done entertainment from the sometimes overly-criticized Michael Bay.<br/><br/>I'll admit, when I first saw the trailer, I was very excited, but then I saw Bay's name plastered across the movie screen. I was like, ""Crap. He directed the Island, didn't he? CRAP. Armageddon. Oh sh--. Pearl Harbor. Bad Boys II. Bad boys. The Rock.I'm going to hate this movie, aren't I?"" Coming out of the theater, though, I realized there really wasn't anyone else who could have created a spectacle of this magnitude. Bay never lets anything else but the robots take center stage, and boy what a chaos-ridden magnificent stage it turns out to be. A conglomeration of product placement and sheer heavy metal, it's a wonder anything here manages to shine through. Voight, the pathetic script, the non-existent plot, all of them pale in comparison with the towering transformers, but of all people, LeBoeuf manages to make the biggest impression, emerging straight out of backwater, mediocre sci-fi action pics like I,Robot and Constantine to come straight into the public eye with this sure-fire massive moneymaker, bringing an incredibly personal and easygoing element to this otherwise jam-packed roller-coaster ride of a movie. If anybody but LeBoeuf had been in the main role, the entire thing would have felt like a impersonal spectacle designed solely to make money out of a toy franchise. Sure, it's all those things and more, but in a world of crashing metal and falling debris it's always good to have a character you can relate to and laugh with, and LeBoeuf pulls off that character effortlessly.<br/><br/>I'm not going to mince any words on trying to explain the plot further or pretending like there's anything more to this movie than what I've already talked about. After watching this movie I knew two things. 1. Giant Battling Robots are the Coolest Thing Ever. 2. For some reason I really wanted a GMC truck and some Mountain Dew. (Can you believe that at one point a Mountain Dew machine transforms into a Decepticon?) Though the product placement may get out of control sometimes, it didn't really bother me, and what do you expect in a movie that features talking cars? No car label at all? Give me a break.<br/><br/>Transformers was advertised as nothing more than a jet-fueled, action-propelled roller-coaster, and it delivers in every way. It reminded me a little bit of Alien Vs. Predator, which came out a couple of years ago, but made the mistake of setting the epic confrontation between the two alien races a few thousand feet underneath the arctic, with about three total confrontations between the aliens and the predators. Transformers isn't afraid to go rampaging in broad daylight, obliterating much of downtown LA. It also beats out its similar predecessor, Independence Day, in that it doesn't waste too much screen-time trying to develop the paper-thin personalities of numerous unimportant small characters. (ID had about six or seven of those, fifteen if you count the whole cast.) Most of the action thankfully centers around LeBoeuf and the Pentagon, never distracting too much from the film's central theme: Transformers. Heck, Transformers may even be the central summer flick of 2007. It's that epic, that good, and that satisfying. Now let's all sit down, and wait patiently for Transformers 2, because the film leaves it wide open and nearly begging for a sequel. Thank goodness."
"youbigbluemonkey","8","1","3","7 July 2007"," Tranformed a little to much for my taste
","Well like many i was expecting this to bomb but was more than pleasantly surprised to be proved wrong. From the beginning the voice-over by Prime sent shivers down my spine bringing all that i loved about transformers flooding back.<br/><br/>The story moves at a fair pace and the action is slick and tight with hardly a moment wasted. The balance between having to explain whats going on and on screen advancement is smooth and flawless.<br/><br/>My only and biggest complaint which has been covered is the lack of character from the robots. Their generic look makes it hard to identify with any of them and in fight sequences is so easy to loose track of whos who. Only Prime retains any semblance of what he looked like in the cartoons. I wasn't expecting and would never want a straight copy to CGI of what they had looked like, but im sure they could have given them at least a passing resembelance to their robot form. As for the veichle mode it hardly matters that bumblebee isn't a VW, its the robot form we most associate with. My own thought is that the film wanted to show off its CGI and made them far more robot like with thousands of moving part and a sharp edgy look. but by doing so they took away their character, it would be like taking batmans bat suit away and leaving him with pointy ears. Every hero and villain needs a recognisable identity if the audience is to show any connection with them. <br/><br/>That aside its a great popcorn film and has you hooked on whats gonna happen next. Defo one to see"
"roknrollchik","7","1","3","7 July 2007"," AWESOME action movie and true enough to the cartoon
","I actually loved this movie, and have seen it twice in the past four days. I understand why some people were disappointed, because the story between Sam and Mikaela was quite cheesy and trite, and sometimes it seemed like they delved a little bit too much into the comedy aspect to really be true to the Transformers cartoon. But, the graphics and special effects were absolutely amazing. I'm still not convinced the transformers weren't real! And the action sequences were awesome, too. Yeah, they changed the vehicles around, and only touched on many important aspects of the cartoon...but you have to expect stuff like that from a blockbuster movie version of the show. No, it will never truly be Transformers...but it was still an amazing movie. And when lines like, ""Freedom is the right of all sentiant beings,"" or ""Autobots, roll out!"" come on, you feel like you are watching the original. And nobody can deny that it was absolutely insane when Megatron rips Jazz in half. I think everyone in the theater got shivers."

","I loved Transformers. It was an awesome movie, the music was amazing, and it wasn't all action, there was some of the love interest, and some comedy that i loved. It really was balanced out. I personally was a bit worried about watching it even though i heard it was really good; it was all my guy friends that told me that. So i was concerned that me, being a girl it would be just action-full and somewhat boring. Just a lot of blowing up or objects, and fight scenes. But no, it was really balanced and i think a lot of girls will love it, and not just geeky girls like me :]] my grandma even loved it. So i recommend the movie to anybody, females, males, young and old :]]"
"livingdead916","8","1","3","7 July 2007"," An excellent action film despite a weak story
","OK, so let's be honest here. Was anyone really going to see Transformers for the story? Of course not! If you were than you didn't know what you were going to see. <br/><br/>But despite a cheese factor through the roof, a mismatch of throw-away subplots that didn't quite fit and obvious plot holes such as about five characters being randomly forgotten about towards the end, the movie was never-the-less spectacular. It wasn't about the story. It was about the Transformers, the action, the explosions, and the entertainment. The CGI was beautiful, seamless, very well integrated and generally a pleasure to watch. The whole movie was nothing but eye candy. As for the entertainment, the movie felt like a really fun roller coaster and the humor and obvious cheese factor counter-balanced the action and chaos to keep it from becoming too dark. <br/><br/>But back to the movie being about the transformers, one of my real complaints is that the transformers didn't have enough development. The movie focused too much on the humans and not enough on the transformers. We don't care about the humans so much, we care about the transformers, that's what it's about, they're the one's who take up the screen, make things interesting. But the movie did leave openings for a sequel so maybe we'll see more character development for the transformers in the second one.<br/><br/>My other complaint is... What the hell was up with the racist crap? Did anyone else notice that they went out of their way to ghettofy Jazz, make him up to supposedly be black, and then he was the only autobot to actually get killed? Shame on Michal Bay! I was willing to over-look all the stereotypes, the Mexican guy at the beginning who refuses to speak English, the middle class family who's dad doesn't want anyone to walk on his lawn (And is the family of the main character) the computer hackers cousin busting through the glass door and getting tackled by the police, but Jazz getting ripped in two did it in. The movie's got racist issues. (By the way... I'm white... And I'm saying this...)<br/><br/>Despite all the crap I've said. I give it 8 stars. Why? Because of what I said to begin with. It's not about the story, screw the story. It's about the transformers, the explosions and the action... And as far as all that goes... 10 stars!"

","This movie was not a cinematic classic or an award winner but it was a great movie experience. If you grew up loving transformers you will get goosebumps when you first see and hear Optimus Prime. Yes, there was some cheesiness but its a movie based on toys!! This movie was not perfect but it was worth the money which I wouldn't say about many movies considering the cost of tickets now. Seeing it on the big screen definitely made a difference. Tons of great action, some cheesy humor, a surprisingly decent storyline(I was expecting a terrible storyline) and a dream come true for me since I was about 8. Of course the best part of this movie, Peter Cullen, the original voice of Optimus Prime. So great. I loved this movie."
"daveygandthekeyboard","7","1","3","7 July 2007"," This is a wet dream for anyone of my generation
","Transformers is about a group of robots with the ability to transform into automobiles and various other mechanical things, who come to earth to find the Allspark, the source of power and creation on their world, which was long since decimated by war. This is a wet dream for anyone of my generation, as the cartoon and toys were what I grew up with. But for me (as I was pretty much strictly a Looney Tunes viewer) Transformers was always on the fringe of what I knew. That does not mean that this movie is any less fun. When they make a movie like this, it seems like there are really only two directions to go: ham it up, or take the ""Batman"" route and make it as serious as possible. This one did choose to ham it up and I don't think it was the wrong decision. It is still a very action packed sci-fi fan's movie. Transformers is great propaganda for joining the army, much like the TV show ""24"" makes being a counter terrorist agent seem cool. I enjoyed it anyway. It is super violent, but most of that violence is robot-on-robot in a hyper blown cartoon-ish sort of way. I was definitely struck by how it made being in the military look so cool, with all of its weapons and toys and definitely a lot of respect shown to all of its men and women. One complaint: it is a little hard to see what's going on in some of the action sequences. It is very fast and all CGI. The sound is booming and very effective, but the actual visuals don't always cut it. The plot (as if anyone cares) does the job of bringing the Transformers into this century, with our present world conflicts, and for the most part it works. Any general cheesiness in the dialogue or situations, for me, was easily forgiven by the fact that, well, it's from an '80s cartoon and toy. Good movie!"

","Yesterday I went and watched a movie called Transformers at Parramatta cinemas Greater Union. Transformers was an awesome and more of a action and a more of a broader movie to my perspectives of the movie. As I watched the movie I thought to myself what an astonishing and an amazing movie it was. There were many scenes that were extraordinary that happened unexpectedly. The plot was not bad but the characters were funny(some) The setting was also great matching the action in the movie.In my own opinion if your wanting to watch a movie with great action to watch in cinemas like reading cinemas(if its available there) than i think you came to watch the right movie thats going to overtake your thoughts about other movies you've liked. Watch it! You'll like it!"
"Jack_Acid","8","1","3","6 July 2007"," Not a perfect adaption, but much better than expected
","As many fans who have posted here, I was a huge Transformers as a kid...I had many of the toys, saw the 80s animated film in the theater and have followed the more recent animated ""Energon"" series.<br/><br/>While I was disappointed by the fact that there were only a handful of Transformers and some of the character models (I've never preferred Prime with a moving mouth), this movie exceeded my expectations. And mind you, leading up to this film, those expectations were very low. First off, these types of old toy/comic/cartoon revival films rarely pan out well (remember Masters of the Universe? What a rape job...I would KILL for an updated, good adaption of He-Man!); the other detriment is that it's a Michael Bay film, whom I've never been impressed with. But he surprised me here.<br/><br/>I think Spielberg's role helped out in droves here to temper Bay's action-lust style. Granted, the action doesn't stop for the entire film, but what downtime does exist is filled with good (and much unexpected) humor without degrading the ""coolness"" of the Transformers. It even had decent touches of drama and sentiment. In essence, the plot was true to the original series - which was never overwhelmingly original - but works fine for the sake of this film. In fact, there was some good layering to the background story and how the original discovery of the Transformer's existence shaped modern technology. Of course there are some over the top elements to the plot, but how could anyone expect any different? If you enjoy what you're seeing, let it roll and that was true for me.<br/><br/>I think most people (especially casual fans or non-fans) will walk away from this at least appreciating it as a great action film with spellbinding effects. No sense in giving detail here, but this is a big screen film for sure. Despite how long it takes to actually see the majority of the Transformers, there is good suspense and buildup to their unveiling (especially Prime). And after they have all arrived, we see PLENTY of them.<br/><br/>Despite the film's length, it never seemed to drag on. I'd love to see future installments take us to different planets and have Megatron be revived as Galvatron. A power struggle between Megatron/Galavtron and Starscream would also be a nice twist and ode to the old premise of the Transformers' chemistry with one another. And hey wait, add Unicron to the wish list! What's more threatening than a Transformer that devours planets?<br/><br/>I think this is a great film for any action/effects fan, and while I'm sure some Transformers fans might disapprove of this chapter, it's a must-see just to know either way. I for one, was satisfied.<br/><br/>What's next for Hollywood and Hasbro? My guess would be ""Yo Joe!"""

","SYNOPSIS: Sam Witwicky (Shia Labeouf) and his crush, Mikaela (Megan Fox) find themselves caught in the midst of a security crisis involving shape shifting androids. Based on the popular toy line. PROS: The biggest pro of this movie are the Transformers themselves. Designed by ILM, these robots go beyond the typical sci-fi cinema eye-candy and become convincing creations that are up there with 'Pirates' Davy Jones as some of the best CGI creations ever to grace the silver screen. Shia Labeouf also does an excellent job. The whole movie rests on his shoulders, and he makes it work. Also great is the fact that this film never takes itself too seriously. Director Michael Bay and Co. understand the humor in the story, and thus produce some great laughs. CONS: My biggest problem with this movie is the fact that it was shot in a gritty, hand-held-camera style that doesn;t fit the story. Instead of adding extra intensity, it just make the viewer dizzy. Also, there are a few moments of Michael Bay excess, some unintentionally hilarious lines, and some annoyingly blatant product placements. Overall, Transformers is a big, brassy blast that is best viewed on the big screen."
"crphillips03","7","1","3","6 July 2007"," A Great Movie with one HUGE drawback for me
","I have to say that this movie really started off strong and I thought that it kept up the intensity the whole way. This is really and 8 out of 10 for me but it had to lose at least one point for a big drawback in my opinion. Optimus Prime does NOT have a mouth. He has a shield over his mouth. Every poster showed him the right way, but them come movie time he has an exposed mouth and the shield only covers it when he is fighting. Are you kidding me, this may be really minor to some people but Optimus is my favorite character and he has been since I was a kid (mainly because of his look). It's like Michael Bay said ""I believe that people can suspend reality enough to believe that cars and equipment can turn into robots, but it's a little far fetched to believe that one could talk without a mouth"". UGH. He doesn't have a mouth plain and simple and for whatever reason that obviously has really gotten on my nerves. Other than that it had great Transformer action, which is all I was looking for. So at least something was done right."
"tyguyhunt007","6","1","3","6 July 2007"," Different Director=Better Movie
","I saw Transformers the other night and even though I wasn't disappointed, my expectations weren't exceeded. <br/><br/>First off, this is a very cheesy movie. However, I can understand this. If you are going to see a movie about fighting robots who transform into vehicles, you have to be able to expect a cheesy aspect to the film. I even thought that some of the cheesiness was funny and was also good addition that brought a good sense of humor to the movie. <br/><br/>However, the real downfall of the movie is the directing. I mean the casting was good, the CG was good, the script was alright, and the everything else was pretty decent. However, when it came to Michael Bay, I was disappointed, just like I am when I see most of his movies. I think he has potential, but he is still young and has to discover more of his talent. Really, that is the only complaint I have about the movie. <br/><br/>Transformers was one of the better movies I have seen this summer (unfortunately thats not saying much) and I will probably buy it on DVD. However, Michael Bay took the my rating down to a 6.5 out of 10. Hopefully Transformers 2 will be better."
"Jayteasee","8","1","3","5 July 2007"," Mostly something really good meets the eye!
","I'm fresh from the cinema after the Transformers, and mind you, I'm one of the fan boys that hoped to see the traditional forms, Optimus with the gray trailer and so on... And I must admit that I was somewhat disappointed at an early point to find out it wasn't to be.<br/><br/>I didn't like seeing a remotely humanoid robot with Optimus Prime's head... and I wasn't too thrilled to find out Megatron was once again something thrown together and someone said ""This is Megatron""... the only reference to him being Megatron was that someone called him that - which was the case with the rest of the characters. How come Optimus Prime is the only one you can always recognize, no matter what the storyline is? Well, I haven't really bothered with the cartoons after the legendary Generation 1, which spawned, what, nearly 400 characters (of which I remember 300 - 350 depending on the day). Having been born in 1979 and being 27 at the time of writing this must have something to do with it.<br/><br/>But live action Transformers? I wouldn't miss this for the world! Alright, so Optimus Prime is only remotely recognizable and the other characters even less so... but maybe... maybe the infamous Michael Bay could hit instead of missing.<br/><br/>Now I've seen the movie, and I must say... no bullseye, but quite near the center of the point blank anyway.<br/><br/>It took them a little too long to get into the damn point. For me a highlight is meeting the Autobots in person. After that, the movie soared, but not without turbulence. The movie captured the atmosphere of huger robots beating the nuts and bolts out of each other above your head. Definitely a place you DON'T want to be in.<br/><br/>This was done well, but the new design of the robots didn't work in favor of the view, unfortunately. The shape and movement of the robots was a little too erratic, and it was difficult to see what was going on in the fighting scene. Just polygons flying back and forth. Not good.<br/><br/>Then there's the AllSpark. Whatever happened to Matrix? They could've kept the name Matrix. The concept of the Matrix has changed in the different story lines... from a physical object to intangible something. AllSpark could well have been called the Matrix. That's okay, the AllSpark worked very well, at any rate.<br/><br/>As I said above, it took them to get to the point, but when they did... maaaaaan. One thing that caused chills to go through this little fan boy was hearing Peter Cullen's voice. The true voice of Optimus Prime. I was gleeing when Optimus Prime introduced himself the first time. I couldn't help whispering: ""Good to see you, old buddy."" Optimus Prime is Optimus Prime, and Peter Cullen does have a lot to do with that. Optimus didn't act out of character, but we get to see that even he is just human... well, you get the point...<br/><br/>But when things get tough, Optimus Prime shows his true self again... that's exactly the Optimus Prime us little fan boys want to see.<br/><br/>Yeah, I'm talking like Optimus Prime is the Transformers... well, he and Megatron. Fortunately that part worked out as well.<br/><br/>Despite the downfalls of the movie - and some of the more adult humor they put in, I didn't like that - I was thoroughly entertained, and I felt I had been served at least a decent Transformers movie. Despite the looks of the robots, this thing worked! Very good!"
"FableDuck","8","1","3","5 July 2007"," Masterful revival of a classic series
","Transformers! Ah, the nostalgic robot fantasy of our childhood where vehicles morph into fighting robots. The endless battles between the Autobots and the Decepticons. The classic duels between Optimus Prime and Megatron. Now, the series is revived as a movie under the director-ship of Michael Bay.<br/><br/>And what a movie! A true summer blockbuster in every sense of the word. The best summer movie by a mile this year. I was left often on the edge of my seat. I caught it at The Grand Cathay in The Cathay Cineplex, in digital format. The picture quality was superb. All the robots and fights scenes were rendered beautifully.<br/><br/>The action is gripping and intense. The transformations from vehicles to robots and back again are seamless and classy. The fight scenes pack power and panache. The plot is acceptable, though there are a few gaps here and there, which is understandable. The history of the two rival factions are adequately explained, though not in much detail.<br/><br/>What surprised me was the wittiness and humour. There were many witty lines, (including some from the Autobots!), and hilarious situations, often causing the entire cinema to break out in fits of laughter. These scenes served to break up the action and dramatics, and were well-inserted.<br/><br/>Of course, there's the necessary love story and the resident hot babe, ala Megan Fox. She does the job well as Mikaela Banes, but she's mostly there because of her features. Shia Lebeouf does a reasonable job as Sam, while Jon Voight, Josh Duhamel, Rachael Taylor, and John Turturro did admirably as the Secretary of Defense, Sergeant Lennox, Maggie Madsen and Agent Simmons, respectively.<br/><br/>Will there be a Transformers 2?

","All in all, Transformers is a really really good movie (stopping short of saying great). The action was really good and the CG was incredible. The reason I gave it a 7 was for two reasons. I really didn't like Sam Whitwicky in this movie. I felt like he was a spoiled little brat of a kid, whose ""witty"" dialog was quite frankly marginally written at best. Secondly, I felt like the writers tried a little too hard with the ""humor"" aspect. The whole ""finding the glasses"" scene took WAY too long, and was a little far fetched considering every step the Autobots make creates a loud boom sound. Sure it may not have been as ""funny"" but they should've stayed in their alternate mode to make it slightly more feasible that the parents (let alone the rest of the neighborhood) wouldn't have noticed giant robots outside their house.<br/><br/>Again, though, a lot of fun, good action and a great movie that I can watch again and again. Hopefully next time I won't have to watch it with the stupid 5 year old twins sitting in front of me beating each other up and acting like stupid 5 year olds. WATCH THE MOVIE KIDS!"

","First of all, let me say that all in all: I liked this movie. However, I was hoping it would link in a bit better with the original: The characters were updated for this movie - that is OK, and expected. But some were SO updated, you could not quite recognize them from the original TV show. Especially the Decepticons were a bit difficult to keep apart, as they were quite similar when transformed into robots.<br/><br/>The voices were not kept close enough to the original. Megatron and Starscream had very distinctive voices in the TV series, but they were completely different in the movie. Kudos for keeping Optimus Primes voice like the original.<br/><br/>Optimus Prime was wise and tactful in the TV series, but in the movie he at times are quite clumsy - for instance in the scene in Sams back garden. I found that rather disrespectful...<br/><br/>Finally I was waiting the whole movie for Megatron to transform into the mighty gun - but he never did! All in all - this was always going to be a movie for the old Transformers fans of the 80-ies. It was never going to be realistic, so why strive to make it more realistic than the original? I wanted to see old Transformers revived. I did not want to see what the Transformers would look like if they were invented today...<br/><br/>Still a good movie, though..."

Well lucky for me and the star the character actually fit his quirkiness to a tea. I can't say the same for the female interest of the film, who appeared much to old and sophisticated for this supposed High School geek. Of course the CGI on the autobots and decepticons was fantastic but some of the fight screens went by so fast you couldn't really see what was going on. I am also glad the movie didn't take itself too seriously. There's a lot of humor and it makes for a better movie because come on who would take this plot seriously. That's why I was so disappointed in the final battle sequences when all of a sudden everything was so serious and well dull because of it. But up until the end it's great popcorn fun 8/10."
"Dragonsouls","8","1","3","4 July 2007"," Choppy and Sloppy at times, but setting standards.
","Action in this film could be very claustrophobic. But there were some scenes that blew my mind as well. I usually don't get headaches during films, and I love loud stuff, but only Black Hawk Down gives me a worse headache. The action does not let up. Worth going deaf, I admit that. The CGI lighting effects are awesome, the CGI blending in with real automobiles and aircraft is standard setting. Fake one minute, real the next, and that equals realistic robots! <br/><br/>The role played by Shia Lebouf was really funny. He could be the next Tom Hanks. He is going to be a big star. Love the role by John Turturro. I was really angered and annoyed by him. Voight needs to retire and make up with Angelina, and cameos by Anthony Anderson and Bernie added humor. Lots of humor in this film, surprised, I was hoping for more darkness. R rating and it would be the best film of all time."
"coolkev99","7","1","3","4 July 2007"," G1 fan review
","This film is easy to nit-pick. While overall I enjoyed it, I fail understand why some little things were left in the film because they almost ruined the entire movie. <br/><br/>For instance:<br/><br/>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ POSSIBLE SPOILERS! @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@<br/><br/>-Overly ""hip"" autobots (they are aliens for crying out loud) -Overly 'cute' frenzy -camera zoomed in far too close in battles/fights -Anti-climactic megatron/optimus fight -Bumblebee peeing and other low brow humor -Shoddy dialog -Various plot holes and inconsistencies<br/><br/>I mean, it was high on action, but felt empty. It was just all a little ho-hum. This film will never be taken seriously which is why some hard core G1 fans are angry. I can understand that completely. Despite all this I still liked it better than many other action movies I've seen and overall it was enjoyable.<br/><br/>7/10"
"quinnwizard","9","1","3","4 July 2007"," So awesome....well, that says it
","I, like many of you, grew up with Optimus Prime and the gang. They helped shape my view of robots when I was a kid (that and Robocop), so when I heard they were coming out with a movie using today's technology, I eagerly marked the date on my calender and passed the days.<br/><br/>This movie KICKS A**. I have rarely left a theater with the feelings and emotions that Transformers left. This movie was so good and it was so easy to get caught up in, that when I left the movie, I actually thought I would see Optimus in the parking lot.<br/><br/>Anyway, no bad reviews on this one from my end, just awesome and anyone from 12 to 60 will like this. I never give a 10 out of 10 unless I am still sitting in my seat at the theater even after everyone else has left. The graphics are amazing, and as another commenter stated, it seemed like the actors were really interacting with these robots, that is how well the movie was filmed, edited, and produced.<br/><br/>Later Tater"
"CarpalTunnel","8","1","3","4 July 2007"," The 4th of July's biggest bang!
","Posted by MrCarpalTunnel<br/><br/>July 4th, 2007 <br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong; I remember the Transformers. I also remember the Go-Bots and Weebulls. However I just didn't think I would ever type these words: This Movie Was Awesome. In a Summer filled with sequels and unoriginal plots, I wasn't expecting much from this outing about kids toys on the big-screen. Michael Bay has made me rethink my first-impression pejudice.<br/><br/>The film is right up there with Independence Day. You remember the Will Smith sci-fi spectacular? Both films are equally as entertaining and pretty similar. Both are about the impending doom coming to Earth. Both have the Government hiding a secret. Both took a mediocre star (Will Smith) and changed the way we perceive him (Shia LaBeouf). Without ruining any of the film; it's pretty much your Doomsday Vehicle for Summer. With one exception: It's FUN! The Cars, the Bots, and the sets are amazing to look at. Each left me wanting another huge chase or battle to erupt. The scale at which the film takes place is just worth the ticket price.<br/><br/>If you are into the Transformers (kids or adults) I think you will feel that this movie has treated the characters on a grand-scale. However if your looking for true action Die Hard 4 is still showing. However I have to say this: This movie was far more entertaining and Optimus Prime never told Megatron ""Yippie Kay Yae Mother!""<br/><br/>If you see one Transformer film this Summer make sure this is it. However I hear John Travolta gives the Auto-Bots a run for their money.<br/><br/>www.xblradio.com<br/><br/>Don't miss our upcoming KID PIX on Transformers the Game for the 360!"
"dolfan4ever13","9","1","3","4 July 2007"," Optimus Prime is still a favorite to humans!
","OK, I love the movie, outright. The only thing is Michael Bay, maybe they could have gotten someone else to direct that was better. He directs in the way that he directed Armageddon, and Pearl Harbor. The close up's of the transformations made it a little hard to tell how they were transforming. And the lack of Starcream being more involved in the movie was a let down; however minor. I wish they would have used the the transformations sounds from the cartoon more in this movie; although, I did hear it every once and a while. It would have been great to hear Optimus transform with the original sound from the cartoon. I love that they brought Peter Weller back from the cartoon series to do Optimus Primes voice, anything else would have been a let down, and would have brought the score way down. Other than that, good acting, great special effects. The only question is to ask. Who is going to be the transformers on the sequel? I'm thinking devastator (Constructicons). Everyone knows Soundwave will be in the next one, and starscream. And Kup will be too, you gotta have an old timer to goto when you don't have the answer, that's the way it works in real life. Oh yeah, far fetched, but maybe not, Unicron. But he may be in the third one. And the director may go as far to put a triple changer in for the first time. Anyways, enjoy the movie, it's a must to go watch on the big screen. <br/><br/>NOTE: They should have had some of the 80's music from the original movie in this movie."
"stumpmee77","9","1","3","4 July 2007"," Way, way better than the 1986 film!!!!
","I don't even remember most of that piece of drek after my favorite character brought the scrapheap! This is super memorable: I'm going to ask for this video if it's out by Christmas.<br/><br/>First of all I'm going to talk about Prime in this film. Defintantly the good: George Clooney (one of the choices for his voice)? I don't think so! Reason number 1 I wanted to see this film is being a fan gal smitten by Prime's original voice since 84. Thank you Mr. Bay; I was considering boycotting it if they had picked anyone else. Cullen conveys such charm and conviction. Like a few people have said the first moment he meets Sam was one of this movie's most moving scenes. Had to hold back tears. Now the bad: Could live with the new truck design, flames and all but why, why, why the designers have to give him such a butt ugly mouth? I was hoping that Megatron would pummel it and he would've had to hide behind the face mask permanently. <br/><br/>Bumblebee the good: Loved his noble character, the cryptic way he was revealed in the first portion and was totally was enthralled by his devotion to Sam and Mikela, too in a lesser degree. The bad: beautiful as a Camaro--Butt ugly face when he transformed. Yuck! And thank you, Mr. Bay for improving that speech thing near the end, I found his ""problem"" highly annoying in some places as I couldn't hear him clearly.<br/><br/>The remaining Autobots did have more development than I anticipated while the Decepticons save Megatron and the sneaky, vicious Frenzy have no development other than being destructive. I couldn't discern which of them attacked the base. And Starscream just needed to get way more treacherous with Megatron (the later is a monster incarnate in this film); even the one scene where they did interact with each other for me was not enough. In fact it was the thing that irked me the most about this film which makes me give it a 9. Put that in the sequel please, Mr. Bay if you read this, I am begging you.<br/><br/>I found Sam Mikela thing flat-out annoying in its predictably but it was made up by the writers making it integral to the plot and the true chemistry and acting of these principals. And I found Mikela's character way more interesting than providing cheesecake to the males in the audience.<br/><br/>Now last but not least the action--all of it was off the chart but my absolute faves was Prime and (sorry I can't recall the Decipticon's name) fighting on the highway and of course the too brief battle of Prime and Megatron where I heard one of my favorite OP catchphrases: ""It's just you and me, Megatron."" <br/><br/>Mr. Bay could you please bring on the sequel early, expand on all the Decepticons, not have Prime or too many Autobots buying the scrapheap and keep the voice of Prime you've got."
"scatalfano","9","1","3","4 July 2007"," Best Summer Movie so Far
","I thought this was by far the best of the 2007 summer movies so far. The action was great, the acting was surprisingly good and I actually respect Michael Bay as a director now. The few complaints I would have is some of the action is so fast it is hard to keep up with it, but I understand they had to shoot it this way to make the effects work. Also the movie was just a little too long. But this seams to be a Modern trend in action movies(I guess they do not want to cut out expensive effects scenes) So If you were a fan of the cartoon you MUST go see this movie, and even if you weren't it is still well worth your time and money."
"d_mattie","7","1","3","4 July 2007"," Very decent movie however...
","I am a big Transformers fan and have been itching to see this movie for some time. I'm giving this a 7 because, like most fans, have expected the greatest movie ever and I guess it didn't completely get there. It was a very decent movie however I was just hoping it would have included more of a serious angle. A lot of the humorous scenes could have been removed as I didn't want it to turn into a fun teen flick. More character building for Megatron and StarScream would have also been ideal but I realized the movie would have been way too long if they added to much extra. Anyway, again, I think it was a decent movie but hope the next one has more plotting and scheming by the decepticons. Effects were quite cool."
"gbkimberley","9","1","3","4 July 2007"," The Real War of the Worlds
","Back in 2005 Steven Spielberg made War of the Worlds and said at the time ""I want this movie to be the movie of the decade"".<br/><br/>Instead, War of the Worlds 2005 was a total cop out with scenes copied from the original, ridiculous loopholes and vastly understated action sequences. Most especially when the army came up against the machines, which left me feeling flat.<br/><br/>This is definitely not the case with Michael Bays Transformers. It's everything WotW should have been and what a 'Summer Blockbuster' should be in my opinion. <br/><br/>It's full of action, great characters, funny one-liners, awesome special effects, a solid storyline and a well thought out translation to screen.<br/><br/>If I have any gripes about the movie it's that the final battle was a tad confusing at times but that will entail a repeat viewing soon which will be well worth it.<br/><br/>When you go to see it (and this is a must see movie) whatever you do, don't be late getting to your seat because Transformers kicks into high gear from the very first minutes."
"srredfire","7","1","3","2 July 2007"," Transformers, more than meets the eye?
","TRANSFORMERS More than meets the eye? So the release is right around the corner of one of the most anticipated movies of the year. But is the anticipation worth it? A good bunch of us have grown up with Transformers, we know the stories, we know the TV show, the movies, and of course, those kick-ass action figures. Finally after all the years we get a live action full blown Hollywood production of the story. I'd like to write this without giving much away, since it is quite a movie, but I'll start with a summary.<br/><br/>Basically we have the ""cube"" or better know as the ""All Spark"". This cube has the utmost power to the Transformers, which are fighting over it. Two clans of Transformers exist, the Autobots, and the Decepticons. Both of them want the cube, but one side is good, and the other evil, respectively. At some point in time this cube was lost, and both sides go from planet to planet searching for it. Guess where their last place to look is? That's right, Earth. The story has multiple character sets it follows, one being a soldier in the US Army, another being a teenager, a group of a ""signal analysis"" team, and the Secretary of Defense. All of these tie in at one point and all reach conflicts and disaster.<br/><br/>Story = 8/10 Now normally, this story may be a little ""weak"" in terms of normal story telling, but since it has been around and evolved throughout the decades, it is widely accepted and interesting to audiences. It's quite an easy tale to grasp, but greats amount of detail can be placed to it. The overall picture is about the Transformers, but we do get a look into the other character's lives and what they are going through with all of this happening. Some of the story is week in character development, and catches some rather cliché moments, but hold strong to what's going on.<br/><br/>Script/Acting = 4.5/10 Ouch. Some of the lines and dialog in this movie were awful, and a good handful of the acting was either dry or overdone, but with the other characteristics of the film adding to this, the movie stays strong.<br/><br/>Sound = 10/10 Whomever did the sound design and effects for this film deserves a true award. Every single action and nut or bolt had it's own sound, each being unique. I truly enjoyed the sound, and would buy a sound effect archive of just the effects played in the movie, they were fabulous.<br/><br/>Visual Effects = 10/10 These are hands down the best effects I have ever seen. I see A LOT of movies, and as with a lot of the community love them, and this movie by far surpasses everything I've seen before this. The animations and transformations of the bots is flawless, the wreckage and explosions and everything is just jaw-dropping, it was perfect. I don't see how they could have improved anymore than this, seriously. Now I truly believe it took over 32 hours to render one frame. There was only ONE, ONE one second scene where I could tell it was fake, and it was a splash of water near the end of the film. Other than that, it was just beautiful.<br/><br/>Length = 144 minutes.<br/><br/>Yep, almost 2 1/2 hours of pure Transformers, pretty sick, eh? Overall = 8.8/10 No I didn't average this score, but this movie does deliver. It's enjoyable and will want you asking for a little piece more. It was a good time, and is worth seeing.<br/><br/>Oh yeah. And that new Camaro is in it. Nice car indeed."
"madmax_thegamer","7","1","3","2 July 2007"," One long butt kicking commercial!
","First of all let me just say that I am not one of those crazy Transformers fan boys like the Elias character from Kevin Smiths Clerks 2 movie. I am familiar with the Transformers back from my Saturday morning cartoon phase when I was just a lad, but thats about as far as my previous knowledge of them goes. I arrived at this movie expecting a typical Michael Bay summer blockbuster effects driven adventure. I knew it wasn't going to be Oscar worthy material, keeping that in mind, I found myself being rather entertained, and not totally disappointed.<br/><br/>While the movie does hold a typical big budget summer flick running time, there is usually enough going on to hold your attention. Shi Labeouf carries his role well as one of the main human characters, I found myself enjoying everything he did more and more as the film went on. His co-star Megan Fox, while very very easy on the eyes, did not totally come across as well for most of the film. Near the beginning when you first meet her she seemed to me very wooden and stiff, but later farther into the film she seemed to get better and more into the role. The real stars of the film however are the Transformers themselves. The autobots, led by Optimus Prime, and the Decepticons led by Megatron duke it out and flex their metal muscle throughout the film. I also thought the cars were cool to, if not really excessive with the product placement. I think that with the exception of the classic camero, all the other cars they transformed into always had the logo front and center aimed at the camera.<br/><br/>All and all I suppose that there are worse ways to spend two hours of your life. I think some of Michael Bays more adult rated R movies like Bad Boys 2 are better but I did not leave the theater to disappointed. Take it for what it is folks, a big budget summer popcorn flick, it has some bad, groan inducing moments, but it also had some wow that was cool, and hey that was pretty funny moments to! Don't be to critical and just try to have fun, maybe play a game, like count the number of product placements or something!"
"rob-2006","9","1","3","2 July 2007"," Excellent stuff - switch off your brain at the door!
","A bit of background - I grew up in the 80s and had Transformer toys, so I know that they are one of the coolest things ever invented, I mean, robots in disguise, how cool is that? So I saw Transformers last night, partly feeling trepidation in case it was rubbish but also excitement as the trailers looked awesome.<br/><br/>So how was it? It was excellent! After the first scene where you get to see a transformation I knew I'd already got my money's worth! The effects are stunning - definitely a step ahead of what's been done before, and the whole thing is full-on from beginning to end. But it doesn't get old. There are explosions, loads of battles, car chases, explosions, and more explosions! There's even quite a bit of humour! And I may be almost old enough to be her father but Megan Fox is excellent eye candy too! So in short, and as you can tell, I loved this film. Definitely one for the DVD collection."
"Carycomic","10","2","10","4 July 2007"," The Marvel Comics book was never like this!
","That's right, folks. In between the toy line and the Saturday morning cartoons, there was a comic book. Similar to the one inspired by the GI JOE mini-figures, only better.<br/><br/>Well, I never thought a live-action movie adaptation would do the Transformers any justice. But, Steven Spielberg has a habit of proving even the worst critics wrong. And, to quote Jon Voight's character from a certain Disney movie, with Nicholas Cage:<br/><br/>""I've never been so happy to be proved wrong.""<br/><br/>The storyline is pretty simple. Both races of Transformers have come to Earth seeking the All-spark. The mysterious object that gave their planet mechanical life (sort of a Rubix cube version of the pylon from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY).<br/><br/>Scorponok the Decepticon attacks an American military base in the oil sheikdom of Qatar, in order to scan the Internet. When he fails, Frenzy--a Decepticon shaped like a portable radio--takes over aboard Air Force One.<br/><br/>In the meantime, L.A. high school student Sam Witwicky gets a vintage Camaro as a present for improving his grades. And, he and his new girlfriend (sexy tomboy Michaela) find out the Camaro is really Bumblebee of the Autobots! Apparently, as the descendant of a 19th-century Arctic explorer named Archibald Witwicky, Sam is the only one on Earth who might have the co-ordinates to the location of the All-spark...and Decepticon leader Megatron.<br/><br/>It's at this point that the two sub-plots, which kept interweaving throughout the first third of the movie, finally dove-tail. And, in an action-packed way that also pays homage to other sci-fi classics, such as WAR OF THE WORLDS (1953 version), THE ARRIVAL, MEN IN BLACK, and THE TERMINATOR.<br/><br/>How the Good Guys triumph over the Bad Guys is as thrilling as it is poignant. And, the pyrotechnics--both CGI and genuine--are awesome. In short: I enjoyed this film from beginning to end. With the two-and-a-half hour running time elapsing as if it were nothing.<br/><br/>But, then again; when it comes to science fiction, I'm usually pretty easy to please. With Spielberg, in particular, rarely disappointing me (can you say, ""1941?"")."

","My guess is, Transformers will be the movie to beat. Just saw it yesterday and I can't get over it. I went out of the theater with my pulse beating so fast and I was asking for more!I was in high school when I watched the cartoons. I love love Bumble bee and his relationship with Spike so much. Though they used the name Sam, it's OK no harm done. Still, Shai was so right for the part. I saw their relationship unfold before my eyes in the movie and I almost cried! gave me the chills and goosebumps. I felt so much like a high school again, only better! I love the way the story unfolded and all the dialogs were neatly connected with each other. The humor was great, it wasn't corny, it wasn't off, just perfect. Shai was perfect. He has the wit and the humor. Considering it's his first action movie, wow. I must say, GOOD JOB KID! THANK YOU MICHAEL BAY FOR GIVING US ONE HECK OF A MOVIE, IT WAS SO REAL AND SO PERFECTLY MADE, AND SO MUCH MORE.<br/><br/>By the way, for those who said Megatron was NOT a gun, watch it again, he WAS, but only for a brief moment in the final battle with Optimus. But it was just his hands since Starscream wasn't there to pick him up anyway. Optimus stopped him so he transformed back. This might be an introduction of so much more in the next.please let there be a sequel!"

","When I came to the cinema to watch this movie, I honestly didn't have any expectation. I came only looking for a pure entertaining movie. And I know Michael Bay is the right director who can deliver ""pure entertainment"". <br/><br/>Having seen all the Blockbuster movies of the summer (Spiderman 3, POTC :At World End and FF 4 :Rise of the silver surfer), I expect this might be just another brainless action pack CGI flick.<br/><br/>But I was wrong. From the beginning till middle and the end of the movie, I was hanging at the edge of my seat. This movie really blows me away. And for the first time in long time, I've heard spectator applauding for a scene. The last time I've heard it dated back 20 years ago with the movie ""The Untouchables"".<br/><br/>With all the special effects and CGI of the movie nowadays we thinks that we have seen it all. But this movie really set a new standard. The robots look pretty real and smooth. The action scene look quite realistic. <br/><br/>As for the storyline this movie also have a very weak and unrealistic one like the other blockbuster movies. Anyway what do you expect from Michael Bay? An Oscar winning storyline?<br/><br/>There are many funny moments in the movie, which I thinks it's good so we don't get too intense. The lead actor & actress really give their best performance. Not just mediocre one like we've seen in many science fiction movies.<br/><br/>This movie is enjoyable for all ages and also for people who never knew the Transformer franchise.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of the Transformer TV Cartoon Series but this movie makes me want to know the franchise more. A good job well done by Michael Bay."

Finally it seems a movie has come along and delivered on people's expectations, and exceeded them.<br/><br/>Its the action scenes that really stand out, they are hard hitting and visceral, we know Michael Bay loves his action, but here they fit the Transformers perfectly. Lots and lots of things get smashed and destroyed and its exciting. Perhaps more so than any other action film for a very very long time. The CGI in this movie will win them an Academy Award, every scene just reeks of thousands and thousands of dollars spent - and thats a good thing.<br/><br/>The storyline blends in really well, the whole movie is like one long roller-coaster ride and it never slows down. Anyone concerned this is a movie for nerds and geeks who like their geeky toys can rest assured that the movie will transform you within 15-20 minutes in. By the end you WILL be a fan.<br/><br/>I think people will be genuinely surprised by what Michael Bay has done here. For me personally The Rock was an action masterpiece and Transformers is right up there."

This isn't Shakespeare and it sure ain't no kidnapped child/sister whatever drama nor a political thriller. Its robots with lasers, rockets and they burn rubber. <br/><br/>I admit its a bit confusing towards the end, but otherwise its plain fantastic.

"Laibcoms","10","2","10","28 June 2007"," Movie Review
","If you were born and grew during the days when Television Networks showed countless of Transformers series, you will definitely be awed by this new Live-Action Movie. Transformers Live-Action Movie 1 premiered nationwide in the Philippines, and region-wide here in South-East Asia and Australia yesterday, June 28, 2007 Thursday. Almost all of the movie houses have nothing but Transformers showing, and each and every cinema have long lines and seats all booked weeks ahead. Guess what? There are not much kids, the generation who never had the chance to watch the original Transformers cartoons on the TV. Most are adults, working adults.<br/><br/>Here's my review of the first Live-Action Movie of Transformers.<br/><br/>Before you continue reading, there are some SPOILERS here.<br/><br/>As any Transformers fan will expect, we want to see instant action. The first few scenes of the movie is simply that, ""action"". But it is only a ""teaser"" of what's to come in the rest of the movie. I like how they started this movie, a way to keep the movie goers more excited instead of getting bored because we are expecting action already.<br/><br/>Then after that and before the complete action part, is where all the drama and the plot were explained. But once again, to keep everyone from getting bored because we want to see the best action parts like the Megatron vs Optimus Prime, they inserted funny lines and comedy 'actions'. As example, the Autobots team were hiding from Sam Witwicky's (played by Shia LaBeouf) parents, Bumblebee was hiding under the roof of entrance door, then Optimus Prime appeared to be seating on the whole house (I will not mention the other Autobots present). Then there was Bumblebee playing classic songs to reflect Sam's desire for the (leading) girl of the movie Mikaela Banes (played by Megan Fox). Mikaela at one scene, walked to go home alone because Sam's car (Bumblebee) won't start. After a few tries, Sam's car started with the song ""Baby Come Back..."" Mikaela smiled (and was impressed!), of course thanks to Bumblebee it was all his doing (guys, if you are courting a girl, find a Bumblebee car!) Grade: 10/10.<br/><br/>The CG is great, they did it very well. This is the first thing anyone will notice in the movie. Everything was smooth and fluid you will not even think of the Autobots and Decepticons as nothing but CG Animation. From their movements to their fighting scenes, together with the humans on the same scenes, as in ""humans"" with an 's'. Grade: 10/10.<br/><br/>The plot line, as we all know, when something Japanese is adapted by an American group, the story becomes very different. Also, personally, it is only right to create a new storyline. In this live-action movie, the story has similarities with the original cartoons, with the original parts being that they arrived on Planet Earth because the Decepticons wants to turn Earth into a new Cybertron through the use of the ancient technology that created the Transformers. This technology can turn any machine on Earth it comes to close proximity into a Transformers, like for example, a Mountain Dew vending machine turned into a wild Transformer attacking every human (though without a faction yet - ie newly born who is confused and doesn't know why 'it' exists), I'll call this the Mountain Dew Bot. Of course there is Starscream, we all saw him in the trailers, but as usual, Starscream is Megatron's ever unreliable right-hand, but I will not spoil you with the proofs of Starscream's unreliability. Grade: 10/10.<br/><br/>The art and design of the Transformers were a mixture from the different series. Example, Megatron's art and design is ""Galvatron"", not really ""Megatron"". Then Optimus Prime is so colorful, showing us that they took every color Optimus Prime had in the different cartoon series. Bumblebee on the other hand is still yellow colored (tip: watch out every yellow colored car and how the Decepticons will react to it), but in this movie, Bumblebee is of the newest design, not the original Volkswagen Beetle car (tip: there is this scene wherein Bumblebee hit the Volkswagen Beetle car besides him, really hard - what's that? A subliminal message from the producers? Were they supposed to use the Beetle model but Volkswagen don't want to?) And Starscream, the art and design was from the original Japanese Anime, not the American cartoons. Grade: 10/10.<br/><br/>Japanese? Yes, there is another message in the movie wherein Sam said, ""super advanced robots, it's from the Japanese"". Two meanings here, first is that Sam is trying to explain to his new girlfriend Mikaela about the Transformers. Second, is to put an end to the never ending debate about if the Transformers franchise is originally Japanese or American. Well, Transformers IS Japanese. It was only popularized by the American ""version"" (its the same with Power Rangers, it is also Japanese but was popularized by the American adaptation).<br/><br/>Sounds? Very well done. From the BGMs (Background Music), to the sound effects, everything fits in the movie and the scenes. Grade: 10/10.<br/><br/>Each character was also played well by their respective actors. They chose the right actors for the characters, which gave us a very well done action movie of the year.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10 stars.

"sdrivii","7","2","10","27 June 2007"," Entertaining and Refreshing. The reason we go to the Movies.
","All i know about Transformers is that it's a huge toy brand with a mass following that spawned a TV show and a film in the 80s. So, when i first heard that a live action film was going to be made i wasn't excited at all. I don't mean to offend any fans, but neither the toys or the cartoons had any effect on me during my childhood. I always found them ""silly"". However, with the release of trailers i knew Transformers the film was going to be one of the most visually stunning films and that it was aiming to have mass appeal.<br/><br/>The film did not disappoint. It was realistic and original. However, it did leave me wanting more. Firstly, the cast was spectacular. Shia LaBeouf impresses the most out of everyone and the Transformers are great in design and personality. Not once during the film did the visual effects ""lose it"". They were truly flawless.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is a charm. The humor is fantastic and the films story develops well. It's truly a crowd pleaser and i can even see my parents enjoying it. However, as the film progresses and more Transformers are introduced, less character development takes place. Hence, amongst the jaw dropping battle scenes in the second half of the film i felt hardly any emotion towards the Transformers and i kinda got out of touch from the film. Only Optimus Prime and Bumblebee are well fleshed characters that i came to care for. Furthermore, one aspect of the film that annoyed me is casting an Australian with a thick Australian accent in what is essentially an American role and film. To those who have seen the film, they may feel as i do, that her accent was a slight negative factor, too distracting and annoying.<br/><br/>Despite the lack of Transformer character development the film is a spectacular beginning to what i hope will be a spectacular franchise. It was very refreshing to watch after a number of underwhelming and disappointing summer sequels. Unlike those other films, this film had heart and it delivered a strong message that is relevant to us all today. However, lets just hope with sequels that it continues on as well as it has begun. Maybe Spielberg who acted as Executive Producer could take over the directors chair."

However, even when the second time I watched it , I still found it fascinating and amazing.<br/><br/>Here is my suggestion: Just ignore what the critics said because they simply can't feel comfortable if they don't pick on Michael Bay , actually it's their way to prove that they are with insight or not that shallow.... etc. What I mean is, isn't movie made to entertain their audience? If the movie fail to entertain me then why should I give a damn to whatever ""messages"" it would like to deliver?<br/><br/>If you are disappointed about summer movies this year, (such as the pirate movie....I think it is REALLY useful for people who have sleeping problems...)

","Well I saw this movie last night (Australia)--June 29 2007.<br/><br/>It was simply incredible. I salute the director and makers of this film.<br/><br/>Everyone in the cinema really seemed to enjoy the movie and I heard people talking about it afterwards and it was all positive. I attended the movie on it's second day since opening in Australia and every session in the afternoon (and probably during the day too) was totally sold out.<br/><br/>This movie is incredibly funny and definitely added to the overall enjoyment of the film. The story is simple to understand and perfect for this type of movie.<br/><br/>The action was definitely present and there were some truly amazing special effects. (Best SFX you will ever see)<br/><br/>It was great that Michael Bay incorporated the human element in the manner that he did. Too much emphasis on the transformers themselves would have made it more difficult for mainstream movie watchers to relate to them.<br/><br/>In many ways I think that having the human element in this movie allowed the director to introduce mainstream movie watchers to the transformer characters, and then in the second movie that they do, they have a very good launch pad such that there can be more focus between transformer to transformer interaction.<br/><br/>I've been a transformers fan since the very beginning with the 80's animated cartoon and have seen every single episode and movie of the TF. This movie was terrific and definitely has added something special to the TF universe :) Well done to Peter Cullen on his voice for Optimus Prime. He is such an integral part of transformers and his voice shined through in Bay's movie as well.<br/><br/>Rating = 10/10"
"JonMLParker","2","1","4","8 November 2012"," ""The 'dialogue' within Transformers often has the feeling that a chimpanzee might have been involved in the writing process.""
","Michael Bay continues to barrage Hollywood with more 'hummingbird cinema'. Afraid of his audience looking away for even half a second, Bay uses a mix of explosions, CGI and rapid editing to ensure that nobody can take their eyes off the cinema screen.<br/><br/>His total lack of faith in his two leading actors is realised in a nightmare of CGI and explosions which minimise the screen time of LaBeouf and Fox so that even they can not damage the film too badly.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it's Bay's reputation that continues to take a battering on the back of his Transformers series, in fact he continues to take a battering on the back of every film he's ever touched. Seemingly unphased by the constant criticism he receives from industry experts and cinema-goers alike, you begin to wonder if Bay is in fact a robot himself.<br/><br/>Why so many screenwriters are credited with the creation of such drivel I have no idea. The 'dialogue' within Transformers often has the feeling that a chimpanzee might have been involved in the writing process. A thorough insult to the hardworking writers of the film industry.<br/><br/>Millions have been made off the back of this film and millions more will undoubtedly be made until we reach Transformers 162. When will this madness end? Nobody knows.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a movie with real style, substance and a truly gripping plot then you've come to the wrong place. However, if you want to sit down for a couple of hours, switch off and listen to your brain cells die one by one, then this is probably right up your street."
"train1077","2","1","4","13 October 2012"," Only way to describe this is unserious and childish with amazing visuals
","I have just seen the movie and want to tell about my experience. <br/><br/>Visuals effects 10/10 Really really good made. The transformers look and move very very nice. <br/><br/>Sound 4/10 The sound effects of the transformers and general quality is fine, but destroyed by teenage popular wannabe rock-music. It's a bit too much high school musical. Not brutal enough, it made the robots seem like delicate women at a tea party.<br/><br/>Acting 1/10 It is terrible. Megan fox looks great, but then she opens her mouth and every word just makes her look more and more stupid. Shia Lebeuf or how ever it is spelled acts as if his life depends on it. He simply tries too hard, like the young person he is, is he probably trying to show his best only making it awful. The rest of the characters also overact and this is including the transformers. Especially the twin-transformers act like small children, taking the role as the two stupid sidekicks like in a Disney cartoon.<br/><br/>Story 5/10 I am giving it five because it has potential. The movie lacks brutal power. Evil transformers kill and wreck havoc on the world and not ONE drop of blood is in the movie. The childish acting and teenage way the story is told ruins what could have been an insanely good story.<br/><br/>Conclusion. If you like unintelligent romantic teenage ""wannabe action"" films(twilight, captain America etc.) this is right up your alley. If you like a good action movie with a serious attitude, don't watch this."
"tomimt","6","1","4","7 March 2010"," Big, loud and stupid
","I tried to think something sensible to say about Transformers, but came into conclusion, that I really don't have anything else to say, but to say congratulations for the special effects team that worked with the movie.<br/><br/>Michael Bay isn't a subtle director who makes important, world changing movies. He is a man, who helms big, loud, stupid, overly sentimental and far too serious movies and he does it with pride and he does it well. Transformers is the statement for his skill of taking an idea that could turn into a great piece of garbage and churn it into a pretty entertaining movie about extraterrestrial robots, teenagers and the possible annihilation of the human race. He hammers the movie together with a sledge hammer and despite he sometimes fails, like he did with the Island, Bay manages to deliver with the Transformers.<br/><br/>So yeah, that's all I have to say about this."

Oh well, forget any hopes.<br/><br/>Seriously though, there is absolutely no substance whatsoever. I'm not expecting The Godfather, but I'm expecting a film that's entertaining beyond robots fighting and things blowing up. I mean, it tries to pass cheesy jokes and bad references as some sort of charm. And I don't care about Shia LeBeouf or his love interest... who doesn't do anything.

I couldn't work out what this was supposed to be, the script was something out of a kids movie, but the set pieces pulled from a wannabe combat flick.

It was just one massive explosion after another with noting but vague, unhelpful explanations of what was going on. I could care less about the characters! There was very little personality in any of them. <br/><br/>Last of all, because there was no way to tell what was going on, I couldn't feel excited about the battles, or feel relief that Shia LeBeouf saved the day and got the stupid girl. <br/><br/>DON'T LISTEN TO ANYONE THAT SAYS THIS MOVIE IS GOOD.

"fantasyescapist","Null","1","4","19 June 2009"," Could it transform into a film that was much more than meets the eye?
","I don't hate blockbusters, but what I do hate is bad film making, especially ones that use flashy, state-of-the-art CGI to make up for a rubbish script. Transformers is a case of this, I think and that's just one of it's many flaws.<br/><br/>Watching it again (in preparation for the sequel), my opinion has changed a lot from nearly two years ago when I was entertained by it. I had a feeling this was one of those disposable films that I'd see once and never touch it again, and I was right, cause it's bad, and here's why:<br/><br/>Acting: Judging from what I saw, this wanted the robots to play second fiddle to what was mostly a human story. Shame the humans lack interest, cause all I saw wavered shockingly poor to mediocre acting and the most one-dimensional characterisation I've seen in a while, along with cheesy, cringe worthy dialogue.<br/><br/>LaBeouf plays Sam, the main teen high-school boy in this, like deer caught in headlights. This constant panicky expression makes for a more weaker hero. Fox's character is our hero's crush, but she looks around 25 and dresses like a stripper. Her acting is very wooden and self-conscious, but since she's eye candy, she fulfils her purpose of being pretty to look at well, even if she looks nearly a decade older than her co-star. Duhamel and Gibson are bland as the two main soldiers - there's a particularly scene of unconvincing acting from Gibson in Qatar as Scorponok is tunnelling in the sand behind them. Turturro's manic and wacky performance is just unfunny and Voight on autopilot. Taylor ranges from mediocre to unbelievable and Anderson just plays a 'comic relief' stereotypical black man - a lot of the jokes fall flat and his character is annoying and unnecessary.<br/><br/>Much of the only good, noteworthy acting comes from the voice-over acting for the robots. Cullen's gravely, authoritative tone, especially at the very end of the film gave me goosebumps and even made some of the worst and most clichéd lines sound genuine. Harnell's voice too is good.<br/><br/>Cutting out the whole military sub-plots and the hackers would've concentrated the story on Sam and his family and the robots, which would've improved it slightly, but you're still left with that god-awful script.<br/><br/>Plot: Yet another vital flaw - the plot is vague and undeveloped. The narrative is severely lacking and even the basics of it, about a Allspark cube are laughable, yet this is all presented quite seriously. Scenes to be taken seriously are quite unintentionally funny.<br/><br/>So, it's 'plot', if it can be called that, is just a thin narrative that doesn't make much sense, as it hasn't been thoughtfully though from the start. <br/><br/>I was bothered by the lack of a good villain in Megatron - we're only shown a small flashback of his apparent wickedness, but he doesn't come across as a strong enough, feared antagonist. It sure doesn't help that his little dialogue is as silly as they come: 'give me the cube!'.<br/><br/>The origin of the robots could've been shown more in the opening. As a result of limiting what we know about the title characters themselves, there's no emotional investment in them much, and when one Autobot is killed, it doesn't have any impact. The same one-dimensional approach is used for the cardboard cutouts that are the humans.<br/><br/>So, a superficial 'plot' and characters leave me cold. The particular scenes with sentimentality feel shoehorned in and the whole onanism part is so stupid and inappropriate. Add the silly romantic bits and it feels so contrived, I'm surprised that this script was green-lighted.<br/><br/>Cinematography: Bay loves to pan the camera right to left, left to right, 360 degrees around someone, over used slow-mo, insert panning aerial shots and close ups that gradually come closer - very rarely does the camera stay still. Scenes lasting five to ten seconds mostly also have a quick cut editing technique throughout. Ironically enough, these film trailer-like scenes end up in an overlong film, with a self-indulgent tone, especially in big set pieces.<br/><br/>The explosions and general action scenes are unwatchable and tiresome because of this approach. I hate watching a film shot in an ADD type way, especially when ineptly done. Yes, the CGI is photo-real and great, but those computer effects don't deserve a film as badly done as this.<br/><br/>The main seven action scenes don't redeem the film and all share one thing in common - a lack of tension or suspense. That lack of restraint and diligence creates an air of impatience in me. The end climatic part ended on a very weak note.<br/><br/>Overall: Only the CGI for the robots, really good voice acting for Prime and the lovable Bumblebee were it's few good points. Apart from that, the film is brainless, bloated, clichéd and is a tedious experience to endure. Even the humans are horribly written, the action sequences with the robots sound like pots clanging together (which is weird for such large and heavy cybernetic organisms) and are a chore to follow who's beating up who. Stupid panning shots, fast cut editing and bad, cheap jokes makes this one of the worst sci-fi action films I've seen, so far. There's no heart in it - just one long advert for cars, eBay and the Transformers toys. A film made primarily for lads mag reader, since it doesn't have anything to offer apart from visuals.<br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with making a fun blockbuster, but at least get a good story , fully realised characters with normal non-panning pacing before you start principle photography. Kids making up stories while playing with their toys is more entertaining than all 2 hours 15 mins of this and probably more creative."
"yamanin","5","1","4","20 April 2009"," Giant Robots
","It's pretty simple, really; this movie is about giant robots. Not giant robots as a metaphor for the dangers of unfettered technology or the corrupting influence of great power. Just giant robots. They tranform into moving vehicles and fight other giant robots. Some are good, some are bad; there's an explanation for why but it really doesn't matter. Meanwhile, the human characters run around and say stuff; the performances are all pretty good and provide a pleasant bridge to the next scene involving giant robots doing giant robot things. So if you like giant robots, you'll like this movie. If you don't like giant robots, why are you watching it?"
"AshCaton","2","1","4","4 December 2008"," Wrong Time, Wrong Place
","Transformers was always going to be risky; 'transforming' what started as a series of toys and an apparently beloved animated series into a film screams ""iffy!"" in any film buff's ears. Unfortunately, it is a case of wrong time, wrong place for this CGI soaked blunder of a movie. In a world with Jason Bourne, a new, far more brutal Bond and the Dark Knight, Transformers can't help but take itself seriously. In my opinion, this is the wrong choice. After sitting through over an hour of this drivel, I was pleading for some Robocop-esquire satire, but none came. Surprisingly, it was the performances that I most enjoyed. Le Beouf is suitably awkward and bewildered and John Turturro puts in a show stealing performance. Where Transformers falls down is on its metallic heroes. They are truly the worst cinematic creation since the human/alien/basically a naked sloth in Alien: Resurrection. The fact that they talk is a huge mistake, funnily enough it is the little yellow mute one that has the most character. None of the others summon even the smallest smidgen of compassion, and consequently, you couldn't care less when they get crushed by Megatron, a dormant Transformer who, waking up after a century or so's hibernation declares that he IS Megatron. Well thanks for the heads up. If Transformers just had the integrity to abandon it's integrity, realise that actually, yes it is a ridiculous idea for a film and have some fun with it, it could have been much better. Instead it's just boring."

","Michael Bay didn't get it. What's Transformers about? Robots transforming into machines?

The face-off between these two stands at the heart of the series.<br/><br/>They both have henchmen to expand on the universe and there are humans involved to make it more accessible to viewers. Bay however, didn't get that.<br/><br/>In the film it's all about some teenage kid Sam and his all-American new chick mobile which turns out to be a robot. Who has some friends. Who crack jokes. And fight evil robots. Who have a leader as well. And something about a huge cube.

","This movie had more character development than I usually would expect from Hollywood flicks these days and for that my pleasure viewing it was heightened. Though this is to be expected since it's based on a series that has been around for a while. My only main gripes are that the pacing towards the end of the movie seemed to be much too fast compared to the beginning. The vehicles in the movie looked real nice. The CGI was done incredibly well. Character interaction generally seemed more authentic than I was hoping for so that was a plus.<br/><br/>Overall, it's enjoyable and at least worth renting. I suggest if you have a free day with nothing else better to do, pick it up. I give it a 7/10."
"dustinhunter707","8","1","4","29 October 2007"," Pretty awesome!!!
","OK I really liked this film, its a lot of fun that combines action and humor to the maximum level of extreme. Shia Lebeouf does a good job as the neighborhood kid who buys a car that turns out to be an alien robot. The action is really well shot and the graphics are out of this world. The freeway car chase scene and the city battle towards the end of the movie is really amazing and actually looks like its really happening in front of our everyday normal people, its amazing. Overall I give this an 8 out of 10 because the action is unbelievable and the humor is actually quite funny too. I would recommend this to all action fans and to all fans of Michael Bay who enjoyed his other films such as Bad Boys 1 & 2 and The Island. If you love action, see Transformers!!!"
"john_murdoch2002","7","1","4","27 October 2007"," More than meets the Bay standards...
","As anyone who knows me probably knows I am an avid and outspoken detractor of Michael Bay and all of his films. I've found them to be cheap exploitive and manipulative pieces of substandard film-making that appears to have garnered some attention due to his flashy style of directing. However, Transformers became one of the biggest movies of 2007 and, as such, I had to see the movie if only to have a merited opinion on the film. By the time the Autobots descended on Earth in the form of a meteor shower, one bit actor runs by the screen with a camera, yelling to it that it is ""a hundred times better than Armageddon,"" I sat in the theater and wondered to myself if the actor knew how many volumes of honesty he was just speaking.<br/><br/>Transformers not only became the fun and exciting summer movie that I was waiting for all of 2007, but it proved to me that Michael Bay has it in him to make a movie that goes beyond exploitive and sociopathic tendencies, two underlying themes in all of his movies that I couldn't shake to the point where I couldn't enjoy them as passive fun. Here, the bitter angriness against the human race that is evident in all of his previous films has gone and we have a fun slice of juvenile entertainment that it seems that Bay has been waiting to make.<br/><br/>For anyone who grew up watching Transformers every Saturday morning, the plot needs no explanation. Autobot transformers battle Decepticon transformers on earth in a bid to protect humanity. However, this Transformers focuses less on the robotic characters than in the American government, a small band of army soldiers and one hyper-testosteroned yet socially inept teenager and his overly hot love interest, all of which sport some very strong and obvious spray on tans.<br/><br/>Sam Witwicky, played with youthful gusto by Shia LaBeouf, is given his first car, which happened to be a ""robot in disguise"" named Bumblebee, who was sent to protect Sam, who happens to be in possession of a map to find a key element for both sides of the transformers called the allspark. The autobots want to use the allspark to reignite their destroyed world while the decepticons want to use the device to create their own robotic army. Simple plot, not too hard to follow, but, hey, who needs to see existentialist character pieces in a movie about cars that become robots and fight each other? There are very cheesy moments and lines in the film, there are plot contrivances and there are some very over the top performances, but like I said earlier, this isn't a film that is meant to be scrutinized the way that a Scorcese or Bergman film was meant to be. So the best way to evaluate Transformers would be to judge the action and fun level. In both respects, the movie succeeds if only because it abandons the standard sociopathic Bay mentality and instead focuses on the entertainer that he has always strived to be. If I have a complaint with this film, it's that the camera needed to be pulled back more during some of the action sequences to get a better look at what was going on. Bay's style is very in your face, but there are points where I wanted to see more of the Transformer fights and get a chance to enjoy what I was watching.<br/><br/>And before I finish the review here, I have to give credit to the amazing visual effects that this film was able to accomplish. So seamless, on both the big and the small screen, where the effects where interactive machines would all of the sudden transform into the gigantic robots that they were. The very first time a machine transforms into another machine, the effect is so seamless that the movie shows the capabilities that computer effects have come.<br/><br/>Transformers is the fun summer film that hearkens back to a time when the blockbusters were entertaining and free spirited, much like Men in Black, Jurassic Park or The Mask. Not only that, but Michael Bay has also stood up to a very challenging task to me: making a movie that has actually made me excited to see his next film."

","Transformers was a great movie, even though there were some changes made! I think they were necessary changes in order to make it seam real, credible, and believable! If they did not change the way it looked and felt (Optimus Prime, Megatron, Bumblebee, etc.) and if it weren't for the other changes made, it would not have been as good and cool and it would have been too kiddish for the adults and fans of the Transformers Animated Series (including myself) who were kids then but are adults now!! Yes! They would have complained it was too kiddish and it feel or look realistic, credible, and believable! Oppinons are like @#!holes, everyone has one! People are way too critical! It is a movie and there is no perfect movie because there are no perfect people, and people make movies!! I think the movie had a lot of funny moments, it had action (Almost nonstop), the visual affects were GREAT, the voices were great, and the sound affects were great! I went to Best Buy to purchase the movie on the release day and you would think they were given the Tranformers DVDs away free the way people were buying them! It also did extremely well in the theaters! Only a good movie causes this sort of reaction with people, not a movie that is terrible!! They did the impossible, and they pulled it off!! I didn't think they were going to pull it off, but they did!"

","I saw it and I was in awe at the end. I CANOT WAIT FOR 2009!!!! I heard a Transformers 2 is coming out then. Only thing I didn't like, was the fact that Jazz died. But the word around the grapevine is that Bay's gotten so much 'Angst-mail' that he's been given no choice but to bring Jazz back somehow. There were so many plot-holes that really, a Transformers 2 is actually necessary. And to those who think it was a bad movie, well, that's your freedom of speech, but I have mine as well and I say that you obviously DID NOT see the same movie I did. This was hands down, THE best movie I have ever seen. It had a bit of everything in it. Comedy, horror, action, romance, EVERYTHING. I think, though, Optimus Prime was COLD to Jazz after he had died. He said two words! And that was it. No feeling at all. But still, THE BEST MOVIE EVER! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SEEING IT! DVD COMES OUT 10/16/07"
"dvc5159","6","1","4","13 October 2007"," One of the biggest surprises of Summer 2007.
","Michael Bay. When you hear the name, the words ""Armageddon"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" pop in your mind. Sure he has a bad reputation, but who could blame him? When he works, he's having fun, just like any other person would. So when he was announced that he was going to direct a live-action version of Transformers, the toy robot-cum-animated series, there was a serious debating issue over the internet.<br/><br/>The critics couldn't be more wrong.<br/><br/>Transformers is a huge crowd-pleaser. Undoubtedly Bay's best film to date. But this is due to his partnership with executive producer God... I mean Steven Spielberg, and manage to control a budget that is big but not as inflated as certain web-slingers and pirates we know. The special effects are amazing, the acting is good, the action scenes are spectacular, and plot holes are as abundant as craters on the Moon. Yet, this film turns out to satisfy almost everyone going in the theater: having a sh*tload of fun!!! When Sam Witwicky buys a new, or rather, old car, little does he know that he and everyone around him will be whisked away to a grand and epic adventure beyond anything imaginable. LaBeouf's acting in here is good, as he manages to show his funny side and heroic side. A I grew up with his show on Disney Channel, Even Stevens, from this film, I could tell Shia was on his way to the top. Among all the Disney Channel Graduates, he is the most successful of them all, and he will continue to be that way. After Indiana Jones IV, the name ""Shia LaBeouf"" will mean box-office gold.<br/><br/>Supporting actors are good too. Megan Fox was cute as the hero's lover. Tyrese and Josh Duhamel were great as G.I. soldiers caught up in another war. It was nice to see Jon Voight taking a role that suits him UNLIKE Baby Geniuses 2. The only thing that bugged me a little was Rachael Taylor and Anthony Anderson's characters. I feel that their character's existence does not explain much of the plot.<br/><br/>I was really please that the producers got original G1 voice actor Peter Cullen as the Autobots leader Optimus Prime. That was probably the best thing about the casting. Hugo Weaving was a good replacement for Frank Welker for the villain, Megatron. Thee Autobots are good, the Decepticons are evil. That's all you need to know.<br/><br/>Overall, I believe Michael Bay has given us a true ""Summer Blockbuster"", one that will be remembered for a long time. It is supremely loyal to the original series, and then some. I recommend it with a big box of popcorn.<br/><br/>8.15/10 Delton"
"whatsinhisboxers24","8","1","4","13 October 2007"," Fun all round
","If you're a child of the 80's and you saw the original (and still best) Transformers cartoon, then the prospect of the Transformers film would have both excited you and given you pause. After all, we're talking about a legend here. Optimus Prime, Megatron et all are names that any kid of the 80's knows and the film had to do them justice.<br/><br/>I'm pleased to say that it did, for the most part, with Prime and the other Autobots being well represented. The storyline was a bit thin, and used mostly as a vehicle to generate action sequences, but the amazing look of the film makes up for it. The Transformers look incredibly realistic, and the human contingent keep the events of the film relevant, preventing the film from descending into an FX-laden slag fest, and after a time you start to like the goofy teenage kid.<br/><br/>What was lacking from the film was any fleshing out of the Decepticons. Megatron barely features in the film until the final act, so gone is the chance to depict the Megatron/Starscream rivalry of the series. In fact, none of the Decepticons are really shown all that much. The action sequences are a bit chaotic sometimes and you can't tell which Transformer is which.<br/><br/>Other than that, the film is a visual treat and the element of wry humour is another appealing factor. An entertaining film!"

","Anyway, last night I saw Transformers in IMAX. If you have not seen it, please go. I was extremely pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>I was expecting your normal, boring, fighting movie that was generic, with big guys punching, kicking and shooting each other.<br/><br/>However, this movie was different.<br/><br/>For one, the acting was great. Shia LaBeouf put on a fairly good performance, and to be fair, the other actors were probably better than him overall, especially Jon Voight, who was splendid as the Secretary of Defense. The others were also great. They were smart, had good timing with their lines, great chemistry, overall just great acting.<br/><br/>The scenes, also. They were splendid. Vivid fight scenes, twists and turns in the movie as well. You really get to feel for the robots as they fight; the Decepticons seem infinitely stronger. On IMAX, it looks even better.<br/><br/>Another fact I loved; the military actually HELPED in a superhero movie. Usually, they just stand idly by and try to help but fail, but they actually played a major role in this movie. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson were expertly cast in this role.<br/><br/>And perhaps the best part about this movie...<br/><br/>It...was..FUNNY This movie was amazingly funny. And it wasn't all about comedy either. It picked its spots extremely well. The Autobots were extremely personable, especially Bumblebee (and I also happen to be a fan of Jazz, and Optimus Prime, of course as well). Anthony Anderson and Bernie Mac also made appearances, and played each of their roles very well.<br/><br/>My only negative comment was that it was long and late at night, but that was fine with me.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was a SEVERE surprise. I loved it. Has anyone else seen it yet? It's been out for a while. I can't wait for the sequel."
"tagheue","6","1","4","28 September 2007"," not bad, but not good either
","First things first, as even the title state, the movie is called Transformers, so by default the story is shallow. Now shallow is not that bad if its written good, but it is not the case. There are to many sidelines that are just thrown in the story and linked together without any apparent reason ( the blonde analyst chick with the Aussie accent and the black hacker would have been so much greater if they were just cut out of this movie, and there was just to much about parents - children relationship at the beginning, I mean masturbation a.k.a. happy hour? stepping on the grass, trash cans? come on......)<br/><br/>Now, when you see Michael Bay as director on a movie poster, you pretty much know what to expect, and that is action at its finest. Given the fact that we have 2 giant robot factions fighting each other kind of hand to hand, Bay doesn't disappoints, and delivers some fine shot action. Basically, the robots are great and they fight accordingly.<br/><br/>The actors are appropriate for this movie. Jon Voight brings some pedigree to the movie, but it shows that this role was accept to pay the rent rather than to claim critics. Shia LaBeouf ain't bad, but it could have been Justin Long in his place or any other young actor with a highscool kid face, it really doesn't matter. Megan Fox is a fox, plane and simple, she is hot. Besides the robots she is the only edge that this move has got. All the other actors are just annoying and mostly unnecessarily present, especially Anthony Anderson. No matter in what I see him, he is always an annoying loudmouth. Attitude and verbal diarrhea with a high volume. Fire him.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, good action, great robots, one FINE girl. Who needs story?"

"borkoboardo","4","1","4","24 September 2007"," so sad...
","As a kid I was totally hooked on those mystery robots that can transform and fight their epic war. I owned at least 20 Transformers, always watched the animated series and just couldn't wait to see them on a ""real"" screen.<br/><br/>The more I hoped, the more I got disappointed. In fact, my friend had to keep me on the seat during movie because several times I was about to get up and leave the theater. Why? In fact very simple...<br/><br/>Maybe I was looking for that old Transformer feeling I had when I was a kid. Well, it didn't come back at ANY point of the movie. Instead I got sprinkled with a film without any logic, intelligence nor uniqueness. People told me that this is the next barrier of film, no, it isn't. It shows very well how you can damage a great story with a redirection of the cash flow of the makers. Here ALL the money flowed into special FX, full stop. The cast is exceptionally dull, shallow and underdeveloped. The script is so cheesy that a 10 year old could have written it (maybe that's the target audience but how is a ten year old supposed to get nostalgic on this one?). <br/><br/>Some excerpts of what I found ""head shakingly"" stupid: <br/><br/><ul><li>Robots that talk in Ghetto slang </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A secret service that is so secret, not even the state knows about it </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Soldiers that shoot shoot shoot and just don't seem to notice that their actions have no effect </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The whole arsenal of the US military is ""shown off""! </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Robots trying to ""hide"" from the target's parents and behaving like amateurs. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The ""character"" of the little evil spybot is just too similar to the spiders in ""Eight Legged Freaks"", making noises like a baby. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The people behave like in Jerry Zucker movies: stupid, illogical, immature, ... </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>If you have seen Bad Boys 2 or The Island you will notice extremely strong similarities considering the action. Actually it's just a repeat. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why do you always have a clear look at Megan's tanned breasts?</li></ul><br/><br/>When the movie was finished I was close to crying. I felt like I was robbed of any feeling or nostalgia that I had about the ""Transformers"". I decided to erase this movie out of my memory though it has done a lot of damage already. I gave it five points because it looks expensive, of course the action is well filmed (although edited a little too fast at some points), the robots move really convincing and the impacts they have on the environments also appear very real. Still, it just doesn't help the film to be enjoyable... Hollywood, what have you become?"

","actually, it's below average, but i'm a great fan of transformers so i can't give it less than 5. <br/><br/>good, solid effects, but that's it. actors are mostly bland. kid (labeouf) is OK, turturro was a pleasant surprise and refreshment and voight gives his standard solid act. everybody else are mediocre at best. script? what script? this movie shouts ""robot porno"", there are some lines thrown in here and there just to connect the ""action"" scenes. my guess is that spending big budget on cgi forced creators to make story as watery and mass-appealing as possible to get the money back. and they've made it. story doesn't make any sense, gets pathetic too often and is full of holes. in fact, EVERY single dialog mentioning autobots and decepticons has some plot hole. in the year 2007, i find that unacceptable. <br/><br/>if you are casual watcher and want a fun robot movie, don't let my review affect you, this movie WILL give you expected fireworks. but if you are transformers fan, you would probably cringe with me over the fact that big studios can't invest real emotion and passion into something legendary and beloved as transformers are. shame."

","It was quite a surprise watching Transformers evolve to such a good flick. I was of the opinion that apart from Quentin Tarantino no other director can successfully make a good movie based on junk topics. But Michael Bay overcomes the odds. Sure he needed a movie loaded with out of the world special effects, but still it was indeed a good movie nonetheless.<br/><br/>It didn't have any big names on the screen. Just numerous robots, good and evil fighting for the world. Surprisingly, however odd this sounds, Michael Bay promoted the story just superbly. Not too much unrealistic, and neither a shade too realism. He had a great visual effects team working with him. Along with teenage beauties Megan Fox & Rachael Taylor, and Shia LaBeouf. He had Jon Voight on a nominal role plus Anthony Anderson as the funny man.<br/><br/>The movie features some unbelievable action sequences amongst the Autobots and the Decepticons. The story is indeed junk. But the movie lives on the action sequences and the visual effects, which are literally out of this world.<br/><br/>An unbelievable 8/10 !!!"

It combines the sick special effects with hilarious commentary and characters you fall in love with. Despite all my friend's saying Shia LaBeouf is a terrible actor in regards to ""Holes"", his performance was amazing. He made people laugh. I also thought some of the military aspects of the movie were impressive, some of the weapons and aircraft they used are not even in military production yet. The fight jets used for example. This movie had everything, from bad ass army officials to hot Megan Fox. This movie is worth seeing more than once. It ain't a stupid robot film by any means.

I guess I knew this movie would be kind of aimed at kids, but I didn't expect it to be nearly this juvenile, corny, and downright shallow. From the annoying autobots to the overblown special effects to the cardboard characters, this movie circled the drain for about the last hour and a half. Easily the most disappointing blockbuster of the summer. Even the special effects, while incredible at times, were just too saturated. Many scenes features battles where it was impossible to tell the robots apart, and while explosions are cool we don't need to see one every 3 seconds. And how does a 1,500 pound car ""transform"" into a 30 foot robot? I know it's science fiction but let's try to keep a tiny bit of realism..."

I still however dislike the dialogue and a lot of the acting he directs, if only he had a co-director.<br/><br/>The Transformers are completely epic, they are stunning, the CG is the best i have seen. They are huge transforming robots but he has made them look more powerful than i would guess most could. They have been made with a human element so that we are much more involved and concerned with the outcome of the fights.<br/><br/>I am starving for more, and i can easily put up with average plot development, and average acting for a second viewing.<br/><br/>A favourite, simply because of the robots!!!"

"getmeagasmask","4","1","4","11 August 2007"," The action scenes are the only parts worth it...
","Undoubtedly, ""Transformers"" presents some high-action sequences with amazing special effects, but there weren't enough of them to make the movie. The story follows a boy, Sam (Shia), as he discovers his car is a robot, and he's been entwined in a robot war that began thousands of years ago. Along his adventures of trying to control the chaotic, but good, robot team that's protecting him and helping him ""save the human race,"" he's run into the sexy Mikaela (Megan). The two, backed by their robot comrades, look for Sam's great- grandfather's glasses (which were encrypted with a secret message) and the ""cube"" (the key to earth's survival), all while trying to annihilate the (so to speak) bad robots. The movie poorly developed Mikaela, only leaving her to be a seemingly shallow girl that eventually follows for the dorky boy (Sam) that everyone hated-- however, her script was so weak that it doesn't matter what she does, she was really put in their for her looks. She comes into the movie as a lacking character and the movie ends that way as well. Oh, and of course, the movie had to make her have some sort of ""troubled past"" for her to add a little depth and ""Wow she is more than meets the eye"". It was so unnecessary though that it was just an eye-roller. Shia's character, Sam, is better developed and easier to connect with. Though the movie does well in many aspects, the fact that the Transformers are a children's toy does show through in the movie with corny parts that would make 8-year-old boys laugh, not to mention the cheesy little ""We protect"" speech at the end. The biggest action parts are at the end and the beginning-- look forward to those. However, the camera is s shaky and jerky that sometimes it's difficult to understand what's going on. 4 stars for the action."

Sometimes it stood out, but I didn't find this inappropriate. The first gathering was very effective with the music, until it got ruined by a break. I hate breaks in the cinema, it reminds me of TV. The action was nice, if sometimes a little nuts. (What's also nuts is the scene where they play that song from Kill Bill.) Of all ""Bay Movies"" this is the least ""Bay"". The camera moves often, but it is less obtrusive than in past movies. Some action/FX scenes run through without any cut, which I found amazing. The ending came quickly, and did not draw out too long. More closure would've been possible too, but there are two funny bit-scenes during the credits. Very surreal was what I perceived as a ""hommage"" to ""Naqoyqatsi"". The building Sam runs into to meet the helicopter at the top seemed for three interior shots just like ripped straight from that other movie. Until the robot broke through the floor, of course. In the end, an enjoyable movie."
"monk_e_fish","6","1","4","2 August 2007"," Not Much More Than Meets the Eye
","While other summer blockbusters like Spider-Man 3 and Pirates of the Caribbean have struggled due to confusing plots and the constant necessity to become ""darker"", Transformers' simplistic plot and ability not to take its ridiculous premise seriously are both a great strength and weakness, making the movie lighthearted fun but never injecting a real sense of danger. However, it is not this so much as the multiple plot strands that causes the problem. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson as the American soldiers first attacked by the Decepticons who survive, discover how to kill them and help lead the fight back, are two dimensional excuses for all manner of dated flag waving action movie clichés of the worst kind, something Bay has been much guilty of before. Duhamel's character is so desperate to be reunited with his wife and newborn baby that he talks about little else, their final moments back together against a sunset backdrop is as bad as anything director Michael Bay did with Pearl Harbour.<br/><br/>Even major actors like Jon Voigt and John Turturro do not fare well with the material. Turturro is particularly bad, providing so-called comic relief as the head of a shady government organisation who know more about the Transformers than they are letting on. Turturro's mugging and gurning belongs in a straight up parody, and not a good one at that, a sort of poor man's Men in Black, and it is a shame to see the man who was Barton Fink reduced to this.<br/><br/>Fortunately, at the centre of all this, is one plot line that really does work. In the role of likeably nerdy, awkward teen Sam Witwicky, Shia LaBeouf completely proves himself to all the doubters unsure about whether he is entirely deserving of his star in the making, next big thing hype. Unlike the army captain, defence secretary or computer genius, Sam is an ordinary character it is easy to empathise with and LaBeouf plays him with great charm as he attempts to win the hot girl, Megan Fox's amply chested but under developed character wise car expert Mikaela, and deal with the fact that his new car seems to have a mind of its own. <br/><br/>LaBeouf is also the one actor who really throws himself into the role, striking just the right balance of light comedy and thrills that suggest his casting in the next Indiana Jones film will be perfect. He manages to convince in interactions with the attractive but wooden Fox as much as with the computer generated robots (indeed LaBeouf's Sam is the only human character to have any consistent interplay with the robot characters). Furthermore, it is in LaBeouf's scenes that the comedy side of the movie becomes genuinely laugh out loud amusing, whether it is Sam's panic as the Autobots wreck his parent's pristinely kept lawn (a nice nod to the ridiculousness of the premise comes as the robots turn back into trucks and cars, still looking conspicuously out of place on the lawn, ""That's not hiding"" Sam complains) or his interplay with his parents (""Sam's Happy Time""!).<br/><br/>But what of those robots in disguise themselves, the real reason for anyone to see this movie? The special effects in Transformers are, quite simply, amazing with incredible levels of detail to every character. Whether in close up or standing in the distance, the robots never look anything less than solid, three dimensional presences interacting with the landscape and people around them with completely seamless integration. Appropriately enough, it is the actual transformation scenes that will cause the real wow factor within the audience as they will truly believe they are watching trucks and planes whirr and click into place as they change into giant robots. One particularly spectacular sequence features a chase along a busy highway in which the chasing Decepticons transform into their robot forms in the midst of the action. The design of the robots is very impressive (and a sequence involving a vending machine transformer shows the visual effects designers having a lot of fun with it), although the pointy, angular and all metallic Decepticons fare less well than the Autobots whose complex and detailed design is matched with big, clear blocks of colour.<br/><br/>The actual fight sequences and battles are occasionally prone to Bay's tendency for too much camera movement and too rapid cuts so it is sometimes difficult to see what is going on, however they remain very impressive spectacles. However, the dialogue in the big smackdown between big bosses Optimus Prime and Megatron is so bad that it would seem better if the fight was completely dialogue free (Megatron: Humans don't deserve to live. Prime: They deserve to choose for themselves. - What's that even supposed to mean?) and, while visually impressive, the robot-on-robot violence is difficult to care about when there are no well developed characters. Of the Transformers, only Bumblebee, who gets to spend a lot of time interacting with LaBeouf's Sam, actually displays any real character. This becomes so much the case that the death of one of the Autobots, a major character in Transformers history, becomes a moment devoid of any emotional impact with Bay and co clearly hoping to trade on the affection fans have for the character rather than giving him any personality within the film.<br/><br/>A mess of clichés and plot holes saved by LaBeouf's performance and amazing CGI effects, Transformers makes for enjoyably disposable entertainment, delivering just what you would expect from a Bay directed, Spielberg produced summer action blockbuster based on a toy range, but little more. Unsubtle in the extreme, whether with action or comedy, turn up looking to turn off your brain and enjoy some spectacular moments and occasional humour and you will have a great time, just don't think about it too much. ***"

","I had no knowledge of the transformers before this beyond a few vague memories of toy cars that turn into robots. I hadn't even realised there were good robots and bad robots until I saw this.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with an attack on a military base by an unknown robot thing that resembles a scorpion. The military are unsure whether anyone survived, which a few soldiers did. There is also an attack on the computer system, with the firewalls all being hacked within seconds. The military bring in a group of hackers to try to work out where a strange sound heard at the time originated from. Meanwhile Sam Witwicky has to write about an ancestor at school and tells the story of his grandfather, an explorer who lived the last years rambling about a monster in the ice and Sam is trying to flog a lot of his old belongings on EBay to buy a car. Sam's Dad takes him to buy a second hand car and he ends up with a beaten up yellow car he soon discovers can turn into a robot.<br/><br/>To cut a long story short, one hacker works out where the signal comes from and Sam's car is joined by a group of Transformers who explain that their world was destroyed and new Transformers are made with ""The Cube"". Sam's grandfather found a frozen Megatron who was determined to create a new race of Transformers, the Decepticons. The small group, led by optimus Prime, are called Autobots and they have to stop Megatron from being released and finding the cube. Of course the military have Megatron in a big freezer, just waiting for the hacker Decepticons to defrost and let loose when they find out who Sam and where they can find their master.<br/><br/>First, this movie looks great. The action scenes are spectacular with great effects and a great combination of people trying to destroy the Decepticons and the Autbots having their own battle with them. The plot, for me, was a bit bizarre but if you don't question it it's easy enough to follow. I don't know how much of this followed the original legend.<br/><br/>As for the actors, it's funny how all the guys look geeky except the hunky soldier types and the girls, even the hacker girl, all look like they belong in a magazine. Hmmm, definitely a boy's movie this, even without all the fancy cars and robots.<br/><br/>The movie was far funnier than I was expecting, although from what I know not everyone is a fan of the humour in it. I liked that the Autobots all had their own personality and that their leader was almost like a school teacher looking after a disruptive class for some of the time. The voice actors all did very well, with Optimus Prime especially sounding austere and frustrated at the correct times.<br/><br/>All in all a good fun movie, but I won't be buying it. Definitely one for the kids with the big robots and the teenage boys with lots of hormone candy of both the female and machine varieties. I'd have no problems taking kids to see this although there is some mild swearing, but the nature of most of the action scenes are fine for kids, there's no blood, just bits of metal."
"tillc","5","1","4","30 July 2007"," Transformers, It Is What It Is: Mindless Action, But a Lot of Fun
","http://www.parcentertainment.com<br/><br/>http://framerate.blog.com<br/><br/>July 4th weekend just wouldn't be the same without some over-hyped movie blockbuster with a whole lotta action and very little plot. And this year proved no different with the release of Michael Bay's Transformers. I have to admit, when I first saw the teaser trailer for this film over a year ago, I thought to myself, ""You have to be kidding?"" First, I didn't even know the Transformers were still that popular. Sure, I owned the toys when I was a kid. I watched the cartoon. But I wasn't sure if the young whipper-snappers of today's generation had a clue about Transformers. Second, I just didn't think that a film adaptation of the Hasbro action figures would be worth my while. And so I went in a skeptic, only to reemerge some two and a half hours later with a different opinion.<br/><br/>Oh, don't kid yourself, the plot is VERY thin. This won't be an Oscar contender, but if you're looking for a lot of action with incredible special effects and a lot of destruction, then this is your film. Let's begin the review with the high notes: 1. SPECIAL EFFECTS - I have one word here: UNBELIEVABLE. With today's digital technology, a film's special effects will always come under close scrutiny, and it's difficult to claim that a film's special effects are revolutionary, like, say, Star Wars. But I have to say, the robots in this film look incredibly real. The detail of each Autobot and Decepticon is remarkable. Very well done indeed.<br/><br/>2. SOUND DESIGN - These sound designers deserve a lot of credit. I know it's tough to shell out money at the theatre these days, but if you can dig deep enough into your couch cushions, I would highly recommend that you do so. Scrape up enough cash so you can catch this one in the theatres where you can really appreciate the sound.<br/><br/>3. HOT GIRLS - Megan Fox. Wow. She plays opposite Shia LaBeouf as the sexy love interest. Let me just pause right here to stand up and applaud the casting director. Tip of the cap to you, sir.<br/><br/>4. ACTION - If you want to see a lot of property destruction, explosions, giant robot fight sequences, and car chases, then pull up a seat and enjoy yourself. This one is action from the get-go. It's as if the studio exec's took a look at the first draft of this screenplay and said to the writers, ""Okay guys, all this exposition here? Pages 1-21? Just cut all of that out."" And now for the criticism: 1. LAME DIALOGUE - The Decepticons (AKA, the Bad Guys) never speak English. They speak to each other in their own alien language, which is translated for us via subtitles. This made them seem more ominous and gave the film a darker tone, which I enjoyed. Then the Autobots (AKA, the Good Guys) started speaking. Big mistake. They speak English throughout the film and their dialogue is extremely lame and stifled.<br/><br/>2. COMIC RELIEF - In one particular scene, the Autobots are trying to sneak around the exterior of a house without being detected, but their antics resemble something out of Three Stooges short. They knock things over, they break things, they stumble around. They utter things like, ""My bad."" The whole scene came off childish and annoying. Many of the gags were forced and predictable, and there was no shortage of over-acting.<br/><br/>3. CONFUSING FIGHT SCENES - Although the fight scenes between the robots were incredible, characters were often too close to the camera. The bodies got so jumbled together, it was hard to distinguish the good guys from the bad.<br/><br/>I left the theatre with a good impression of the film. Yes, it definitely had its weak points, but your reaction to the film will definitely hinge on what type of movie you're expecting before you walk into the theatre. If you're expecting a well thought out story with wonderful dialogue and deep characterization, then you'll be in for a big disappointment. If you're looking for mindless action with great special effects, then you will probably enjoy it. Just remember, there's more to this film than meets the eye."
"solidgameboy12-1","7","1","4","27 July 2007"," Is this film really, ""More than meets the eye""?
","What can be said about the Transformers that hasn't been said already? What haven't they been turned into? Surely you can't mention Transformers without the various cartoon series that have been created since the show and its beginning in 1984, or the annoying spin-offs from it. You can't deny they haven't been made into action figures, and you cannot forget the video games that have seen light on the PS2 and other systems, and of course, the Original Cartoon Movie cannot be forgotten. It seems like by now, Transformers have been recognized in several different forms of media, and are household names to America.<br/><br/>Looking at Michael Bay, whose resume includes such horrid films as the Bad Boys movies, Armageddon (we all really like it because of the soundtrack, admit it) and the 3+ Hour Pearl Harbor (Which is probably the longest three hours anyone has sat through), it's too hard to say whether the reputation of the Transformers could be made better or tarnished by Bay and his direction of a long running cartoon show.<br/><br/>However, Bay pulls off a movie that definitely does not sit on my top favorite movies of 2007 (His ranks lowest, against 1. Pirates 3, 2. Harry Potter 5 and 3. Ratatouille) but still makes a movie that I enjoyed watching in the theater, but I doubt I'll want to see again.<br/><br/>Here's a brief summary: Sam Witwicky (Played Fantastically by Shia LeBeouf) is a junior in High School who gets what looks like a automobile that has something about it, something that the Dealer states (""A driver don't pick the cars. Cars pick the driver."") and soon gains a vehicle that looks like a nice way to pick up chicks (like Megan Fox's character, Mikaela), but has something more to it. It's an Autobot named Bumblebee, one of several seen in the movie.<br/><br/>At the same time, in Qatar (Brush up on your geography for this one), several men fighting for the war (Played by Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson) get attacked by strange machines in the desert. Suddenly, the war turns to be battle between man and machine, but where do they come from? Are one of our allies (or Enemies) trying to take us out with special technology unlike any other seen before? As the movie advanced, it felt like it was going nowhere a bit too fast. A strange transmission that sounds like garbled talking on a shorting out walkie-talkie is the main focus for the most part, until we advance a bit more, and finally see some action.<br/><br/>I will give Michael Bay this credit: He knows how to pace, to a point. His development on all the characters are significant enough to have time to explain them all, but it's a 2 hour, 24 minute movie. There must be a lot of fighting, right? Strangely enough, fighting doesn't occur enough.<br/><br/>When a lot of money is being put into making a movie of this caliber, you'd expect a lot of fighting, especially since Transformers seem like they would be awesome fighters, but the movie has at least a maximum of 25 minutes of fighting, while the rest of the film is mostly character development that drags itself out to the point where it's not even character development anymore, it's just trying to extend the movie out until its large finale, but then even the fighting at the end is not enough. I craved for more.<br/><br/>The audience that was there spent a lot of the movie in the bathroom or snack bar until the fight scenes came on, otherwise, a lot were talking and became bored. I was getting a bit annoyed with a movie this talked about and this big had less action than previously imagined.<br/><br/>One thing about this movie that I enjoyed was the fact there the cast is having fun (sort of), little jokes and sight gags were pretty good, and the audience got a laugh when it was implied for you to laugh.<br/><br/>I will say Michael Bay has made an okay movie. It's flaws are that it's a bit too long, and spends a lot of its time trying to move the plot, but tiptoes to the end instead of making it in bounds and leaps, and takes a long time to deliver action instead of granting us our wish of constant combat.<br/><br/>As for the positives, the acting is well done, the characters have personalities (At least LaBeouf's and Fox's characters do) as well as the Autobots, and the film has a good way of recognizing when it's trying to be funny, while keeping in context of the T.V. Show.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 7 out of 10."
"lindaskute","10","1","4","27 July 2007"," Awesome movie
","This movie had it all! It was great! And for anyone who didn't like it, they're just haters with no taste. But there was nothing to hate about it, it had action, comic relief, lots of crisis, and a little sprinkle of drama. Everyone I know loved this movie. Some have even gone to go see it again which is rare. It is like the old transformers but with some upgrades. The transformers look a lot better, more sleek and up to date. Shia is a great actor and he does deliver in this flick like all the others. The fight scenes are intense and action-packed. Oh, and I did not think it would be possible with this kind of movie, but I actually cried a bit. The cars, and well all the vehicles are really nice too, especially the main one, you'll see."
"iainbyam","10","1","4","27 July 2007"," Better than i could have ever imagined
","As a fan of Transformers since the very beginning I had my doubts about the film especially since Michael Bay was directing but my god did he get it right the Transformers look amazing the action scenes are some of the best I have ever seen but what really surprised me was how funny the film was the whole of the cinema was in hysterics for the first half of the film. The only thing that I thought could have been a lot better was the final battle between Optimus Prime and Megatron it was far to short and you didn't see much, but the worst part was Megatron was clearly superior in strength and was throwing Optimus round like a rag doll and as every Transformer fan knows Optimus is the strongest and hardest Transformer ever and would have made minced meat out of him and any other decepticon as he does in the animated movie. The rest of the film more than makes up for the final battle and I can't wait for the sequel which if they get a true Transformer fan to direct it could be one of the best sci-fi films of all time."
"fuzzysham13","8","1","4","24 July 2007"," Best action movie of the year
","This is by far the best action movie of the year. Compare it to Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End, this movie is so much better. Action movies stereotypically have simple plots, and Transformers is no different. The story is simple, keep the Decepticons from getting the All Spark. Definitely not hard to follow.<br/><br/>I think Shia LaBeouf did a good job as Sam. He kept things light when there wasn't much action going on and he showed urgency when he had to. I have to give him props for making out with Megan Fox (Mikelea). She is smokin'.<br/><br/>The effects in the movie are top notch. OK, so CGI will always looks a little cartoonish no matter how detailed it is. It will never have 100% correct lighting. It is pretty damn close, but nothing will ever beat models.<br/><br/>You could go see the 4th Die Hard movie, or the 3rd Pirates movie, but in the end only one movie has the killer action. Transformers!"
"kaelcarp","6","1","4","23 July 2007"," Mixed feelings
","I finally got to see this after years of following the creation of it from the initial rumors to the announcement of Bay as director and so on. I was a very big Transformers fan in the 80s, and I'd consider playing with the toys to be a big part of my childhood. They were the last major toys I played with before puberty kicked in, so they have lingered as my favorites from back then.<br/><br/>My feelings about the movie are mixed. I'll start with the good (which is always shorter because it's less interesting).<br/><br/>It was the best Michael Bay movie I've seen. Granted, I've pretty much disliked everything else I've seen from him and I haven't seen everything. Armageddon remains the worst big-budget movie I've ever seen. But Transformers was a step up for Bay. The special effects were awesome and believable, and it was very cool to see the Transformers brought to life on screen. It's funny, I can remember saying after seeing Jurassic Park way back when digital effects were coming into their own that maybe they could make a live action Transformers, and lo and behold, here it is. The movie is visually arresting, and there are a couple of strong performances from Shia LeBouf and John Turturro. There's some humor and a good sense of fun with it.<br/><br/>Now the negatives.<br/><br/>For one, the robots didn't feel as much like individual characters as they did on the old cartoon. Their faces didn't look as much like faces, which is part of it. But they also looked too similar. The originals all looked quite a bit different. In robot form, they retained more of the look of the vehicles and other items they became. In the cartoon, you could see emotion on their faces and hear it in their voices. In the movie they were more like true robots. There also was no real portrayal of the relationships between the transformers. There was a bit of differentiation when the Autobots were introduced, but it wasn't too much. The Decepticons still all pretty much seemed the same.<br/><br/>There were some regular Michael Bayisms that I didn't like either. Heroes are too heroic and bad guys are too bad, especially for a PG-13 movie. Granted, that's how it was in the source material initially, but over time, the Transformers cartoon became more nuanced, with characters rethinking their positions and switching sides and issues of insanity in Decepticon leadership making some Decepticons question what they were doing. The show became more sophisticated as it went. Perhaps it is understandable that the sophistication level dropped, but I had hoped the PG-13 rating would mean more adult themes. No, just a few more curse words.<br/><br/>Another Michael Bayism I dislike is the glorification of violence. Now, I don't mind violent movies, but I don't like it when movies put a nice sheen on violence. If you're going to show violence, you should show its results. If you are going to show robots shooting up streets and crashing through buildings, you need to show some bodies. The original cartoon had most of its action happening in very isolated areas. The movie had a huge fight sequence in a major city and robots flying through buildings where it was actually shown that there were people working inside. A lot of people have a problem with violence in films. I have a problem not with violence but with a dishonest portrayal of it that hides its negative results.<br/><br/>I also thought there were some lazy stretches of believability. The government trying to cover up what happened in the end by burying the bodies at sea was stupid because obviously people would know, seeing as how a city got ripped apart and there had to have been reporters capturing it. Also, the military leadership was way too honest with the public, with the Secretary of Defense telling people on air that they had no idea what had attacked them in the desert and all that.<br/><br/>Yet another Michael Bayism is to depict military and political officials as simplistic, honest men who are purely heroic. Now, I think the portrayal of the soldiers themselves was actually pretty good, but the Sec Def is much more of a political position and I thought the character was basically too honest and straightforward.<br/><br/>I wasn't too bothered by the physical differences between the original versions and new versions of the vehicle forms of the Transformers. The change in Bumblebee's car form worked for the movie and the old versions were very 1980s anyway. How can you make a movie now where all the vehicles look like they're from the 1980s? However, I didn't like that they changed the basic nature of some of the characters. Bonecrusher and Devastator were two separate characters. In the original, Devastator was formed by combining five robots into one, and one of them was Bonecrusher. It is also a sin that Megatron turns into a plane and not some kind of big ol' gun. He didn't look nearly enough like the original Megatron to me.<br/><br/>Okay, I guess I've put enough effort into reviewing what was essentially a silly summer popcorn movie. It's just that it was a big part of my childhood, so I had a lot to say."
"atamata","6","1","4","22 July 2007"," Too many rose-tinted spectacles here
","When I heard that a live action adaptation of Transformers was being made I was beside myself. And as the release date drew nearer i couldn't wait. I was much the same about Alien v Predator, and likewise I knew that both films were likely to be utter pap but at the same time, lots of fun. I mean let's be honest, Transformers was never going to be the Citizen Kane of the 2007 summer blockbusters but it failed in so many ways I left the cinema feeling disappointed.<br/><br/>Bad points:<br/><br/>* Bad characters - what was the point of the Australian 'analyst' and her hacker friend? She was clearly just some eye-candy and he was ham-fisted unfunny comic relief. * Bad editing - too many pointless set pieces. What was the point of the interrogation of the Aussie woman and the hacker? None except for a unfunny comedic set piece. * The best comic book adaptation ones have been the ones which focused on the darker side to the main characters (ie Batman Begins, Spiderman). Obviously with the Autobots (esp Optimus) being such goody two-shoes this wasn't going to be an option. However making so many of the characters out to be comic side-shows took away so much of the gravitas that the characters had from the comics. Megatron was a bad dude not as much because he looked bad, but because he was utterly ruthless, not just with his victims but with his own followers. and we didn't really get a sense of this in the film. * Little dramatic weight - the sequence where Bumblebee is captured drew no empathy from the audience as we simply hadn't got to care about the character that much at that point. * John Turturo - why was such a great actor given such a pansy ass role? * Action sequences - too confusing. When there were hand-to-hand combat fights it was hard to tell who was who, is that a Decepticon or an Autobot? Too hard to tell! * Bumblebee was a VW Beetle!!!<br/><br/>Good points:<br/><br/>* errmmm... the CGI was impressive<br/><br/>Seriously that is the best i can really say about it. The most I can give Transformers realistically is 6/10, and it pains me to do so. Mind you when you look at Michael Bay's filmography is it any real surprise?"
"sg2790","6","1","4","22 July 2007"," Confused direction...some what disappointing
","I didn't really think much of this film when i saw it on adverts etc... but for some reason my mum and her boyfriend really wanted to see it, even though apparently i watched the TV series when i was younger.<br/><br/>Good Points -Brilliant visual effects, the way the robots transformed was extremely realistic -the sound effects (not music), the metallic sounds really suited the robots obviously and fitted well. -The comedy, Perfectly timed and was extremely funny at times - even with the robots.<br/><br/>Bad Points -The Soundtrack, this goes with the confused direction. One moment there was the hard instrumental almost 'patriotic American' drums that you get in some films;which really added to the films serious side. However then there was some rock in it which lightened the film slightly. Yeh some films can switch tones but it really didn't work in this. - Getting back to the directing. Usually with a film you get a gut feeling on how the film will be. This one i just couldn't decide whether it was a serious hardcore action or a child's comedy. The two didn't mix well and Michael bay really didn't do well...and the great Spielberg.<br/><br/>I would advise watching this you could like it but it really didn't suite me the too sharp camera angles and the none fitting music just took away the experience."
"Installation_At_Orsk","5","1","4","22 July 2007"," Mechs and violence
","I've never watched an episode of Transformers, never owned a Transformers toy, never sung along to 'You Got The Touch'. The main reason I went to see this film was... well, my inner 12-year-old wanted to see giant robots fighting each other and smashing stuff.<br/><br/>My inner 12-year-old left mostly satisfied. Giant robots do indeed fight each other and smash stuff. But my adult self was somewhat less easily entertained, and left feeling disappointed by a messy script full of holes (what happened to Barricade, the Mustang Decepticon? As far as I could tell he vanished right after the start of the freeway chase), unnecessary story lines (the hackers could have been removed entirely just by giving the line about how Sector 7 find Sam to another character) and action sequences that turned into nothing but a big blur.<br/><br/>Probably the most irritating aspect of the film was that it was full of annoying characters who did one-note comedy 'schticks' rather than behaving like people. Having a comic-relief character is one thing; in Transformers, it seems practically *every* character was there to deliver unfunny one-liners or sight gags. Sam's parents, Sam's friend, Sam's teacher, Bernie Mac, his grandmother, Anthony Anderson, *his* grandmother, his cousin, Agent Simmons, his sidekick, the Indian guy on the phone... Nor were the robots immune, as Frenzy (the boombox Decepticon) was a straight-out 'wacky' character, and even Optimus Prime ended up doing slapstick!<br/><br/>Michael Bay is a director I have mixed feelings about; he's done some movies I really enjoyed (The Rock), and others I hated (Armageddon, Pearl Harbor). What I find ironic is that his earlier films, when he was a relative unknown and was working on smaller budgets, did a much better job of delivering thrills and excitement, probably because he was forced to use real cars and real people shot by real cameras on real locations. Now, every action shot in his movies seems to involve some CG vehicle whipping past a (simulated) millimetre from a wildly shaking virtual camera. Everything becomes indecipherable streaks of light and colour. It's not thrilling, or exciting - just confusing.<br/><br/>The Transformers themselves are impressive to look at, but they would be even more so if I could actually see what they were doing. All the publicity has gone on about how many millions of parts and zillions of polygons the CG models are built from, but on screen they just become a whirl of silver and coloured body panels. The only robots who were easy to identify in the finale were Optimus (blue and red) and Bumblebee (yellow). All the others were just shades of grey and black running around and somersaulting like speed-crazed acrobats. Sometimes I could only tell if I was looking at an Autobot or a Decepticon by the colour of their eyes (blue=good, red=evil).<br/><br/>There were some odd directorial choices as well. If I hadn't known in advance that Jazz would die by being ripped in half by Megatron, I would never have realised that was what happened! Instead there was just a flurry of movement in long shot, then a cut to something else. Come on, one of the good guys has just been killed! Where's the shock? Where's the horrified reaction from his friends? Where's Megatron taking a moment to gloat, even?<br/><br/>So ironically, in a film about giant robots, I felt as though I didn't get my fill of giant robots. If the film had been 20-30 minutes shorter - take out the hackers, take out the Secretary of Defense fighting Frenzy, take out the pointless sitcom-level minor characters like the surly cop or the fat dancing cousin - and at least the proportion of mechs to meatbags would have felt more balanced. The movie is called 'Transformers', not 'Annoying People', after all..."

","The only reason this nonsense didn't get a 1 was due to Josh Duhamel (Las Vegas). He was the only highlight for me. The rest of the cast was made of shallow, uninteresting people. Not that I expected more from an action flick but just saying. Jon Voight and John Turturro are two fine actors who are wasted in this film. This movie tried so hard to elicit laughs in between the action and failed miserably each time. Anthony Anderson was just not funny. The interrogation scene with the donuts was like a bad sitcom where you could see the punch line a mile away. The blonde Australian girl who outsmarted national security was just ridiculous. As for the action, it was hard to keep track of which machine was which. Just hunks of metal tearing each other apart. The cartoon had much better fighting scenes more than 20 years ago! Pathetic. Also Optimus Prime was a heck of a lot stronger in the cartoon than in the movie. He was at least Megatron's match. In the movie, he clearly had inferior strength. I can't even recommend this for children since they had to throw that ill advised bit of dialog in when the parents entering their son's room."

It was cool cars and what not transforming, good versus evil, Optimus vs Megatron, it was all gravy. But never have I imagined such stunning visuals and an individualistic adaptation so intense, just purely entertaining as it is impressive.<br/><br/>From a viewers opinion, I wouldn't really convey the fact of some slight changes to the originals rather accept the fact that this is one of the few movies that amazes me in terms of visuals, plot and pace. Of course there's Megan Fox, who adds even more spice to the film.<br/><br/>The only worry before watching this was the length and I'm relieved that it was just long enough to fit in all the necessary components to make it one hell of a movie.

"nomad107","4","1","4","20 July 2007"," Transformers themselves were awesome, but the movie was terrible!
","Saw this last night and my childhood dreams of 20 years were partially fulfilled, but overall I was quite disappointed.<br/><br/>Now, on the plus side, the Transformers were perhaps the best CGI I've ever seen in a movie. Period. I don't see how the filmmakers could possibly have done a better job in bringing the Transformers to life on the big screen. Add in some terrific sound effects, and you can actually feel the mass of the robots as they move across the screen. The battle sequences are some of the best sci-fi action scenes that you'll ever see. Acting was good, for the most part, and the comedy had its moments.<br/><br/>However, I felt that this movie spent too much time on the human characters and not enough time on the Transformers themselves. They simply tried packing in too many human characters with separate story lines that introducing us to all of them pushed back the arrival of the Autobots to nearly halfway through the movie. And, as a direct consequence, the robots get very little time for character development. Prime and Bumblebee are the only two who actually get personal attention. We learn enough about Megatron from what others say about him, but none of the other Decepticons (not even Starscream) gets more than a couple of lines of dialog.<br/><br/>I could write pages and pages about how bad a director I think Michael Bay is, but I'll try to be brief. Basically, Bay would make a great Assistant Director in charge of just the action scenes of any of his movies, because he certainly has a flair for cinematic fireworks. But when it comes to telling a coherent story with three-dimensional characters, Bay is one of the worst directors in the history of film. Enough of that though; everyone knows why so many people hate Michael Bay. I'll just say that this film suffers from all of those same reasons.<br/><br/>I gave this movie four stars, because while the Transformers themselves were spectacular, they happened to be featured in a very poorly written movie. I'm really not looking forward to the sequel unless they can find a director who takes his movies seriously."
"Snapscape","2","1","4","20 July 2007"," Don't Let The Name Fool You *spoilers*
","First of all, the movie has multitudes of continuity errors and sloppy story writing. I expected a lot from this film with the budget they had, but unfortunately, it turned out to be another Godzilla 1998. Much like Godzilla, there's little focus on the main characters, being the robots themselves, and more on the US military and a sexual endeavor that carries throughout the film making you wonder why they didn't just call the movie Sex Pistols.<br/><br/>Probably to suit the outcome of being destroyed by lowly humans, the robots were designed to be extremely weak. Most of the Decepticons are dispatched by the military quite easily, bringing into question as to why the Autobots need to ""protect"" anything for that matter. Heck, they should've just went wild and started destroying everything. Though the property damage they've caused saving the world alone might be enough.<br/><br/>The absence of character development for the robots is prominent. Most of them come out of nowhere near the end of the movie and some have absolutely no dialog whatsoever. Bay failed to see any reason to develop their personalities. One of the dozens of continuity errors is that some of the Decepticons just vanish into thin air during the freeway chase. The Autobots and the military are supposed to protect sentient life, bringing into question as to why they brought the final battle into a civilian population for no reason at all. Also, the whole point of the Transformers arrival on Earth is to look for a device called the All Spark. In a few scenes, two Decepticons (Starscream and Blackout) are in reach of the human character who has the device, but in each instance, they transform and leave instead of killing and relieving him of it.<br/><br/>Of course, the generic story about the guy getting the girl surfaces at the finale. Both Bay and the writers failed miserably to depict the heart of the Transformers, and made it into a film about anything but. Hopefully, Hasbro will take the franchise to a more capable movie studio other than Paramount and their terrible sci-fi writers, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. Is it any wonder why the Star Trek movies have gone to shame?<br/><br/>In the end, don't expect to see the Transformers you've grown to love, because they don't live here."

Oh, and Labeouf rules! So thanks Bay and Spielberg!"
"zardoz-13","9","1","4","18 July 2007"," An improbable but compelling science fiction fantasy thriller
","""Armageddon"" director Michael Bay blends live-action human heroics seamlessly with top-notch, computer-generated images of huge extraterrestrial robots battling for supremacy of the Earth in his new movie ""Transformers"" (*** out of ****), an improbable but compelling science fiction fantasy thriller about good versus evil robots. Essentially, this spectacular, often amusing, and sometimes inventive, $150-million dollar hokum amounts to a glossy cinematic commercial for toy giant Hasbro. Like the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"" ""Transformers"" materialized first in the early 1980s as a line of toys. Later, the profitable Hasbro figurines graduated to the small screen in an animated television series. Since then, fifteen ""Transformers"" TV series have been appeared in the U.S., Canada, and Japan. In 1986, these shape-shifting robots showed up in their own animated theatrical length feature appropriately entitled ""Transformers: The Movie."" Finally, these wrestling space alien robots have reached the big screen in a larger-than-life, two-and-a-half-hour plus summer extravaganza with ""I, Robot"" star Shia LaBeouf. ""Mission Impossible 3"" scribes Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, along with director Bay, have given the mythological origins of ""Transformers"" a makeover of sorts. Of course, anytime Hollywood buys a franchise, either toy or otherwise, the studios inevitably make alterations. Meanwhile, seasoned sci-fi movie fans will spot the obvious homages to Steven Spielberg movies, like ""E.T."" and those of Spielberg collaborator Joe Dante.<br/><br/>""Transformers"" erupts with action and rarely bogs down during its mammoth 144 minute running time. A sinister U.S. military helicopter makes an unauthorized landing at an Army base in the Middle East. When the occupants fail to identify themselves, U.S. soldiers unleash a withering barrage of gunfire. Suddenly, the helicopter rears up, transforms itself into a towering two-legged alien monster and rampages through the base. While this gigantic robots is eradicating every soul in sight in ""Independence Day"" style, a smaller robot pops out and hacks into the base's Pentagon computers. A group of soldiers, among them Capt. Lennox (Josh Duhamel of ""Turistas"") and Sgt. Epps (Tyrese Gibson of ""2 Fast 2 Furious""), survive this slaughter and eventually contact Secretary of War Joe Keller (Jon Voight of ""Anaconda"") who orchestrates an across-the-board defense. Keller assembles the best hackers in the world to crack the alien's code. The opening scene and subsequent scenes that alternate between the Army and the hackers resemble something out of serious Ridley Scott movie like the R-rated ""Black Hawk Down."" Clearly, as big, dumb, and ear shattering as ""Transformers"" is, Bay has spared nothing to make it look like the jaw-dropping event of the summer.<br/><br/>No sooner has ""Transformers"" delivered its white-knuckled, off-the-Richter-scale opening action gambit than Bay shifts from a serious style Ridley Scott saga into a warm-hearted but sardonic Joe Dante movie. Dante directed ""Gremlins,"" ""Gremlins 2,"" ""Explorers,"" and ""Small Soldiers."" Dante's sci-fi comedies rely on a near teen or teenaged hero who has problems impressing the opposite sex. Enter Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf of ""Disturbia""), a nerdy eleven grader who gets no respect. He is keyed up about the prospect of getting his first set of wheels. This rite of passage occurs on Bobby Bolivia's used car lot where Bobby (Bernie Mac of ""Ocean's Thirteen"") sells Sam's father Ron (Kevin Dunn of ""Small Soldiers"") a battered yellow Camaro for $5-thousand dollars. Bobby is a heck of a car dealer when you consider that the Camaro drove itself onto his lot. Anyway, the Camaro becomes a babe magnet for Sam, and high school bombshell Mikaela Banes (Tennessee-native Meagan Fox) starts hanging out with our hero. Meanwhile, Sam learns that his Camaro possesses a mind of its own. One night his Chervolet cranks itself up and careens off without warning. Sam straddles his bicycle and pedals after his car in furious pursuit. When he catches up with his Camaro, he discovers that it evidently had abducted itself instead being stolen as Sam had feared. Not surprisingly, Sam freaks out when his Camaro turns into a giant robot and speaks to him.<br/><br/>Basically, in ""Transformers,"" two types of robots have come to Planet Earth to search for a mysterious cube. The good robots are the Autobots, and they include Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ironhide, Jazz, and Ratchet. Sam's Camaro transforms itself into Bumblebee. Meanwhile, the evil robots are the Decepticons, and they consist of Megatron, Starscream, Blackout, Brawl, Barricade, Frenzy, Bonecrusher, and Scorponok. The Autobots and the Decepticons both know about Sam's scientific ancestor who met Megatron initially before the villainous robot encountered some difficulty of its own. Suffice to say that Sam has something very important that both robot armies need. The Autobots are willing to cooperate with humans, but Decepticons want to destroy them. Predictably, the Autobots team up with mankind to fight the Decepticons. Los Angeles becomes the arena for a giant smack down wrestling match between these awesome space aliens.<br/><br/>Anybody that has seen either the ""Transformers"" TV series or owned the Hasbro figurines may complain about the liberties that Bay and his writers have taken with the franchise. For example, the scene at Hoover Dam and the history behind the dam played no part in the original ""Transformers."" Happily, Peter Cullen, who provided the voice for Optimus Prime in the TV series, reprises his role, while ""The Matrix's"" Hugo Weaving voices Megatron. Aside from a couple of loony, over-the-top performances by Jon Voight as the Defense Secretary and John Turturro as a crazy government agent, everybody else plays it fairly straightforward. George Lucas' Industrial Light & Magic special effects company has furnished some of the best CGI graphics ever seen on the big-screen. Just watching the ""Transformers"" do their thing is worth the price of admission. Mind you, it's kid's stuff, but it doesn't look like kid's stuff. Altogether, this testosterone-fueled fantasy is ideal summer entertainment for those who want to relive their ""Transformers"" memories or for sci-fi fans that want to see computer-generated animation ascend to the next level."
"philip-bunnell","8","1","4","18 July 2007"," a film of its age...
","Well I have just watched the Transformers movie in the Republic of Korea and I was very impressed with the look and feel of the movie. The action is plentiful and spectacular, the computer-generated robots are superbly detailed as they transform and the actors' performances are great. The story is easy to follow, the pacing is good and two-hours fly by. A well deserved 8/10.<br/><br/>BUT...this movie scores a 2/10 for honesty, fairness and integrity. It's very sad that so many children, with impressionable young minds, will watch this movie and believe it's propaganda. <br/><br/>The movie, which is masquerading as a 'summer blockbuster', stinks of neo-corporate American and neo-conservative ideology ..!! I left the movie theater feeling like I had just watched a recruiting commercial for the US armed services, American family values and for wanton consumerism. It's quite understandable - that parts of the movie must be pro-military - because many scenes involve equipment (such as planes, tanks etc) and personnel. They would never have been done to such a high calibre, I suspect, without the assistance of the US Defence Department. But it's the overt use of current events together with images of the military might of America which leaves a bad taste in the mouth. <br/><br/>For instance, before the Tranformers are first revealed, China, North Korea and Iran are all mentioned as the potential threat! The audience is then treated to scenes of American Battle fleets with aircraft carriers and attack ships steaming across the oceans. There is no diplomacy or meetings, the movie is showing us that America will always use 'might-is-right' action when a threat is detected. Which to the average low-expectation Homo Sapiens will be just another reinforcement of America's homeland security operations. <br/><br/>Likewise the clever use of vehicles and electrical appliances just repeatedly reinforces a glorious view of machines and technology. I wonder how many audiences members want a cell phone, car or computer like those seen in the movie! At one point, a vehicle produces a vast amount of dirty smoke, which just drifts off into atmosphere!! <br/><br/>As my friend noted, if the bad Transformers wanted to take over the world, they shouldn't have bothered fighting, they should have just driven around in their vehicles forms for the next few years. Bye bye Ozone!! Bye Bye humans!! I would go on, but I am bored, so to conclude....<br/><br/>If you believe that American foreign policy, American military deployment and America's attitude towards the environment are correct, then Transformers is an ideologically sound movie. But if you believe the world could be better without the current American administration then this movie will grate.<br/><br/>Particularly the home-spun ending!!"

How this film took three whole people to come up with the story is baffling.<br/><br/>The acting as a whole is wooden. Except when the robots start talking, then it it gets past wooden. (What is a word for worse than wooden but with a healthy dose of puerile?). <br/><br/>But let's face it the action is what this movie is about - and the cars are the stars.<br/><br/>A highlight? If I'm forced to pick one, it would be the Bernie Mac cameo.<br/><br/>A lowlight? If I'm forced to pick ONLY one, it would have to be John Turturro's out of place turn as the goof-ball secret spy. He was the only one not playing it straight.<br/><br/>We really should not expect much from a Michael Bay (Bad Boys, Bad Boys 2) directed film apart from explosions and car chases.

This movie embraces everything the old summer movies use to achieve. I was also glad to see they went the independence day route and what i mean by that is that they did not go out and spend tons of money on big stars who are set in their ways.

But with out sounding childish, I was extremely surprised.<br/><br/>""Transformers"" is without a doubt a film for those who want to see things explode and nerdy guys who get the hot girl. Shia LeBeouf is undoubtedly becoming a star on his own, especially with his breakout in ""Disturbia"". But ""Transformers"" just gives him that extra break.<br/><br/>From the get go, ""Transformers"" explodes with great action and stunning visuals. But after that amazing opener you'll soon be brought down to neutral. Acting becomes poor, with the exception of Mr. LeBeouf. We soon get to see the blank faced Megan Fox, who might I add is just beautiful. The chemistry between the two is there but it seems like its forced.<br/><br/>There also seems to be a peculiar amount of stupidity in the movie. Come on people. Why in the world would you bring a cube, the center of attention, into the middle of the city?! How in the world can the Transformers learn to speak through the internet yet the Decepticon leader can speak perfect English without coming anywhere near the internet? Please, lets be real to some extent.<br/><br/>""Transformers"" is undoubtedly the hit of the summer. Explosion nuts will go crazy with all the realistic action.

"electricmage","Null","1","4","10 July 2007"," Michael Bay is anti-American
","First he turns one of the worst atrocities in American history, into a love story. And an all out puss-fest.<br/><br/>Michael Bay, why must you destroy the story of Transformers? I give you props for the amazing CGI. But your major flaw was changing the look and the storyline. The Transformers are way too detailed, and have way too many parts to actually distinguish which Robot is which (Decepticons). The battles are amazing, but it's extremely hard to tell who exactly is doing what to whom. <br/><br/>The other flaw, is the weak-ass-ed storyline. The cartoon had the humans as mainly insignificant creatures. Caught between the waring factions. The majority of the film is based around Sam Witwicky. I understand the need for this, but give me a break Bay. Can't you put your ego and talentless mind aside for one minute, and just make an all out slug-fest? This should have been a CGI infested movie of WAR between two robot armies.<br/><br/>There were plot holes galore as well. The product placement was insane. Almost to the point of annoyance. An XBOX 360 comes to life? A mountain dew vending machine? A Cadillac comes to life and attacks a girls head? Where did these things go to? Why did the cube turn them, and essentially make them evil?<br/><br/>I'm in awe, that someone would find this script to have been green-lit. One can only hope Spielberg isn't losing his touch, and finds something as mediocre to use for the next Indiana Jones film.<br/><br/>If only I could remember more....I was so dumbed down by the experience, aside from the general eye candy that I can barely remember who I am. Christopher Nolan has more talent in his pubic hair. <br/><br/>Thanks Michael Bay. You've turned one of my favorite shows from the 80's into another Michael Bay, Nancy boy film...Way to get the story wrong."
"kim_etzerodt","9","1","4","9 July 2007"," Very good no-brain action. And that's no bad thing.
","I must admit - the most I've ever experienced of Transformers before I saw the movie was a Megatron toy I had as a kid, so I had no connections to the universe before. I went into the theater expecting nothing but action and I got what I came for. After all, if you watch a movie featuring a battle between giant morphing robots, who reign destruction on each other (and Earth) and expect a revolution in storytelling, or ingenious twists and turns in regards to plot or characters, you're stupid... to say the very least.<br/><br/>Now, in regards to the plot: I've read quite a few reviews where people complain that the story is confusing and difficult to understand, just because you have to learn a few new words, like ""Autobots"", ""Decepticons"" and ""Allspark"". Those reviewers must be deliberately daft. I mean, how hard can it be? Good and evil robots race to find the same ancient artifact. Evil robots want to use it to rule the universe. Good robots want to destroy said artifact to prevent evil robots from ruling the universe. What's the problem exactly?<br/><br/>And with a plot like that, I find it nice, that the movie does not take itself to seriously, meaning that there is a lot of humor, especially in the first part. Instead of having serious discussions, travel montages etc., you have a bunch of gags, that ensures a light and easy entrance into the characters, the story and so on. In regards to the characters. Yes, there might very well be a connection to the name of the main character, Sam, and ""Uncle Sam"", but let's just leave that. Instead, Megan Fox deserves mention... The screen almost melts when she is on it. Yes, sometimes the director spends just a tad too long focusing on her (very) pretty face, but even so, it's hard to actually get enough of her in this movie :) The other actors play their role as expected (Jon Voigt is solid in this one), but special mention must come to the animators at ILM for their job on the robots. From the first kick-ass scene where an airbase is being decimated by a single robot, all the way through to the (to say the least) explosive finale, this is the kind of film that makes you want to become an animator... at ILM. To name a particular scene, it must be the one, where a robot tumbles down a busy street. To avoid hitting an innocent bystander, he fires two shots down into the ground to propel himself over said innocent bystander. I can barely imagine how much fun and play-time the animators must have had making this. All the robots kick serious metal butt, all the way through the movie. If nothing else, the robots make the movie worth watching. Watching them fight, dodge rockets and other shots, and especially watching them transform at blinding speeds just to keep on fighting each other, without slowing down is a joy to watch.<br/><br/>Basically, when you watch this movie, you're getting an evenings worth of pure entertainment: There's no intricate plot in this movie. It's straight action from start to finish, mixed with a handful of gags to lighten the mood. Throw in awesome effects, an ultra-hot Megan Fox and the coolest robots of all time. This is an evening of pure, relaxing fun. <br/><br/>If you need to cool off your brain after thinking too much about something, this is definitely a movie for you. If you like pretty girls, and Megan Fox in particular, this is definitely a movie for you. If you're looking for a movie with killer giant-robot-action, this is definitely a movie for you. If you're into animation and CG-effects and want to see, what the technology is capable of at its' greatest, this is definitely a movie for you.<br/><br/>All in all, this one is very recommended."

The robots themselves looked very cool and realistic, though I sometimes missed the cleaner designs of their animated counterparts. I find it a bit odd that the filmmakers would go to such trouble to make the robots look real, and place them into such epic battle scenes, yet try so hard not to take things too seriously. It might've been more effective had they gone for straight drama. I wasn't even trying to compare this to the animated _Transformers: The Movie_, however, until this film lifted a quote directly from its predecessor. If they're gonna invite the comparison, they should at least make sure they measure up well. I would probably buy this when it comes out on DVD just 'cause the visuals are so cool, but I definitely feel the animated version was better and will continue to hold up better over time."
"kinetsmac","8","1","4","6 July 2007"," Transform...and Roll Out
","By the time I am writing this, I have just returned from seeing Transformers the movie at my local mall theater, the experience of the film still rolling through my head. After waiting for an unbearable stretch of months since I first saw the movie promoed on the cover of a magazine at a Sheetz, I finally lost my patience, grabbed my bike (since I'm at college, my car's at home) and rode for two miles uphill, miraculously making it to the seven o'clock showing. <br/><br/>And let me tell you. It was worth it.<br/><br/>Transformers is, without a shadow of a doubt, the best summer flick yet. I know that this accomplishment is a bit dumbed down from ""The Three Letdowns"" (Spidey 3, Pirates 3, and Shrek 3) but this movie holds it proudly none the less. Fast, action packed, and surprisingly funny, Transformers is what going to the movies should be, entertaining, thrilling, and endearing.<br/><br/>That isn't to say the film is without its flaws. Some viewers I expect will find the character development for some of the 'formers to be a little weak, especially for the evil ones. The autobots are well portrayed and even quite humorous at times (especially Bumblbee), and although their voices are noticeably different from their first G1 incarnations, Bay and company have thrown in some clever nods that longtime fans will enjoy (an example being Jazz saying ""what's up b####es"" when he first transforms.)<br/><br/>As for the decepticons...there isn't much to say. The majority of them don't appear until near the final battle, among them fan-favorite starscream and the decepticon leader megatron, with a snippet of argument being the only indication that the writers understood the long established dynamics between the two characters. Outside of that, the only 'con that receives any major screen time is the pint sized, gibbering, hyperactive spy Frenzy, who, while entertaining in his crack-head like warbling, does leave a lot to be desired in terms of screen presence. The rest of the evil invading robots are basically all identical to one another: evil, angry, and destructive. And, while this is certainly accurate to the basic Decepticon belief system, it greatly neuters all the long established characterization given to them, and that's a bit sad.<br/><br/>In the voice acting department, kudos to Peter Cullen and his victorious return to the part that made him big. Optimus Prime is just as cool as he was twenty years ago, and Cullen's voice actually seems truer to the part with the aging its been through; Prime sounds just like a war general, battle worn and tough. My one complaint is that Cullen seems to have trouble saying things with a ""normal"" tone, and he can occasionally make prime a bit over-dramatic at times.<br/><br/>In the case of Megatron, Hugo Weaving says the lines with gusto and evil bravado, but with all the synthesizing done to his voice, it could have been Gary Coleman saying the lines when you get down to it. I've often disagreed with Transformers purists in the past, but I will agree with them on this: Frank Welker will always be THE classic Megatron voice, and his absence is certainly felt in this film. <br/><br/>As for the human cast, all of them do a performance that ranges from passable to quite good, but its young Shia Lebouf that definitely steals the show. I was greatly surprised and impressed by Shia's ability to say comedic dialog in a believable, human way, and its this attribute that makes his part as Sam truly endearing. You find yourself liking him, and this is crucial for the pacing of the story. Its no exaggeration that Shia's performance is the linchpin that keeps the film from falling apart, and I can honestly say I cant say that I can think of anyone better for the part. Nice call there Mike.<br/><br/>Transformers is a film that is great in a truly bona-fide way, and I enjoyed it immensely. I should warn parents that, besides the intense action, there are a few surprisingly crude jokes thrown into the skillet, among them the subject of masturbation. <br/><br/>Yeah, it made me pause too.<br/><br/>But aside from that, there's nothing to whine about. Buy that ticket, crack open a box of Mike-n-Ikes and a bottle of Volt, and hang on for the best flick of the summer.<br/><br/>Roll out."

","OK, this is without doubt an entertaining movie, though this is mostly accredited to the amazing action and 10-metre-tall robots (which is obviously impressive in itself) which are sentient and which have eyes that blink... yeah.<br/><br/>The opening in itself says much about the script. Before time began, there was (short dramatic pause) The Cube. Although somewhat annoyed at the lack of proper sentences escaping the characters' mouths, I did catch myself working hard to contain my laughter when a giant robot comes with sentences such as ""I can smell you, human"".<br/><br/>The sheer stupidity of some also amazes me. Particularly two things. The autobots (except Optimus Prime) all seem to all have ADHD or something of the sort as well as being severely without comprehension of the idea of not being seen, which leads me to the other annoying thing about this movie (except the infinite amounts of ammo each transformer seems to carry). The humans can not for the life of them spot the 10-meter tall robots 'sneaking' about in the STREETS, and almost in crowds, not to mention that even if the robots contain high amounts of radiation, Geiger counters can't seem to track them either...<br/><br/>In spite of all these flaws, this is indeed an entertaining movie, and if nothing else, a good laugh, at least in my opinion."

","The movie had good action. The history of how transformers came to be is introduced in the beginning for all those who are unfamiliar with the story which helps everyone understand what's going on. Some parts at the beginning could have been cut out. The movie was about 3 or so hours long- too long. Some of the content was a little too mature for children under 7 years old. The action scenes near the end were too jiggly. You would get a headache if you kept your eyes open for all the fight scenes. Great graphics of the transformers matched in with the real actors. And, there is a good storyline which helps keep the audiences attention until the end. The is definitely room for a sequel. And, I'm sure toy makers will be making numerous toys for children of all ages to have their very own transformer. It pays to go see it (better than a rent-able)! Enjoy!"

The human cast was perfectly balanced and given plenty to do alongside the Transformers. At 2 hours and 20, the movie is the perfect length. To anyone who bashes this movie for any reason--you obviously weren't paying attention. I can finally forgive Michael Bay for Pearl Harbor and The Island. Mr. Bay, sir, I commend you."

"mike-4586","9","1","4","8 July 2007"," Too much fun. Well worth the time.
","Transformers is fun, entertaining and worth watching. You might read some other reviews that slam the movie for being more of a Sci-Fi-action-comedy rather than a pure Sci-Fi flick. Transformers was never a sci-fi series to begin with, but rather a vehicle (no pun intended) to sell merchandise. <br/><br/>The hardcore fan might not like this film because it does poke fun at it's self, which gives it great character. We are talking about robots that can transform into cars, planes and other machines. The real science is pretty much out the window so no need to be a hardcore geek about it - It's not a Carl Sagan novel.<br/><br/>If your in the mood to be entertained for a couple of hours this movie delivers. Special effects are the best on most complex I have seen. The characters are fun and you really get to like the main human character.<br/><br/>As for the Transformers themselves the film makers kept their campy dialog from the animated 80's series. Also the robots have a personality and comes across pretty well, especially bumble bee. <br/><br/>If your a hardcore Trans-nerd avoid this movie. If your a general movie goer than go watch it."
"joby10095","8","1","4","8 July 2007"," Good escapist movie
","Transformers looks like it is going to be one of the biggest successes of the summer, and it is easy to see why. While this film won't go down as a great cinematic masterpiece, it will go down as one of the best films in a summer full of useless garbage. I have read quite a few of the negative reviews of this movie, and I can't really understand them. People complain about poor acting, a paper thin plot, and general cheesiness. I just want to ask what they expected from a summer blockbuster popcorn flick. It is based on a 1980s cartoon show for crying out loud. I have to say, I liked the movie. There was a lot of action, the acting wasn't as bad as it could have been, and the special effects were jaw dropping. It is eye candy, designed to get people to to theater, and it worked well. It isn't Citizen Kane, and it doesn't pretend to be. It is a nice film, that doesn't preach too much, promises lots of excitement and action, and manages to deliver. It helped get my mind off of the fact that where I am living is dull, I don't know anyone, and my wife is only 2 months into a 15 month deployment.<br/><br/>The only thing I hope is that the studio doesn't get stupid and work on pumping out a really lousy sequel. Hopefully, this summer has convinced studios not to go down that road any more."
"farrukhaziz","9","1","4","8 July 2007"," Awesome!
","For me this movie started off as one of the best I have ever seen. The action was non-stop and the story and acting was good too. The humor did set it apart from normal action movies. Though I'm giving in 9/10 as the action did slow down at the point where the Autobots are introduced and meet Sam. Though again the action again picked up and was brilliant right to the end.<br/><br/>A few scenes did remind me of Armageddon that Michael Bay directed earlier. That movie is one of my favorites too. I liked the small reference when during an action scene the young boy with the camcorder says,""Man this is 100 times cooler than Armageddon""! Shia LeBeouf is definitely one to watch for the future. After his Disturbia here is another fine performance.<br/><br/>All in all, recommended highly!"
"trip_durden","7","1","4","7 July 2007"," More than meets the eye...
","'No sacrifice  No victory'  the underlying motto behind director Michael Bay's latest Hollywood special effects extravaganza, in which he reinvents the almost faded 80's cult- animated hit, Transformers, for the post 9/11 global climate, producing a film that is both visually spectacular and edge-of-your-seat entertaining right from the opening scene to the final credits. The narrative of this film is not new, and when the world as we know it is facing complete annihilation, America again comes to the fore as our fate balances in the hands of two warring extraterrestrial robot factions: the Autobots and the Decepticons. The Autobots, led by Optimus Prime (voiced by Australia's own Hugo Weaving), befriend Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf), whose ancestral legacy ties him to the unfolding drama. And along the ride Michael Bay makes countless costly sacrifices for the sake of entertainment; Buildings are demolished, cars are destroyed, explosions are plentiful  this is one ""loud"" movie  I could literally feel the action in the back row. <br/><br/>Much of the film has a familiar feel to it. Bay imports images that have become the common currency in post 9/11 media - military air-bases in Qatar, panning exterior shots of the Pentagon - and at times it reads a little too much like the NBC's 'War on Terror'. But he does poke fun at the current trend towards acronyms (although there are no WMD's to be found in this film). Veteran actor's John Turturro and John Voigt add weight to a youthful cast, including Australia's Rachael Taylor, as a Pentagon assigned signals expert, delivering the most politically significant message in the entire film, influencing the Americans to look beyond their earthly neighbours and the usual suspects in their hunt for the enemy.<br/><br/>There is definitely 'more than meets the eye' to this film, and I was taken by surprise by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtz's hilariously laugh-out-loud screenplay. Overflowing with sexual euphemisms, jibes (Aboard Air Force One the US President asks a flight attendant to ""wrangle me up some ding-dongs, darling""), and self-referential jokes (""This is easily a hundred times cooler than Armageddon""), the sharply comedic dialogue provides a nice counter balance to the relentless action that takes up the latter half of the film.<br/><br/>Adorned with state-of-the-art big boys toys (Prototype Camaros and F-22 Raptor Jets), the impressive CGI is seamlessly integrated into the regular stock. The final battle scene between Optimus Prime and the recently defrosted Megatron is technically ingenious for the way in which Sam Witwicky is melded into the CGI action. Technically, Transformers has set a new benchmark in the realm of computer-enhanced action, but this does little to distract from the typically formulaic manner in which the drama unfolds. Despite the primary colours and clichés with which Bay paints his latest epic, Transformers stands as a vibrant and exciting movie spectacular, with a poignant, albeit ambiguous political agenda, and a sound design that is worth the sacrifice of the admission price alone, and all the better to experience on the big screen."
"jdkraus","9","1","4","7 July 2007"," An action spectacle well worth the admission ticket price!
","Transformers were one of my favorite action figures I played with when I was a kid. As being much older now, I would never had expected Hollywood to make a movie based off of them and if they did, I had the strong sense that it would flop. But now I have seen it, and my judgments were proved totally wrong.<br/><br/>First off, I have to say that ""Transformers"" has the best; I repeat the BEST visual effects ever created, towering over ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"". The visuals were so authentic and awesome that they did not even look like computer-generated robots, but real ones. In the theater, I felt right in the movie with the robots as they fought each other against impossible odds.<br/><br/>Now, most movies with great action sequences and spectacular special effects seem to focus just on those two things and forget the actors and script. Unlike those kinds of movies, ""Transformers"" has a decent list of cast members from the significant roles of: Shia LeBeouf, John Duhammel, and Rachel Taylor to the smaller roles, including: John Voight, Bernie Mac, and John Turturro. Of those thespians, I have seen Shia LeBeouf in the fewest of movies. However, he was a great lead, especially for an action flick like ""Transformers"".<br/><br/>The story was very unrealistic, as expected, but it was interesting. Although, it did not have a corny feeling of heroism and emotional effect like ""Spider-man"" or ""Fantastic Four"" has; it did not feel like a ""comic book based"" movie. On the contrary, I was interested in the story, and it had a hint of emotion for the ""good guy"" robots. But it does not have a strong moral tale like ""Batman Begins"". Overall, I was highly impressed with this movie. There is no doubt that this should win Best Visual Effects in the Oscars! 9/10 <br/><br/>-This is not quite a kid's movie, due in part to the hearty and sometimes adult/sexual jokes."
"RCWjr","7","1","4","6 July 2007"," A solid effort
","I grew up with the Transformers and find the whole ""diehard"" nitpicking a bit ridiculous. The original cartoon was meant to be a tie-in to sell more toys, nothing more nothing less. Given that fact, all this pseudo gravitas created by the rabid following is funny to watch and listen to. If you take your Transformers THAT serious, stay home because this movie strives for nothing more than what we got with the early 80's cartoons.<br/><br/>Effects are spectacular, explosions and action are top notch. But then again, that is no surprise, this is a Michael Bay movie. People really need to get off the hate Bay band-wagon and just understand and know summer means getting the blazes away from the real world and stepping into a cooled theater and enjoying some fun. Bay knows how to do that in spades and gives it to us here.<br/><br/>The story is weak, holes through and through, but so what. The film succeeds in giving us exactly what we want from a Transformer film: robot's in action! If you have created some sort of alternate reality world where Transformers is about something more, again, stay home. There is comedic moment sprinkled all through the action. That does remove a sense of danger from the film, but then again, this wasn't supposed to be a rated R fest.<br/><br/>My only disappointment with the film is the score. Normally with a Bay production we get a great anthem of score music. There really isn't much in the way of that in the film. We get some coolly placed rock music, but the score never really reaches out and grabs you. I had hoped for a variation on the Transformer theme, but what we get is a by the numbers score.<br/><br/>This is another solid effort from Bay. A good way to get out of the heat of the summer and enjoy some fun."

Today, however, I was reading some reviews that were pointing out all these continuity errors and what not, and I started to think ""yea... those errors did happen."" But still, I had a great time with this film and if your gonna hate a movie because of some continuity errors and some minor holes in the story (specifically the disappearance of barricade, and I'm not talking about after the battle with bumble bee, cause some people were complaining how he was destroyed... maybe he just got damaged and recovered later on...it could happen).

","Last night, my friend and I went to cinema for this film. I read many good reviews on IMDb before going there but I went without any expectation about Transformer because I didn't want to be disappointed by this movie as I was disappointed by Spiderman 3. We took a sit at the very center . After a bunch of advertising the movie finally started. At the very first scenes I felt ""oh oh, really really not bad, it's not gonna suck"" and it really really didn't I sat tight on the chair and stared on the screen from the beginning to the end of the film. It was good, very good. I'm not gonna tell you about what I saw 'cause I want you guy to be curious as hell . Instead, I'm gonna say how good it is.<br/><br/>1. The movie scrolls fast enough for you to catch what's going on and not to be bored. Scenes go after scenes and things go after things logically and in an smooth order so that you always can follow what's on the screen. In addition, stupid actions, stupid talks, stupid situations are what you're NOT gonna find while watching Transformer.<br/><br/>2. Special effect, it is so stunning. This is what I like the most in this movie. Trust me, this movie will give you an opportunity to see a dozen of beautiful mighty and giant robots. But these huge pals are not merely mechanism, they have feeling and mind and even purposes , so that audience don't have to see fights between bunch of pure metal guys and more importantly this make the movie not to be a cartoon for children. And more about special effect, I really enjoyed the fights in the film, they were made so cool, however, the camera angels in fighting scene seem so close and you'll hardly see who fighting who on the screen.<br/><br/>3. Lots of funny stuff. Obviously, most of action films must have something something funny and this rule is like a golden key. However, where and when to put hilarious situations in is not so easy, if the crew did it wrong, the movie would be ridiculous somehow. Fortunately, Transformers really makes sense about when and where and how to make you laugh. This is another aspect to make you enjoy the film.These cool things form a awesome entertaining film which is worth the ticket.<br/><br/>Go see it if you don't want to miss a good time"

","When I walked out of the movie theater, I was at first disappointed. Deep down, I wanted Transformers to be a great movie, an epic on the same scale as LOTR or Star Wars. The dumb plot, the classic Michael Bay cheese, the brazen product placement all offended my cinema sensibilities. But the movie did bring back old memories, and made me reflect on why I loved the transformers cartoons (G1) in the first place.<br/><br/>What was the cartoon like? It was a show for kids, and well, the plot and ""acting"" were accessories to the daily struggles of Autobots vs. Decepticons. It gets worse: The entire show was created so Hasbro could sell toys. Even the greatest moment in Transformer history, Optimus' death, was motivated by Hasbro's desire to sell a new toyline; It was one giant product placement. Toss artistic integrity out the window right there. So why do so many of us love Transformers? Simple: there is nothing cooler than giant transforming robots fighting evil. And that is exactly what Michael Bay gave us. Say what you want, but Bay is one of the finest directors of action sequences. All of the films flaws, all of them, where forgiven the moment Bumblebee transformed. I couldn't help but enjoy myself as I watched old friends fight familiar battles in stunning CG glory.<br/><br/>Thank you Michael Bay, for letting me relive the joy I once experienced as a kid."

","As a young teen in 1984 I was a major fan of Transformers. So, when I learned it was coming out as a movie I was psyched, but worried that movie makers would screw it up and leave it unrecognizable.<br/><br/>I was there opening night, with my kids, ready for anything. What I saw on the screen was quintessential Transformers and I was Pleased. Even though it was updated to reflect the 12st Century, this was the Transformers I knew.<br/><br/>I would have liked to see more character development for the Transformers, and less for the humans. Much of the Transformers characterizations relied on knowledge of and referred to the original cartoon, such as Megatron's seemingly non-sequitor comment to Starscream regarding Starscream's repeated failures.<br/><br/>The good side to this is that for fans of the original Transformers, there were many references to the cartoon. The nature of the Transformers arrival was changed, as was their reason for being on Earth.<br/><br/>Transformers is NOT a movie for kids. I saw at least one mom taking her child (age 5?) out of the theater after repeated ""colorful"" language and violence, including many graphic scenes of human death, and overt sexual innuendo. Even the cartoon of the 80s was rather dark, one of the few cartoons where characters, human and Transformer, actually died in battle."
"Boricanator","9","1","4","5 July 2007"," The Best Sci Fi in 10 years
","Without a doubt the best Sci Fi in the last 10 years. I case your wondering, I have thought about the Star Wars Prequels and War of the Worlds. Honestly, this beats them both.<br/><br/>For starters it breaks away from this standard of making fictional, comic book-like colorful character from being too psychological. The director is basically saying, forget these standards, I'm making a movie about non-human characters, the best way to make this movie is by creating a fun movie about robots smashing each other. He keeps the plot simply and straight-to-the point, as it should be.<br/><br/>The screen-play kept you hooked. It presents such daily issued that almost anybody can relate with and merges it the transformers movie. We have the military and leadership perspective, the scientific perspective and the regular people perspective that is balance to the point of keeping our adrenaline pumping and have several laughs along the way. This is a breather from the all too serious Star Wars and, to mention Comic Book, Spiderman. Especially with Star Wars, you felt like it was a soap opera. Transformers is very true to the human reactions to the events; people running away, military and intelligence people trying to figure out was is wrong. Or even before the fighting starts, we say regular people living their regular lives and acting according to their backgrounds. Granted, the humor placed on it is a bit exaggerated, but no more exaggerated than the negative human reactions in Star Wars, which were way over the top.<br/><br/>What prevented it from being a perfect movie was that it over extended its ""increasing conflict"" and the lack of more action scene. Adding a few more robots, starting the battles quicker and extending them a bit would have made it truly exceptional. My advise to Michael Bay on this is not to be shy to make bigger Sci Fi movies. He has what it takes to make the big and great."

","Movies like Transformers are a double edged sword. On the same list as all superhero films, avant garde films like Pulp Fiction or Brokeback Mountain, or straight family films like Shrek or any Pixar film, you either love em or hate em. My husband is a huge fan of the cartoon-I am a product of the 80's and always watched ""My Little Pony"" and ""Strawberry Shortcake"". Transformers was for boys. I never watched it but I knew who a few of the characters were.<br/><br/>I didn't expect much from the film-I thought Michael Bay, bad actors, cheesy lines and pretty good effects. I really underestimated it. Actors were good, not many cheesy lines, effects ""off the hook"" ( i never use that word). You've never seen effects like this before. Un-freaking-believable.<br/><br/>Love it or hate it, just see it truly to be entertained. Most people expect films to change the world, I go to escape reality.

"arklier","8","1","4","5 July 2007"," Transform and roll out!
","I tried not to look up too much on the Transformers movie beforehand, because I wanted a fresh experience when I did see it. These days it's possible to find out pretty much everything about any big movie before you even see it, and I didn't want that to happen to me. I also hadn't seen any of Michael Bay's movies previous to this, so I didn't come in with any preconceived notions about the director. As someone who was a kid back in the G1 days, I haven't really kept up with any of the current story lines since Beast Wars. There are also some scenes interspersed with the credits, so it pays to not leave as soon as the credits roll.<br/><br/>The good: The special effects were spectacular, as expected. You really got a sense of how *big* and awesome the TFs are. There are some funny moments to break the tension, including some that had the entire theater in stitches. The main characters got a lot of characterization and there was a good human angle on the story. Prime's voice is done by his original VA, Peter Cullen (who sounds older than he did in the G1 cartoon, but I suppose that's because he IS older). There are also some memorable quotes pulled from the first TF movie.<br/><br/>The bad: While I understand the need for updated vehicle modes, I wish that the TF's robot forms looked closer to their G1 counterpart's, even if it was just in the facial features. If you're familiar with the Alternators toy line, they're a good example of how IMHO the TFs *should* look in robot mode. Some of the TFs got very few lines, and thus not much in the way of characterization. I would have preferred there to be some interaction scenes between the Decepticons, to show their personalities better. The movie didn't use the 'transforming sound', it's just kind of a mechanical clanking and whirring.<br/><br/>The neutral: The story deviates from the classic G1 storyline on how the TFs came to Earth. It's still 'giant alien robots come to Earth' but the details are different. Prime has the face shield, but it's retractable and he spends most of his screen time with it off. It's kind of odd for me to see him with a mouth, but then again, this isn't the first time he's had one. Some of the characters do get killed, but due to their lack of characterization, it's hard for me to feel for them like I did when characters died in the first TF movie. There is some swearing and sexually themed jokes, so I don't know about taking really young kids to see it if you're hung up on stuff like that, but teens should be fine.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is full of win and well worth the $9 it cost me to see it."

","You can tell that each scene is a crafted work of art. The sound, the directing, and graphics are all fine tuned on each frame. I am VERY picky about movies looking fake and I have a very good eye for detail and I can assure you this movie will live up to and beat your every expectation. The micromanagement of detail is so well done the film looks very clean and not fragmented. The trash talking that the robots do while fighting does not sound boring or blah, its actually funny and entertaining. If I had to choose a few things that I would change about the movie it would be the mood, i would make it more serious and less funny but that could be just me. Also the S7 actor was an over actor and was kind of annoying at times but died off just in time to watch the end fight."
"Basilisks_Gaze","9","1","4","4 July 2007"," A fun movie, full of explosions and smashing things.
","I, personally, loved this movie. I never watched the cartoon and never saw the first movie, so I don't know as much as most people, but I can say, honestly, that this is probably the best movie I'll see all summer. Megatron genuinely scares me, and Bumblebee is awesome. I love him in the beginning. Optimus Prime is also absolutely amazing. I love his character and was so glad it was Megatron instead of him at the end of the movie. Megatron was a fun villain too. As I said, genuinely scary. The mouthful of metal teeth add to it. And his voice makes me shiver. Absolutely amazing. I kind of wanted him to live. Sam was an interesting character, despite the fact that he's a human, not a Transformer. A relatively normal teenage boy--plus the well-worn ""unpopular boy get the beautiful girl"" ending, but you can't say you didn't see it coming. If you want to see this movie, you MUST see it in theaters. It just won't be the same on a normal TV with normal sound."

","the story line was good as well as the graphics. the only problem was the camera angles, they were horrible, you didn't always get a full view of what was going on in a particular seen. you found yourself moving your head around trying to see the rest of the scene when in fact it wasn't there for you to see. the story line was good and it was given in full detail, it wasn't the kind of movie where you were guessing half the time what was going to happen. it was a pretty heart filled movie and it moved you to a certain extent. it certainly wasn't a good movie for the younger kids. but all in all it was a pretty good movie and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a quick thrill leaving you with the after affect of wanting to live the movie."
"griffinbranham","9","1","4","4 July 2007"," Transformers delivers exactly what it promised
","I went to see Transformers on opening night with a group of friends. I went in expecting a lot of action, some cool looking transforming robots, and of course Megan Fox. The movie delivered exactly that, and to my surprise, a little more. The special effects are unlike anything I have ever seen. Industrial Light & Magic should be handed their visual effects Oscar right now - the competition is probably over.<br/><br/>However, several of my friends were disappointed with the movie. They claimed that the acting wasn't great and neither was the storyline. I thought, ""What were you expecting?"" While their gripes were mostly true - the acting isn't anything spectacular, clichés were abound, and there are a few unnecessary scenes that could have been edited out to cut down on the film's long run time - I didn't care. I loved all of it because it was fun as hell. Robots morphing into fighters jets and back again in mid-air, a tiny CD-player robot that later turns into a cell phone, Megatron and Optimus Prime beating on each other, smashing through buildings and jumping across rooftops. It's really a spectacle, and that really isn't ALL that the movie delivers.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf is excellent again, returning from Disturbia-mode with the same awkward teenager humor. I thought he was hilarious - check out the scene when he talks to Megan Fox for the first time as he gives her a ride in his new car. John Turturro's appearance halfway through the film was a warm welcome. He shows his oddball side to good effect. Bernie Mac and Anthony Anderson's small parts were hilarious; par for them. And I can't talk about the actors without mentioned Megan Fox. It sure as hell doesn't hurt a movie like this to have one of the hottest females on the planet appearing in most of the scenes.<br/><br/>All in all, despite its shortcomings, Transformers packs enough of a punch with its incredible special effects and several diamond-in-the-rough non-action scenes that it will live on as a classic, especially if the two reported sequels can match its flare."
"Selestia","10","1","4","4 July 2007"," Two words sum it all up...
","Yes, only two words sum it all up: ""Freakin' awesome!"" Or so that's what a five year-old told me after we saw it last night at the Tuesday release.<br/><br/>Growing up on Transformers and other 80's cartoons (and comics, toys), this was well worth the wait. Micheal Bay delivers like expected: high-octane action that gets you from the beginning and doesn't let you go until the very last scene. (The theatre was packed full of children--and after ten minutes, NO ONE was talking or leaving their seats. Unheard of.) The detail on the Transformers has already been laid on so thick by other reviews--and that's because not enough can be said about it! The robots are almost obsessively detailed, which makes them extremely realistic, and makes you think that this really could happen. Even die-hard fans will find the upgrades on the Transformers themselves believable, understandable, and mind-blowing.<br/><br/>There has been criticism about the camera play and grainy, incoherent battle scenes, but I found them realistic and cohesive--especially when you're a puny human trying to watch two 20-30 foot robots destroy each other. Perspective makes it harder to believe, and to see. Bay makes the camera angles very realistic by showing us what we would see if we were are ground zero.<br/><br/>And also, like said in previous reviews, the storyline was a bit on the weak side. Or at least not what you would be expecting from a movie called ""Transformers."" Humans played too large a part for a movie about alien robots. I'm sure they'll compensate for this in the rumored sequel--which I'm sure after this weekend won't be a rumor anymore.<br/><br/>My biggest quirk with the storyline and dialogue was the rampant comedy--particularly the rather crude and childish wording and actions. (Bumblebee's lubrication of the Sector Seven guy, or Mom's ""private"" talk, anyone?) Shia LeBouf, renowned for his comedy, was more than enough to keep the laughs in the theatre without ""potty humor."" This was not a obscenely-budgeted film, but that did not effect the quality of the actors one iota. From Shia to Jon Voight, Bernie Mac and voice talents of Peter Cullen (who we fondly remember as the original Optimus Prime) and Hugo Weaving, the cast was solid and believable.<br/><br/>The music score was outstanding. Steve Jablonsky, usually a composer for the horror-thriller genre, did a stand-up and recognizable job at keeping the music flowing and up with the action, making sure that there was never a dull moment. (I particularly liked the almost hymnal score piece while the Autobots were coming to Earth to Sam.) Linkin Park, Goo Goo Dolls, Disturbed and several other notables lended their talents to the score and to the soundtrack--I'm gonna put it on my must-have list.<br/><br/>All-in-all, this is the blockbuster family movie that is a must-see for anyone who lived on Transformers as kid. Oh, and bring your kids, too.<br/><br/>9/10"
"dwpeak","8","1","4","3 July 2007"," Michael Bay's Best Film
","TRANSFORMERS<br/><br/>**** stars out of 5 (8/10).<br/><br/>I tend to like or dislike Michael Bay's films, more often for the latter. His latest movie, ""Transformers"", is a big success. It is funny and thoroughly entertaining.<br/><br/>Sam Witwicky (SHIA LABEOUF) is an isolated teenager who buys an old camaro with the help of his father. In fact, the car is a transformer, here with his comrades to save the human race from destruction. There are evil transformers (forgive me die hard fans, I don't recall the name) who are trying to steal a cube that helps form planets. Instead of using it for good, they plan on using it to dominate the earth and create a planet more fit for themselves. The Autobots (the good guys) understand the human viewpoint and want to help. All the while, the government tries to figure out what is going on, and determines how to stop the machines.<br/><br/>In the end credits, the movie says it's based on the action figures. I'm sure they borrowed from the old t.v. show as well, but I'd never thought this would happen; being blown out of my seat at a movie inspired by toys. By my plot description above, the movie doesn't sound funny at all. Let me tell you something; it's hilarious. The audience and I were cracking up for about two hours. In fact, it is one of the movie's strongest points. The sharp writing and the quick delivery makes it all the better. Even the transformers are able to crack one-liners and it's all a whole lot of fun.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf is in top form here, as he was in ""Disturbia"". The beautiful MEGAN FOX gets the job done as Mikaela Banes, the school babe who is more than meets the eye. The other standouts would be ANTHONY ANDERSON and JOHN TURTURRO who give us two more hilarious performances. JOHN VOIGHT is worth recommending, because he hardly delivers a mediocre role. This movie is non-stop entertainment. The action scenes are exciting and well-directed. The amount of effort that had to go in this film must be staggering. The CGI is beyond stunning, and the film reaches a certain level of art.<br/><br/>The movie has a few teen romance clichés, and the end climax is too long and can be overwhelming. The giant robots deliver cheesy lines about how they're going to dominate each other. Nonetheless, it is well-shot and very fun. <br/><br/>That's what this film is; fun. There's not much else to it. Everyone on and off camera appears to be having a great time and they deliver one great roller coaster ride; one of full of laughs and stunning visuals."

","I grew up watching Transformers on and off. I knew who the good and bad guys were, but I never got the whole plot of the cartoon series. To me, it was just a cartoon with vehicles that can turn into robots and forever fighting. It was mostly dreary (to me). After all, what would you expect out of a girl who was clearly more interested in watching Tom and Jerry?<br/><br/>Watching this movie found me in a theatre full of children that got me puzzling if they even knew that there was a cartoon called Transformers. The plot of the movie was entertaining, funny and mostly flawless. However, I guess most of the humour was lost on children too young to even understand the dialogue.<br/><br/>The graphics were lovely, the cars lovelier still. The movie actually got me interested in wanting to know what comes next and rooting for the characters. To sum it up, I was kept at the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>If there is to be a sequel, I look forward to it, minus the children."

"TOMNEL","5","1","5","31 July 2008"," A sci fi action flick, where everyone is a comedian, that isn't very funny or thrilling.
","Michael Bay is not the best director out there, but if there's one thing he can do, it's make a cruddy movie laden with special effects, ala Pearl Harbor. Transformers is so full of special effects my eyes practically burst from the nonstop effects. That's not a bad thing. In this case Michael Bay's big budget stupid blockbuster Transformers needed all these special effects. The problem with all his other films is how the effects consume the picture and there's no room for character development. There's character development here...so what's the problem? The characters suck! Other than Megan Fox who's on screen to bring in the teenage boys that would've seen this anyways, every character, including the Transformers, are comedians. That would be fine, but none of their comedic styles fit in what is supposed to be a popcorn munching action flick. There are many other problems to go with that, but this is what really annoyed me, though other people seemed to enjoy that.<br/><br/>Sam Witwicky (Shia Labeuf) has a promise from his father that if he earns good grades, he will get a new car. He does, and he gets his new car...but it's not just a car. It drives him around sometimes, and plays music that fits the situation. In fact, this must not be a car at all. Of course not, it's a Transformer autobot named Bumblebee, and Sam is needed by the Transformers because of his late grandfather's run in with the bad bot, Decepticon, and Decepticon's code is imprinted on his g'pa's glasses. Meanwhile, Sam is going around with the popular cute girl in school Mikaela (Megan Fox), and she and Sam, along with several other story lines of people, featuring Anthony Anderson as a scared computer nerd, Jon Voight as the Secretary of Defense, John Turturro as a mean agent and Josh Duhamel as a military man, all have run in's with the Transformers, good or bad.<br/><br/>I'll start with the negatives and move to the positives. The part of the movie where the car was playing love songs and driving itself was needed, I suppose, to move the plot along, but it reminded me of a bad rip-off of the Herbie the Love Bug movies. The humor was annoying (My biggest gripe!). Shia Labeuf has this manic, fast paced way he delivers each line, and after a while it gets very repetitive. The Transformers also do things that are supposed to be funny, like in one scene one of them drips fluid from their crotch area on someone, like they are peeing. This gets a big laugh from audiences, but for some reason only produced a dull groan in me. Anthony Anderson, known for his comedic roles, tells the female computer programmer he's with to be calm when the FBI comes in, and of course, he freaks out and starts crying...pretty obvious humor. Also, why does Optimus Prime want the cube attached to him? He doesn't think maybe they should attach it to the bad bot? I also didn't realize the Secretary of Defense just lets random people help him with problems...I certainly hope that's not the case.<br/><br/>Onto the positives. I liked the constantly switching story lines, because it gave the characters just enough time to be annoying before switching them. The special effects were grand and cool, and expensive, featuring streets blowing up and many other cool things you can only see in a big budget like this (150 mil). Though the humor was often stupid, at least this has a light tone so it's not dreary to watch.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a dumb blockbuster that put it's money where it's brains should be. But despite the problems, it was often entertaining, and I laughed a couple of times from the jokes that eventually just got to me (""Go to bed, handsome man"").<br/><br/>My rating: ** out of ****. 140 mins. PG-13 for violence, some language and sexual humor."
"snow-mblu","2","1","5","23 July 2008"," Predictable, ridiculous...
","I liked Transformers and that's why this movie disappointed even more.<br/><br/>It's just ridiculous. There are only two good things about this movie. Shia LaBeouf's performance because he's an amazing young actor (as you can see in Disturbia much better than in this movie) and the special effects. Oh, don't get me wrong the fighting scenes are well made. The transformers look great. But it's so predictable! Even the fighting scenes are predictable. I knew exactly when Optimus Prime was going to appear, when he or Bumblebee were going to save Sam and when Megatron would attack; because it was too obvious! The romance was ridiculous, after all she was his classmate and never noticed him, but hey, since she needed a ride, why not hook up with the guy with the car? Please... I found it offensive, because it represented male chauvinism.<br/><br/>I'm sorry to those who don't agree with me, but I can't say it's worth seeing, except for its especial effects and LaBeouf's performance, the rest of the movie is just bad. If you want to see a good mecha action movie this is not it."

","You know one day in future our descendants will look history and say how tasteless and simple minded we were in entertainment especially movie making , 7th art.

Add some stupid cr..py dialogue , US Armed Forces propaganda and a few hot chicks for eye candy : Here is Transformers. A huge excuse for massive explosions , typical Michael Bay (creator of Pearl Harbor disaster. Not the historical attack. Disaster of a movie made in 2000 I am talking about ) style. I bet he is laughing while counting big bucks he got by suckering all stupid 15 year old male target audience (MTV generation we might say) to theaters and showed them worst acted , edited and plotted film I have ever seen in my life. I really congratulate myself in fact because I had sense not to see it in movie theater and spend money on it. I just borrowed a DVD and wasted two hours no..no endured two hours of torture. I mean CGI and massive explosions are all nice but what about character development , proper acting , a sensible story ? You know essentials of a scenario or proper editing ? Nada , zero , none. Michael Bay must have assumed that we will be in love with giant robots fighting each other and USAAF aircraft firing missiles. But robots were not even primary characters. Primary characters are a boy who wishes to impress a hot chick , his first date , a bunch of US Army grunts , a hot chick computer hacker and her fat stupid hacker friend , Defence Secretary of US ( who is old veteran actor Jon Voight. He must really have been desperate for money to play this non character ). There are so many coincidences , convenient occurrences , clichéd plot points you really have to turn your brain off to see it to the end. Lame slapstick humor completes this whole mess and destroys whatever self respect these characters or movie itself had...<br/><br/>Hot damn I am annoyed. I will do my best to forget this latest Bay calamity. I think I need a therapy for that. Worst big budget movie after Independence Day. If this is the best they can do that means American movie industry is dead and buried long time ago. My recommendation to Bay. Quit movie making and start your own demolition business..."

","This film was over all good, BUT the content for children is ABSOLUTELY UNNECESSARY.<br/><br/>The movie did NOT need to include the transformer urinating on one of the government agents. And, especially the comment by the mother about masturbation, was TOTALLY UNNECESSARY and detracts from the movie and quality! I had my children watch this film because transformers are a children's toy and the writers or producers had to had ALL THAT filth and scum that children do NOT need to be EXPOSED to.<br/><br/>I am disappointed that my children could not see this wonderful high action film that was, in my opinion, good for the most part, BUT the movie producers and writers had to include the segment of garbage many conservative and Christian family would prefer NOT to have in a movie.<br/><br/>What is wrong with the movie industry is that they feel like sex, violence, and profanity WILL MAKE a MOVIE interesting and MORE Likable because this is the REAL world, so to speak, just because the REAL world is this way, DOESN'T necessarily mean we have to include this in the movies.<br/><br/>For example, women are not all slim, trim, and beautiful, BUT the models are...why do they NOT place fat, unattractive women as models? Thus, in movies they can remove ALL the GARBAGE that is NOT NECESSARY! Completely disappointed with the movie TRANSFORMERS!

"event3070","5","1","5","27 October 2007"," Don't Shia away from this one. You think that's bad, read the review.
","First and foremost, I should mention that I am not familiar with the cartoon. Therefore, my review will not compare this film to the cartoon in any way, shape or form. In fact, all movie long I was expecting the autobots to form together and become Voltron - different cartoon altogether as it turns out. What I'm trying to say is, if you're some sort of purist, this review is unlikely to help you. Then again, if you're a Transformers cartoon maniac, you're probably going to watch the movie no matter what I write here.<br/><br/>With that said, let's get on to the review. I liked it. I thought the movie was pretty entertaining, fun, and worth my time to watch it. Shia La-la-la--la boof! buff? Either way, gesundheit!. Yeah, he was good. He really made the movie for me, his unusual name aside. This guy is funny and offsets the action and suspense quite nicely, providing the audience with some relief from all the edge-of-your-seat hoopla.<br/><br/>Like I said, overall the film was pretty good. I can't give it more than a 5/10 though because aside from the action and the drop of humor mixed in, this film really wasn't about anything. Alien robots duke it out on Earth's soil, horny teenager gets involved, girl has history of family issues - hardly vital to the story, and all this drama for what - a cube? This must be one hell of a cube, probably kicks the Rubik's cube to the curb, I imagine. I guess with a movie of this sort though, the story/plot/order of events is simply a vehicle for all that kick-arse action. That's fine of course, if you like that sort of thing.<br/><br/>For me to have given this film a better rating, it would have needed a more compelling story with some sort of theme, purpose, reason for existing other than to have its audience drool over its coolness. I like my films to be a little more meaningful, I guess. You know, artsy fartsy. Sometimes just fartsy.<br/><br/>This film was neither of course, but I still think it's worth watching. Hey, just look at its rating! Someone's likin' it."
"Matt_Layden","8","1","5","27 October 2007"," Better Then Most Of Bay's Other Work.
","To make this story short, good alien robots and bad alien robots crash on earth to find a cube. One wants to destroy it, the other wants total domination.<br/><br/>When you go into a Michael Bay film you can expect 2 things to happen. One, balls to the wall action, involving car chases, shoot outs and explosions. Two, characters that have no arc what so ever and we don't really seem to care about them. Such is the case with Transformers. The only difference is, this film is based on a television/toy from the same name, so it's fan base knows the characters and feels attached to them anyway. You can now add Transformers to the list of films that have been transfered from either: Television show, video game, toy, and comic. Unlike 80 percent of films based on these things, Transformers is actually good. This is a big statement, this is the same guy that took a historic moment in American history and turned it into some sappy bad love story. He's back on his game, when he did The Rock.<br/><br/>The die hard fans of Transformers will point out it's flaws from the get go, these so called flaws do not affect the film one bit. In fact it helps, the fact that they changed it to fit any kind of reality in film. Do we really want to see Megatron transform into a giant gun, and do the colours of Optimus Prime really matter on the semi? Fans complained that there was no white spider on the suit of Black Spiderman and there's no exception here either.<br/><br/>Don't be afraid to see the film if you have no idea about the characters previously. It's simple, blue eyes are good, red eyes are bad. They look like normal machines, but transform into giant robots. I myself never watched the show, I did watch Beast Wars though, a spin off series in which they would transform into pre-historic animal on earth, instead of cars. The main reason to be seeing this film, is to watch some badass robots blowing stuff up trying to kill each other, while destroying the city we live in. This is accomplished, but we also have to be sidetracked through boring non-important sub-plot involving humans.<br/><br/>There are two characters that could have been completely cut out, or transformed, no pun intended, into one character. This could have saved time, time that could have been added to what the people want to see, giant robots. The two characters in question are Anthony Anderson and Rachael Taylor. Here are two people, for other then some comic relief and tech mumbo-jumbo serve no purpose to the advancement of the story. Does she really need a guy whose better at the stuff then she is? Why can she simply be the best and do whatever it is he does? Secondly, there is another subplot the is mentioned but never explored. Megan Fox's characters father has a record and this is used against her...for 2 minutes, then it gets cleared, one scene of drama between two characters, then it's pushed away never to be seen again. These things fall under the one of the two expected things to happen at a BAY film.<br/><br/>The other, the action, is in full swing. You'll get goose bumps when you first see them transform, then again when they are in action, destroying the city around them. Everything is so well created that one can actually believe this is happening in the city. I can see some awards thrown this way for special effects. In a time when people have seen spidermen swings through cities, pirates sailing the seas and hobbits roaming to a mountain, it takes something special to be able to make the audience drop their jaws in awe. This film does that.<br/><br/>Even though there are plot holes, such as where did Barricade go after he led the other Decepticons into battle in the city? What happened to the x-box, steering wheel and pop machine after they transformed? How does someone as hot as Megan Fox end up with the kid from Even Stevens? Things we will never know. The film has a few surprising faces that pop up. The voice of Agent Smith makes an appearance as the head bad guy, John Turturro, John Voight, Bernie Mac, Zack Ward pop up here and there. I was expecting to see Steve Buscemi be some kind of comic relief guy, but to my disappointment.<br/><br/>Transformers has a few steps it misses on that ladder to greatness. A long running time, missing plot holes and character we couldn't care for round up the most of it. I'm sure there are other things, but we go to see this film for one thing. Giant Robots In Action. That my friend is what it delivers, it a breathtaking final scene within the city. Jets fly through buildings, tanks fire left right and centre, crazy is not even a way to describe it. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a popcorn movie, that is really really loud."
"Boloxxxi","5","1","5","30 September 2007"," Machines try to stop another from getting a cube -else the earth is screwed.
","When a movie is not as good as it could have been it's usually not the fault of the FX people. They deliver 99% of the time (when it's not low-budget). And it's usually not the fault of a seasoned actor if a movie is lucky enough to snag one. This movie snagged Jon Voight who played his role as a general or secretary of state (I forget which) straight as an arrow. Good for him. I only wish everyone else had done the same thing.<br/><br/>Let me explain: I guess you could call this movie a ""sci-fi semi-comedy"" whose humor was largely supposed to be in the dialogue and the antics of an uncute mini-transformer . Trouble is, though trying hard to be, the dialogue wasn't funny and got on my nerves big time. Honestly, I had a border-line migraine from the unfunny chatter. There were at least 3 occasions (maybe more) where I can remember thinking ""Shut the f**k up, already!"" The principal offender was the ""Disturbia"" guy who seems to be type-cast 'cause he was doing his nervous, babbling, blundering when-I-see-a-girl-I-like and when-there's-a-crisis shtick. Somehow the pretty girl in the movie is always attracted to him and I seriously wonder why. Maybe they feel his constant nervous blathering is disarming and even cute; perhaps even flattering. They probably also figure that any man who is this tongue-tied and bumbling over a woman would make a nice pet.<br/><br/>To help young Disturbia out with the unfunny chatter was a brief appearance (mercifully) by Bernie Mac who plays a fast-talking car salesman (Was this one of those times when I said ""Shut the f**k up?""). Now I don't know if it's just me, but it seems like the more success some comedians achieve the less funny they become; just not as sharp as the good old days when they had their ""A-game"" going on. Also on hand to help Disturbia (I don't know the guy's name folks) tank this movie was Anthony Anderson with more unfunny yak yak. (No memory loss here; I did say ""Shut the f**k up, already!"" to this guy on his intro.) <br/><br/>Finally, parents take note: kids, because they tend to be less critical, would enjoy this movie more because of the cool machines and special effects. I myself would also have enjoyed this movie more if the rest of the cast played their roles as dignified and straight as Jon Voight. There was just too much unfunny motor mouthing going on for me. And the end of the movie reminded me of why I generally don't like war movies: too noisy and confusing. You know- Who's doing what to who, and why? Etc, etc, etc. KA-BOOM! CRASH! BANG! <br/><br/>Aspirins, anyone? <br/><br/>Love, Boloxxxi."
"Rob_Taylor","6","1","5","26 September 2007"," Transformers....Michael Bay in disguise....badly
","Hmmm....where to start. Well, its a Michael Bay film, so I was fairly certain I'd get plenty of action, which is true of the movie. I also expected, and was not unpleasantly gratified to note, that common sense would play second fiddle to creating contrived scenes in order to generate a more ""vibrant"" feel. This last isn't always a bad thing, but common sense must be paid at least lip-service or things just end up looking foolish.<br/><br/>In Transformers, the heroes insult your intellect by having the super-power module, The Allspark, taken from its hidden repository and transported into the middle of a major city. What's wrong with this picture? Oh yeah, the incredibly violent badbots(TM) are sure to follow and rain carnage on said city. Duh! Common sense is...drive it out to the desert, wait until the badbots (TM) show up, then nuke the lot of them. Problem solved.<br/><br/>Despite this typical Bay foolishness, the movie entertains well enough and moves along at a fair pace. It IS fun, but could have been a lot better. Characters are reasonable drawn, except for the bots, who you are almost expected to know before you go to watch the movie. The effects of the transformation sequences are well done, but happen a bit too quickly for you to fully appreciate them. In fact, a lot of the action takes place at such a pace that you can lose track of who's where, fighting who etc.<br/><br/>There are a lot of comic bits that serve to add nothing to the film other than grate on the nerves, however. The tiny scoutbot that tracks the hero (Shia LaBouef) is particularly pointless and comical, uttering needless little growls and squawks that put you in mind of Gremlins. Utterly stupid.<br/><br/>However, as I have mentioned, the film isn't awful. With a bit more attention to sense, rather than contrived scenes, it could have been great."
"DarkSkyX","5","1","5","26 September 2007"," I walked in to this moving hoping for some serious scifi... boy was I misled!
","I walked into this moving thinking (hoping) it was a ""serious"" sci-fi movie, kind of like Independence Day. Sure have comical characters but the flick having a dark undertone. It starts off this way, showing lots of human death, but the unrealistic and comical characters of the Defense Secretary (Jon Voight) and Agent Simmons (Turturro) throws all this out the window.<br/><br/>Pros: good effects for the most part, good action.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/><ul><li>although the CG was good for the most part, there were some scenes when the CG guys seemed to have decided they just couldn't be bothered to get the lighting/shadows/focus of the subjects done correctly - some of the CG scenes were poorly done in comparison to others. - since when does the Defense Secretary run around shooting guns with a bunch of high school kids? Isn't the defense secretary usually considered a military VIP?? - since when does a military captain get to call the shots on what the entire military does? He orders in all sorts of things throughout the film without ever having to get an OK from anybody, and talks to the defence secretary like they're cop partners. - what happened to the rest of the army!? It was basically Josh, Tyrese, and Voight representing the military the whole movie. - THE TRANSFORMERS. In the cartoons/figures they were made up of maybe a dozen or so large solid moving parts. In the movie they're made up of, I don't know, say a HUNDRED THOUSAND parts all of which being no bigger than a Rubiks Cube. They were such a huge collection of such small parts there doesn't seem any way their overall structure could have ANY kind of strength. Being made up of such a massive amount of tiny parts they look like they'd just fall apart, and have pieces falling off them all the time. - THE TRANSFORMERS: Some times it takes then a full 5 seconds for their thousands upon thousands of parts to move around during transformation, but in another scene they do it in the blink of any eye! Then in yet another scene they start changing, and the changing goes on.. and on.. and on... and on.... - How convenient the downtown core was completely void of people within half a minute for them to have their battle in. - just too much junk on the screen at once during many of the fight scenes.</li></ul><br/><br/>All in all, it's a movie that teases you as a serious sci-fi flick, but ends up being a movie made up of comical characters, possessing little realism, and is best suited for an audience 13 and under if it wasn't for the masturbation references and large amount of human death and violence."
"dinesh_cena1989","5","1","5","8 September 2007"," Micheal Bay's TRANSFORMERS quite often slips away from the spirit of the series
","If you are a person who likes great paced roaring action adventures with a delightful twitch, watch THE TERMINATOR. A movie like this is like what I just mentioned. These are the elements Micheal Bay's TRANSFORMERS tried to desperately achieve. Let us just assumer Bay was a great director. Wait, lets think twice.<br/><br/>The main character of Kyle played by budding actor Shia LaBeouf has he discovers his car which goes haywire and ends up to be a transformer. Halfway across the world in the deserts of Iraq, an American fighter and his crew are being terrorized by these monstrous robots. We then see reasonably well-done graphics pacing with the action as government officials try to track and stop this invasion.<br/><br/>Transformers comes under the category of science fiction. It is quite possibly the most demanding genre to work on. Firstly, if it based on previous television series, comic books etc., fans want to feel the excitement and pace of what they've seen and read brought to life on the screen. Apparently, Bay isn't aware of this phenomenon. He throws in extreme graphics and choreographed camera movements to match the extreme graphics. Although the movie is a Spielberg orientation, it drifts away from the TRANSFORMERS everyone read. I was not impressed by what I saw in the theater. A Spielberg direction would have changed everything into a stellar great-one."

","There have been several movies that have changed my idea of thinking of the film business. King Kong and Lord of the Rings being some of them. Transformers is one of those movies, but for a different reason. When I saw the teaser trailer at Pirates of the Caribbean last year I laughed. The idea seemed absurd, but the finished product was spectacular. I not only was blown away by the action, but i was amazed at how awesome Michael Bay made a movie about a toy aimed for 8 year olds (sorry Transformers fans.) The humor was genuinely laughable. The characters (for the most part) were well written and the special effects were ground breaking. Transformers deserves its 8 out of ten. I want to give it higher but if it did i would be putting this movie with the likes of The Godfather or Return of the King and that just doesn't seem to fit."

","This film is the fight between two gangs of robotic creatures for the mysterious energy reserve called The Cube.<br/><br/>The special effects are so amazing.

It is such an impressive job to have several robots transforming on a busy street, with the army shooting at them and people escaping in all directions. Apart from the visual feast, the story has a human touch as well, as shown by the emotions of robots. It has a gripping story, and it unfolds little by little at the right pace. This film simply redefines what a mega-budget blockbuster looks like."
"leftwingmofo","4","1","5","3 August 2007"," Someone messed up.
","There's apparently a T-shirt going around which reads, ""Michael Bay raped my childhood."" Since Transformers didn't play a huge part of my youth, I can safely say my childhood remains pure and untouched, but that doesn't take away from the fact that this movie is terribly flawed.<br/><br/>People seem to be overwhelmed by the beautiful CGI, and I admit the Autobots and Decepticons both look fantastic. The transformations and movement are fluid and I was as impressed as everyone else. But I didn't let that blind me to the simple fact that the script was not becoming of such a well-loved franchise.<br/><br/>If you're make a film about giant alien robots that can turn into motor vehicles and fight each other with giant cannons, don't make us wait forty minutes to see any kind of action. With the exception of the Decepticon attack on a US military base in Qatar, there was virtually no robot-related activity for the first half an hour. Bumblebee was in almost every scene following his introduction, yet we have to wait and wait and wait to see him transform.<br/><br/>Now maybe I'm looking at this the wrong way. Maybe they needed that time to properly introduce the human characters. But the last time I checked, the title of the movie was TRANSFORMERS. I like Shia LeBeouf as much as anybody else, but if I wanted to watch a film about Even Stevens' attempts to get a girlfriend, I wouldn't have paid to see TRANSFORMERS.<br/><br/>And another thing - who had the bright idea of keeping Megatron (you know, the main antagonist) stuck in a bunker until the third act? And when he and Optimus Prime finally, FINALLY, get to fight, who thought it would be a really great idea to cut back to the soldiers in the middle of the robot-on-robot beatdown that everybody waited two God damn hours to see? I'm giving the film 4 out of 10 purely because the Transformers were brilliantly realised. It's just a shame all that good CGI went to waste. The possibility of a sequel is there, especially as I'm sure the film will do great business at the box office. I just hope they hire a new screenwriter for it. Someone really messed up when it came to making this movie."
"EUyeshima","6","1","5","2 August 2007"," Clang! Clang! Clang! Went the Shape-Shifting Robots With a Helpful Dose of Comedy to Boot
","Director Michael Bay will never win any awards for subtlety with his industrial-strength, testosterone-heavy popcorn movies. His prevalent use of quick cuts and hand-held shots, compounded by car chases, explosions and other CGI-saturated effects, are all accounted for in this juvenile-oriented 2007 action picture, but I have to admit that there is a welcome sense of humor in the screenplay by Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci that manages to bring this one a cut above Bay's previous endeavors like The Island. Humor is a smart approach in tackling potentially unfamiliar terrain such as Hasbro's Transformers franchise, which had its heyday in the 1980's, before much of the film's audience was born. Yet, at the same time, there is a need to remain true to the spirit of the original premise without changing it in order to pacify baby boomers who would not accept anything less than the myth. In meeting both those objectives, the film meets expectations as an intermittently entertaining summer film.<br/><br/>The convoluted story has to do with two warring factions of shape-changing robots - the heroic Autobots and the villainous Decepticons - who both depend on a monolithic entity known as the Cube for sustaining their races. Just how it does it is beyond my comprehension, as do most of the plot details having to do with the Transformers and their planet Cybertron. What make marginally more sense is the main storyline around an awkward, huckstering teenager named Sam Witwicky, who is the descendant of an explorer whose glasses hold the key to the Cube. Sam wants a car badly and gets a beat-up Camaro which naturally turns out to be an Autobot. He also wants Mikaela, a girl who seems way out of his league until her mechanical skills and checkered past come to the fore. While this boy-meets-car-and-girl story is simmering, there are other subplots involving an army unit in the Middle East battling the Decepticons, a computer hacker who frustrates the Secretary of Defense with her complex yet undeniable deductive reasoning, and a group of X-Files-type agents, led by an overbearing zealot, who try to take Sam and Mikaela into custody.<br/><br/>There doesn't seem to be great priority placed on resolving the various plot lines, except for the first one and only after twenty minutes of quick-action destruction held mostly in medium shots in an assumed attempt to exaggerate the parameters of the action. Oddly, the climax has more of a benumbing effect since it's difficult to tell the scope of the action with much of it feeling clunky and repetitive until the exhausting finish. Before that, many scenes come across as inexplicable, over-explained or just too drawn out to enjoy fully, for example, the comically clumsy Autobots hiding around Sam's parents' house. Emphasizing the derivative nature of Bay's approach here are snatches of film classics like The Terminator and especially King Kong used throughout, and the influence of executive producer Steven Spielberg can be felt in Sam's responsibility-driven storyline.<br/><br/>Bay and the screenwriters deserve credit for humanizing the robots just enough to make them compelling to the viewer, though honestly not enough to empathize that much with their fates. It's not for lack of trying, as for example, Peter Cullen, the original voice of Optimus Prime, provides stentorian fervor and palpable dignity to the role. The human performances are in line with a comic-book-style franchise. Shia LaBeouf has the most screen time as Sam. The young actor makes Sam a likable reluctant hero, though he's fairly limited beyond his constant look of amazement. The real scene stealers are John Turturro as the unctuous agent, Anthony Anderson as a squealing hacker and recent Tony winner Julie White as Sam's overprotective mother. Barely registering is Josh Duhamel as the heroic head of the army unit and Megan Fox in form-fitting wear as Mikaela. All in all, it's pretty clear that the movie defies logic and relies heavily on sensory overload to sustain itself. The unexpected comedy elements are what make it better than at least what I expected."
"drmaloof","5","1","5","1 August 2007"," Disappointing
","The movie is disappointing in general.<br/><br/>I am a transformers fan since the 80s, when i used to watch the cartoons as a kid. I really was expecting a lot more, and then i found a very bad plot and bad quality humor. They tried to reach all kind of public with bad quality jokes and subplots. The soundtrack is one of the worst soundtracks i've ever heard. <br/><br/>Also, during many scenes of the movie, you will notice something familiar... IT IS like ""Independence Day""... oh wait, when was the official release date of the movie??. Look again when the Secretary of Defense go into the chamber where Megatron is frozen... doesn't it look like the scene when the president enters Area 51 and see the crashed alien ship?? You will find many more similarities by yourselves, but i wont talk about them all in this post.<br/><br/>In other hand, special effects are OK. Not as ""super-uber-cool"" and ""revolutionary"" as i heard and read from people, but they are OK.<br/><br/>And please, if they are actually thinking to film a second part, please ask other writers to make the script and focus it to one kind of audience (kids, teens or adults... NOT ALL AT TIME)."
"ExpendableMan","7","1","5","1 August 2007"," Good news everyone, they haven't screwed it up
","Before you read the following review, I want you to be aware of something: I am a huge Transformers nerd. Not big enough to name myself after obscure Japanese Decepticons or anything, but still geeky enough to have amassed a sizable collection of merchandise and regularly cry myself to sleep muttering ""oh Megatron, nobody loves you but me."" Therefore it was with some trepidation that I approached the eagerly awaited live action movie, especially seeing as all the pre-release hype seemed to be focused on Megan Fox bending over a car bonnet. And that it was made by Michael Bay and the last time he made a film with ""tremendous respect for the source material,"" we got the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Thus it is with some relief that I can sit here and tell you that the best thing about Transformers is that isn't a complete disaster. In fact it's really very good and one of the strongest no-brain blockbusters to turn up in a summer that's been filled with them. However, it's not without its faults.<br/><br/>Now given my little introduction above, you're probably thinking I'm going to spend the entire word limit complaining about the character designs but I'll try not to. This is an entirely new spin after all and moaning about how Ironhide doesn't look like Ironhide anymore isn't going to achieve anything, (did Frenzy really have to be an irritating gremlin with a comedy voice though?). However, what can't be denied is that the majority of the Transformers in this film have zero characterisation and consequently, in the huge mass of violence that closes the movie, it's sometimes difficult to tell who we are meant to be cheering for. In fact only Optimus Prime gets a decent depiction and even Bumblebee, for all his screen time, is robbed of significant development by being burdened with the irritating gimmick of talking through an in-car radio, effectively ruining any chance of a meaningful, ET-style friendship to develop between him and Sam (Shia Lebeouf).<br/><br/>On the plus side though, Lebeouf is really good. In fact, he's probably the best thing about the entire film, high praise indeed considering he's been cast as the human foil for audiences to cling onto when all they really want is two hours of robots smacking the living daylights out of each other. As Sam, he is nerdish enough to convince you that he could slip under the school hottie's radar for five years but at the same time, possesses a charm and sense of humour to ensure he doesn't go walking around with a ""gee whizz, how cool"" demeanour whenever a car explodes.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the Spielberg influence is rife and gives the film a welcome degree of comedy. Sam's attempt to hide five robots that are bigger than his house from his delightfully-odd parents is arguably, the highlight of the storyline. It gives the proceedings a very human element which is lacking in all the scenes where Sam doesn't appear - the attempts to humanise the soldiers in the generic military combat zone at the beginning for instance are horribly cheesy and serve only to let anyone who's seen more than five films know that they'll be dead within seconds.<br/><br/>And then there's the action. Where would a Michael Bay film be without action? And Transformers delivers the goods but sadly, doesn't deliver them enough. Three scenes really stand out: the Decepticon helicopter Blackout's introductory rampage, Prime's highway duel with Bonecrusher and Starscream's mid-air scrap with the US air force. Each of these moments is a terrific jolt of adrenalin but by and large, the robot on robot combat is a let down. Credit that to Bay's love of wildly over the top camera movements and inability to stay still for a second, as Bumblebee's ruckus with Barricade, and Ironhide scrapping with Devastator become confusing spectacles where it isn't clear who is meant to be hitting who. Alongside this is the fact that for large portions of the film, the robots, especially the Decepticons, are conspicuously absent, to the extent where your mind starts to wander while waiting for the next fight.<br/><br/>Aside from these few complaints however is the sense that they tried to make the scope a bit too grand. The majority of the story is told from Sam's point of view, but at time it veers off to show events from the perspective of the military and a team of code-breakers. This fractures the story development and in truth, the film would have been far better if they'd narrowed their focus a bit and concentrated solely on Sam.<br/><br/>But like I said, the good news is that Bay, Spielberg et al haven't ruined the franchise. Indeed, despite the impression I might be giving, Transformers is a very enjoyable movie and I welcome the prospect of future sequels, its just that I was always going to be bit extra-critical of this film. There is an undeniable degree of childhood excitement to be had watching the first transformation sequence and seeing Optimus Prime act like Optimus Prime, while at the same time sounding like Optimus Prime is a pure nostalgic treat. When it comes to it, for all the plot holes and complaints I've picked up on, the only thing that's liable to ruin Transformers for anyone is the fact that the Decepticons are rarely on screen, especially Megatron and Starscream who only show up for about five minutes each. If you're not a geek, add another two stars to the score."
"mr_mcpimpington","2","1","5","29 July 2007"," I'm sorry, but this was without a doubt one of the WORST MOVIES I've ever seen.
","Those who feel as if this movie was an 8 or better must not have seen the summer blockbusters of old. First of all, this movie has been made at least 5 or 6 times within the last decade: Jurrasic Park I, II, II, Independence Day, Godzilla, King Kong, War of the Worlds ... all different from Transformers of course, but largely rely on the same emotional impact (many lives/Earth itself in danger) and slick CGI created to lure large audiences in July.<br/><br/>To be sure I only saw a few Transformer episodes as a kid, I wasn't really a super freak over them or anything b/c to me it was just another cartoon. So I didn't get giddy when they mentioned the name ""Megatron"" in the movie, which several people in the theater did.<br/><br/>The performances in this movie were all horrible, all of them. The amount of overacting, especially from the cameos is extremely laughable. Any scenario involving government intelligence or military action was laden with made up words like Defcon Delta, Sector 7 or the President asking for some Ding Dongs in his red stockings. Meanwhile the same group of soldiers fight on two fronts (who knew the army was so small?). And the smartest people in the entire movie include a ridiculously beautiful blonde haired ""systems analyst"" who belongs on a runway somewhere not on a computer cracking alien codes. And when she gets stumped sneaks on over to a kid's house who lives with his grandma and plays dance dance revolution, because according to our supermodel Einstein, ""he is the only person in the world who can decipher this language"".<br/><br/>The CGI is the only reason to watch this movie. You either have to like Transformers to enjoy this movie or enjoy the same tastes as the 16 and under crowd, otherwise your going to find it incredibly cheesy. Especially when a 40 ton robot says ""What's up baby?"" and dances, or when another pees on a human being. How about when asked how they can talk, Optimus Prime replies, ""We learned on the World Wide Web""? Cheese cheese cheese. And it's everywhere! All the time! I've only given a few examples in this review, I couldn't possibly remember them all. However, I do know that I've never cringed so much while watching a movie.<br/><br/>I really wish I could flag all the people who gave this movie a good score, so I never have to see their warped delusions on what is and isn't a good movie ever again."
"Pritt19","4","1","5","28 July 2007"," Failed to meet my expectations
","As Transformers is relatively new in the cinema, I will get straight to the point about Transformers. I will not give any spoilers, as it unfair on those who have not seen it yet.<br/><br/>The special effects in the movie are truly amazing and on this front must be praised highly. Bringing the Robots to life from the hits 80's animation is a brilliant site to observe. Their are noticeable faults with designs of the robots and camera work, which is unwatchable at times. The movie is meant to specially appeal to the generation who were raised within the decade. This though is very questionable following a full viewing of the movie.<br/><br/>The new ideas and concepts executed in the movie are little baffling and reference to technology related to the animated series appears to be scarce for example energon cubes, telecom1 and so on. Their is only a brief mention of cyperton, the distinct planet the robots hailed from. Instead huge emphasis is directed on the moderns gimmicks such as mobile phones, computers and internet rather than the technology that we have been accustomed in the cartoon if you get what I mean.<br/><br/>The Transformers make only brief appearances in the movie, with the human characters surpassing the length of time against the transformers.Instead we pay our money just to see the human world, rather than the robot world which transformers is about. For example high school life, Spike's parent obsession with their lawn and excessive levels of military and FBI operations. All these scenes are totally unnnecessary and would of condensed the movie to 90mins, rather than an epic 2 and half hours of useless material.<br/><br/>The characterisation of the movie is totally bland. None of human characters had much emotion and humour at all. The robots hardly exhibited much personality at all, with the Deceptiocons being portrayed as violence and destructive. For example Megratron hardly had any personality and the ruthless streak he exhibits in the cartoons. The relentless rivalry between Megratron and Starscream is non-existence. Optimus Prime to me, is by far the strongest character in the movie, with a component of heroism's. The dialogue is very weak in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie would been destined a great science fiction movie. I felt it has real potential to be a great movie. Michaeal Bay and the script writers mess it up completely with too much gimmicks , unnecessary scenes andpolitics. The overwhelming hype movie received failed to live to its expectations. I ended up a gloomy and disappointed audience following a weak showing of the movie. The summer promised some great movies, but Transformers though by a long margin fails to fit into this category. I feel betrayed of what I have seen as it does not fail I am watching a cartoon of Transformers. <br/><br/>If a sequel is on the pipeline, than drastic improvements needs to be made and needs to tie much as possible with the original cartoon without too much emphasis on humans and more on robots and their personality.

","""Transformers"" has its funny moments... and that is one of the reasons why it sucks. Every time they attempted to make it funny, it feels very out of place. Movie directors should refrain from using comic relief, unless they really know what they are doing; most of the time it adds nothing and breaks the suspension of disbelief. But this one is dumber than the usual. See, if I wanted to laugh, I would have gone see a comedy. Preferably one without juvenile humor about masturbation or urine... that is, unlike this one, I kid you not!<br/><br/>This should have been a badass action film, why can not they keep it badass all the way? For example, for two films with very similar themes, compare Bay's so-so ""Bad Boys"" to Michael Mann's awesome ""Miami Vice"". One keeps tossing you back to reality; the other hooks you early on and keeps the tension high until the very end.<br/><br/>Also, the product placement was ridiculously in-your-face (and part of the stupid comic relief), so that also plays a part in ruining the mood.<br/><br/>And there are some absurd things in the writing. How come a bunch of huge robots walk around on your backyard and you don't see or hear them? How come they keep Megatron frozen outside of a freezer? If all those alien robots are so powerful, to the point of wiping an army base single-handedly, how come the humans capture Bumblebee so easily? And why does not Optimus help him at that moment?<br/><br/>Sure, it is just a dumb action flick, so one would expect it at least to have some wicked action scenes. Does it? Yes, but it is not consistently good. It starts great, but the final battle gets too confusing, because Bay's ever-zooming shakycam is on the loose again! I thought he had learned a bit of self-control after ""The Island"", which, unlike his previous stuff, was pretty good (and flopped, ironically). Nope. Maybe his best film only happened by chance. Somewhat like Ivan Reitman did ""Ghostbusters"", then followed that classic with an uninterrupted row of stinkers.<br/><br/>The creature design and the visual effects are excellent. But the writing could be much better, and the director needs some medicine to control his camera's epilepsy. Now, I have seen worse stuff; this is far from total disasters like ""The Mexican"", ""Double Dragon"", ""The Avengers"", or ""Lost in Space"". I will even say that it is rather enjoyable if you are in the right mood, a guilty pleasure perhaps. But it is nothing great, and it could, or even should, have been much better."

","Autobots (nice humane robots) and Decepticons (cruel psycho robots) battle to protect/massacre mankind. That's all the plot summary you need.<br/><br/>After an insane prologue where a US base is wiped out by a crazed robot - that sneaked in in the guise of a military helicopter - Bay proceeds with the unexpectedly touching story of young Sam (Shia LaBouf, one of the film's greatest assets) getting his first car (Autobot Bumblebee in disguise), unaware that both robot factions are monitoring him, his family having ties to a mystical lost cube they are searching for. A bit of time is spent exploring Sam's life and tentative romance with school hottie Michaela (Megan Fox, generic model-actress) before everything turns increasingly violent as the Autobots show up and make their purpose known and the Decepticons give up ""the subtle approach"" in favor of total carnage.<br/><br/>Anyone showing up to see this film is in it for the spectacle and ""Transformers"" delivers. That ILM have accomplished miracles is an understatement: the character design and animation is bewildering, giving us something we've never seen before while seamlessly blending it with non-CGI elements. Each revamped robots is both amazing and affecting (particularly the touching Bumblebee and a gleefully bad-ass Megatron). Bay has his faults but when it comes to lightheaded entertainment and action, he is hard to beat, and here he outdoes himself it what could well be his finest film. The funny moments work thanks to Bay's breezy direction and Shia LaBouf's astounding likability, making the dramatic and epic bits all the more effective.<br/><br/>That the film's ending seems a bit rushed and leaves you wanting more is a testament to how gripping the preceding 140 minutes have been, and you will leave the theater thinking of indelible scenes like Sam ""hiding"" Optimus Prime and company in his parents' backyard (a wonderfully absurd moment), the almost poetic arrival of the Autobots, and of course the final smack-down.<br/><br/>The only similar event movie that comes to mind is the original Jurassic Park.

I gave 5 only because the great battle scene in the end of this movie.<br/><br/>I don't know why, but very often good films can become a crap only because writers make a story about teenagers love. OK, there can be a little love between two people in action movie but when the story about intercourse between two people amounts about 75 percent in the action movie, it is bad. Transformers is a cartoon adaptation, for god sake. It is created for male audience mostly. There just can't be so much stupid love.<br/><br/>As i said you can watch this movie only because superb special effects. But i think there was not enough SE in here. It is Transformers, there should be more iron fights, more action, people should be only in second place. Before i saw it I thought there will be nothing but crushing fights between two metal races. The script will be created only to explain how transformers came to earth and why they are fighting each other. People can be nothing more but victims in fights. But no. This film is about mankind, and transformers is nothing but second-rate characters in here.<br/><br/>So, i think this movie is totally out of balance.

Very interesting to watch!) Me and some friends of mine always hoped that they would make a Transformer movie! When the news came that this movie was going to be made I was full of joy! But I also feared that Hollywood would ruin everything that was so great about the Transformers franchise! With great relief I can mention that Michael Bay has captured the spirit of the Transformers and has made an excellent adaptation! The Transformers have a prominent role in the movie! They looked real and felt real! Even the human cast were good! Shia Laboeuf again manages to steal some serious screen presence like he did in ""Disturbia""! Although I hated the idea that human characters would be involved in the movie (Which in the cartoon was very minimal) they did add something extra! Escpecially in the humor department! Some scenes were just hilarious! But like the cartoon it is all about the Autobots and the Decepticons! Their battles is what we want to see and we get to see plenty of that! ""Transformers"" is without a doubt one of the best blockbusters movies from this year! It delivers on the action front and is pure fun! Go see it!"

","This movie was by far the best movie I've seen in months. I have never walked out of a movie theater so overjoyed (except the Pirates movies; I love Capt. Jack). But Transformers is an just as phenomenal. It is action-packed and full of excitement. The special effects were amazing; an award should be on its way. And Shia, oh Shia. He was incredible. He put on a great performance; not only was he a brilliant performer, but he's hysterical. This movie is a spectacular combination of humor and action, enough to keep anyone entertained. Even my three year-old brother sat through the entire film. The intense action may not be suitable for all children; but what kid wouldn't find cars transforming into robots and fighting each other cool? No matter what, this is a must see movie; possibly the best movie of the summer so far. Overall rating: 10. A must see!"

"redmaxdrive","10","1","5","16 July 2007"," Transformers is the GREATEST!!!!
","I've been a fan of Transformers for as long as they've been around. I've seen them transform into everything from cars to planes to animals. In Beast Machines, one of the Maximals could transform into a plant! They've been everything under the sun and more besides, so it might have been a little difficult for the filmmakers to find a fresh direction for the robots. I prefer to think that this film was created for a new generation of robophiles who've never heard of Transformers, and the die-hard fans who wanted to see them go in a new direction. I, as one of the die-hard fans, love this movie and can't wait for the sequels to start pouring out.<br/><br/>I really liked Bumblebee's new vehicle mode. Going from a Volkswagen Beetle to a Camaro is a real step up the ladder for the little guy. And Megatron's new look is appropriately menacing. I can understand why some of the purists might have a problem about this movie, but I think they need to calm down a little. The Transformers mythology, like everything else, has to evolve or it'll go extinct. Think of this movie as an alternate universe that expands the possibilities for future storytelling, just like the comics did in the 80s. Sure, the characters might not be as we remember them, but I believe the changes are for the better and will only enhance the enjoyment for anyone with a flexible enough mind."
"djrobx","10","1","5","16 July 2007"," Behold, the power of cheese!
","I was a huge fan of the ""Generation 1"" cartoon series growing up. When I first saw the trailer for ""Transformers"", my jaw dropped at how awesome it looked. I've been SO bored by the vast majority of the movies that are released in the last 5 years, it's difficult to get me to agree to paying for theater ticket. I usually opt to wait for DVD. But, I jumped at the chance to see this one! It was EVEN BETTER than I expected. Shia LeBouf is an incredibly engaging actor. It's hard to top what Edward Furlong did for ""Terminator 2"", but he absolutely carries this film with a perfect performance. He is able to pull off the relationship between man and machine brilliantly and believably. My childhood hero, Optimus Prime has been brought back to life in a context that I can appreciate as an adult! Reading many of the reviews here, I see a lot about cheesy dialog and jokes. I loved every last ounce of it. I thought the touch of ""American Pie"" style comedy and the sappy ""I'm not leaving without Bumblebee"" and the corny relationship between Sam and that hottie are exactly what this flick needed to prevent it from taking itself too seriously. I even liked all of the primetime TV stars thrown into the mix to keep a bit of familiarity.<br/><br/>That's not to say the film was perfect. Michael Bay worked hard to integrate a variety of different popular film clichÃ© elements together. The result worked for me, but I can see that the movie would have benefited from a few more months worth of script refinement. It needs just a little more balance.. a little more continuity.. to flow together just a little bit better.<br/><br/>It went in a lot of different directions, but all of the elements were not tied up by the end. We devote a great amount of time and energy on saving poor Bumblebee. But Jazz comes and goes without a lot of emotion. Early on we are endeared by Captain Lennox's newborn that he wants to hold so badly, but the movie ends and his family is nowhere in sight! I think the Decepticons needed more personality. The only bad guy we really got to connect with was the boombox! Perfect, no, but a solid 10 out of 10 for me. I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in years."

","what can i say, amazing just watched the film and WOW enjoyment of the highest quality, special effects brilliant, alright the transformers have been criticised for having metal lips, some have been altered from the cartoon, megatron is no longer a gun, bumblebee is no longer a beetle, but hey this is 2007 everything gets upgraded and boy have these transformers been upgraded. the robots look unbelievable and the transformation scenes are out of this world. my only gripe is that you don't get to see megatron until about 3/4 of the way thru the film but other than that i can't find any fault with a movie that will not only entertain kids but some of us adults who are really just big kids and while watching a film go u know something i wish that was real and i wish that was me cause that is what these films are all about, fantasy, adventure and excitement and leaving everything 2 the imagination. roll on the sequel and hopefully a reincarnated jazz."

I always felt he is the right man for s studio to hire to make a perfect blockbuster movie, but sadly he never quite directed the right kind of subject to find that perfect mix between storytelling and special effects. I have grown up watching Hollywood all my life and Michael Bay's movies always give me that escapist excitement that i seek from larger than life movies.<br/><br/>This film is big screen entertainment at it's breathtaking best and will leave you exhausted at the end of the show. This is no way a kids movie. Its got action, action and more action.Plenty of humor, A very human story (its cheesy, but you wont care).

"deamond9","9","1","5","15 July 2007"," Really good Transformers adaption
","It's almost a buddy movie AND a war movie. There's the bigger story of the war, and there's also the smaller story with the guy, the girl and Bumblebee going on at the same time. <br/><br/>The Transformers are all alien robots that possess the ability to scan any other machine and then turn themselves into a copy of it. Usually they tend to add the Autobot or Decepticon symbol somewhere. The Decepticons, at least, also have the ability to produce a holographic representation of a human sitting inside them. The main difference between the Autobots and Decepticons seems to be political; the Autobots refuse to harm humans, whereas the Decepticons want to destroy us all. All of them seem to have learned English and other information about Earth from the Internet.<br/><br/>In the smaller story, Bublebee is a teenager's first car. Bumblebee seems almost over-enthusiastic in trying to help the kid get laid. The girl is hot. Picture ""Herbie"" meets ""American Pie"". (Well, maybe not American Pie, they don't go that far, but one of those movies)<br/><br/>The kid and Bublebee were also being pursued by a police car with the Decepticon symbol on the side. This part of the story reminded me a bit of Terminator T but much bigger and more menacing.<br/><br/>One of the great things about this movie, which surprised even me, is that they actually managed to make the Decepticons scary and creepy. Particularly the Helicopter and Soundwave (I think it was Soundwave. The only remotely Soundwave-like thing about it was that it took the form of a DVD player, and Soundwave was a tape player.)<br/><br/>Soundwave is a much smaller Decepticon than the others. He seems to be acting basically as a spy. He's this little, almost gremlin-like creature, constantly sneaking around and hiding when humans might see him. He's roughly 30 or 50 cm tall at his full height, whereas the others average 5, 10 meters tall. <br/><br/>I won't tell you too much about Megatron.<br/><br/>COMPLAINTS; <br/><br/>Unlike the cartoon, their design seems to be over-complicated, they seem to break into too many small parts when they transform. Almost as if they were trying too hard to make it look different from a toy. This creates two main problems; A) it makes it allot more difficult to follow or figure out how they transform, which is exactly what was so interesting about Transformers back in the 80's B) It also makes their faces too complicated, which means it's hard to tell them apart. Particularly the Decepticons.<br/><br/>In some of the action sequences towards the end, they used shaky cameras and dust just to make it look more ""real"". In fact it just looks shaky. Cinema Varitae is vastly over-rated."
"aimless-46","7","1","5","15 July 2007"," Discovering Japan
","The ""Transformers"" concept is of course Japanese, but the origin predates the animated television show that originally aired in the U. S. from 1984 to 1987. The idea actually goes back to the post WWII ""Godzilla"" series. The Japanese were able to turn the big green fellow into a franchise by producing a series of sequels with titles like: ""Godzilla vs ???"" (Mothra, Biallante, Cosmic Monster, King Ghidorah, Magalon, The Smog Monster, etc. etc.). Japanese producers had discovered a universal appeal in combat between a somewhat good monster/ alien and a clearly bad one. Arnold the Barbarian's ""Terminator"" sequels also picked up on this can't miss idea.<br/><br/>Director Michael Bay has latched onto this idea as a way to arrest his career decline. Normally repeated disasters on the scale of ""Pearl Harbor"" and ""Armageddon"" would result in banishment from Hollywood and a subsequent career making educational films in Des Moines. But somehow Bay was able to convince them to use him for this project. Apparently having crashed and burned (spectacularly) in many of his prior efforts, gave Bay a fair degree of perspective and he is able to have a lot of self-reflexive fun with ""Transformers""; a goofy film with a lot of stuff that blows up it neat ways and does not take itself nearly as seriously as the original series. In fact it should appeal to ""Godziilla"" fans who find this quasi-parody quality endearing. <br/><br/>In place of Godzilla and Mothra et al the film features Computer Generated Transformer toys that contort and expand from something normal into robot monsters. The head monster, who speaks with the voice of Earthquake McGoon, is a bad boy named Megatron. He is the most fearsome of the evil Decepticons robots, who are at odds with the nice robots (Transformers). Both brands of robots fled the doomed planet Cybertron and came to Earth. There is a fairly explicit reason for their choosing Earth (called the Allspark) but for it is not important that casual viewers fully understand the details. <br/><br/>Initially ""Transformers"" is a teen movie, with the familiar loser teen boy (Sam played by Shia LaBeouf) lusting after the hot girl (Mikaela-not the one on ""Star Search"" but Megan Fox who played snobby Carla in ""Confessions of Teenage Drama Queen"") who does not know that he exists. Fox has aged noticeably since ""Drama Queen"" and is fading uncomfortably fast, but she still looks good enough that scorching your eyeballs is a real possibility.<br/><br/>In an attempt of improve Sam's social standing at school (and to advance the storyline), his Dad gets him a Camaro which turns out to be a Transformer named Bumblebee. Having a transforming car causes Mikaela to notice Sam at about the time the film itself transforms from teen movie to battling robot Sci-Fi. <br/><br/>Enter the Secretary of Defense (Jon Voight) , the armed forces or at least Sgt. Lennox (John Duhamel) and Tech Sgt. Epps (Tyrese Gibson), and a secret agent (Coen Brothers favorite John Turturro). Like the ""Godzilla"" franchise the best efforts of the military make little impression on the robot monsters. <br/><br/>Bay builds up the suspense level as things move toward an epic battle between the Transformers and the Decepticons that will decide the fate of the world. Unfortunately the wheels start to fall off the film at this point as it goes into the ""exercise in excess"" mode of stuff like ""Ultraviolet"" and King Kong"". The Industrial Light and Magic effects are not at fault as their digital creations are first class. There is plenty of attention to detail and the movements and battle sequences are individually excellent. The problem is that the whole is considerably less than the sum of its parts. A situation that is only tolerable if you begin viewing things from the self-parody angle; which I think was actually Bay's intention all along. <br/><br/>As Roger Ebbert notes: ""The mechanical battle goes on and on and on and on, with robots banging into each other and crashing into buildings, and buildings falling into the street, and the military firing, and jets sweeping overhead, and Megatron and the good hero, Optimus Prime, duking it out, and the soundtrack sawing away at thrilling music, and enough is enough.""<br/><br/>It's really time for these CGI dominated movies to mature and start choreographing their scenes to be more than just eye candy. A logical fight strategy would be nice, something that makes sense and is not just random violence. The ""Transformers"" violence looks like it was lifted from old scripted bouts of ""Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling""; with the combatants often down but never out. <br/><br/>The failure to incorporate logic distances the audience from the action and makes it impossible to build any real suspense. For this reason alone, the film would have benefited from some serious action scene trimming and a more logical assembly in the editing room. Computer animation has become far cheaper than actually staging live-action sequences but audiences are increasingly discounting these scenes-viewer thrills don't happen when viewers are wise enough to see it as animation. Current audiences are finding it increasingly difficult to suspend disbelief. The same thing occurred in the 1960's when audiences began recognizing the projected backgrounds used for scenes shot in the studio. This started a trend toward shooting films on location with only television shows still using the sound stages. <br/><br/>But this excess is the film's only real fault and since it comes at the end most of the viewing experience is quite enjoyable. <br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."
"NewDivide1701","9","1","5","14 July 2007"," Truly more than meets the eye
","Transformers in short is an excellent sci-fi action adventure of robots with the ability to change, or transform, themselves from earth vehicles into titanic robots who have come to Earth to seek an all powerful artifact known as the all spark, as well as to wage their war on our world.<br/><br/>This rehash of the classic 80's cartoons is just as visually inspiring as Transformers the movie back in 1986. This movie is not ""dumbed downed,"" but a movie that was made to simply sit back, relax, and enjoy without the need of unnecessary complexity to the story that has on occasions ruined failed epics.<br/><br/>Transformers has a significant amount of suspense and tension within it to keep the viewers interested in the movie, while also having well timed comedy to keep the movie from being depressing or too serious. As well it was made to give it the ""it all happened so fast"" feel to it, and a sense of being there in the midst of battle. Greatly enhancing the overall effect.<br/><br/>If it wasn't for the name Transformers, the incredible visual effects, the high octane action, as well as the story would allow the average person to understand it without any reference points. And the story didn't need to parallel human society, just entertain, and they did their jobs quite well in that department.<br/><br/>Give Transformers ..... 8.5/10"

My only CONS (no pun intended) were...<br/><br/><ul><li>Practically no interaction between the Decepticons. They just all showed up out of the blue at the end. No congregating and plotting.

"freaky_dave","8","1","5","9 July 2007"," Action Packed and fun to watch
","Transformers is one of those summer blockbuster movies that you can't miss. It was action packed and loads of fun. Sure the story was confusing and some of the actors only secondary to all the transforming alien robot clans, but it all seemed to work because the film never takes itself too seriously.<br/><br/>Two alien robot clans land on Earth and do battle over an Allspark which is a magic cube of some kind which grants unlimited power to whoever possesses it. You have the heroic Autobots and their leader Optimus Prime, and then you have the evil Decepticons and their leader Megatron. I could go into more detail about how this Allspark ended up on earth, but it would take way too long. If you go and see the movie, it is explained in detail anyway, so I don't believe I need to explain it here.<br/><br/>Anyway our main star in the film, outside the special effects and the robots, is none other then Shia Labeouf who was the lead man in the suspense thriller Disturbia which was out earlier this year. He plays Sam Witwicky, and like he did with Disturbia brings a lot of humor and wit to Transformers as well. His costar is the hot and sexy Megan Fox who becomes his love interest and also knows a thing or two about car engines. There is also support from big actors Jon Voight, John Torturro, and Tyrese Gibson as well as comic relief from Kevin Dunn and Julie White who play parents Ron and Judy Witwicky. What these other actors offer may not be great, but it helps to keep the movie from ever being just a one dimensional action packed thriller loaded with special effects and nothing else.<br/><br/>The special effects are in fact the best I've ever seen. They even rival those of Spiderman 3, and may even go beyond that early summer blockbuster which I was disappointed with. Michael Bay keeps the action moving and only slows down in his attempts for humor which actually work. Bumblebee, the Camaro that Sam actually buys, is comic relief in itself as one of the Autobots which seems to play classic rock songs at just the right time to mirror what Sam is actually thinking.<br/><br/>If you were a fan of the Transformer toys back in the 80s, I think you'll like the movie. Even if you weren't a fan, I still suggest you see the film because it is quite entertaining. I will give it an 8 out of 10."

","Best movie I've seen in a long time, First movie I've ever went back to the theater to see again, and considered going a third time.<br/><br/>Let me also point out that I've scoured the internet reading all the bad reviews, for anyone reading these reviews Don't bother listening. The movie was great, Transformers managed to keep a good balance of drama, action, and comedy. Which kept me in my seat even though my kidneys were shutting down because I had to pee so bad. All the complaints I've seen on the internet can be easily dismissed. Since all complaints are the focus of 2 things, one people compare it to generation 1. I grew up with G1 I'm glad they changed things, the cartoon was dry, I've watched it again as an adult and if they brought that back to theaters which I was afraid of, the sales would have toped 37 dollars and a piece of lint. If you like G1. then watch the G1 movie. secondly the other complaint people have mad is that the movie is military propaganda, or a car advertisement. Of course the military would be involved in fighting giant invading evil robots. and the auto-bots are cars. what did you expect? the auto-bots don't even have GM symbols on them just the auto-bot insignia, and last time I checked the military hasn't ever had to fight of giant robots. the movie was great entertainment and there was never a time in the theater were I was left bored waiting on the movie to pick up again, also it was one of the few movies were everyone in the theater was laughing or clapping, and also got a round of applause at the end, this movie kills all the other recent flops, the sales speak for themselves, Go see it, you wont regret it. you will want to see it again."
"FMACDONALD","8","1","5","9 July 2007"," This Film Will Bring The Inner 10 Year Old Out In You.
","I grew up loving Transformers. The only thing I loved more than Transformers was Star Wars. I watched the TV show religiously, had all the toys, and read the comic book. Sadly that legacy ended for me in 1986 when the animated movie hit theaters and my favorite character's like Optimus Prime, Megatrom, and Starscream were killed off in the first 20 minutes of the film to make room for new characters like Cup, RC, Galvatron, Blur, Hot Rod, and Ultra Magnus. In General Transformers was ruined.<br/><br/>Fast forward 20 some odd years later and director Michael Bay has brought the war bound alien robots to life in a live action movie with producer Steven Spielberg in tow. Bay has been blasted and praised for his films, which include The Rock, Armageddon, Bad Boys, Bad Boys II, Pearl harbor, Miami Vice, and very underrated The Island. Some people feel Bay has what it takes to make a big budget summer popcorn action flick, while others feel he cators to much to the younger crowd that don't care about strong plots. Personally I like Bay, most of the time. I enjoyed The Island, The Rock, both Bad Boys films, and Armageddon. Pearl Harbor, and Miami Vice I want to know what he was smoking. So the question is, did Bay get back to the typical leave your brain at the door, and just have a good time type of movie? The answer is...Yes.<br/><br/>Transformers is a blast, and is one of the better films of the disappointing summer 2007 season. Spider-Man 3, and Knocked up are also high on my list. It's an action film that not afraid to be an action film. The thing that makes me extremely happy is that the movie catered to all the older fans that grew up watching the old cartoon (although I better see Soundwave in the sequel).<br/><br/>The plot is paper thin and easy. 2 races of alien robots, the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, and The Decepticon's led by Megatron, destroy their home world of Cybertron. They then bring their war to Earth and the human race is caught in the middle. The Decepticons want to wipe out all Humans to make earth the new Cybertron, while the auto-bots want to protect us.<br/><br/>That's the story of Transformers, plain and simple, the end. You can't help but get giddy when you hear Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen, who voiced him back in the old cartoon) say ""Autobots, roll out"".<br/><br/>Fans who grew up watching the cartoon will not be disappointed, although I still wish Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) was a gun of some sorts, the film was 2 1/2 hours of robots beating the hell out of each other and stuff blowing up. People who never watched the old cartoon and just think the movie looks good shouldn't be disappointed either.<br/><br/>This film has already been declared a hit and looks like it could dethrone Spider-Man 3 as the highest grossing film of the summer. As much as I love Spider-Man I have to admit, I hope it does. It came to no shock when I heard that Transformers 2 is already being written, and that old cartoons are the new stomping grounds for Hollywood.<br/><br/>G.I.

","yes, i saw transformers today it was an excellent movie ah, it was so crazy suspenseful so many chase scenes, and how could there not be? the kids ARE being chased by robots planning to destroy the human race, anyway & it was also very funny : D for example, When Sam (Shia LaBeouf {which means 'The Beef' in french, no lie}) needs a new car, his father drives past a Porshe dealership; ""I've got a little surprise for you, son."" ""No, no, no, no! Dad! Oh, you've got to be kidding me!"" ""Yeah, I am. You're not getting a Porsche!"" oh man, funny stuff :D & everything the mother does is just so quirky ""We could call it Sam's Happy Time!"" it's great, probably one of the best movies coming out this summer but i gotta say, I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry MIGHT beat it (I'm joking) but yeah, it's great. a little fast in action scenes, but i can forgive them<br/><br/>once more, GO SEE IT!"

","This movie is by far the best movie this summer and maybe this whole year. It is far better than any of the trilogies this summer. Michael Bay did an excellent job adding his touch to this movie, i couldn't think of anybody better to do a big budget, big explosions, big blockbuster than Bay. This movie is full of stars each doing a good job on their part, but the main stars are the Transformers. It was cool to see that each Autobot had a unique attitude, Optimus being the leader, Jazz being attitude of the group, BumbleBee being the young, caring soldier, Ratchet being the veteran like soldier of the group, and Ironhide being the muscle of the group. It did bug me some that they didn't develop the Decepticons as much as they did the Autobots like for example how they chose their form. But they were very well done, props out to the guys who did the CGI, i hope they get the Oscar next year. The story is very good, concentrating on the relationship of ""a boy and his car"". The story made you care for the Autobots, and BumbleBee specially. It was a wise decision to outnumber the Autobots, as it showed them working together, and sometimes even thinking they will loose. This movie has all the ingredients of a perfect summer movie. it has comedy, drama, and lots and lots of action, Michael Bay style. All i go to say is i can't wait until 2009 for the sequel. This movie is truly more than meets the eye."

","I've never been a big fan of CG in movies; I feel it totally ruined ""the magic,"" but this movie blends it almost perfectly with live-action that throughout most of the movie, I felt as if the Robots were like any other actors! There were a few times when ""the cursed CG monster"" reared its ugly bright head, but very minimally; the Transformations were looked great, and the CG characters actually looked like they interacted with the real actors. Peter Cullen reprised his voice acting for Optimus Prime, not a spoiler, and proved he was, is, and always will be, the man behind Prime! Shia LaBeuf, or however you spell it, is at the top of his game as Sam Witwicky too, and Megan Fox is simply electrifying as Mikaela. There was one part I didn't like though, this may be a spoiler for some sad people out there like myself, Prime has lips. In short, minimal cussing, lots of really top notch CGI goodness, no female nudity, grade A performances from the immediate cast, and tolerable cheesiness, make TF a good bet for the summertime theater crowds! GO SEE THIS MOVIE!"
"diac228","4","1","5","7 July 2007"," ""Left cheek! Left cheek! Left cheek!!""
","This following review has no product placement whatsoeverthe movie being reviewed has done enough of that on its own. Transformers is a great idea turned sour because of pitiful writing, bad directing, sloppy acting, weak editing, and a slew of perky little flaws that some people will catch but others will totally miss. With such a heavy budget, one would think that they could hire better writers, right? And Mr. Bay, why on earth do you still attempt to add emotion to your mind-numbingly loud movies? The special effects were indeed amazing and the CGI work was nearly flawless, but that gets tampered by all the lower-budget work involved. This movie could have been cut by nearly 40 minutes, the pacing was slow, it was just all wrong. To fail this movie would be exaggerating considering the intensive effort into making the robots (and the effects were executed perfectly) but do not expect anything worthy of being among the summer popcorn champs past and present.<br/><br/>In a mindless action movie, a plot isn't totally necessary but something has to be established in order to give the viewer a reason to continue watching despite all the explosions and body parts flying. Transformers doesn't have a weak plot (Powerful cube-like object embedded in the Earth and two armies of alien robotic things fighting to obtain it) but the dialogue is easily the weakest portion of the film. It must have been so hard for the actors and actresses to not laugh at some of the insanely cheese things they have to say. Bay hasn't been very lucky with the whole dialogue thing (Pearl Harbor, The Island) but its reached a new low here. What also mars this movie is the endless amount of clichés sprinkled all over the place. The pretty-female-with-jerk cliché has been done way, way, way too many timesplease stop now. Oh, and let's not forget the barrage of plot holes too (How can ANYONE outrun a Transformer?!)<br/><br/>Acting was rather wooden as well. Despite decent performances from Jon Voight, Rachael Taylor, and John Turturro (hey, its not his fault he had so many bad lines) the acting was pretty weak. The voice acting amongst the Transformers was a mixed bag, and Shia LaBaouf comes off as pretty annoying sometimes. The lead female, Megan Fox, is amazingly pretty but that was about it. Speaking of wooden, let's discuss the musical score, which seems to borrow from all other popcorn flicks, including previous Bay works.<br/><br/>The worst part of Transformers is Michael Bay himself. Despite the screenplay, he could still craft a clever action movie; it has been done before (The Rock, Bad Boys anyone?). Instead, we get the hypersensitive camera work, the spinning-cam that Bay has suddenly fallen in love with, too many long shots of people looking at something, and then too many close-ups during the fights, resulting in a mess of a battle. Sometimes, its extremely difficult to see who is fighting what and who is the hero and who is the villain. Like Fantastic Four: Silver Surfer, there were little action quips, but no major action sequences until the very end; which even then consists of a lot of miniature battles jumbled up into one final showdown.<br/><br/>In order to get to the action we've all been craving, we have to put up with pointless and useless character development and unnecessary scenes that made the movie at least 40 minutes longer. Michael Bay is no Spielberg; he cannot portray emotion for the life in him. His pacing is really fast when conflict is spewing, but when this isn't happening the gears shift into negative third gear. Spielberg should have been working on this, since summer popcorn blockbusters is his specialty (Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones trilogy, Minority Report, Jaws, War of the Worlds). Bay should have just made this a frenzied action film, instead of a complete film full of all sorts of genres, from comedy to action to romance.<br/><br/>Something not to gripe about however are the incredible special effects. The robots look absolutely fantastic, and their movements flow beautifully. Despite the camera moving too much and not finding the right range, the robots going at it is one of the best-looking CGI shots in the history of cinema, and we've been very blessed with incredible special effects this summer with At World's End. The audience was applauding every single time that a robot was first revealedunfortunately they don't get much screen time. As a matter of fact, some just ultimately disappear from the film altogether, while some have extended periods of absence. Nonetheless, when you do see them, your jaw will drop in amazement.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Wonderful special effects destroyed by practically all other aspects of the film. Whether it's the bad acting, bad writing, bad directing, bad pacing, or just overall all-around bad clichéd cheese, Transformers is a very good idea turned sour because it fell into the wrong hands. Bay should stay away from all attempts of adding emotion to film and just blow things up and create carnage. However, he even screwed that up by giving the camera a bad case of Parkinson's. Transformers may entertain the hardcore fans but it will take a while to see the action that's been advertised heavily in the media everywhere. Watch it once, see it for the booms and kapows and blams, and then forget about it like most of Bay's other works. Wait, what else has Bay directed?"
"d228833","5","1","5","5 July 2007"," Has some appeal, but doesn't do Transformers justice
","I am writing this review to get a lot of frustration out about the film. I'm not saying it is horrible, but to give this movie 10, well those are the people they were aiming at. If you are a true fan of TRANSFORMERS there is no way that you can truly enjoy this film. Those of you that are in your mid 20's saying you grew up watching it, give me a break, that makes you about 3-6 years old when this great series came out. At those ages you really had no ideas of what you were watching.<br/><br/>The action sequences are good, it was cool to see the robots on the big screen, but I needed more. I know there is a budget, you can only do so much, but give me some robot interaction. Why do I have to wait an hour and a half to see Starscream and Megatron interact, and then when I get it I only get 1 line, give me a break. A lot of the fighting you really can't see, because at times it either is moving too fast, or it is too close up.<br/><br/>Everyone knows Bumble Bee can't fight a lick, so how did he beat Barricade? I don't care that he did, but show me how. All I know is they started fighting, Frenzy(what a joke), gets cut in half and Bumble Bee is standing on top of a hill victorious. Give me something Michael Bay. The biggest fight Optimist vs Megetron I get what 3 frames of action, Optimist hitting a building twice and the boy killing Megatron, GIVE ME A BREAK.<br/><br/>The story line, WHAT WAS THAT, I feel that Bay took my childhood, and said this is my toy now and I can do what ever I want. Why change it, all Bay had to do was make a movie, everyone loved TRANSFORMERS for what it was, not through Bay's vision. And why can't you just call the boy Spike, that was his name!!!! I give this a 5 because those that never cared or truly grew up with the cartoon will like this Cheese, but for me and I believe anyone who really grew up with and love Transformers, they will be very disappointed."

","I thought it was fantastic, I haven't had a better time at a movie since 300. I was a HUGE transformers fan when I was a kid...had a closet completely full of them back in the 80's.

At some points in the movie it made you go WHOA that was wild, other parts you laughed, each of the Transformers had their own personalities just like in the old cartoons, I can't find a thing wrong with it. You ridiculous film critics that always have something bad to say about a damn good film astound me. Everyone has their own views so I guess I'll leave it at that, but don't nit-pick at every damn detail as if it destroyed the entire movie.

"gihrenzabi","8","1","5","3 July 2007"," A true adaptation
","Saw it last night at 9:15. Almost found myself buying Transformers toys this afternoon, so the marketing trick is working...<br/><br/>Okay, I will go in reverse usual order and do the Good before the Bad.<br/><br/>The Good: This is a proper Transformers movie. Reagan-era ""pure Good versus pure Evil."" Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime - he IS Optimus Prime.<br/><br/>I was ten years old when the Transformers came into existence, so I was at the precise center of the target audience those toys and cartoons and comic books were being marketed to. I had it all - and I can tell you that the movie gives you an authentic Transformers experience. They ARE the Transformers, Autobots and Decepticons, precisely the way you remember them, just 23 years later.<br/><br/>The true Transformers mythos is rather faithfully-reproduced, with changes made for expediency's sake. There's no time for the retelling of the asteroid belt that threatened Cybertron or the crashing of the Ark four million years ago, but the basic story remains unchanged nonetheless.<br/><br/>The effects are amazing. They made the transformation sequences *believable.* I had heard tale of certain mass-to-space calculations they had made to determine the sizes of the Transformers in robot mode, and it looks like they really did an excellent job in figuring that out.<br/><br/>The pacing was pretty good. It didn't feel like a 143 minute movie.<br/><br/>Now, the Bad: This was one of the most racist movies I have seen in a long, long time. The Creole guy who eats alligator tails and who talks about his grandmother having ""the sight."" The guy who gets yelled at twice for speaking Spanish. The Indian person on the customer service line. The Black Special Ops soldier who gets yelled at for not being able to keep up with acronyms (which, in the book, is followed by said Special Ops soldier throwing back all the acronyms he has to learn as a Spec Ops soldier, which is noticeably edited out in the movie). The Autobot who dies is the ""black"" Autobot. I am bringing pen and paper to a viewing so that I can catalog all the incidents.<br/><br/>It left me with the feeling that had I watched this movie with my 9 year old I would have immediately needed to deconstruct all this so that my son realized the sloppy writing being utilized. Stuff like this left me with the distinct feeling that this movie could have been SO much better had it not suffered from one thing: Michael Bay.<br/><br/>Michael Bay is a slipshod, shallow, stuck-in-his-adolescence arrogant schmuck who doesn't deserve to direct another film. Unfortunately, they have two more Transformers pics in the works and I cannot imagine that he will pass up the paycheck.<br/><br/>He gave Optimus Prime a mouth because he just ""wanted to change things."" I found that somewhat offensive, but that's my childhood-fan purism talking...<br/><br/>The film is *very* conservative. There's the aforementioned language comment, for one. For another, the military is terribly-glorified. When the Secretary of Defense (cast in the mold of a true warrior, hilariously-enough considering old Rummy who just left the position) announces that ""losing isn't an option for these guys,"" in reference to the Special Ops soldiers that become integral to the plot, you might want to refer him to some of the casualties in Iraq. There are times when ""Transformers"" is a virtual recruitment tool. ""Come look at all the cool toys you can learn to play with!"" You never see the results of the Transformers' war on Earth in terms of the human casualties they inflict, other than one scene in which a Spec Ops soldier is impaled, full-screen, by Skorpinok and another in which Megatron flicks away a human like an insect.<br/><br/>Other than that, the Autobots and Decepticons fight their way through cities and highways without any sign of the casualties they are causing. The violence is incredibly antiseptic. At one point, when Megatron was crashing through a building and you see it in slow-motion from a side angle, I turned to my friend and said ""A WHOLE lot of people are dying right now,"" and we had a good laugh about it.<br/><br/>This, again, brings us back to the Transformers as a Reagan-era, simplified morality play. What the Transformers *are* hasn't changed in 23 years one whit, which makes Bay's horrific lack of style perfectly suited to this film, interestingly enough. So, while the movie would have been so much better without him, he isn't able to screw up Transformers properly because it fits into his shallow style so well.<br/><br/>I suppose you would say that Bay didn't make a good movie in as much as he was handed material that even *he* couldn't flub; and having Spielberg as the Exec Producer surely helped to keep the ship sailing on a smooth course more than once.<br/><br/>I'd give the movie a B, and that's strongly influenced by my tilt towards the subject material. Shia LeBouf does give a great performance, but I honestly cared about him and the other humans infinitely-less than I did Bumblebee. I actually found Bumblebee to be the ONLY sympathetic character in the entire film.<br/><br/>This is a movie for 9 to 14 year olds, and it suffers for it. I suppose I shouldn't have expected them to make the film for my generation, even though we ARE the original Transformers fans, but they have to sell all those new toys and video games SOMEhow...<br/><br/>I'll see it two more times purely for the spectacle of the Transformers, but by my third viewing I am going to be pretty bored with the nigh-superfluous human characters."
"dmc1515","5","1","5","2 July 2007"," A movie based on a cartoon based on a toy...seriously, what do you expect...
","After finally seeing the live action movie based on a cartoon I watched and toys I owned as a child and reading all the reviews posted here, I must admit I am astounded by the highly negative and highly positive reviews, as the movie itself falls somewhere in between.<br/><br/>The Godfather and Citizen Kane it is not. Nor is it as bad as all the fanatical fan-boy postings make it out to be (possibly still upset over how awful the Fantastic 4 sequel was). And frankly, we should move past a 20+ year old cartoon that hasn't exactly stood the test of time, falling somewhere between the Smurf's and He-Man & The Masters of the Universe).<br/><br/>The movie is exactly what the vast majority of humans believe it to be before even walking in the theater; a big, loud, fairly entertaining summer blockbuster that will make you forget about the outside world for a little less then 3 hours.<br/><br/>Is it cheesy in places? Yes. Does it make sense all of the time? No. Is it a giant commercial with lots of product placement? Yes, for Hasbro. Will it hold your attention long enough to give you your money's worth? Probably for 90% of you.<br/><br/>The CGI is simply amazing, probably one of those big step forward moments in movie making that seem to happen every 10 or so years. The actors are serviceable; pretty people doing pretty things made to look ugly, but still with their hair neatly in place. The story is a formula you've digested many times before and will probably continue to digest in years to come. And the director, the oft loathed Mr. Bay, is not at fault here. He did after all put big explosions, a so-so plot line, and pretty actors in a movie about toy robots.<br/><br/>I give it a 7 of 10, because it was entertaining from beginning to end and the CGI was impressive. But just remember before you settle into your seat for something deep, meaningful, and otherworldly; this movie is based on a cartoon based on a toy from the early 80's. If you are looking to make an emotional connection, a date with a stranger would provide you with better odds."
"paul_vromen","9","1","5","1 July 2007"," Wonderfully Overblown but never Pompuous
","First and foremost, people should keep in mind that this movie is made to entertain. It's not high art, it's not though-provoking in any sense, and I see that some critics take themselves way too serious when reviewing this film. It's a thrilling and lovingly crafted popcorn ride from beginning to end. I'm a massive movie fan who enjoys Almodóvar, Truffaut and Welles (wait a minute, that's Unicron!) as much as the next person, yet enjoy the movie for what it is: a totally over-the-top, humor-littered action flick based on a line of toys.<br/><br/>I initially had my reservations when I heard that this flick was to be directed by Michael Bay. However, now I can see that Mr. Spielberg wasn't talking total PR- babble when he said that Bay was the ideal director for Transformers. Yes, the action sometimes is overblown and it's often difficult to make out what is going on (especially with the admittedly spectacular one-on-one robot fights), but here Bay's bloated style totally fits. And his signature car chase sequence is stirring stuff.<br/><br/>As for the characters: even though there's little room for character development here with all the action, what is actually there is handled very well. The robots remain fairly underdeveloped when compared to the human characters, but that's more due to the nature of the introductory storyline. I'm sure that the inevitable sequels will give the robots (and hopefully the Decepticons and Starscream in particular) a little more screen time. Even so, it has to be said that the Autobots' personalities are handled very respectfully in regard to their original incarnations.<br/><br/>In the end, what we have here is a very engaging action film that establishes its core cast well enough to make a genuine emotional connection, and sets the door wide open for a sequel. Its shortcomings lie in its simple plot and its lack of background explanation- although a prequel novel and comic do a reasonable job of providing a bit more depth. A roller-coaster ride that looks and sounds spectacular and thankfully doesn't take itself too serious. Hopefully its audience follows suit."
"kinsmed","8","1","5","1 July 2007"," Michael Bay gives 'More Than Meets The Eye'
","A generation has grown and introduced it's favorite 'robots in disguise' to the next generation.<br/><br/>Director Micheal Bay gave us such summer family films as ""Armaggedon"", ""The Rock"", and ""Bad Boys"". Here he turns his attention to lovingly updating a childhood classic that earned only moderate acclaim in it's own time.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I was one of the kids that have followed the evolution of the Autobots and Decepticons as well as the Insecticons and the Constructicons and whatever those silly human-sized robots were.<br/><br/>Even as an adult, I have an Autobot decal on the side of my car (that has been there two years) and am wearing the Transformers shirt I have owned for several years as well.<br/><br/>So I approach the movie understanding many will have different interpretations on a fondly remembered favorite. Further, Bay had his doubts about helming what he perceived to be a children's movie.<br/><br/>All this considered, you will approach the first half as a uniquely fun little romp as ""Sam"" contends with a car that seems to cause him nothing but trouble. As the movie progresses, a Bay-style gritty fight for survival emerges, pitting Decepticon metal against human mettle as a squad of elite soldiers join Sam and his newfound interest in holding off the red-eyed bad guys to help Optimus Prime and the Autobots. Their ensuing battle decimates a downtown.<br/><br/>As a side-note, the product placement division was hard at work, but enticingly vague, leading you to think more subliminally about what you saw. Without divulging too much, a fleeting example involves a machine that shoots cans of soda. If we must endure placement, execs take heed, this is the way to do it.<br/><br/>I value that some distribution exec somewhere saw fit to allow a preview of it to military theaters, but they would tear their hair out if could have anticipated even half of the abysmal screening conditions at the Ft Lewis movie theater;<br/><br/>-the movie is stopped several seconds in so the projectionist could threaten the audience.<br/><br/>-the second reel was loaded backwards and had to be stopped and reloaded.<br/><br/>-the projector lens pops out more than once and needs to be refocused each time.<br/><br/>-the light level seems to waver throughout the movie.<br/><br/>While the screening conditions were deplorable, you cannot beat a military crowd and it's family for cheering and gasping at all the right places.<br/><br/>Great news; James Earl Jones has been signed to voice and discussions are underway for a sequel in two years. For Transformers fans, this sensation is 'more than meets the eye'."

","hmitt said that the Transformer sound is missing from the movie. It's there, but perhaps I only heard it after reading the comment that said it wasn't their. I think perhaps you only hear it when they transform in slow motion? Magic movie, the transformations are what I would have loved to have seen in the toys. I always thought that the toys were just too simple, and you never saw the detail in the cartoons. There is one scene where a human and girl are standing in the middle of the auto-bots and they all transform in turn, spine chilling!

I'm not expecting an Academy Awarding winning movie, but there are plenty of action/sci-fi movies that do much, much better in the story telling department.

"dee.reid","10","1","6","16 October 2007"," ""Transforming"" the summer at the movies
","The overwhelming response to ""Transformers,"" a live-action film version of the line of Hasbro action figures and animated series from the 1980s, proves that the days of genuine, brain-dead popcorn entertainment at the movies during the summer months are not yet gone. ""Transformers"" is summer-movie popcorn entertainment of the first degree, seamlessly blending human actors and state-of-the-art CGI into a concept that's virtually out-of-this-world, and bringing it to life.<br/><br/>Michael Bay (""The Rock,"" ""Armageddon,"" ""Pearl Harbor"") directed this breathtaking action/sci-fi adventure epic, from a dynamite, intelligently written script by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman that places its key source material, the '80s animated series, under a finely tuned microscope, casts off the dead weight (possible Cold War subtext), adds Bay's trademark music video-style over-direction and you get what is very easily one of the most groundbreaking summer movies in a long time.<br/><br/>Like most people, I grew up watching ""Transformers"" early in the morning during my youth. I was one of many young boys who went through the bang-bang-BOOM! phase as an adolescent and looked to ""Transformers"" with a kind of gosh-wow, child-like innocence. I didn't collect the action figures, unfortunately, and although I watched the series whenever I could it was a rare occurrence toward the mid '90s when many cable network channels were rearranging their line-ups. Fast-forward to 2007, now I'm an adult, and I did look with skepticism to Transformers in live-action. And while I've liked Bay's movies in the past, I questioned his abilities to handle something so delicate for a brain-dead 2007 audience.<br/><br/>Well...<br/><br/>It's his best movie yet, despite his tendency for over-direction. For the most part, he flies on the straight & narrow, with few screw-ups. Perhaps it's because one of his main producers was Steven Spielberg and effects studio Industrial Light & Magic was responsible for the special effects. In the past, Bay's usually worked with super-producer Jerry Bruckheimer, who's gone for now and he seems to be showing signs of maturity as a filmmaker (did I just write that?).<br/><br/>For those of us accustomed to the lore, ""Transformers"" revolves around the centuries-old battle between the heroic Autobots and the malevolent Decepticons, massive shape-changing robots of extraterrestrial origin who mistakenly bring their war from home planet Cybertron to Earth. The Autobots find unlikely allies in humans, who join the fray in attempting to banish the Decepticons from our planet. In this big-budget blockbuster, high school loser Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and his crush Mikaela (relative newcomer Megan Fox) are thrust head-first into the action when Sam discovers that his great-great-grandfather had accidentally discovered the frozen remains of Decepticon leader Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) in the Arctic Circle. As such, he also discovered an alien power source called the ""All Spark"" that Megatron wants so that he can use Earth's technology to conquer the universe.<br/><br/>Well, the Autobots, led by Optimus Prime (voiced by the only regular from the original series, Peter Cullen), aren't having it. And along with an elite Special Forces unit led by Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) that also includes Tech Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson), and Defense Secretary John Heller (Jon Voight), Sector Seven agent Simmons (a scene-stealing John Turturro), and hackers Maggie Madsen (Rachael Taylor) and Glen Whitmann (Anthony Anderson), it leads to a special effects-laden, no-holds-barred showdown in Los Angeles, where these forces collide head-on in an epic, 30-minute battle that's sure to please those hardcore ""Transformers"" fans and those who might not even know why the hell these giant robots are fighting each other.<br/><br/>The film opens with an action sequence in the Qatar desert where one of the Decepticons attacks an American military base there. This scene sets the pace for the rest of the film: a roller coaster ride that is pretty much non-stop for the 143-minute running time. There's never a slow moment for you to capture your breath! With explosions, car chases and machines waging epic war on each other, you can bet it's worth your $8. And there you go thinking that the blockbuster was long dead.<br/><br/>What didn't escape my attention was that the film is driven not so much by the special effects, really, but by the actions of the human characters (not that the robots themselves are at all a boring sight). The actors, especially unsung Everyman Shia LaBeouf, are not short-changed and resolved to remain background to the action. The screenplay provides these characters with plenty of moments to shine, with some smart and witty dialogue combined with enthusiastic performances. These are people you come to know and like, not cardboard cut-outs, and likewise they grow on you. (OK, OK, so what about the Autobots/Decepticons?) The special effects are what's most accomplished in ""Transformers."" The actual ""transforming"" scenes really bring the 'bots to life breathlessly, so that when they shift, you're in awe by their forms morphing and reconfiguring, and metal clanking together like living machinery. That first moment when Sam buys his new car - oh, a boy and his new car (a Camaro!) - that transforms into sweet-natured Autobot Bumblebee (voiced by Mark Ryan), it leaves you breathless and wanting more, which you get x10 later on. And you thought this was just another summer movie.<br/><br/>""Transformers"" - It's a step up from the cartoon, definitely.<br/><br/>10/10"
"contact-1196","2","1","6","22 September 2007"," OK but nothing special, typical Hollywood cliché
","I am amazed about the good rating here, thats what got me to see the movie and boy i was disappointed. While the movie is full of effects and a lot of cash spent on them it seems that there wasn't enough money spent on the story and dialogue's. I found it really dumb in several dialogue's as they seemed to just fill the space and keep the time flowing. I don't want to spoil nothing and ill just say that your kids will sure like the movie and you might like it also if you are looking for a low brain/high budget movie. If you look for a smart movie then this is for sure not the one, typical super hero jump bang bang and love story sparkles behind the fight scenes along with the classic dumb dialogue's and clichés. I am sorry but i just regret spending 2 hours watching the movie."
"EijnarAmadeus","5","1","6","31 July 2007"," Michael Bay finally delivers a hurray
","Way too many popcorn movies lately has been suffering from the fact that they're simply too long, Transformers is another one joining that party, but it falls in the tomb of those still delivering an impressive show, Transformers combining stunning action sequences with surprisingly fine comedy it may just be Michael Bay's finest movie so far.<br/><br/>The greatest gags drawn are mostly between the nerdy boy and the sexy girl, but the amusement is high as the robots have got an irony and humor that gives the movie a great, extra push. And although it's far from revolutionary, it's impressively entertaining throughout its running time. The CGI-effects are great, especially the final showdown between the good and evil robots, dueling heavily in the streets as its clearly the movie's most showcasing scene as one robot after the other do a kamikaeze jump. Transformers is just pure popcorn and pure fun, and its also one of the finest show-casings of that genre so far this year."
"lonegun-2","2","1","6","29 July 2007"," Starts great then turns to a steaming pile after 20 minutes
","It only gets a 2 because it starts of so well only to disappoint, With humour and good acting it is only after about 20/30 minutes in that the story starts to jump around for no reason and scenes that seem to have been put in only to fill space and subplots that lead nowhere! Yes there is a lot of action but a lot of it is un-necessary as if it was just put in to fill space and this is not limited to action scenes and this takes away from the movie.<br/><br/>Like why take the ""cube"" from a area of low population to a big city with lots of people on the pretext that it would be easier to hide? Who in any countries military force would make such a feeble minded decision to do that (according to Michael Bay an American government director of defence and a ""secret"" organization)! The only reason to do it is so that there would be lots of people and buildings to kill and destroy hence a bigger action scene.<br/><br/>It started to feel as if there was more than one director and each one has a different story line to follow only for them to be joined up after the whole movie had been shot.<br/><br/>For the last 45 minutes of the film I just wanted to leave the cinema, it lost the plot as if Michael Bay had decided to change the great storyline to something with more plot holes than a mini golf course (and yes the movie is corny).<br/><br/>I love a good action movie but lately they all seem to be dumbed down.<br/><br/>Myself I would recommend waiting till you can rent it, as it is not worth the visit to the movies!"
"zeratul_58","10","1","6","14 July 2007"," My Childhood Didn't Die in Vain
","Having been born in '84, I've watched Transformers religiously as a child. The show was an incredibly influential part of my early childhood, and I've always felt deeply for it and the characters involved.<br/><br/>When I first heard there would be a Transformers movie, I was apprehensive. But I was intrigued as well. I went to see this movie with my teenag'd niece. She knew nothing of the Transformers characters, saga, or anything. In fact, she wasn't terribly interested in it. I went in to the theatre fully expecting to walk out, my childhood violated by creepy uncle Michael Bay. The film did not deliver this.<br/><br/>It delivered instead a most excellent film that reminded me of days of old. Waves of nostalgia overwhelmed me when I first heard the original transformation sound, and it was all I could do to not throw my fists into the air when I first saw Optimus Prime and shout for joy. The drama of the story sucked me in, and I felt, not violated, but excited as characters remained overall the same as they had been in my youth. And, I must admit, there were a few moments in which I was brought to tears by Prime's words and the Autobots' heroism.<br/><br/>Even my niece enjoyed the film, so I'd recommend it for fans and non fans alike."
"www-ama999","9","1","6","11 July 2007"," the movie is great except the part of Qatar is.....
","Frist of all the movie is really great , the directing ,the sound effects and finally the animation is above excellent except the story is not really perfect and also the scene of Qatar is Unrealistic. Qatar is very civilized and also the fastest growing country in the middle east after Dubai. And also Qatar Doesn't have mountains , well I live there I didn't see any mountains in my life and also another thing the houses are not built like shown in the movie. In Qatar, the houses are very luxurious! But every thing else is awesome, excellent, great whatever you call it . What you can say Michael Bay is the man and ""Transformers"" is the best of 2007!"
"raevan-2","1","1","6","4 July 2007"," Blah
","I had had such high hopes for this movie as soon as I heard it was coming out.<br/><br/>When I saw the previews I was thinking 'oh no!' but still waited to see it before deciding on if it was good or bad.<br/><br/>I have decided it was blah. The story with the humans totally stole the screen over the transformers. I mean in the cartoons its mostly transformers with some humans in for fun.<br/><br/>Things I disliked: I was really annoyed that most of the decepticons had little to no screen time and even less in the way of lines.<br/><br/>Were the Autobots that retarded in the TV series? They seemed totally lost. Most of them also didn't say much except Prime.<br/><br/>You also have to wait 2 hours before you even know what all the Decepticons are even in the movie.<br/><br/>Also Megatron isn't supposed to look like a raptor and frenzy isn't either. Most of the rest are hard to keep track of in the battles and I didn't even realize who died til someone said so. At the end I was like...all the deceptions...dead? The main thing flashing through my head the first hour was Herbie vs. Predator.<br/><br/>Kid likes car, car picks kid, kid finds out car has a will of its own. Then alien attacks some army people and army people die.<br/><br/>I don't see how anyone could like this script wise. The robots have a very pathetic role compared to what should have been there and I am about over the stupid love stories added into every movie.<br/><br/>I did however enjoy the little time the transformers had and wish it could have been a half hour of mostly them with a couple humans trying their best to help them out."
"jaredmobarak","7","1","6","4 July 2007"," More than meets the eyeTransformers
","Michael Bay is by no means a director for whom I anticipate each movie of his. The man doesn't do subtlety and he doesn't do intelligent storytelling either. However, you cannot say he doesn't have both artistic vision and deft skill at shooting a film. Sure the guy likes to blow things up, but being able to consistently make work with the amount of preparation and choreography that is necessary, the guy needs some credit. When the idea of a live action Transformers movie was being bandied about with Steven Spielberg's name attached, I will admit I was intrigued while also perplexed by the directing choice. It was only when Spielberg went to the producing side and brought Bay on to helm the action that I finally started to get excited. I knew absolutely nothing about the mythology besides remembering that the toys were cool, but something about Bay, whom I will admit to not being the biggest fan of, just seemed the right fit. After finally experiencing the phenomenon, I will say that I don't think anyone could have done it better, even if the film itself could have been elevated a tad higher.<br/><br/>Truthfully, no one is going to see this movie with the hopes of watching a wonderfully written script and emotional progression leading to a top-notch conclusion that both satisfies and ignites conversation. Come on, this is a story about aliens coming to Earth for their ""lifespark"" in order to take over the universe. You've got the Decepticons led by Megatron looking to destroy and you have Optimus Prime's Autobots attempting to thwart their attempts. This is all about the effects and the carnage with the slight story playing second fiddle only to allow for more explosions. On this level, the film is very successful and a great time at the theatre. You can't ask for better special effects or fight scenes. The ""transforming"" is just awesome to behold and never gets tired as the film goes on, the integration of robots with humans is quite flawless, and the animation bringing the two worlds together is pop art at its best.<br/><br/>The real stars here are the Transformers themselves and you really can't fault anything about them. With that said, this movie doesn't happen without its multitude of humans to play off of. For the most part they do an admirable job in keeping the audience's interest enough to not mind waiting until the next big effects sequence happens. Shia LaBeouf uses his sarcastic, nice guy persona to good use like always. I believe he just plays himself in most things, but even if he does, it works. Surprisingly I was impressed by Josh Duhamel who I really look upon as not an actor, but his small role is effectively played, as well as his army compatriot portrayed by the underrated Tyrese Gibson. Heck even Megan Fox manages to be a little more than just eye candy and Jon Voight entertains once you get past the horrid Southern accent.<br/><br/>Where the film fails for me is in the campy overtones and corny jokes sprinkled in everywhere. I understand the fight scenes are so big and serious that Bay and company felt they needed some levity to counteract them, but really now. Some of these jokes are so bad and some of these characters are so one-dimensionally hammy that I was shaking my head hoping they would be crushed during the fights. I love both Anthony Anderson and John Turturro, but here they are utterly terrible. The facial reactions are so broad you'd think they are doing silent film and the words and actions of their characters are literally cringe-worthy. People have told me that the camp was prevalent in the original cartoons, so I will cut it some slack. I just think it was so heavy-handed and against the rest of the film that it stuck out like a sore thumb. The quips from LaBeouf worked as did the ones from Amaury Nolasco playing off the army ""heavys"" he is with. Bay needs to stick to explosions and realize that he doesn't have the chops to try and make a comedy as well. His pacing in some ""funny"" scenes is unforgivable. When the Autobots are destroying LaBeouf's yard, it was laughable the first five minutes. By minute twenty-five you just start yawning.<br/><br/>Despite this shortcoming, though, I will say that Transformers is a great experience. You will be blown away by the special effects and computer animation. There is no way you can't be. The live action integration is effective and even the story manages to root itself in enough reality to be somewhat plausible working in a world where alien invaders have come to Earth. A popcorn summer flick through and through, you won't go wrong checking this one out for either a good time or to hop on the nostalgia train of that amazing decade of the 80's."
"tagmclaren","5","1","6","3 July 2007"," This movie is more ""cool"" than good
","I saw Transformers yesterday and I didn't expect much. For starters I'm not fond of Michael Bays movies. Technically this movie is very well made, the special effects, sound and the photo (typical high budget action photo) slow motion faded music closeups. The thing about this movie that bothers me the most are all the silly one-liners and comic reliefs, and apparently most of the audience that saw the movie liked it. They laughed when they were suppose to laugh. And as an old Transformers fan i really missed the old characteristics of the robots. Basically Optimus and Bumblebee were the only bots that you could recognize. This movie is more ""cool"" than good. I'm looking forward to the sequel and I hope it will be directed by someone else than Bay, I would prefer Cameron."
"salbeik","10","1","6","3 July 2007"," One of the best movies ever in it's category
","As other people, I will start by saying that I am in my mid 20's, so i grew up with transformers. Never been a fan or anything like that. Before watching it, I was convinced that this is going to be one of those movies with a great trailer but the movie itself is going to be a total letdown.<br/><br/>Let me start with GRAPHICS: There are no graphics in this movie...it's reality. It is simply stunning. No shortcomings, graphics are perfect. Every single reflection on any surface is rendered perfectly.<br/><br/>I don't think that you could make this movie better in anyway.<br/><br/>Music : Was totally great (I bought the album). Humor : There's a lot of it. Action: Total action all the time - just great.<br/><br/>In my opinion this is one of the best movies ever in it's category. I just saw it yesterday, and I just can't get it out of my head, some scenes where just amazing and I want to watch it again :D"
"jjrulz","10","1","6","3 July 2007"," Transformers is amazing!
","I walked into the theater wondering about Transformers, I knew that it would either be one of the worst comic-book movies of all time or one of the greatest. It turned out to be the latter. The sound effects were awesome, and the special effects were top-notch. Combines, they made a very realistic effect, and after the first ten minutes I knew I was in for something really special. The storyline was even better. I wasn't a huge fan of the original series (I am only 13) but I know a lot about it, and although I admit that some of the robot designs were dramatically changed, I think that it was for the best. Overall, I recommend this film to anyone who has any taste for good movies. I can't wait for the sequel!"
"Wraith8677","8","1","6","3 July 2007"," Possibly the best movie of the year?
","G1 fans gather together and drag your whole families out of their houses and take them to the theater RIGHT NOW! Because it's Transformers time! The long awaited live-action incarnation of your favorite cartoon is here. And some of your favorite Autobots and Decepticons have come from Cybertron to destroy and protect you. This is by-far one of the best movies of the year, no actually, in a couple of years. If you've ever wanted a movie that blends live-acting with CGI it is Transformers. As far as the look and feel of the movie you actually believe that these robots are walking around on a real set. You are drawn into the characters, (both human and machine) and even more into the fight scenes. <br/><br/>The first half of the movie is very heavy in dialog and surrounds the humans for the most part. While the Transformers part is very fast paced and will raise your blood pressure to the point you want to jump out of your seat cheering. The human cast is made up of actors you all know and love, and Shia (who is mostly a sidekick in other movies, I Robot, Constantine) adds this movie to the growing list of awesome movies he has been involved in. All the human actors are unique and bring something to the movie. The Transformers also bring the action and effects that top this film off as one of the best movies ever. All of the Autobots are unique and have very different personalities that are tied up with Optimus Primes' grand and wise presence. Though the film really focuses on Optimus and Bumblebee, but those are the most beloved Autobots out of the bunch so it doesn't mater too much. The Decepticons on the other hand, though they outnumber the Autobots receive very little screen time with the exception to the end. The Decepticons that received more attention was Barricade, Scorpinok, and Frenzy. Megatron, though he emits a dark presence in the background appears very late in the film, BUT what he lacks in screen time he more than makes up in shear destruction of anything in his way. From tearing an Autobot in half, to flying Optimus through a building, to kicking a human twenty feet into a car. Magatron's appearance is simply horrific and terrifying. The fighting between robots and humans in pure ecstasy, and will impress even the hardcore action fans. <br/><br/>""Well Brad, is there anything else you'd like to add before wrapping it up?"" <br/><br/>Yes, thank you Michael Bay (and Steven Spielberg) for giving us such a great movie that people will be talking about all year, and if things go well,(Like the Transformers toy and TV series) maybe even for generations to come. That is why I give Transformers a perfect 5, out of 5."
"auronlupin","8","1","6","3 July 2007"," So Far the Best Movie of the Summer
","This movie is a must see for anyone who remembers the original Transformers. The action is unbelievable and the Transformers are amazing, Going in I knew Michael Bay would go big with the action, but I never expected him, to go this big. The Transformers clearly over shadow any actor or story they tried to put into the movie. The story is OK, but when the Transformers are fighting you really stop caring for the characters and kind of get annoyed at them. Shia Lebouf was good at providing comic relief, but the camera should not have been on him during the battle scenes. John Turttoro character was annoying and over played by the actor. A surprising good performance by Josh Dummal who ensures his place in any future action movies. Overall the story was weak, but its Michael Bay and Transformers, its all about the action and robots."
"ndurante","10","1","6","29 June 2007"," A few personal technical issues, but completely enjoyable
","Coming out of the movie theaters, I get the sense that at any moment a car is going to start ripping apart and jump over me to fight another robot. This movie has that kind of lasting impact. Although this review will not be entirely glowing and bandwagon, my basic sense is that tonight a select few hundred people bore witness to the birth ( or re-birth ) of the next major blockbuster movie franchise. Kudos to GM for securing their part in the event. Im a Ford guy, and even I wanted to drive that Camaro. Certainly if there are any brains in the management of local Toys-R-Us stores, they should stay open late tomorrow night and hand out maps describing how to get from your theater seat to the Transformer aisle of their store. If there isn't such a marketing tie-in already in play, then they really missed the boat - ( ARK sized boat ).<br/><br/>Starting with the casting of Shia LaBeouf, who has elevated himself through the ranks of young Hollywood babyfaces with well calculated moves such as IRobot and now Transformers, along with longshot risks such as Project Greenlight's ""Battle of Shaker Heights"". Shia's agent should be thanked every day by said actor for helping to insure that he and a certain bright yellow 2008 Camaro will be raking in box office gold for at least the next ten years, if the Hollywood establishment doesn't stick their deft hands into yet another action hero franchise. This possibility is much less likely under the helm of SKG, aka Dreamworks, aka some of the most anti-establishment creative forces yet to descent upon the landscape of American cinema.<br/><br/>Now, on to the main course.<br/><br/>If there is something to be said for a film being TOO beautiful, it is the downfall of the cinema format that you sometimes cross a threshold of visual comprehension and much of the film makers artwork is lost because your eyes just cannot keep up. This is certainly the case in many sequences in this movie. The other technical challenge that contributes to this vertigo is the fact that a tremendously, excruciatingly high percentage of the action is framed in tight closeups. This experience is difficult to explain.<br/><br/>Perhaps I was just sitting too close to the screen, and I am sure that others can either agree or disagree with this technical point - I really wished through a lot of the movie that the POV ( point of view ) was pulled out just a LITTLE BIT to capture more of the Autobots and the action. There are a few sequences towards the end of the movie where this does happen, and the sense of scale and size is far more dramatic ( in my opinion ) than seeing tight close ups of the faces and gears and intertwined robots rolling around in an indistinguishable heap. More than a few times the visual information being presented was just ""out of context"" without visual references to keep the sequence grounded. The freeway cloverleaf sequence, by contrast, gives a far more impressive display of the amazing power of the things you are watching.<br/><br/>I know this sounds like I'm nit picking, but if there is anything about the movie I truly found to be a negative at all, it was the framing of many of the action shots. The only other thing about the movie was this inexplicable gap in the action ( and the comedy ) right in the middle of the flick. The only reason it's so noticeable is that up to that point the pacing of the action, the reveals, the eye candy, and the comedy are intertwined so perfectly as to give you more a sense of being on a theme park Virtual Ride than in a movie. Then comes the "" we have to explain the back-story "" sequence and really slows down the pacing. I think it would have been better served to put it in the sequence when we first see all the Autobots together, but hey - I'm here and Steven Spielberg is there - what do I know. :-) Last little request from film makers - if you're going to put a "" aren't you glad you got in the car "" moment into movies, don't stop the entire final fight scene ( soundtrack, explosions and all ) to let the male and female heroes have a tender moment....<br/><br/>All in all, I cannot imagine any kids NOT wanting to head to the Transformer aisle between now and Monday, and I am certain that EBAY will be on fire with ""rare and collectible"" Transformer collectibles for the rabid child in all of us. From someone who NEVER watched the Transformers as a kid ( I'm 40 ), I can tell you that the movie is a runaway success on all fronts. It didn't surprise me to see that Transformers 2 is already in the works, and slated for a 2009 release. I guess the only things to speculate on are what new Transformers will be in the sequel, and will GM be able to afford an exclusive lock on the product placement in the next installment of this brilliantly crafted franchise. As if Spielberg needed any more money...<br/><br/>RRInfoGuy PS - I hope that Chrysler gets to play in the next one.. who wouldn't want to see a Viper or Cuda up there on the screen?"
"rodneyrude01","9","1","6","29 June 2007"," First 2007 blockbuster that is entertaining!
","I had high expectations for this flick and for the first time since Batman Begins, a film actually lived up to its hype. I was literally bored with Pirates and Spiderman 3 as they offered nothing new and had extremely messy scripts where writers think a good movie these days is made up of 17 parallel story lines and run 30 minutes longer than they need to.<br/><br/>I won't go into the plot so here's my critical yarn Firstly, Transformers has a fantastic script that is actually filled with great comedy. It maintains a reasonably serious tone but knows when to lighten itself up at its silly premise. The acting is quite impressive with Shia LaBeouf sealing himself as the next Leo Dicaprio/Tom Hanks for generation Y.<br/><br/>Now to Mr Bay. People bag him but honestly, have you ever come out of one of his films not entertained? Bay has composed some of the most amazing action sequences here since The Matrix. Maybe not as groundbreaking but for jaw on the floor factor, most definitely.<br/><br/>I have never enjoyed a film so much this year since Hot Fuzz. My only rant is that Bay needs to calm his editors down. Some of the action sequences are edited so fast and shot so tightly, it can be easy to have no idea what is going on, but hey, it's a Bay trademark. Lastly, like all modern blockbusters, it could have had 15 minutes shaved off but is no where near as bloated as two aforementioned sequels. Finally, great score.<br/><br/>I hope this film does well considering all the nerdy backlash. I grew up with Transformers, I don't remember much but as a film, it will be hard to beat for summer blockbusters...Well until we in Australia have to wait another 6 weeks to see Die Hard 4 and Bourne U"
"monique_lawoffice","9","1","6","29 June 2007"," Loved it!!!
","Me and my 10 year old son both loved this movie. I was really dreading going to see this movie because I generally don't like superhero and science fiction type movies, but I was very pleasantly surprised and may even go see it again because I missed so much since the audience and I were laughing. My only complaint is that there were some sexual comments and cursing that could have been left out and would have made the movie more appropriate for my son. More specifically, there was a discussion about masturbation and although I found it very funny, my son did not understand and I had to explain it to him. Overall, I think it's a great movie as long as you're prepared to explain ""adult"" comments to your child."

Kept me hooked throughout.<br/><br/>The only thing stopping it from being perfect is the cheesy dialog towards the end but other than that incredible. Battle scenes are awesome, transformers look incredible and story is entertaining. The characters fit in perfectly with their blend of humor and quirks. The good thing is they never take away anything from the Transformers. And the special effects are top notch. Go see the movie. Best movie of the summer by far!"
"lpeart2006","9","1","6","29 June 2007"," What can I say, it has been done right
","This movie was fantastic. When I have high expectations of a movie, when I see them, they let me down, the Pirates sequels anyone? When I first heard they were making this I said about time they did.<br/><br/>When Michael Bay was announced as director I had no reservations like most fans, he is a top action director and I knew he'd turn this into a great action movie. It doesn't take long to get into action when Blackout attacks an American army bass. The fight scenes between the Autobots and the Decepticons were mind blowing, especially when the jet fighters are taking on Starscream. Some people were concerned that Bumblebee wasn't a VW and Megatron doesn't turn into a gun. No concern because I hardly cared that Bumblebee turned into a Camero and if Megatron turned into a gun it would of not fit with the story The visual effects what can I say, some of the best I have seen in a movie in a long time. The fight scenes, explosions, particle effects and the animation was top notch, especially the transformation.<br/><br/>The acting was good to. Shia LaBeouf played Sam very well, and I liked the comedy they put into it with Ironhide wanting to shoot everything, and when the Autobots are trying to hide in Sam's backyard from parents is a classic.<br/><br/>The only parts the movie is let down in is the unnecessary plot line about the the government trying to decrypt the Decepticons code when they hack the computer system, it serves little purpose to the whole outcome so when Jon Voight is on screen, duck off to the toilet if you need to because you'll miss nothing. The other is the non existent dialog between the Decepticons. Most of them have 1 line each except for Megatron, the Autobots talk to each so the Decepticons should have to, they come of as just killing machines.<br/><br/>There will probably be a sequel because there is no way this movie is going to be a flop, I just hope they don't just add more characters and use the same storyline. If your a fan of the original cartoon you will love this and if you like your action films you will lap this up. And the best bit about it is Australia got a huge blockbuster movie before America. Go see it now"
"imaragon","8","1","6","29 June 2007"," Awesome....Mind Blowing SFX Action
","I am quite new to the Transformers bandwagon and went to the movie Melbourne on the first day as I was dragged by my friends who are absolutely crazy about the Movie.But I have to say I was quite surprised to my amusement, I found the movie to be absolutely great entertainment... the concept was easy to digest as I am a fan of fantasy adventures based movies so got stuck into the feel of the movie quite early in the movie.<br/><br/>The introductions to the characters was quite subtle and the excitement grew as the minutes passed by. The CGI was simply awesome and so were the sound effects. In the first 15 minutes of the movie sets you up with what can you expect in the next hour and half.<br/><br/>The story was simple and the pace was gradual and one can easily feel that something big is coming later down the line in the movie. The movie reminded me of T2 though at different points of time ...in fact there was one instance in the movie where the T2 theme was also played ( maybe not purposely) The lighter moments involving the character of Sam Witwiky and his life and other characters around him were not over the top and actually made we laugh but concentrated in the first half of the movie and the comic timing of the actors and the scene placement was perfect so kudos to the editing team.<br/><br/>I don't want to divulge a lot of details but overall the entertainment value of the movie was great and I loved the concept and how it was handled by Michael Bay and his crew...which we can expect from a director of his caliber.<br/><br/>I would recommend the movie to anyone who is into action/SciFi adventure and good clean fun."

","I am a fan from the cartoon series, not an OTT obsessive fan, but a big fan all the same. Who doesn't want to see huge transforming robots? And the transforming robots, for the most part, are awesome CGI. I think it has set a new benchmark in terms of what is possible with CGI.<br/><br/>Don't worry about Hugo Weaving as the voice of Megatron, its not a biggie like some people thought it would be, although the faces aren't great. Fans already knew before the movie from the hundreds of photos posted on the internet that the faces were significantly different from what was in the cartoons. I personally felt they could of been a bit less complex.<br/><br/>Megan Fox is smoking hot in this movie and reminded me of a young Tea Leoni (think Bad Boys). Sam is a character that grows on your and the relationship with Bumblebee is a nice touch reflecting the tight bond they shared in the cartoon.<br/><br/>There are a lot of slow motion shots, some people like them, some don't, I thought maybe a fraction too many, but anyone who has seen a Michael Bay movie knows to expect that.<br/><br/>In summary, this movie is spectacular and must be seen on the big screen!"

","To be fair, ""Transformers"" is not a masterpiece. It will probably never be classified as ""culturally significant"" or win awards for anything other than visuals.<br/><br/>And, at its heart, it is not much more than a 2 1/2 hour toy commercial.<br/><br/>But here's the thing- It's not really trying to be anything else. Michael Bay, rather than try to deny the cheesy and somewhat ridiculous background of this project has chosen to fully embrace Transformers at the core and the results, believe it or not, are DAMN. GOOD.<br/><br/>Breakthrough special effects are combined with Bay's trademark action sequences to bring the most beloved elements of our favorite toys to life at long last. Top it all off with Peter Cullen and you have a guaranteed blockbuster on your hands!!!!!"
"stopford","9","1","6","28 June 2007"," a blockbuster worthy of the name
","what a great movie. it does what so many recent blockbusters have failed to do. It displays it's multi million dollar effects and CGI to illustrate a well fleshed and well written story line. Too often we put up with poor scripts and one dimensional stick on characters because they blew the budget on 80 ft monsters and explosions. Transformers has the eighty foot monsters but also the well rendered teen angst angle, the nightmare trendy liberal parents and some outstanding comedy from support players Bernie Mac and john Turturro. the young leads were outstanding and watchable and Josh Duhamel shows he is thundering towards leading man status. The action set pieces bring to mind the fun that we had back when Armageddon, Independence Day and Con Air showed blowing stuff up was fun when you do it with real grown up actors and give them scripts written by writers with senses of humour. Even manages to stick in some gentle satire about George W.... or is it .<br/><br/>Go for the giant war fighting toys! Stay for the movie of the year so far."
"slyrider23","7","1","6","28 June 2007"," One of the best action movies this year.
","This year there have been many huge film releases, such as Pirates 3, Spiderman 3, Die Hard 4, and many others. But I believe this film has possibly the most bang you will get for your buck this year. I myself was not a fan of the cartoons, but this movie blew me away. Sure it is about as long as Spiderman 3, but there is far more action. The acting was pretty good and there were some funny moments in this movie. The story is pretty straightforward, and it doesn't stray from the plot. The visuals in Transformers were some of the best I have seen so far, and the cinematography was pretty capturing. I would very much recommend this film to everyone and not just fans of the cartoon. It is a true gem."
"chi_pham","8","1","6","28 June 2007"," Movie was well done
","I was a huge fan growing up so yeah there were many things in the movie that were not 100% like the cartoons. But it was great to see the adaptations made to modernize the cartoon into a movie at present day. I wanted to see this movie for nostalgic reasons despite the fact that I own the cartoon movie that came out in '86 and the first 3 seasons on DVD. The movie did a good job of introducing the characters and story plot while keeping it light and humorous. The bountiful actions scenes were incredible and tied in very well with the soundtrack. If you are a die hard transformers fan you will catch small subtleties here and there throughout the movie from items hanging in the rear view mirror to lines such as ""more than meets the eye"" Even though the characters look different their voices were cast almost identical to the cartoon and the personalities were definitely the same. I would definitely pay to watch this movie and look forward to the second one. I do wish that more characters mainly autobots were shown. However the graphics and special effects were pretty amazing to see them transform and also do battle. I guess the sequel will reveal more of the original characters"

"Octave_One","9","1","6","28 June 2007"," I've dreamt of seeing this movie since I was 8 years old....
","I was a Transformers kid. I loved the toys, the cartoons and even saw the original animated film on the day it was released in my home town in 1987.<br/><br/>As I stood in line waiting to go into the theater last night (28-06-07)to see Transformers, I noticed how excited I was feeling. A few feet away, some guys were waxing on about all the things they assumed would be bad about the movie.<br/><br/>This kind of saddened me, it was almost like they were waiting to see the movie fall flat on its face, or perhaps this cynicism was a defense mechanism. Were they were preparing themselves for the worst? We finally filed into the theater, and after nearly half an hour of commercials and promos, Tranformers finally began.<br/><br/>The first thing that I have to say, is that this ""is"" a Michael Bay film. It has big action, it is populated with broad, shallow characters and has more than a few cringe worthy gags.<br/><br/>But where this film rises above the excessive chaos of his previous films, is in the casting of Shia Lebuff who is both funny and believable. A lesser actor, really would have hamstrung this film. Shia grounds it with his wonderful, relatable performance.<br/><br/>And then there are the Transformers themselves. A wonder to behold. The Autobots have made the transition from cartoon to big screen, with all of their courage and nobility intact. The thrill of seeing these compassionate, giant robots defending their human wards, stumbling through cultural differances and dealing with issues of scale filled me with a childlike happiness.<br/><br/>These characters are more than special effects, and sound design. They really are amazing.<br/><br/>I loved this movie, at it's worst moments it's dumb fun, at it's best it's like watching Jurassic Park for the first time all those years ago. I almost couldn't believe what I was seeing! Interestingly enough, the same trench coat wearing geeks, that were bagging the film as we went into the theater, whole heartedly stood and clapped as it finished."
"jemps918","9","1","6","28 June 2007"," Incredible! Amazing! Super!
","Incredible! Amazing! Super! These are the superlatives that immediately come to mind to describe this crowd pleaser.<br/><br/>Admittedly, I shared many a Transformers fan's apprehension at having Michael Bay (Armaggedon, Pearl Harbor, The Rock, Bad Boys) direct the film. I'm not particularly a fan of his let's-blow-everything-up style, and most other fans thought he's too old (at 42) to relay their sacred bots' story on the big screen. But despite his cockiness, I'm happy to report that he delivered the goods--and how! Mighty wise of him holding back on the previews, which did not share much of the storyline or even a view of a whole robot; this heightened the anticipation and enhanced the effect of seeing the robots transform seamlessly in all its intricately mixed CGI glory, which really blew the audience away.<br/><br/>The action was non-stop and all original (check out the rollerblading 'bot in one of the many intense car chases--a Bay specialty). The Decepticons were really sleek and scary and looked so much tougher than the colorful, dated-looking Autobots, but of course we always root for the underdog. The filmmakers' were also able to successfully translate emotions to the gigantic robots without making them look cutesy and without sacrificing their 'roots'.<br/><br/>Bay really made the most out of the plot, and considering Transformers' target audience (reminiscing Gen X 30somethings, mostly male), the result is an exciting ride which was also pleasantly funny in parts. Never mind if there were endless plugs on My Little Pony, Furby, Nokia, etc. They only served to honor one of the movie's messages: that old-school is still cool (and that knowing some ancient tactics can definitely help you in a pinch!).<br/><br/>It helped that latest Hollywood hot property Shia LaBeouf (Disturbia, Indiana Jones 4) was likable and had good comic timing, and the staple Bay hottie was played to the hilt by the beautiful Megan Fox. Josh Duhamel (Las Vegas) releases his reliance on his looks to play the leader of the Special Ops team who first gets attacked by the Decepticons.<br/><br/>Autobot leader Optimus Prime has been called one of our generation's strongest father figures, and his fate in this movie will definitely please his fans. You might be surprised to see him with lips in this version, although it is said that in the later Japanese animations, he already had them.<br/><br/>Finally, a summer blockbuster for the year that isn't a sequel and doesn't disappoint! A sequel is sure to be in the works, featuring the other Transformers who weren't featured in this installment. Yet another flick to anticipate!"
"singitwifme","9","1","6","28 June 2007"," I am sooooooo impressed *light spoilers*
","i won't put huge spoilers in because I know that half the world has yet to see it (thank god it was released earlier down here in Australia)... but i will say now, when the first transformer came on screen and transformed, the mouths of everyone in our cinema dropped. Literally. this movie already made it into my list of the top 10 movies for 2007, and it was only 10-15 minutes into the opening scene. And boy did it get better. they continued to impress not only in the graphics and CGI, but in the storywriting which was actually humorous, and people that have no clue about transformers...OK, i was one of them... would b able to follow along easily with narration as well as clear repetition of all the main story plots vocally by characters. All the action sequences were spectacular, each of them outdoing the last. The best way I thought to describe it is that it was a boys wet dream (i am female by the way, and could see it as this)... u had cars, action, suspense, a girl who knew what she was doing, comedy, the army and of course the transformers. I was set for disappointment, but ended up being astounded, proving that I should so not judge before I go to the movies."
"Gideon40","9","1","6","28 June 2007"," The best summer blockbuster in years
","I just came back from the premier where I live, and this is, quite frankly, the most amazing blockbuster ever in years.<br/><br/>To get this out of the way first, the bad points of the film were that the two human protagonists, don't seem to act all that surprised when discovering the first transformer. I feel that the film could have done without the love plot line; its too clichéd in blockbuster films these days.<br/><br/>Also, the story is told entirely from Sam Witwicky and the Autobot's point of view, which means the decepticons are almost never seen interacting with one another. The rivalry between Starscream and Megatron exists only in one spoken line.<br/><br/>Its a pity, considering how the original cartoons divided equal time between the autobots and decepticons, but I guess that is what the sequels are for.<br/><br/>If you are fine with that, then this movie is an absolute blast. The action scenes are lengthy and breathtaking. While the decepticons aren't given much speaking lines, there are a lot of scenes showing them wreaking havoc on anything other than themselves.<br/><br/>The action scenes are unbelievable. I'm a pretty harsh critic when it comes to action scenes in movies, and I have to say nothing tops the climax of this film. I won't say anything more, except to suggest that you try not to blink. You don't want to miss one millisecond of the climax, trust me.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, and structured well. Don't expect a deep, thoughtful storyline that is bulletproof from scrutiny, but expect something that is entertaining and follows the original cartoons in spirit. There was maybe one scene which dragged on longer than it should have, but thats about it. The whole show is quite long at 2 1/2 hours, though a movie on this scale deserves to be 3 hours long.<br/><br/>Overall if you can overlook the above mentioned flaws, this is the summer blockbuster to compensate for the disappointments of Spider Man, Pirates and Shrek 3. If you have to see one summer blockbuster, make it this one."

","hey all, i'm a huge Shia Labeouf fan - this guy is so funny, and he has this quirky acting style, which is why i wanted to watch transformers so bad. it's not generally the type of movie i'd watch, because come on - they're giant robot car things... transformers come on!!! - but I loved it. I have to be honest and say the story isn't the best story ever... i mean it's pretty crap to be honest, it's kinda like comic book style, you know way over the top (eg. we have to rescue the baby from inside the whale that's about to get killed by the giant volcano that is secretly a pimple on someone's face) <br/><br/>***** but because the acting is so suburb, and because the script, despite it's very fictitious tale, is very funny and keeps you heaps interested all throughout - in my opinion it's a winner... Oh! and not to mention the visual animation - it is just incredible.<br/><br/>This movie is an action, comedy, science fiction, space movie with a hint of romance. A good all-rounder movie for the family."

","Some of my gripes: <br/><br/>Too loud! My ears are still ringing. And why is it, when you buy the DVD, you have to turn your receiver up to 50 to get any decent sound? And don't sit too close to the screen when you go see this thing.<br/><br/>Horrible, horrible picture quality. One would think in this day and age, they would have perfect picture quality. The image was so grainy, I'll probably have to skip on the DVD if this is what I have to look forward to, jeesh. They should use the cameras like the ones used on X-Men.<br/><br/>Couldn't tell which robot was which? The fight scenes were shot so tight, I could not tell what was going on half the time. Please tell me I'm not the only one who felt this way. Difficult to discern the good from the bad bots. The desert scenes weren't as bad.<br/><br/>The acting and the script were terrible. Josh D. (Las Vegas) was one of the very few good actors in this movie.<br/><br/>Why did it take so long for the bots to come to the rescue all the time? For example, first scene with Camaro... why did it wait so long to help the 'kids' when it was sitting right there??? <br/><br/>Over $10.00 for 1 pop and 1 popcorn! Are u kidding me! <br/><br/>Some of my likes: <br/><br/>The vehicles and the bot transformations. <br/><br/>That (new) Camaro is sweet! <br/><br/>The overall F/X, I must have thought a hundred times 'how did they do that?' <br/><br/>There were only 8 of us in the theatre."

","This film was a real pleasure to behold. Seeing my beloved childhood toys and favorite cartoon explode on the big screen in a way I never imagined was just way to cool. I never thought they could make a live action Transformers that could look so realistic, but they proved me wrong. The story, well it is the Autobots versus the Decepticons of course. Granted there is more to it than that as they are trying to get to this mysterious artifact called the cube before the other group. We also have a young youth in search of his first car, lots of humor and a lot of action as well. The only complaints I have are minor as I would have liked to have seen some of the Decepticons a bit more, as Starscream and Megatron are confined to the end of the film. However, I got to see Optimus Prime a good bit so I will not complain to much about that. The action is great in this movie, as we start off with one rather impressive attack on a military base that really sets up the movie with a bang. We then have numerous other scenes of the Decepticons trying to search for the whereabouts of the cube and Megatron who has a connection with the boy searching for his first car. We have a great scene involving a Decepticon cop car and Bumble Bee (one of the Autobots) and at the end all the ends tie together in one fierce battle in the middle of a city. Great fight and an impressive conclusion to this movie. So be prepared to watch one of the more fun and action packed movies of the summer as the Autobots fight the evil forces of the Decepticons."

","11 years ago there was a movie that was highly anticipated that was coming out on 4th of July, in ""Independance Day"". 11 years later another movie comes along with equal or greater fanfare with a lot of parallels. I bought a ticket five days in advance. I got to the theater two hours early to find out that 50 or so people beat me there. I sat outside on the hard concrete anxiously waiting to get in and sit down. AND IT WAS ALL WORTH IT.<br/><br/>Transformers by far had the BEST CGI I've EVER seen. Ladies and Gentlemen, a new bar has been set for CGI. Put the entire film world on notice that Transformers has raised the bar. I was stunned, I was flabbergasted, I was amazed at how excellent the CGI was. There was a taste of it within the first 15 minutes when an attack helicopter transformed into a large fully mobile robot and began attacking a U.S. base in Qatar. The detail and realism was so magnificent. The transformations and then the movements of the robots was absolutely flawless. And for people like me that watched and owned transformers as a kid, it was beautiful to see Optimus Prime, Jazz, and the new Bumble Bee. Speaking of Bumble Bee, what a great way to introduce the new Camaro. It was so seamless how the transformers went from vehicle to robot and back again. Just about every transformation brought about much deserved applause.<br/><br/>This movie is way ahead of its time. The action was mind blowing, and Michael Bay did a stupendous job by keeping up the tempo throughout the movie even between action sequences. There was plenty of humor and dialogue to keep the audience entertained when we were not being graced by the illustrious transformers. No expense was spared for this movie. This was just such a fabulous tribute to the toys and the cartoon, I can only hope that there will be a sequel."
"editor-299","6","1","7","29 June 2007"," Surprisingly deep despite subject matter
","The biggest surprise I received upon viewing the newest Dreamworks release, ""Transformers,"" was how mature the script was, especially coming from a concept deeply rooted in Saturday morning cartoon origins.<br/><br/>Running from 1984-87, the animated TV series competed with the likes of ""He Man, Master of the Universe"" and ""Thundercats"" for the macho affections of young boys growing up in that decade. Now, thanks to the efforts of producer Steven Spielberg and director Michael Bay (""The Rock,"" ""Armageddon,"" ""Pearl Harbor,"" ""The Island""), a live-action version that combines the adventure and violence that is Bay's trademark, with some crisp writing and fairly humorous situations (thanks to screenwriters Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzman, """"Legend of Zorro,"" ""The Island"").<br/><br/>A little known fact amongst those not as familiar with the cartoon or comic book is that this live-action version was not the first feature film. In 1986, the animated ""Transformers: The Movie"" appeared. It jumped the action forward in time 20 years to the then-future of 2005 and pitted both the Autobots and Decepticons against the menace of the giant planet-eating robot, Unicron. <br/><br/>Well, except for joining together and the the Unicron part, this new version features pretty much the same plot. Now, though, the story is helped along with the inclusion of young stars, Shai LeBeouf (""Holes,"" ""Disturbia"") and Megan Fox (TV series ""Hope and Faith,"" ""Two And A-Half Men"") and some seasoned veterans, Jon Voight, Bernie Mac and John Tuturro, this is one (dare I say?) fairly funny and complex film.<br/><br/>Okay, it isn't ""Hamlet,"" (in fact, it's not even ""In the Line of Fire""), but it is still enjoyable and exciting at the same time. Another interesting concept is the three simultaneous plot lines, including a high school nerd, Sam Witwickey (LeBeouf) trying to impress a girl, Mikaela (Fox) and get his first automobile; an attack on a group of soldiers (led by Josh Duhamel) in Qatar by a renegade helicopter/robot; and the hacking of the United States defense computer system. In this latter story, Voight plays the Secretary of Defense John Keller, sort of a more compassionate Donald Rumsfeld.<br/><br/>Taking the forms of cars, trucks, aircraft and even a radio (for comic relief), the Autobots, led by Prime (voice of Peter Cullen), and the Decepticons, under the rule of Megatron (Hugo Weaving, ""The Matrix,"" ""Lord of the Rings""), are fighting a thousand-year conflict over a cube of ultimate power. The poor dopes on Earth are simply pawns in this galactic struggle and, more often than not, caught in the middle.<br/><br/>Still, the humans are not entirely helpless, as the soldiers, Sam, Mikaela and even Keller (who wields a shotgun like Dick Cheney on steroids), help to battle the baddies in the streets of New York at the end.<br/><br/>The graphics are nicely done, with the rather difficult illusion of switching from an innocent looking vehicle to a huge, deadly robotic monster appearing quite realistic. The acting gets a bit hammy now and then, but nothing like Bay's earlier efforts. And, as previously mentioned, the scribbling is clever enough to keep the older set in their seats during some of the more redundant battle sequences.<br/><br/>Not a perfect summer movie by any means (it's extremely loud, it goes on for about 15 minutes too long and in some cases, it's difficult to tell the good automatons from the bad ones), but, overall, not bad.<br/><br/>Not bad at all."

","For years we have enjoyed the Hasbro toys, ""Transformers, Robots in Disguise"", and seen many cartoons (that look like the makers of PokÃ©mon), but finally they are turned into a high-tech, special effects crammed and explosive live action science-fiction action adventure, from director Michael Bay (Bad Boys, The Rock, Armageddon) and executive producer Steven Spielberg. A long time ago, far away on the planet Cybertron a war waged between the noble Autobots, led by Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), and the devious Decepticons, led by traitorous brother Megatron (Hugo Weaving) for control of the Allspark, or The Cube, that gives great power to whoever possesses it. The Autobots managed to smuggle the Allspark into outer space, until it finally landed on planet Earth. The Allspark was first found by Captain Archibald Witwicky (William Morgan Sheppard), who had a map engraved into his glasses by Megatron, and send a transmission to Cybertron. He is then carted away by the Captain's ship. A century later, teenager Sam 'Spike' Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) buys his first car, and to his shock it turns into Autobot guardian Bumblebee (Mark Ryan), and of course, get the glasses of his great grandfather's. All the other Autobots soon show up, but also in the desert of Qatar, the Decepticons show up attacking U.S. military bases, causing the Prentagon to send Sector Seven agents to capture the ""specimens of this alien race"". Sam, his new girlfriend Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) and the human race are now in the middle of a grand battle with these robots, and Megatron waking from his frozen state makes it even worse. Also starring Josh Duhamel as Captain Lennox, Tyrese Gibson as USAF Tech Sergeant Epps, Rachael Taylor as Maggie Madsen, Scary Movie 3's Anthony Anderson as Glen Whitmann, Jon Voight as Defense Secretary John Keller and Small Soldiers' Kevin Dunn as Ron Witwicky. The special effects mixed with live action are incredible, particularly transformations and weapon fire, pretty much every moment in this film will grab your attention and keep you hooked. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Sound, Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects. Very good!"

I enjoyed the hell out of the movie. Its loud, proud, has smattering of Michael Bay tack (which could have saturated the 2 hours 20 minutes). The only niggly issue I had was with some of the excess side characters, but when the crap hits the fan then its on and they essentially disappear.<br/><br/>And when i say the action starts, the last hour is full on, high adrenaline and it is very impressive to watch. And Starscream kicks ass, every sequence he is in, he is ruining people, gotta love it.<br/><br/>One of the things I liked is that it was aimed not at kids, but more to the middle audience, teens and above, several cut off obscenities and awkward conversations with Sam's parents (very funny) make the film feel like an actual film rather then just an advert for merchandise.<br/><br/>All up, I really enjoyed the film and was pleasantly surprised by how much I did so.

","Transformers is a great show for 30 min, you have a lots of explosion and satisfying visual effects such as the metamorphose of Autobots in car, but the major problem is that the the scenario's blank spaces are filled with those explosions. At the end, the scenario is so poor in substance that you understand the story join the movie in the last 30 minutes. Everything becomes repetitive.

"josephrygaard","5","0","1","23 December 2019"," Before Watching: Transformers (2007)
","""Transformers"" (2007) is the infamous sci-fi movie based on the beloved Hasbro robot characters. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>Transformers is about a guy called Sam and his car, which turns out to be a robot involved in an interstellar war with other robots. The visual effects, battles and sound design are pretty and very impressive, however, that is also where the praise stops.<br/><br/>Transformers suffer from a lot from objective issues. There is a lot of illogical plot elements, immature teenage humor, sensuality, and flat, stereotypical characters. Mixed with an uneven pacing where certain scenes are stretching way too long, there's a big risk for audiences to feel uninterested and frustrated. The movie is at times also confusing and unclear about exactly what is going on, and certain side characters can feel inhuman and very over-the-top. The more these points are vital to one's watching experience, the more the same watcher will identify to the previously mentioned audience. This movie is clearly aimed to the younger teenagers and can likewise be perceived as cool and thrilling if one is 12, 13, or maybe even 14. Beyond that, one would need a lot of love for the franchise and forgiveness alike to enjoy the experience, especially as this level of quality doesn't improve with the sequels.<br/><br/>My personal grade: a very average 5/10.

","Give Michael Bay a budget and he'll spend it. Wisely or not is up for debate. But damn, the man-child that he truly is certainly is presented through his mind-numbing work. Enough pyrotechnics to annihilate an entire nation and an adequate amount of Megan Fox showcasing to transition into the adult entertainment business. So, Transformers. A franchise decimated by needless, unimaginative sequels that tarnished the reputation of the primary instalment. Also known as, the only decent entry Bay ever conceived. A group of Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, sent to Earth to prevent the Decepticons from reviving the antagonistic Megatron and retrieving an extraterrestrial cube.<br/><br/>This blockbuster opposes everything I stand for as an amateur critic, film buff and general human being. Its bombastic nihilism, riddled with blatant exposition, surmounts to an unquantifiable splurge of stuff happening onscreen. Seriously. It's the equivalent of being lobotomised and watching a sunset from a stained glass window. The colours, brightness and artificial heat would melt your retinas. That's Transformers.<br/><br/>But what people seemingly forget, especially those elitists too afraid to breach admittance, is that Bay's first foray into the franchise is actually tolerable. Good, even. And by that, I don't mean it's the epitome of blockbusting entertainment. Far from it. Yet Bay, a director incredibly easy to pick on due to his accessibly basic yet overly explosive features, implants genuine directorial talent that prove his integrity. Yes, about an hour of the film's runtime is explosive, with buildings toppling and metallic vehicular warfare ensuing.<br/><br/>However, what makes Transformers utterly re-watchable is the constant flow of its narrative. It never stagnates. For over two hours, Bay continually pushes the story forward. Whether it be sweaty soldiers exhuming mountains of testosterone, sweaty LaBeouf clamming up or sweaty Fox suggestively leaning over the hood of a car (realising Bay's wet dream...), it doesn't matter. The point is, there's never a dull moment through the frantic action. A commendable quality that provides motion to the narrative's mechanisms. Bay knows how to exploit a budget. You go big, or you go home. He clearly understood that literally.<br/><br/>Another reason as to why the first chapter is one of his best films, is the simplistic story. The actual plot is thin, with a couple of robots stopping some other robots from destroying everything. Basic foundations without convoluted lore that is constructed as if the writers are formulating random ideas as they're writing the script (*cough* Revenge of the Fallen...). Yet what furthers the script's memorability is the humorous characterisation. The Witwicky clan in particular. LaBeouf delivered a frenetic performance that solidified his leading qualities (which may have backfired on him!). His adolescent antics and heroic endeavours forced him to be both relatable and likeable. Fox, despite being presented on a suspiciously stained silver platter, held her own as well without resorting to the typical ""damsel in distress"" scenario. Supporting cast were buoyant also. The governmental world ending plot merged well with the teen angst situation, even if it was a colossal convenience. And a plethora of memorable quotes that I unknowingly recite on a daily basis. ""Shut up Grandma! Drink your prune juice!"". Classic.<br/><br/>It teeters on mediocrity at the best of times, however Bay's focus on the human elements for the vast majority of the first hour ensured that it was more than just mechanical beings punching each other to fluctuating bass drops. There is substance before the clunky visual and auditory extravaganza. Did I grow up with the original source material? Of course not. Regardless though, I think we all need reminding just how solid this blockbuster really is. ""Autobots! Roll out!""."

(Example: (2018 movie) At 1900 ends bumblebee came to the planet earth. save the earth with optimus prime and more autobots comes. after 20+ years (2007 movie) autobots comes again like they couldn't make it at first.If you make a movie for beginings you have to be carefull on timeline of the story guys...

I didn't think it was the next Star Wars or Spielberg masterpiece, just acceptable blockbuster entertainment. <br/><br/>I decided to watch the film for the first time in ages and while it isn't the worst, it hasn't aged well either. Many issues critics highlighted with the sequels are also present in the first, just to a lesser extent. There's stereotypes, shouty characters, inappropriate sexual innuendos and voyeurism in addition to excessive action. <br/><br/>On the positive side, the story is straightforward and the Transformers themselves are entertaining. The effort the CG people went into putting every detail of the transformations is astounding and the sound design is also top notch.<br/><br/>While it does have a comprehensible story and isn't as awful as the sequels, I can't say this is a good or underrated movie amidst an infamous franchise, even though I'd like to.

","Proof, if proof were needed, of the way in which Hollywood blockbusters have been successfully dumbing down in the past thirty years, TRANSFORMERS is a bloated mess that contains genre staples and not one jot of originality. It's a story of cool special effects and not a lot else – and leaves me wondering why there was a need to have any human interest in the film whatsoever. Why not just focus on the robots and leave it at that? Michael Bay is far from a favourite director, but I used to get a kick out of his epics like Armageddon. TRANSFORMERS makes that movie look like a masterpiece in retrospect.<br/><br/>The main problem is with the script. Clearly aiming the franchise at the American male teenager demographic, we get toilet humour (watch out for the 'hilarious' scene where a transformer urinates fuel on a bad guy), crass jokes (the one about masturbation is the most unnecessary and dumb), the ubiquitous Anthony Anderson (as unbelievable as a computer hacker as Denise Richards was a nuclear scientist in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH) and the appearance of what must be the dumbest bimbo (Megan Fox) seen on screens in a long while. Running in at almost two and a half hours, this could easily have lost an hour and a half, because it's unbelievably padded. The first hour only just introduces the characters, and the last half hour is an action scene. Cut out all the stupid jokes, all the poor acting from the rubbish Shia LaBeouf, the overacting John Turturro, and the do-anything-for-a-buck Jon Voight, and you're left with a cartoon that's not even as good as the original TRANSFORMERS: THE MOVIE, an animation made back in 1986.<br/><br/>Bay overdirects things as per usual and borrows some shaky-cam effects in an effort to up the tension, but the result is that much of the action is just a blur of computer effects. Saying that, the special effects ARE impressive, and I absolutely loved the look of the transformers themselves. It's just a shame they couldn't have appeared in a better film. The only bit worth watching is the city battle at the climax, a massive, special-effects filled, ten-explosions-a-minute action sequence that reminded me of those old Toho monster bashes. Seeing giant monsters tossing cars, smashing buildings, tearing each other to pieces and battling the military makes for a highly entertaining section, and must have cost an absolute packet to put together. If they repackaged the movie, removing Shia LaBeouf and including just this 30-minute scene, I'd probably buy it. But I have no inclination to go near TRANSFORMERS ever again. Spielberg, who's clearly in this for the money alone, should be absolutely ashamed of himself."

","I grew up watching during the weekends Transformres, I also ,like any 10 to 12 year old boy Transformers' toys and I put then to fight.So I will give you my point of view to the first Transformers movie ,which came out in 2007. The reason why ,I start with this and not the most recent one is the fact that ,the first of this Franchise is the best and by best I mean most tolerable to watch ,because the next three are treason against the Cybetronians as a whole. To start with the good part the CGI are almost perfect and the voices of Optimus and Megatron are amazing. And now the bad part. Firstly everyone here acts awfully indeed and the worst were by fact Megan Fox and Shia Lebouf ,their characters are so stereotypical that the supporting cast seems to play OK, and that no easy feet. Next the action is fully of unfocused scenes, sake camera and too many stupid one liners. Thridly and by far the most significant reason , why I have negative feeling for this movie is the fact the the Tranformers are not the MAIN characters in THEIR OWN MOVIE. To add insult to injure this flick nominated for 3 Oscar. WHO? This has no explanation apart for the effects part. The last complain is the ending which although is not horrible, I felt it rushed when I saw again the movie. The funny thing is that , when I was in my teens and Isaw for the first time I like it ,but when after a year when I saw it again one year later ,was a nostalgia killer ,for a time I end up hating the Transformers. If someone is to blame is the Paramount and Micheal Bay, the later has more blame because he made of Franchise out of it and thanks to the previous mentioned acclaim ,his ego went berserk. As a result of that, the following flicks were even worse. First Tranformer ,then Teenage Mutant Nintza Turtles and in 2017milk to it will come out a Power Ranger movie ,it is official, Hollyhood is set on milking to death our childhood."

The peaceful Autobots defend earth against the evil Decepticons that are in search of a cube in connection to their planet. Special effects are impressive as vehicles shift into robots but they are really there to beat the bolts out of each other. Directed by Michael Bay without a shred of story. Bay is known for directing such junk as Armageddon and Pearl Harbor. This is at least an improvement for him. Shia LaBeouf, in the one decent role, ends up in possession of Autobot Bubblebee, but supporting actors are are only there to shout over loud noise and make narrow escapes. John Voight sleepwalks through the role of secretary of defense. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson play soldiers who are hardly useful. They attempt to fight the Decepticons, which becomes a joke once those machine begin mashing our technology into hub caps. Megan Fox is laughable playing the female lead whose role consists of bending over an engine exposing her cleavage.

","Behold the filmmaking of Michael Bay, which consists entirely of hot women, bad actors, and noisy robots jumping all over the place. The transformer toys are a childhood favorite for many across the world, appealing mostly to young boys. Now director Michael Bay has them on the big screen in a pg-13 rated film. I give credit to Bay for allowing there to be a plot and not just a bunch of metal flying around and blowing u. Well actually that's all there is. In addition to a ridiculous concept and horrendous acting from Shia LaBeouf and the young hottie Megan Fox, Bay fills the screen with ear-piercing noises and overdone visual effects that consist entirely of making as much of a raucous as possible. Literally, I had no idea what the motivation for all this destruction was. At one point I wondered if anyone would pay attention to how mega-robots were destroying everything in sight and if anyone died in the process of this mayhem. ""Transformers"" is a joke of a film, relying mostly on the stupidity of Michael Bay's direction and the shattering visuals that bombard our senses in a negative way. What we have to sit through is teenager Sam Witwicky's (LaBouef) first car actually being an alien robot. This isn't the only alien to arrive on Earth. Optimus Prime and a fellow group of transforming robots have arrived in search of the Allspark. But Optimus Prime and the Autobots aren't the only aliens to appear. Megatron and the Decepticons are also searching for the Allspark, and they would do anything to get it, even if it means destroying the world. Yep, I'm afraid this is what they're calling entertainment these days. Nothing wrong with a fun film once in a while dominated by heavy visual use and funky sounds. But Bay doesn't get it. He uses too much stupidity and unflattering cinematic techniques to deliver a money-making piece of trash with zero entertainment factors and a whole lot of heart-scratching."

Most of my problem with this movie is script-related. A lot of it is hard to watch, the logic is specious and the gags are awful.<br/><br/>On the whole, there are better ways to do a big Transformers blockbuster, and Michael Bay is the wrong direction (incomprehensible action scenes, dizzying camera movements). For one, alien doesn't equate with insectile. They don't have to look like toys from the '80s, but they also don't have to be hideous. This is some expensive CGI, but I can't tell what body party I'm looking at.

"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","2","10 December 2014"," Almost more of a comedy than a sci-fi film
","Back in 2007, Michael Bay was back with his newest project: Transformers. With ""Armageddon"" and ""Pearl Harbor"" already under his belt, he was known for films who managed to shine more through gigantic special effects than through critical acclaim. However, ""Transformers"" brought him at least a bit of the latter. This was Shia LaBeouf's breakthrough movie and with 150 minutes it runs very long again just like Bay's previous works.<br/><br/>The first 100 minutes are really something like ""American Pie meets sci-fi"". The humor switches between really funny and downright cringeworthy on some occasions. The last third of the film is basically no comedy at all anymore, just 50 minutes of science fiction and action sequences as we get to watch Optimus Prime battle Megatron. The movie got some acclaim at the teenager-oriented movie awards and at the Oscars it received three nominations in the technical categories, but lost them all (2 of these to the newest Bourne movie). One of these nominations was the sound editing category, where the team from ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy reunited. In the sound mixing category, Kevin O'Connell scored his 20th and so far most recent Academy Award nomination. Still no win though. A somewhat sad Academy record. ""Transformers"" features new faces in some of the key roles, including LaBeouf, but frequent movie-goers also get to see Jon Voight, John Turturro and some more experienced Hollywood actors. This includes regulars from ""House M.D."", ""Law & Order"" and ""Prison Break"" for example in some of the parts.<br/><br/>One character who did almost nothing for me (except being delighted to see Anthony Anderson in her scenes too) was Rachael Taylor's. It added really nothing of worth to the whole story. I could have done completely without her and that wasn't even the actress' fault.<br/><br/>This movie does not have one gigantic major flaw. It's okay for the most of it, but it wasn't really outstanding either. Megan Fox is nice to look at and the special effects are pretty spectacular. LaBeouf gives a performance that is appropriate for a superhero movie. Personally I'd recommend it more to younger audiences. There's not really any harmful violence going on and the humor in the first 100 minutes (which would actually work as a comedy film on its own) is just aimed at teenagers mostly. So if you like science fiction films, give it a go."
"buckfandan","5","0","3","27 June 2014"," What did I just see.
","Sitting in this movie I kept thinking ""its going to get better, it must get better!"" but I was so wrong. I was surprised to see a lot of over saturated/structured cgi shots but that's not what I'd call BAD. What was bad first of all was not one character was likable in the whole movie. Not Mark Wahlberg, not the Irish dude, not even Optimus prime! Take Mark Wahlberg's character for instance, he was a over-protective crappy inventor who was not able to provide for his family. The whole movie sets you up to think he is going to invent something good(think Hugh Jackman in Real Steel) but nope. Not one good invention. He's just a moody guy who's mad because he finds out his daughter has a boyfriend and you get to hear him whine about it the rest of the movie. Not a good Wahlberg role. The autobots were also annoying they seemed kind of like spoiled kids. Doing whatever they wanted and when faced with danger they ran away with their tails between their legs. Now for the comic relief. It was annoying in most cases. Each character pretty much took part in what I call ""dumb comedy"" where the character says something really dumb that turns out being funny. That works most of the time but when every character is doing it whether it's in their character profile or not, it ruins anything they had going for them. Most of this comedy was so frequent and redundant that it became annoying very quickly. And then we have the script. Good gosh, EVERY line was so bad it was laughable. I was seriously shaking my head for almost the entire film which was close to 3 hours by the way. That's a long time to sit in one place for even a good movie. Needless to say I was glad when it ended. I was so surprised to hear people clapping when the movie came to an end but the smidgen of hope for humanity in me would like to think they were clapping because it finally ended rather than showing their approval for the movie. As soon as it ended I had to look up the director and writer and I was surprised to see that they have done some decent movies previously. I don't know what happened with this one but I haven't heard a script this bad since The Host (2013) and before that probably The Last Airbender (2010). Redeeming qualities? I doubt there are any. Maybe some cool sound effects and 1 or 2 jokes that were actually funny but even then I felt embarrassed to laugh. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, all of this has given me more respect for Shia LaBeouf because the last transformers movie with the same crew was 10 times better than this one."

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","0","1","9 April 2014"," Juuuuuust can't love it.
","Michael Bay has a style that I like to call ""yutz charm."" He makes movies presumably for an audience who doesn't ask for much beyond having their movies be loud and pretty to look at. That's not to say that the audiences for his movies fit the term ""yutz"" but Bay likes to treat them as if they are. He's the brainchild behind such box office firebrands as ""Pearl Harbor"", ""The Rock"", ""Armageddon"" and ""Bad Boys."" His movies are loud, crude and colorful; they move fast and stuff gets blow'd up real gooder.  Bay makes movies at two speeds: Pathetic and passable. Most of the time his work falls into the former, but ""Transformers"" falls into the latter. There are good things in it, moments that could almost be mistaken for being ""inspired."" Yet, for every effective scene there are two that aren't. You get a funny line of dialogue and then a robot that urinates on a man sitting in his car. Scene like that kind of make you lose faith.<br/><br/>""Transformers"", of course, are based on a line of toys first introduced in the 1980s. It was clever, you could bend and twist these toys and turn them from robots into cars and other things. It wasn't exactly food for the mind, but it was a clever idea. Added to that was a TV show, then a rather superfluous 1986 animated movie and now a $150,000,000 retro exercise that is entertaining while you're watching it but means nothing when it's over.<br/><br/>The story isn't much, but here goes: Two cults of ancient robots have arrived on Earth having battles one another for centuries across the galaxy. In this corner are The Autobots led by Optimus Prime who fight for right and might and want to spare the human race their war. In this corner are the Decepticons, who could give a rip about the human race and want to turn all of our technology against us. They're in a battle to retrieve something called The All Spark, which sounds like a set of spark plugs but is actually device that can turn a mundane object into a transformer. Why they need it is somewhat unclear. Actually, it would have made more sense if they were looking for a set of spark plugs.<br/><br/>The robots themselves are 50-feet tall and have an arsenal of weapons. They can contort themselves into vehicles – trucks, cars, planes, you name it. Bay's spirit of ""yutz charm"" assumes that you will overlook the question of how a robot the size of a small office building could contain enough metal to transform itself into a half-ton pickup truck. On the bright side, several of the robots do have personalities. Their dialogue is more or less perfunctory but there was, at least, an attempt to give them something more than big weapons. More might have been done, however, to make the robots more appealing. The Autobots and the Decepticons are incomprehensible when you look at them. Their faces aren't expressive, but hidden within all the metal. They have mouths but why do they need them? The All Spark is in the possession of a teenager named Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBouf), a kid so nervous that he runs the risk of developing hypertension before he gets into college – maybe it has something to do with the fact the his name is WitWicky. His parents are no help. His mother is a jabbering idiot and his father takes pride in making his son's life a living nightmare. As the movie opens, Sam is about to receive his first car. No points for guessing that the car is More Than Meets the Eye – see I went there. Also into his life falls Mikaela (Megan Fox), a rapturous beauty who falls for Sam because - gasp – she cares about him. They briefly have a relationship that in another movie might have been interesting. Ms. Fox, it should be said, is the most appealing special effect in the whole movie.<br/><br/>This is a strange movie. Every action, every moment is ramped up beyond the ordinary. Even moments of calm between the human characters have the urgency of a cartoon. Most of it is given over to the clatter and bang of the visual effects department. Much of the movie is given over to the fights between the robots. When they fight and their bodies are pressed against one another, you can't tell one from the other. They're metal; therefore they can't get hurt, so why do we care? If they get destroyed, they can be rebuilt. Right? Maybe that's what the All Spark was for? It's hard to ask questions, just be mesmerized by the Yutz Charm and don't ask too many questions."

","Transformers is a franchise that was born out of the need to make money. And yet, it grew beyond being just another '80s toy marketing scheme into it's own distinct universe and tone. It had a soul. It was one of those things where all you had to do was take one look at it and go, ""That's Transformers."" But this movie has no soul. It does not revolve around Optimus Prime and the Autobots fighting a (somehow) covert war against the Decepticons. No, this movie revolves around the adventures of Shia LaBeouf and his Styrofoam-bland girlfriend Megan Fox getting in over their heads and delivering exposition.<br/><br/>Now, I know what you're thinking: ""It's got the giant robots in it, and that's all I need."" Well, you know how in the cartoons there's always an explosion of color whenever sheit goes down, accompanied by kick-ass music? Yeah, this movie, and ALL of Bay's Transformers movies, have none of that. The fights take place in this eerie silence and all of the unique colors of both the Autobots and the Decepticons are lost under a pile of chrome. The Transformers themselves are unrecognizable aside from Optimus and the sound of the Transformers changing from vehicles to bots always made my skin crawl.<br/><br/>""Soulless""...

","I am a big fan of cheesy and exaggerated action, but this one disappointed me. It is a shame - I was looking forward to it, even though it was based on a toy-franchise. I find the idea of giant robots fighting each other oddly exciting - if it well made. But there is too little memorable action. There was too little, too late. The movie seem to run in slo-mo, then there is absolute chaos, then it is slow again, some chaos, boring, and finally, self-righteous end. I give it 3. Will not watch again. Some bad things: It has been directed by a donkey. It is too long. It gets very dull. It is too self-important. It is too sentimental. It focuses too much on teen-romance and ""Dawson"". It has very weak character definition. The robots aren't introduced properly, one doesn't get to know them. The robots are stiff and have no significant or memorable traits. There is also a contradiction in length and the shallow toys-concept: This movie is, on the one hand, very long and self-important. The music is sentimental and the plot and mood feels like it's trying to be moving. On the other hand, the movie tries to be young and fun. Both cannot be achieved in one work. Cannot recommend."

It's a roller coaster thrill ride, with a punchy soundtrack of epic proportion and likable characters.<br/><br/>Now for the bad. The dialogs are a bit too easy, it kept to its roots in that aspect. Shia Laboeuf's character can be a bit unnerving with its over-dialoging, especially in the beginning, since you haven't really had time to get to know him. The story line is unimaginative and the characters one dimensional. Finally, lots of departure from the original stories and robot design can break the mood for hardcore fans. That last was most probably to please a new generation and have all cars of American design, which is really lame.<br/><br/>That being said, it's difficult not to enjoy this flick, if only on a superficial level.

"swedzin","6","0","2","15 October 2012"," Transformers.... by Michael Bay...
","For starters... I am a ""Transformers G1"" fan and I love those good old 80s TV series. Because I think they were great! So expect a ranting that is kinda mix of Christian Bale and Lewis Black.<br/><br/>Now! Let's start with the people who came up with the retarded idea for this film and those guys are Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and John Rogers. They are the ""writers""... who ruined our childhood by their idea and thanks to Bay this idea was produced on big screen. The producers of this film said that they are a G1 fans and they wanted to make the same film. Well... they lied. The idea was to give us robots who don't talk at all... Have they even seen a G1 cartoon? Than Orci and Kurtzman come up with the idea that robots should talk, but they're will not be the focus of the film... And that's ladies and gentlemen... the Hollywood. They should rename it - No-idea-wood. So, take the original idea, turn it to a dump and hand it to Michael Bay.<br/><br/>Which leads us to Bay himself. This guy is unbelievable. Who just keep making expensive films that looks like giant commercials. His camera angles, plot holes... incredible! How come that this guy exist in the world of cinema? Explosions? Son of a... OK, we expect explosions in Transformers film, so... good for Bay. But, not good for us. Bay is really an expert to irritate audiences and ruin his own films. I guess what? He did ruined our childhoods. The G1 cartoons are cool even today. They were the best! Now, Bay's directing of the film... nothing but dumb plot holes, for one moment, it is a middle of the day, the next second - night. Who turned off the lights?! Shallow, irritating (human) characters, they seemed lost in the film. I mean, look at the actors, they looked so uninterested so... without emotions. I am not saying that most of them were bad actors, but they really looked kinda... ""Oh, we are here, we are payed"". I think that the only good thing is music score by Steve Jablonsky. And there are few more. We'll be back later on that...<br/><br/>Actors: Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky (the name Sam... was it that hard to give him a real name - 'Spike'! His name is Spike!). Shia is not bad actor, but he seemed pretty irritating on some occasions, he is more like to be a future comedian in sweet, romantic comedies, or action comedies. Megan Fox as Mikaela. Megan was there just to look hot and sexy, for that's all she is... hot and sexy. To attract moviegoers that find leading actress pretty. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson... nothing special in their performances. Rachel Taylor, well she is not bad as an actress, but... she was here for cuteness too. Anthony Anderson was here for comic relief, but no luck, he was loud and irritating. Jon Voight and John Tururro? Two greatest actors in the film, they did this for the money. When you see Turturro as a g-man, you know that it's not gonna be serious. His character was designed as another comic relief, but... no luck. Kevin Dunn as Ron Witwicky, he was good (but they didn't address him to his G1 nickname 'Sparkplug', and he is not an engineer...) Julie White as Judy Witwicky, she was awesome! (but alas... Spike didn't have a mother in G1). We also had Bernie Mac in some of his last film roles...<br/><br/>Now, the robots. As Bay stated ""he didn't want to make a stupid robot film"" and ""he didn't want for robots to look like some funny boxes from the cartoon"". If you don't want to make a stupid film about robots... don't do it at all! Let's start with the design of the robots. Well, I can't argue with that, the design is good, it's very rational in many ways, rather to look like ""boxes"", but if you ask me, you could put ""box robots"" in the film, but the movie crew who works on design, on concept idea, they were to lazy to even try and test how would it look. But, the robots didn't look that bad. The wrong thing about them is their character. In G1, the robots were important, they were the focus. But, here, robots comes second. The autobots are heroic and decepticons are evil and that's it. They don't talk much, they didn't really give some stronger personality, instead, they are retards. Bumblebee for example, he is mute and he could communicate through the sounds and radio and that's a sacrilege! Bumblebee is one of the most famous autobots, if not even more famous than Optimus himself. Megatron for example is just evil and that's it. He wasn't that long on screen, he came out of nowhere and that's it ""I'm evil and I am megatron!"". Optimus was OK, just like we expected, so Peter Cullen (the voice of Optimus who did the voice in G1 cartoon), he was Optimus again and he was good. Hugo Weaving voiced Megatron. Hugo is a brilliant actor, but he was given to little to make something out of it. Decepticons are speaking in cybertronian language... what a waste of time and idea. Keep talking in English! Why don't autobots talk in their own language? Because it makes decepticons more menacing. Face it, robots look good outside, but inside - retards. The only transformer that I like is Bonecrusher, he looked cool and he had a cool, evil personality, alas... he was there very short. And that's your film... ruined forever with this piece of crap. Bay also did a sequel, because no one touches his ""baby"", well maybe it's your baby, but it's not your original idea. I give it 6 out of 10 because it is entertaining."

","""Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more: it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."" This quote from Shakespeare's ""MacBeth"" best describes Michael Bay's loud and confusing reboot of the Transformers franchise.<br/><br/>The basic plot begins with the voice of Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) telling the audience the history of Cybertron and its fall, with the Allspark, the energy source that powered the planet somehow ending up on Earth. Megatron (voice of Hugo Weaving) tries to catch it but misses and lands in the Arctic Ocean, where he will be found in 1897 by Captain Witwicky.<br/><br/>The movie opens to Special Operations soldiers landing at an American airbase in Qatar. We meet Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel), Tech Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson) and a few others. We also see a Blackhawk helicopter. It refuses to answer hails from the air base, so is escorted to the base and allowed to land where it transforms into a Decepticon that destroys the base.<br/><br/>Cut to an awkward Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf), descendant of the aforementioned Captain Witwicky. He's likable but constantly picked on at school and laughed at. <br/><br/>I won't explain the whole movie but soon Sam has a secret protector in a yellow Trans-Am later revealed as Bumble Bee. He also had Megan Fox interested in him for some reason. Then, he meets Optimus Prime and the other Autobots, including Jazz (Darius McCrary of ""Family Matters"") and Ratchet (Robert Foxworth of ""Falcon Crest""). They explain that his great grandfather has the secret location of Allspark imprinted on his ancient spectacles.<br/><br/>From exciting auto chases to thrilling fights to the freeing of Megatron from beneath a secret base under Hoover Dam to a city-wrecking finale, director Michael Bay keeps the action going, which is what fans want.<br/><br/>That said, the movie is ultimately forgettable. LeBeouf gives a credible performance. John Turturro is his usual over-the-top self, but the rest of the cast is flat. Jon Voight looks completely lost. Kevin Dunn and Julie White as Sam's parents are embarrassingly clueless.<br/><br/>Then, there are the questionable and wasted roles of Maggie (Rachael Taylor) and Glen Whitman (Anthony Anderson). Bernie Mac's cameo as a used car salesman had more weight in two minutes of film reel than Taylor and Anderson in the entire movie.<br/><br/>And a special acting hell must be reserved for Megan Fox. She's hot but she's plastic. She delivers her lines as flat as a board. Listen when she tells LeBeouf ""No matter what happens, I'm glad I got into the car with you"" and, later to a wounded Bumble Bee, ""I'll drive, you shoot."" <br/><br/>Other problems? The CGI was excellent but Bay's shaky camera style gave me a headache. <br/><br/>The sound department did a fantastic job...during the non-action scenes. During the fighting, it was just deafening. And the music felt ripped off from other movies.<br/><br/>As for the Decepticons, what happened? It was next to impossible to tell them apart. They had absolutely no color. Starscream is an F-22 Raptor, yet we see Megatron transform into a jet as well, making people think he is Starscream. Brawl is a tank but his shells have less pop than the grenades the Army hits him with.<br/><br/>I mentioned plot holes and stupid scenes. Too many to name, but here are a few:<br/><br/>Autobot Jazz, as voiced by McCrary, sounds ghetto. <br/><br/>Bay eliminated the cartoon's best conflict, namely between Starscream and Megatron. Save for one last of admonishment, we don't see any conflict between the two Decepticons. We also don't see Soundwave, Megatron's true second-in-command or Laserbeak, both of whom would have been better than Barricade or Scorponok.<br/><br/>Lennox, Epps and the U.S. Army do a better job at stopping Decepticons than the Autobots. We have to believe that Lennox and company use 40-mm grenades to put down the likes of Brawl.<br/><br/>The finale has to be the most inane. The Decepticons attack S7, the secret base under Hoover Dam. To keep Megatron from getting the Allspark, Lennox sends Sam and Bumblebee, with the Autobots to the center of a major American city, knowing the destructive, human-hating Decepticons are in pursuit.<br/><br/>As you can expect, downtown is wrecked. Occupied cars and buses on the highway are destroyed. Bridges are knocked down. Scores of people are killed or injured. Thousands flee in panic. Air Force jets and helicopters are shot down to crash into skyscrapers or onto crowded streets.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, however, we see Sam's parents giving an interview where the reporter asks them about alleged alien invasions. They deny anything happened. Optimus Prime then narrates that the Autobots hide in plain sight, in secret.<br/><br/>So, no one in the city had a cell phone with a camera? Did all these innocent people die horrible deaths by invisible beings? It all gets covered up? <br/><br/>Bay assumes the audience is stupid and will buy it. Judging by ticket sales, he's probably right.<br/><br/>If so, then Shakespeare's quote of sound and fury most likely applies not to him, but to us."

","Transformers is a film that attempts being a cinematic epic through only the depth-less method of huge explosions on a large-scale for it's special effects to play out. And when a big blockbuster action film that is bound to spawn sequels like this one is introduced for the first time in it's inevitable series, it does always result in a brainless experience only intended to entertain the simplest visual pleasures for the simplest of minds. Particularly teenage boys who are all about crude humor and hot women contrasting with dazzling CGI. But the first installment commonly comes off as decent, passable, and tolerably okay because it hasn't gotten the chance to become old, predictable, and overused in its sequels yet. Transformers is a movie you need to take at face value, because there is nothing beyond the surface. It's decent because while it is obviously nothing good, it's still the simplest of entertainment with no thought required, where it's acceptable to turn off your brain just for some explosions and special effects. However, by being this kind of movie, Transformers does inevitably set itself up for terrible sequels in which this method is not a dumb pleasure anymore, but a boring, formulaic, and weaker than the first because of the same worn down movie."

","Okay, I'm going to flat out say that this is the worst live action adaptation of a popular 80s cartoon and toy franchise. Transformers was my favorite show from my childhood. (Even though they were reruns.) I collected the toys, (G1 and Beast Wars) and watched any adaptation from Beast Wars up to Armada and Energon. When i heard about this movie, my thought was OK better see it. I was dead wrong. After watching what i saw it officially killed my childhood. There were some good things about it, the special effects were cool, the voice cast was awesome especially hearing Peter Cullen's voice again. (I was happy bout that.) The downsides were a combination of the following: poor storyline, very bad cheesy acting and Megan Fox. What was her purpose of the movie? NONE. Sex appeal, OK but in this case, NO! Another downside is the fact that out of all the transformers, they leave out the 2 best ones: Hot Rod and Cliffjumper What would have made this movie better would be better story writing and character development."

I saw this before I watched the original show - I was 12 when I saw this movie. But although they aren't equals, this movie is really good! It should've won an academy award just because, to the adults, it brought back the 80s. Still, what made this movie not be a ripoff was that it had an entirely different plot than the show did (no Energon, all about the Allspark). It was directed in a well- executed manner. Acting was okay. Fight scenes were...intense. The plot was fine. So overall, why 7 stars? Because I didn't know squat about Transformers before I saw this. Now, I have a huge collection of the figures. It started a new obsession for me. That's how much I liked it. It's a good movie.

","(www.plasticpals.com) I'll be honest with you. I don't like Michael Bay's movies. Dumb science fiction sucks. From the disgustingly bad Armageddon to the brain-damaged The Island, there's only so much a man can take before writing off a director. So despite being a child of the '80s, having grown up on a steady diet of Transformers cartoons and toys, I didn't bother making the trip to the theater to see the live-action Transformers. I waited until it was out on DVD, and then waited another year and a half before finally finding the time to watch it. Did I mention I'm not a fan of Shia LaBoeuf? I'll be honest with you. This is probably Michael Bay's best movie to date. Granted, that's not saying much but at least I can see a noticeable improvement here. It's not a bad movie – in fact, it's pretty entertaining. It has its share of stupid moments, makes one too many pop-cultural references which will badly date it, and spends too much time focusing on the humans rather than the true stars of the show, but it gets by. Stomaching the first three-quarters to get to the action-packed finale (which ends in typically bad deus ex machina fashion) is probably worth it, since the battles between the beloved Autobots and their equally admired Decepticon adversaries look surprisingly great.<br/><br/>I don't imagine integrating giant robots into city streets is an easy thing to do, and Transformers does it quite well. I'm not a huge fan of the new robot designs, whose exoskeletal frames are broken up into about a thousand pieces when transformed, but I'm willing to grant that alien technology might look more like magic than human-comprehensible technology.<br/><br/>I will give it a recommendation but before watching it you may want to set your IQ to something like 75."

I'm no fan of Michael Bay and he truly influenced the future of movie making in the worst possible way. These 3 movies will stand out in history as the trilogy that embodies everything wrong with Hollywood movies.<br/><br/>Some people will say that's going too far, some people might say that they enjoyed these movies and were good entertainment. The truth is there is nothing wrong with explosions and action packed movies, but this movie marks the all time lowest point of originality and ingenuity.<br/><br/>In many ways this film has a worse effect then the sequels because its actually trying to come off as an inspirational and decent movie, which only puts emphasis on it's flaws. Revenge of the Fallen was a complete joke Dark of the Moon can't be taken with the least bit of seriousness.<br/><br/>I'll start by addressing how annoying everyone in this film is. There is not ONE character in this film that I would enjoy seeing in another movie. Shia LaBeouff turns his douche bag gauge on high and everyone from the sector seven agent to the parents were intolerable. I've never seen a film before where by the end I despised the sight of the cast like this. Why is everyone acting like an idiot? There is not one person with a shred of dignity and they all act like characters in a cartoon. Is that they aiming for? Make the movie as unrealistic as the cartoon? Why not put the autobots in a clown suit and have them perform parlour tricks?<br/><br/>One of the worst parts of this movie is how over dramatic the scenes are. It's almost like Michael Bay has becomes so deranged he actually imagines he's making a masterpiece. The scene where bumblebee is caught by the military is so over dramatized you think Bambi's mother is about to be killed. One of the most awful scenes happens when Meghan Fox's character harnesses bumblebee to the tow truck and then drives into an alley. There, she breaks down with a montage of the heros' struggles. The sheer absurdity of this scene was enough to make me burst out laughing. I suppose it's meant to symbolize their struggle and their courage to overcome it. The sheer stupidity of this scene is baffling to the point of comedy. They spend the whole time making some huge juggernaut explosion sequence and NOW after all that nonsense they intend to inject some sample of reality? It gives off the same appearance as someone crying about the failure of their life while wearing a Barney costume.<br/><br/>Terrible film, don't watch it unless you can look past everything but the action."

","Michael Bay brings the classic Hasbro toy collection ""Transformers"" to the big screen. The only plot this movie contains is just a bunch of walking and talking robots, battling and fighting, and the only necessary plot is action, duh! ""Transformers"" is a movie that is expressed in both positive and negative reactions. Negative thoughts - Michael Bay brought too much for this movie, turning him into a terrible director. The action was too much for me, the cinematography is too fast, the editing is annoying, and the script is stupid and unrealistic. Positive thoughts - Shia LaBeouf, although he acts like a jerk throughout, he still makes a pretty good performance. Megan Fox did alright in her performance in this movie, but she and LaBeouf don't really show a lot of chemistry between them. The sound is dazzling, the visual effects are astounding, some moments were funny, some members of the cast I liked, and the Optimus Prime character was powerful and enjoying. Now, I'm not saying that ""Transformers"" is either the greatest or the worst movie ever made. It's an alright movie with too much action and way less story, but it sometimes manages to thrill you, even though it's mostly annoying. Besides that, it's a movie that is perfect summer entertainment for your kids, and I thought it was pleasant, in a both enjoying and annoying way. ""Transformers"", in my review, ""sometimes annoying, but it's mildly enjoying""."

","This movie was a blast. Such memorable jokes, and plot that was relatively unique. At almost 30 years old, I was surprised that this movie would be as ENTERTAINING as it was, and considering that it's a Michael Bay film. No other director could've pulled this off. I recommend that parents watch it first and if you're satisfied with the movie THEN watch it with you children. The jokes a pretty mild, but over all it's still a fun movie. ENTERTAINING ALL AROUND. Amybody who disagrees is probably a fan of indie films and NOT really a fan of just plain, old fun flicks. The only part that kind of made the movie drag was that the Autobots save the day so late toward the end. There's only so many ways to say it, so I'll say it again; SUCH A FUN MOVIE!"

","There really is too much to say about this. I'll fit in what I can. Okay, lets go back 1 year. Superman Returns and Brian Singer lovingly recreates the spirit of the first two films in nearly every way possible. The result is a wonderful film that does more than pay homage to Richard Donner's originals.<br/><br/>Now in 2007 and Michael Bay has basically defecated on Tranformers legacy with this 're-interpretation'. Aside from an nice opening scene, the film is almost bereft of Autobots or Decepticons for the first 45 minutes. Instead we get some some teen-angst bullshit that we've already seen too many times before in countless teen rom-coms, there's no place for it here. There's no theme tune - you know the one! Instead we get some run-of-the-mill alt-rock from Linkin Park. I could go on, but wont.<br/><br/>On the upside there is some good action and when we aren't being subjected to the silly teen-comedy i.e. when the Transformers are actually part of the plot, it is an enjoyable film. Unfortunately its all a case of too little too late."

","When I first saw the trailer to this, I didn't know what to think but the premise was something new to me on the big screen so was sort of hyped for this movie. I don't know if it's because it's the first time I seen robots in great CGI beating the crap out of each other or something, but I had a entertaining time with this movie. The plot isn't anything amazing but it's passable and the build up was decent as well and the final battle in this flick was just awesome to watch. The human elements in this movie is pretty weak but it's bearable and it's alright to some degree. I didn't really like the clichés in this movie though. About the boy with the heart of gold that gets the hottest girl in school by doing something heroic. The humor in this is alright, not great but didn't bother me all that much although it felt a bit cheap. I know a lot of Transfomers fan will bash on this movie, but I will give my honest opinion. This movie was actually a quite entertaining movie, a good popcorn flick that the whole family will have a good time with. I kinda dislike it when people say ""it's the type of movie you will have to shut your brain off while watching in order to enjoy it"" that usually means the story is a complete mess. In this case though it didn't get to the point of me getting so annoyed with it that I just wanted to see action every minute. Megan Fox is going to be exposed a lot more after this and I will just say it's not because of her acting. As for Shia LaBeouf, he was alright. Maybe it's because this is his first time being in this franchise, but didn't get all that tired of his character or was very annoyed by him. Overall this is a pretty darn good popcorn flick that just might be worth your time. It would have been better if some of the human bullcrap that was just there for humor and parts that was pointless to the story besides the action was cut out since the movie seemed a bit longer than it should be. But that is just a few negatives in my opinion. I give this movie a 7.8 for being entertaining, it would have been better if the robots at least got some more development cause you really don't care who gets destroyed. This movie is a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>7.8/10"

","This movie was very interesting to watch. It prompts you that Air Force is a great career if you so choose to join it. The reason I mention this is because the human defense systems which were the army, navy and especially the air force helps the autobots to fight the decepticons. You realize that the power of technology made by the human race can also be used by the outside worlds and the cube as such. President Hoover had constructed a dam to hide Megatron and the cube which was classified above top secret and to come up with such an idea, shows us the idealistic thinking of a human mind. I am talking about the author of Transformers. 'Transformers' a comic book, and transformed into a high graphic movie shows us the vast scope of animation in the present world. So now we are talking about two careers. This movie can motivate to either join the armed forces or to become an animator which are so darn cool. Coming to the actors. Although Megan Fox looks stunning because of her artificial face, her acting doesn't seem to meet the movie's expectations. On the other hand, the other roles are just brilliant. Octupus Prime teaches you leadership and humility. I usually watch movies above 8 rating on IMDb but this movie was an exception because of the fact that its COOL."

","transformers an average summer popcorn flick. I must admit I have never seen the show or played with any of the toys so my review is strictly about the film based on its own merits without any comparisons to other Transformer merchandise.<br/><br/>The story is a very basic good guys vs. bad guts with the Autobots as the good guys and the Decepticons as the the bad guys. These guys had a war on their home planet over the control of a mystical cube the Allspark. Well the Allspark made it to Earth and Megatron of the Decepticons found it but he got encased in arctic ice. Well the protagonist Sam Witwicky(Shia LaBeouf) grandfather found the Megatron and on his glasses Megatron engraved the location of the Allspark. Well the Autobots come to earth to get the Allspark and protect Sam while Megatron and Decepticons try to get it.<br/><br/>The good points of the film are the action sequences which come fast and furious, the film editing and the sound effects. The technical aspects of the film are all first rate and it looks like a big budget summer action flick. The bad parts are week dialog between the characters, lack of character development, and I found many of the non principals so cartoonish like they came right out of a kids cartoon.<br/><br/>Grade C+"

","I loved this movie. I loved everything about it, from the smallest characters to the massive robots. One thing I admired the most is that this movie has a lot of heart. Visually captivating and engaging in every way, it's equivalent to embarking on a long summer vacation and having the absolute time of your life. It also contains a mesmerizing musical score that gives me chills when I hear it, for example: the scene where the Autobots crash land on earth.<br/><br/>I was never a fan of the toys/cartoons of the 80's. What happened was when this movie came out, a friend of mine at camp wanted to see it so I went with her one night when we were both off. It blew me away and right away became one of my favorite movies of all time. This also reminded me that you appreciate a movie more when it's released at a special time in your life.(I was at a summer camp interning) I'm glad I associate this movie with my camp memories from summer, 2007.<br/><br/>Now people say Michael Bay is all special effects/explosions and no substance. I COMPLETELY DISAGREE. He's one of the best directors we have today and he knows how to combine emotion and action and this is evidenced very well in Transformers.<br/><br/>Mr. Bay, if you're reading this....Keep up the great work and don't let all the negativity sway you from your visions and dreams."
"nintendofanof1993","7","0","4","13 February 2011"," Hyped up.
","This movie was a decent adaptation of the popular Transformers series. Now this movie certainly was strong in the effects department but the actors looked like they were struggling at times. Despite all this, they still had a strong plot overall, along with an all star cast. The movie starts off with a young Shia LeBeaouf as Sam, his goal at this point is to get an A in every class to get his first car and ultimately make it in society. Along with Megan Fox as his soon to be girlfriend. The story starts off somewhat slow, the car he buys from the dealership just happens to be Bumblebee, one of the Autobots. The story continues further as Sam eventually finds out the truth about his car and the Autobots vs Decepticons. The plot holds tight to the original series overall. The different Autobots are all forming to defeat the Decepticons and take down Megatron. I would have liked to see Hotshot instead of Bumblebee but thats my opinion. The creators really made a great interpretation and adaptation of Transformers. I had a few problems with this movie however. Number One would have to be the weight of these giant machines. Throughout the movie they seem to movie so gracefully, like their weightless. Sure one could argue that there rocket propulsion to make them seem weightless, but still it bothered me a bit which cost this movie a few points. The other problem I had was the size of the machines. In the series they were not at that large except for Optimus Prime and Megatron, their size held their significance. However in this movie they were quite large. But despite all of this it was still a decent action flick and I strongly recommend it for all the fans because its just Transformers at their best. Enormous, loud, and entertaining. If your not a fan I still recommend it. Its a great action flick that wont disappoint with its great special effects. So I give this a 70% because it appeals to the fans and pulls in some new ones as well."

","The plot of the film begins when Earth becomes battlefield in a war between Autbots and Decepticons – two races of alien robots capable to ""transform"", or, to mimic any part of ordinary machinery. While evil Decepticons want to conquer Earth and destroy humanity, Autobots led by Optimus Prime (voice by Peter Cullen) want to prevent them. In doing so, Autbots receive help from Sam Whitwicky (played by Shia LaBeouf), high school student whose ancestor accidentally found Megatron (voice by Hugo Weaving), leader of Decepticons, buried in Arctic ice. Young man is protected by Bumblebee, Autobot masked into car with whom Sam tried to impress his classroom crush Mikaela Barnes (played by Megan Fox).<br/><br/>Reason why TRANSFORMERS is better than average Michael Bay's film is simple. Film based on a toy line is not supposed to burden scriptwriters with important and serious issues like penal system, human cloning, American pacifism or crime and punishment. TRANSFORMERS therefore couldn't be taken seriously, so Bay didn't need to try and predictably fail in such endeavour. Instead of that this film is taken as nothing other than an excellent opportunity to display the current state of CGI technology in Hollywood together with other, crude but effective ways to bring undemanding moviegoers to theatres during summer season."

","I remember the very first time I saw this movie. The special effects were great, and it immediately began with a war/fight scene. The explosions, I thought, were very well done and believable. Again, I was only 13 when I first saw this. The complete mindlessness of this movie was appealing to me as a teen. ""Transformers"" is a name we all known, some more than other. I don't know much about the original toys or show or whatever it may be. Be that as it may, I felt a very modern twist on these classic figures. The sleek, updated cars really shone through as well as the recognizable cityscapes. All of the technological aspects in the films were a nice touch. I liked seeing Shia LaBeouf in this movie. I think the connection his character, Sam, had with his silent alien guardian, Bumblebee, was well played but could have been deeper. The temporary ""tension"" between Sam and Mikaela at the discovery of her juvie record was a little cheesy in my opinion. Some of the acting was a little forced. The first part of the movie seemed slightly inane. Megan Fox looked the part of her role well, but something seemed to be lacking from her performance. I don't know. John Turturro is always awesome to watch with that perfect, unique blend of sarcasm. ""'Never heard of it.' 'Never will.'"" Josh Duhamel played perfectly the fearless, committed solider as well the the natural leader, hence ""captain"". The scene of him on the motorcycle seemly painfully real and intense accompanied by perfect music. I struggled to find any symbolism in this movie. Perhaps that's because I just wasn't searching for it. This movie did not stir me up emotionally, it was the action that made this film as enjoyable as it was. Bumblebee's speech impediment (haha) was particularly funny and creative, so to have him regain his voice at the end was, again, a little cheesy: I didn't care for that decision. Optimus Prime's narration of the movie, and it being a ""message"" to those dwelling in deep space, was superb. That put forth the perfect introduction, background, and closure, while maintaining good potential for a sequel. Although long, I really liked this movie. I can think of no better way to develop a Transformers movie in these times. What I can say is that if you want a quiet, thought- provoking, well thought out film, you've come to the wrong place. If you just want to kick back and enjoy the action and the memorable, humorous lines, I'd recommend this movie for you. (Cheesy ending)"

I mean the effects are awesome, the robots are awesome, the mythology is just so engaging(it's no wonder this alone attracting Bay's attention), and the leading actor is very well done. But like the bad director he is, this movie has some flaws. The only big one that I have noticed was the story's continuity. I mean, some minor characters simply disappear from the storyline with no explanation about what happened to them in the end. I can name at least three supporting characters who we have no idea what happens to them if you pay attention.<br/><br/>But despite this and other flaws I'm sure people have noticed, the movie still holds together and provides us with great entertainment. Whatever else you think of films done by Michel Bay, Transformers definitely is worth your time, energy, and money. A box-office success that is worth contributing to."

","I got to see Transformers....not to be confused with Transformers: The Movie, the 1986 animated film that leaves a couple of continuity mistakes with this recent flick (as does the original show and comics). headed by Michael Bay as director and Steven Spielberg as exec. producer, this recent summer blockbuster is a modern day ""rebuilding"", if you will, of the 80's cartoon many of my generation loved as a child (and still do today, in some cases). some changes have been made to bring this concept in the real world, yet the general love for the Transformers remains intact. even if the intentions were higher than the result.<br/><br/>Transformers' storyline follows around a teenage boy (Shia LaBeouf) leading a normal teenage lifestyle while trying to woo the girl of his dreams (Megan Fox), or, more likely, his fantasies. his dad buys him a car from a used car dealer (a small cameo by Bernie Mac). the car he ends up getting turns out to be a giant robot, which engages in a battle with another robot. eventually, more robots land on Earth and meet up with the boy to find a pair of glasses that may hold the key to the planet's future. the leader, Optimus Prime (brought to life once again by Peter Cullen) explains that there are two races of robotic beings: the benevolent, heroic Autobots and the evil, destructive Decepticons. Prime explains that the source of all their power comes from a cube called the AllSpark, and that the Decepticons plan to use it to conquer everything. meanwhile, the Decepticons have already crept into disguise amongst the human world and are seeking to release their tyrannical leader, Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving, of V For Vendetta, The Matrix, and The Lord Of The Rings).<br/><br/>and so and so forth continues into some of the most eye-popping CGI action scenes we've seen to date. seriously, the special digital effects for Spider-Man 3, Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World's End, and Fantastic Four: Rise Of The Silver Surfer combined don't even hold a candle to the sheer amazing attention to detail put forth in Transformers. I still revel in the fact that we've brought cinematic technology into reality as far as we probably can since seeing this movie so many days ago. i'd always wondered what real-life version of my favorite cartoons would look like, but i'd never have believed that it was going to be like this. the characters are also as interesting to watch as the CGI that brings them to life. the Autobots (namely Optimus Prime and Ironhide) have some really great characterization, and the Decepticons (or rather, Megatron and StarScream) act just as one would imagine them. one by one, the action scenes blast you out of the seat. there's also some really good humor here, as well as some fine voice acting. and trust me, it could have been bad. don't complain about Frank Welker not doing a voice-over. what might be most appealing to some fans is the dialog that parallels the mood and memorable moments of the original cartoons and movie. overall, the best features about this film are the CGI wonders and the tiny details they put into the film. what's really excellent though, is the film's instrumental score. i'm not sure who wrote or composed it, but it's nigh perfect in compliance with the movie's atmosphere.<br/><br/>but, like every other movie, it has it's bad points. where Transformers really suffers is strangely enough in it's concept execution. now, i'm not saying that this wasn't a good movie. I think it's a great movie. it's just that this is a realistic version of a 1980's cartoon about cars and jets and other machines that turned into giant robots with laser pistols. it's not exactly the kind of flick you'd think was a surefire thing. because of this, everyone is going to go into this movie - hardcore fans, casual fans, newcomers, nostalgics, people who couldn't give a sh*t about anything Transformers-related before this movie - with something different in their minds. not necessarily expectations, but more of what they want this movie to be. in turn, this mind frame is going to cause of a lot of disappointment for a lot of people, in various ways. for me, Transformers was a little too ""open"". it leaves lots and lots of space for the already-in-production two sequels, but I don't think that that's such a good thing. sure, it means more robotic butt-kickery, but do we really need another good-movie-turned-franchise to wear down into the ground until there's nothing left? weren't Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, X-Men, and Jurassic Park enough? another bad point about Transformers is the human acting. sometimes it's very good, sometimes it's too cheesy for it's own good. sometimes we get some good characterization, sometimes we get a throwaway character with no substance or value to the film (i'm thinking directly of the pointless jab at George W. Bush and Jon Voight's all-commanding Secretary of Defense). overall, the acting is inconsistent. Shia's very good, and fun to watch, but Fox provides nothing more than a tantalizing body to drool over. there are some minor annoyances of mine, but I won't go into them since they'll probably be mine alone and don't really take away from the film. except for the fact that the movie ends with Shia making out with Megan on top of Bumblebee, who's pretty much his best friend by the end of the movie. way to let your pal in on the action, there, kid. cue Prime's excellent ending speech.<br/><br/>basically, Transformers is a fun ride, well-worth the admission price (or possibly even two or three) and by far one of the best films of the summer. a welcome change from all the lackluster disappointments of other summer blockbusters this year, and without a doubt one of Michael Bay's best."

","Its always hard to convert a previous media into a film and pull of something that can be defined as excellent. There is no doubt that Bay had intentions of doing this but all he has delivered is soulless piece of work with some good special effects. The Transformers story is one of simplicity and for that Bay and his screenwriters cannot be blamed, however they can be blamed for the awful dialogue given to the characters and the cliché images of each and every character in the film. They are all so one dimensional and predictable that there is no interest to be found in any of them. The movie is at its purist sense a dummed down 'hollywood-enised' expression of the Transformers brand. Its saving grace are its action scenes where meticulous effort has been put into the effects, but even these are far too monotonous that after about the fourth one you beginning to get rather tired of the whole concept of giant robot aliens battling one another. To those who like a shallow explosion filled action flick than this is for you, but for those who like depth to a movie then certainly avoid this one."

There's a lot of action, poorly written dialogue, and dazzling special effects. The acting is only on par with the direction. Michael Bay may know how to blow things up in amazing ways, but he lacks the ability to really get a reaction out of an actor.

I can name many sci-fi action films that have much better action scenes than Transformers but I'm not going to as I felt I should keep this review short and sweet as others have pointed out the many flaws in this film; some of which I will list here. Having just seen the second film a week ago, I'm just gonna say this one was much better than the second one, why? Well, I just feel that this one has a much better focus on the story,not that there's really is a story to begin with, but it just jived with me for some unknown reason. I don't know, but I just feel this one is much better. On that note, Transformers is not as bad as the second one but Revenge of the Fallen was the pits as far as I'm concerned. If you seen the first film and are eager to see the second, then go ahead but I rather see Transformers again (on DVD) then revisit ROTF.

The transformations are wonderful and cool...what kid wouldn't love them!! The battle between the robots are exciting...the thing action adventures should be made of...too bad none of the kids I know will get to see this movie before they turn 18."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","0","1","24 June 2009"," Incredible eye candy blockbuster that admirably tries to be more
","Let me be forthright: this is an 8/10 on the entertainment scale, coming from someone who as a child, rented the original animated series over and over again every time his parents took him to blockbuster. This is not an 8/10 quality movie, but it gets that rating because it might be the most visually entertaining movie made to date.<br/><br/>I remember nearly fainting when I saw the first teaser for ""Transformers."" That shock and awe factor certainly plays a huge role in enjoying this movie. If you thought Michael Bay made explosive movies before, try adding CGI to the mix. On the eye candy scale, we're talking the equivalent of Belgian chocolate here. Seeing the transformations happen and being teased a little more with them each time generates all the audience interest this film needs. Those who dislike Bay's over-explosive style will find more to critique here, but in all honesty, the man does a fine job giving us the entertainment we paid for.<br/><br/>More interestingly, the trick that writers Robert Orci (""Mission Impossible III"" and Bay's ""The Island"") and Alex Kurtzman have to pull of in this film is immense: take a film concept greenlit for entirely action and commercial-oriented purposes and legitimize it as much as possible with a plot. Even though it's obvious how hard they try, they deserve props for even making it somewhat feasible. For example, they try and swing it that the discovery of a frozen Megatron in the '30s is responsible for all our modern technology since because they studied how he worked. Hey, it's creative.<br/><br/>The background info, which is given to us outright, is that the Transformers home world of Cybertron was destroyed by Megatron, leader of the Decepticons (bad guys) and the only device capable of creating new Transformer life ended up on Earth -- which no Transformers knew about until the movie started. The Decepticons want the device to create a world for them to rule and the Autobots (good guys) and their leader Optimus Prime want to destroy it so no evil can be done with it. Earthlings, who happen to be caught in the middle, have to suck it up and deal. <br/><br/>Because no film would be any good with just machine characters, Orci and Kurtzman create Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf), your average teenager who gets sucked into the mess because as it happens, his great-grandfather discovered the frozen Megatron. He in turn sucks Mikaela (Megan Fox) into this mess because what fun is a guy running around getting hot and sweaty if he doesn't have an incredible gorgeous woman to get hot and sweaty with? Then there's a supporting cast that is so overkill it's ridiculous: soldiers, computer hackers/defense intelligence people, agents of a secret government branch, the list goes on. All that matters is they make the film barrel on like a flame-emblazoned blue mack truck.<br/><br/>Then there's the attempt at humor, which succeeds when it isn't forced there and comes naturally out of the fact that there are giant robots hanging out in suburbia. Maybe the film's best non-action scene is when the Autobots go to Sam's house to get his grandfather's glasses and they attempt to hide from his parents. Otherwise, the humor is poor because with a film this plot and action driven, it only awkwardly interrupts the flow.<br/><br/>The last mighty effort in the writing is to develop the thematic content. There's the idea of sacrifice and courage that come along with the hero's journey and are meant to please parents forced to take their children, but there's also the underdeveloped but interesting notion of weather humans are worth protecting as the Autobots do. That's rich with potential, but they don't sell us with it. But hey, we'll take the effort, because anything more than incredible visuals is icing on a movie like this."
"jangomac72","9","0","1","20 June 2009"," Fun from start to finish
","Big budget switch your brain off action flick, directed with usual over the top extravagance by Michael Bay.<br/><br/>Shia LeBeouf plays Sam, your typical nerdy film teenager who finds out his new car is a transforming robot and gets thrown into a war between the Autobots and the Decepticons, alien robots from another world. Megan Fox is gorgeous as the eye candy whilst John Turturro hams it up wildly as a government agent.<br/><br/>This could have been a train wreck of a movie but in the hands of Exec Producer Steven Spielberg, he ensures that it's a really fun movie. It has a very witty script from Robert Orci and Alex Kurtzman (writers of the new Star Trek movie), absolutely eye popping Special FX from ILM and lots of wham bam giant robot fighting action, directed by Bay using his usual flair for putting the money up on the screen.<br/><br/>If there's any fault with the film it's the usual criticism of today's summer blockbusters. It's 15/20 minutes too long and some of the action scenes are an edited mess but let's face it, a film based on a toy line should not be this enjoyable but it is Bring on the sequel 8.5/10"
"rollercode","8","0","1","19 June 2009"," Great Summer movie, too much anticipation for it
","Transformers had everything you could ask for in a summer blockbuster. It had high octane action scenes, very cool special effects. Great acting from shia. A very hot looking Megan Fox, and a nice bit of humor mixed in. This movie is not anywhere CLOSE to being as bad as a lot of people saying it is. I think the problem was the movie had too much anticipation and hype. People came in with very high expectations and were disappointed that it wasn't how they thought it should be. When it comes to summer movies, you can't leave your self with so much anticipation. You should go in with zero expectations and truly judge the movie on what you thought, not what someone else said. Overall, I give Transformers an 8 out of 10, because its a perfect 4th of July summer blockbuster, and I'll definitely be looking out for the second!"
"moviesleuth2","6","0","1","11 June 2009"," Dumb first half, fun second half
","While no one will mistake Michael Bay for making something intelligent or well-acted, they were at least watchable the whole way through. But Bay, the God of summer action movies' (Jerry Bruckheimer) favorite director, has made his weakest film yet. The first half of the movie is so dumb it's nearly unwatchable (maybe its because Bruckheimer isn't producing...). The dialogue is bad, the characters do stupid things, and stuff sometimes just doesn't make sense. Fortunately, however, the movie gets better around the 45 minute mark. It's not smarter, but it's actually entertaining. This is especially crazy since Steven Spielberg is an executive producer. Then again, he ""sold out"" a while ago, and is now more of a producer than a director.<br/><br/>The story is completely absurd, but hey, it's a sci-fi movie, so of course it's going to be. Anyway, there are two warring alien races who are machines, the Autobots (the good guys) and the Decepticons (the bad guys). They bring their battle to earth because there's an all-powerful box called the Allspark there, and it could either bring peace, or destroy humanity and give the Decepticons control of the universe.<br/><br/>The acting is okay, I guess, but no one is developed at all. Half the people are only memorable because we know their faces from other movies. Shia LeBeouf is immensely likable, so we care about seeing him through the movie. He's no different here than in any other movie he's been in, but he has an irresistible charm that does the job. Surprisingly, Megan Fox is not around just for good looks. She can act, and nearly steals every scene she's in. Jon Voight is awful, however. It's one of the worst performances he's ever given. Josh Duhamel is adequate, but not memorable. Jon Turturro is fun to watch as the of-the-wall secret agent. Tyrese Gibson is completely wasted in this movie.<br/><br/>I really hate the Shaky Cam technique. For those of you who don't know, it's where the camera moves around a lot during an action scene so you can't get a good look at what's going on. Used effectively, it can heighten the suspense. ""The Descent"" is a case in point. The technique heightened the claustrophobia because it heightened the sense of being trapped in the dark and fighting monsters the characters couldn't see. But in ""Transformers,"" there's no use for it. Michael Bay used it probably because it is the trend, and, taking a note from Jerry Bruckheimer, he's never one to pass up on something that has already made money before.<br/><br/>However, Bay is not a versatile director. He's good for filming action scenes, but not much else. He can't keep the material straight, and that's a problem because there are a lot of things going on simultaneously. With Bay's inadequate direction, characters come and go as the story demands it, and the rules that the film established are broken repeatedly and new ones are made. It's a mess.<br/><br/>However, I'd be lying if I said ""Transformers"" is a terrible movie. It's no masterpiece (it's not even especially good). But it's watchable.<br/><br/>Will I see the sequel? I guess, if I have nothing better to do. Because the film left me with that thought, I'll be generous with its rating."
"Amartier","7","0","1","7 June 2009"," Better Than I Expected
","I was invited to this movie by my friend, and I has no intention of going to Transformers, hating the cartoon. I decided to except his offer to be kind, and expected a totally stupid movie like the TV show. I was stunned. It felt as if Micheal Bay totally changed the storyline, with the All-Spark added instead of pointless battles for the galaxy. Not only did Micheal make the storyline more decent, he also made a lot of characters that were actually quite likable, or appreciable.<br/><br/>The storyline like I mentioned, was actually made so that the battles had purposes instead of random fighting. However, the movie would constantly remind the audience that the All-Spark was the main focus by having Decepticons constantly demand for the All-Spark for world domination. When there aren't any demands though, you completely forget what everyone's fighting for. This isn't a large problem though, you'll still find yourself enjoying the movie thoroughly.<br/><br/>The action was great and not shallow or stupid as I imagined. I was completely blown away by the special effects and sound effects. You would be able to see every piece of the cars transforming to take the shape of a giant robot. What's more impressive is that the giant robots collide and throw fists at each other. Not one part of the movie looks fake.<br/><br/>The acting was good for the most part with the flawless performance of Shia Labouef. Megan Fox however - was not the greatest actress you could ever find. Dialogue also could have been a little better. Otherwise, these things aren't usually noticeable.<br/><br/>Transformers was overall good, it wasn't spectacular, but it was enjoyable to watch. Therefore I give it a ""7"" with the great special effects giving it a score boost. The first Transformers now has gotten me hype for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen!"

","This is a complete guilty pleasure for me. No it isn't a great film & Megan Fox is nothing more than eye candy but damn she looks good, although kind of whorish, but that's OK w/me.

I have a Wide Screen 37 inch TV but man I bet my rating would be even higher if I had a 50 plus one. I am looking forward to the sequel as it looks even bigger and better & I'm sure when it hit's Blu-Ray it will be kick-butt! Even if you didn't like the film, this is a perfect film to watch on Blu-Ray that is for sure. Get this Used & watch the great sequences especially the end as it looks and sounds superior especially compared to the now defunct regular DVD. Skip some of the relatively dumb plot & watch the robots kick each others butts because it is very cool. Nothing but praise but I gave it 2 extras stars just because of the excellence of the Blu-Ray experience."

","I was going to watch this movie only cause i see it had potential,after see it,it was like eating pizza:leaving satisfied. Transformers is the way how a concept must be adapted,i mean,this isn't based in the cartoons,is based in the toys of the same name,and IT ISN'T FOR KIDS,they create a good story and it looks like Revenge of the Fallen will be DA BOMB! in theaters. The special effects are from 1st class,but in the battles between Autobosts and Decepticons i can't see who is who,but is enjoyable. Shia LeBouf as Sam do a good ""meanwhile"" in the movie and his attraction to the girl makes the funny moments in this serious movie. Megan Fox...wow,she let my eyes totally open. I only wish that there was more action scenes,but thinking that is only the first movie,that point is out.<br/><br/>The acting is good,and the black guy is funny,as the rest of the characters. The most impressive is the awesome way they create Optimus Prime and the rest of the transformers in the movie using FX from 1st class,they movie decently and they have the classic voice of a huge robot.<br/><br/>Way to go to Michael Bay!"

His camera shot's were perfect, his ability that made some important dialogue stand out was brilliant. <br/><br/>The amazing crew did a wonderful job. From directing to the creators. The special effects and visuals were mind blowing. You can't get better effects in a movie.

"sgone30","8","0","2","26 April 2009"," An entertaining movie
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I am not a comic book fan so I can't comment on whether the film kept true to the Transformers comics/cartoons. Although in some incarnation I seem to recall they were re-born from Hasbros/Marvel's GI Joe (but could be wrong) in the 1990s. The film is a typical Michael Bay full of action, some witty one-liners,yes some cringe-worthy parts, and his trademark 360 degree pans to emphasise the drama. I love the first hour of the film, in the way it builds up the threat from the Decepticons: including the attack on the USAF base in Qatar, Captain Lennox Team's/USAF's battle in the desert and the fight on 'Air Force One'. The special effects are superb, particularly I love the way that ILM captured Optimus Prime's own reflection on his armour. That is what I call attention to detail. The climatic scenes are sensational and are also ""Bayesque"" ie. a lot of action sequences all at once. My favourite parts of the movie are the scenes with the Witwicky family. Kevin Dunn and Julie White are very funny eg, the Porsche Garage scene, and Sam's ""Happy Time"". Anthony Anderson is also a very funny man. The film is very much glued together by Shia LaBeouf's performance who is very talented actor but does like to say ""No, No, No"" for some reason. I can only think he is related to Jim Trott from the Vicar of Dibley. All the cast put in good solid performances eg, Las Vegas's Josh Duhamel, the iconic Jon Voight, John Turturro, the Late Great Bernie Mac and an accomplished performance by Megan Fox. We even get to see Cloverfield's Odette Yustman with a bit part, for some reason being attacked by an SUV! (I know the All Spark thing did it). One comment on the climax, I must admit to be puzzled why the military would think it would be a good idea to hide the ""All Spark"" cube in the middle of a city, putting thousands of people in danger of being killed by giant alien robots,as opposed to finding a remote place eg, a desert, to bomb the heck out of the evil robots!?(The special effects wouldn't be that good I suppose?) That aside, the film is a good way to spend a couple of hours away from the Credit Crunch, the recession, etc and is very low maintenance on the mind. A very entertaining movie."
"smatysia","6","0","2","20 April 2009"," Neither as good nor as bad as folks on this site say
","OK, I understand that I am not exactly the target demographic for this film. (Over sixteen) But my take on it is that is it is neither as good as some people say it is, nor as bad as others say it is. I know nothing of the cartoons or toys that are supposed to be the base here, and thus cannot comment on ""being true to source material."" But some of the characters (such as Sam, Mikeala) were decent, some of the others (such as Turturro, Sam's parents, Bernie Mac) were utter caricatures. Megan Fox looked very good. IL & M did what they do with CGI. I'm sure it was visually impressive on the big screen. If you take this film for what it is, it is mildly entertaining even if you aren't a kid. If you expect the movie to be something it's not, you will be sorely disappointed."

"Gav14","9","0","2","14 April 2009"," Unbelievable movie. The Transformers felt real.
","THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS <br/><br/>First off, I would like to say that I did not watch the show and therefore I have nothing to base it against. I did however go into this movie with low expectations because it is more or less based off a toy....<br/><br/>First off, the plot was very engaging. It made it quite plausible that the Transformers would visit earth. The plot is simple, which is nice since the viewers came in for an action flick instead of some twisted movie that drowned in its own plot. The plot: The Autobots (good guys) are in a race against time with the Decepticons (Bad Guys) to find the all powerful AllSpark (a super powered cube). Two humans, Sam (main character... Shia Labeouf) and Mikeala (Megan Fox), are caught in the middle and help the Autobots. The fate of Earth is in their hands...<br/><br/>The music was good as well. It wasn't anything stunning like in Gladiator, but it was present and fitted in well.<br/><br/>The acting was good. Shia Labeouf did a good job as Sam, an awkward kid. At the beginning of the movie he is quite entertaining. Megan Fox did a good job as well. Many people say she was wooden (not great) but I believe she did a good job. Another great thing about her is she is HOT! The animation in this movie was unbelievable! Im not sure how it didn't win an Oscar.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was great! 9/10 for sure.<br/><br/>-Gavin"

"ajjets10-1","4","0","2","6 February 2009"," Pffft, Out of Touch (spoilers)
","Look I will give this movie a four cause of the special effects, and lebeoufs performance, but thats where it ends for me. Every 30 seconds, there was something that made me think, michael bay is a fraud and probably never watched Transformers in his life. For starters my favorite Transformer growing up was Bumblebee, known for transforming into a yellow VW bug. So you can imagine my excitement when they are at the car dealership, and I see that yellow bug sitting there, but this fraud of a transformer fan pulls arguably the biggest slap in the face to any Bumblebee, and IMO real transformer fan. Instead of using a yellow VW Bug, they decide to have it on the screen, and use a Yellow mustang sitting RIGHT NEXT TO IT?!?!?!. <br/><br/>OK so my mind is still open at this point, I can't base a movie off of one problem, that may have been more personal to me then others. Well the next major problem, is this movie is based around this pair of glasses and an item called the All Spark........ummmmmm seriously, what in gods name does that have to do with anything Transformers. Well I am still open, but then it turns from a bitter taste in my mouth, to the horrible feeling of needing to puke.<br/><br/>The whole movie, is revolving around this all-spark and a pair of glasses, yet 90% of the movie is about lebouf's character, hardly anything to do with the Transformers themselves which is what the movie is friggin named. There is no emotional attachment when jazz dies, Optimus Prime has a total of about 50 words in the movie, and all the while there is no sign of megaton.<br/><br/>But then they introduce Megatron, and now its time to get this movie going, 1 hour and 15 minutes late, but still its time for Megatron to handle business. I am expecting starscream to be by his side, Megatron to transform and if not him transform into the laser rifle, transform into a giant missile launcher, or some weapon to wreak havoc upon the autobots. Sadly no he is a JET, he is the form of which starscream takes throughout the entire series. Look I understand having Megatron being a giant gun doing nothing would be stupid, but thats the least they could have done for a fan of the cartoon since they decided to butcher everything else.<br/><br/>Then they take this dramatic approach that no matter what happens a human cannot die, and let Bumblebee get kidnapped and taken away(yes 25 humans are able to incapacitate, and ship off a Transformer robot to some secret facility, where they also had been hiding Megatron too), yet throughout the entire series, they were fighting and blowing up anything and everything. Now I know what you are thinking, if they did that it would defeat the purpose cause they never showed the people dying in the cartoon, thus they were defending human lives. Well no you are wrong, what defeats the purpose, is the end of the movie, when they decide hey, we could've helped our friend but instead did nothing. Where as later when the end of the movie comes and Megatron is free, its time to just barrel through traffic, forget about saving human lives, and each and everyone of them destroy and pillage the city, when its really only prime and megatron fighting. <br/><br/>Oh and the whole reason they are on earth, wasn't because of a war on cybertron that led to them crashing into earth. No the decepticons just beat the royal crap out of the autobots, and then go, continuing looking for the All-Spark. So the autobots decide they have to get to it first and magically get to earth hundreds of years after megatron finds it and is frozen on earth. Thats right, they don't all get there cause they crash on earth, the decepticons land there years before and failing to get it, and suddenly the autobots just magically show up.......seriously.<br/><br/>Michael Bay, you have destroyed, and then burned my childhood memories with a torch of smelly crap."

There are some comic moments, notably when the Autobots are hiding from Shia's family. The acting is alright though Jon Voight appears slightly embarrassed as the Defence Secretary.

","Finally broke down and gave this film a chance. Was a big Transformers fan when I was a kid, more of the toys than the cartoon. So I saw the commercial for the sequel and decided I would finally rent this one, I am often amazed at movies with giant budgets like this one. Ultimately they seem to have no sense of themselves. They are so far gone from reality, and not even close to enjoyable. I am not talking about about far-fetched concepts like transforming alien lifeforms that just so happen to look an awful lot like cars and planes of our world. You suspend that disbelief when you buy a ticket, or rent this movie. But so much unnecessary dialog, and situations. I feel like the premise for how this concept (transforming robots locked in mortal combat)was going to be handled was ill-conceived at best. Michael Bay. I won't go into it too much. I'd be here all day. I'll just say, his visuals are absolutely stunning, but there is NOTHING holding them together. Total, total hack. I wanted to watch an action film that I could just shut my brain off and enjoy. Unfortunately I just can't force myself to be stupid enough for this film. Now G.I. Joe may fall next.

","I watched Transformers just after it came out on DVD and was less than impressed but figured to give it another chance but ended up disliking it far more.<br/><br/>The main issue I have with the film is its attempts at humor. The most painful scene by far is when Sam is trying to keep his robotic friends hidden from his parents who are inside the house. I don't know about you but if I had evidence of giant transforming robots from space I'd readily reveal them to my parents. This silly and painfully awkward scene lasts far longer than it should and sets the pace for the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie, as I vaguely recall (I was in a fit of pain over how terrible the movie was and my memory isn't 100%) tells a simple story about the robots attempting to defeat Megatron and get some cube which, in a hilarious line of dialogue, gets put into Prime's chest by Sam...<br/><br/>As a kid I loved the Transformer's cartoons (especially the CGI Beast Wars) and was looking forward to the movie but the magic was gone...<br/><br/>The action scenes are dizzying and you can't tell what's going on, which I hear is typical of Michael Bay's directing style...<br/><br/>The positives: Shia is still an okay actor (some complain about him but I think he's pretty good) and Megan Fox is extremely attractive. The Special Effects, when they weren't making me dizzy were pretty good as well... But the movie is a mess and hardly deserves a sequel."

","When a magician repeats his repertoire through out their entire career, no matter how flashy it is, it gets old fast. Michael Bay is he cinema equivalent. Visually impressive? That's just a cover up to disguise his inability to engage a satisfactory story arc/line in any of his films. Ever notice whenever the dialogue (if there are any) runs dry there's always a spectacular explosion or two to distract the audience? The poor acting and the unbelievable sub-par script have been additionally littered with awkward not-at-all-funny comedic moments and the strangely frequent misplaced sexual connotations. The scene jumps from here to there without any coherence and the whole film structurally is one big mess. I kid you not, if you have the intelligence to look past the glitz and candy (applies to another Bay film for that matter), you'll find it's just one big nothing of a waste of a reel."

","I DVR'd this in high def and was really looking forward to a cool movie with good transformers in titanic battles against the bad transformers. It just seemed like I was watching another one of those movies like Independence Day where they just couldn't help but try to inject corny lines and ruin the movie by making it seem unrealistically staged and I just could never immerse myself into the plot. It was another formula ""teenage"" movie (and I hate to use that term because it has nothing to do with teenagers, but rather has to do with writers and producers and directors talking down to teenagers thinking this is what they want). <br/><br/>I hate it when Hollywood takes a multi-million dollar budget and a cool subject and then turns it into schmaltzy crap like this. Why not make it more ""realistically staged"" with a more serious tone the way people would really be acting like if Transformers really did start a huge battle on our planet? If I was a director of a movie like this, I would let the plot and story breathe in an atmosphere of serious realism. Be subtle with humor and effects. Don't just start blasting it at the audience with both barrels for the entire duration. Thanks for screwing up another potentially great movie Hollywood."

","In his 1982 book ""Danse Macabre"", Stephen King predicted that the future of bad films was not cheap and cheesy films like the works of Ed Wood and Phil Tucker, but glossy, expensive films of the same quality; films which amounted to the celluloid equivalent of ""a dead rat in a Lucite block"". While he has had as extensive and successful a career as a writer as anyone could imagine, surely he has never written anything else as insightful or accurate. Exhibit A: Transformers, one of the biggest hits of 2007. Here we have a movie with a plot that would have barely sufficed for an episode of the cartoon on which it was based. You remember, that cartoon that existed exclusively to sell toys. This film also ""treats"" us to humour that would disgrace a ""Police Academy"" sequel (trust me, I would know), incomprehensible action scenes, the ugliest character designs this side of The Garbage Pail Kids and the most sanitised combat scenes in a film since ""G.I. Joe: The Movie"" (though less enjoyably). Military enrolment isn't the only thing this movie wants to advertise either, and boy, it isn't subtle about it. The one redeeming feature of this fiasco is that it features perhaps the most impressive CGI work seen in a film to date. It is also well handled and cleverly incorporated into the film, instead of sticking out like a sore thumb as CGI often does. That is enough to earn the film a pass mark. Though not a recommendation. Much as you wouldn't want the dead rat in the pretty cage, there is no need to see this film just because it looks nice on the outside."
"davidguest","4","0","3","18 August 2008"," A poor effort for an idea with such potential
","To be honest I was disappointed with Transformers. I didn't have particularly high hopes about the film, due to the fact it had 'summer blockbuster, lots of shouting, explosions and cheap humour' written all over it. To this effect, it lived up to my expectations, it was a poor film. The opening scenes where a transformer predictably makes itself known at some random military base in Qatar is just downright confusing. Firstly, it changes from day to night in a matter of seconds. Second, there is a vague attempt at trying to get the audience to bond with a character but it is crammed into about 30 seconds. Third, the transformer tries to steal all of the American military's secrets and important documents. Hold on... WHY THE HELL WOULD THEY KEEP THAT INFORMATION ON A TEMPORARY BASE IN THE MIDDLE EAST???? The film is riddled with these sort of plot holes and general lazyness from the writers. Another negative point with Transformers is the editing. My God, it is confusing, disorientating and adds absolutely nothing to the film. In most of the 'action' scenes you are just left staring at rapidly changing shots of dust and mangled metal moving at high speeds. To me, although this film may be enjoyable to Hollywood blockheads, this film just lacks any thought or innovative thinking. It's lazy. On the plus side, the CGI is impressive and the film looks good, apart from the fact that lens filters were used far too much.<br/><br/>If you're into shouting, explosions and not a lot of story, this is for you."

","I loved the Transformers. Always haved. Big fan since they started way back in 1984. I was so looking forward to seeing the big budget live action movie, it filled me with high hopes that they would do justice to a cherished childhood love of mine. Then I found out who would be directing it....My hope scattered like cockroaches do when you turn on the lights. Micheal Bay is one of the worst directors in main stream Hollywood today. His movies are ALWAYS hopelessly overblown and overproduced exercises in irritation!! This movie is not only no exception, it reinforces that fact. This movie just dragged on and on and on till when we finally get to meeting the transformers, you just don't care anymore. The script was lame the story was plodding and as I have already stated the directing was disastrous. The worst part about Micheal Bays direction was the way the action scenes were shot. Because this is Micheal Bay, he feels a need to make every single bit of action fit into every single frame. The camera work was so all-over-the-place that I couldn't hardly focus on what was going on half the time. In summation, Bad Acting, bad writing, bad story, bad movie, and above all else...Atrocias, egregious, draconian, malicious, and every other negative term for bad in the English language, directing by Micheal ""I really know how to make a sucky movie"" Bay. SHAME, SHAME, SHAME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

","Bay should seriously try to make a movie one of these days where the story carries the film and the effects add to it, instead of relying so much on special effects. <br/><br/>I almost feel insulted when I watch a Bay film. He treats his audience like children, constantly trying to wow us with special effects. I will admit, the robots were really cool, but after seeing them for about fifteen minutes, I got used to them and they alone could no longer hold my attention.<br/><br/>There is also no reason why this film should be 143 minutes long or whatever it is. I imagine Bay watching the original 110 minute cut, like a witch tasting the slop in her bubbling couldron, and thinking to himself, hmm....it's missing something, I know, it needs more action, special effects, and CG!<br/><br/>I will also take this opportunity to harp on a long time beef I have with Bay's style. I can not stand his ridiculously quick cutting, and shaky/quick/crazy camera movements. My eyes literally hurt after watching this film. I also had problems following the majority of the action sequences because there was just too much crap happening and happening ridiculously quickly. He really over did it in my opinion.<br/><br/>*Note to Michael Bay* People aren't impressed by watching fast, shiny things with neat sound effects for over two hours, unless the film has some backbone, aka a story. I didn't find the story that bad in this film but the ridiculous amount of CG/special effects soured me to it.<br/><br/>This film just seemed to drag. It was one special effects laden battle after another and it just got old.<br/><br/>Oh, and the dialogue was pitiful/laughable. <br/><br/>Oh, and a lot of the robots looked confusingly the same."

","WHY would they insert sexual humor into a movie that should be marketed to kids (mostly boys, let's face it) around age 9 and up? WHY? Read the parental info elsewhere on this film if you haven't yet.<br/><br/>We skipped this when it was in the theaters, our son was 10, but this past summer - at age 11 - we rented it, thinking it might be OK. The sex humor was unnecessary, although it probably went over our son's head. The scene where the mom brings up masturbation was just... unbelievable. I was furious (and I'm no prude; it was just completely inappropriate). My son immediately asked what that meant. Suffice to say, it made for some uncomfortable moments.<br/><br/>But mostly I sat steaming wondering why filmmakers can't be creative without stooping to gutter humor ... the film ""The Italian Job"" was a great example of how to make an action-packed film for slightly older kids with out foul language or humor. ""Iron Man"" with Robert Downey Jr. also came *close* to being free of the stuff you really don't need to expose 11 or 12 year old kids to.<br/><br/>If they wanted a PG-13 film (and WHY should a movie about Transformers BE a PG-13 film in the first place?!), they could have cut some of the sexual stuff and it would have been fine.<br/><br/>But, to go further, they could have cleaned it up a bit more (and toned down some of the violence) and still had an action packed, PG film for those younger kids. Why didn't they do that? We see a summer packed with PG-13 films, which is a real shame. There are plenty of PG films out there that prove they can make money. <br/><br/>I wish Hollywood would show some respect for kids and parents alike, and work to create more smart and entertaining films - both in the PG13 and PG categories - that don't rely on crass humor for laughs. There ARE smart people in Hollywood, right?"

","Hmm where do i start...well this movie really wasn't all the bad everyone was expecting it to be, yet it had moments where it could have been better. The acting was OK, Shia did a decent job as Sam though i didn't see why they couldn't have had him called ""Spike"" once or twice here and there, to make reference of them 80's show and for someone to actually know thats him he's playing as. Cause i doubt highly many people, if not any, knew Spikes real name was Sam in the cartoon series...i don't think they ever mentioned that. But anyhow, it wasn't as big a deal. <br/><br/>Cullen rocked as Prime again, though you could sense in his voice that it was a lil deeper and edgier and not quite the 80s Cullen voice as prime but in general i think it was still a great job, despite some corny and unnecessary lines. What i really had fair beef with was the lack of characterization on the Decepticons. Thats what made them so loved and comical and very entertaining to see in the cartoon. But in this live action adaptation they were really not much different then the T-1000s from the Terminator movies....lifeless walking chaotic machines. There was no intrigue to them, you would've like to have seen At least some more dialog from StarScream who we all know was the most witty and had his very individual personality which set him apart from the rest of the Cons. But all there was was one line which he had with Megatron, that was a moment i relished in the movie and was waiting for more...but there wasn't. Speaking of Megatron, Hugo Weaving did excellent and was a great replacement for Peter Welker...i kinda understand why they decided to go with him and not Welker. My favorite parts where when he would use the same phrases as the 80's Megatron did...like Boy! and Pet! <br/><br/>I also loved the sequence when they first introduced the Autobots and you actually see them all transforming as the camera is shifting from Primes Feet to the other Bots. That part gave me goosebumps. The voices used for the Bots were good, Ratchet was my favorite you could believe the voice that it was him. Ironhide's was OK, still wished they had used someone like Sam Elliot. Jazz was good i didn't have much problem with his voice, all in all i was satisfied with the Autobots and their voices and characterization. The ending was surprisingly good, and made me already anxious for the sequel, which i hope when they're making it give a lil more attention to the Decepticons but either way, im sure will be a great movie w/e they do. <br/><br/>Since i gave the Animated movie a 8 out of 10 im gonna give this one a 7.

When you are watching it, you feel like you are watching a action movie. And it's really difficult to combine this two elements (funny conversation and exciting fighting scene) together well at a same movie. Anyhow, the funny conversation also shows the friendly relationship between the autobots and the humans. <br/><br/>Camera 10/10 As many people have agreed, the special effects are excellent here in Transformers. The entire film was pretty much showing the robots fighting, transforming and traveling, and not even one second people could tell the robots are computer generated. Especially when Optimus Prime picked up Sam Witwicky's grandfather's glasses, that smooth and careful movement was unbelievably good. <br/><br/>Storyline 6/10 I do agree that the story can be better developed. Maybe more about the transformers' history would be good. Just so that the audiences can understand the background better and then be able to get into the film more. Also agree that there are too many advertisements in this film, all the cars...you would know if you have seen it. <br/><br/>Entertainment 8/10 This film is entertaining, it makes people sitting on the edge of their chairs for most of the time. And with the funny quotes that people will talk and laugh about them again and again. It is totally a 2.5 hours relaxation. A great film to watch together with friends and family. <br/><br/>Acting 8/10 The acting of Shia LaBeouf was very good. He fully reflected a miserable teenage boy in every aspects.

The action - breathtaking, the robots are seamless in their movement and look beautiful as they do battle, as realistic as I could have ever dreamed and fit in the picture like a glove. The main characters, while their may have been too many with the army and the computers geniuses, were complimentary to the story, and the action seemed to do so well cause of the many characters, the army and Transformers, led by Optimus Prime, against the Decepticons, manned by the evil Megatron. The story, original in its depiction, is a great ""MacGuffin"" as Hitchcock coined it to the story, and was perfect for setting up great battles. Sam; Shia LaBeouf was amazing, plain and simple. Many action movies have to have a hero whose muscle mad or a member of MENSA.

There are great actors such as Shia La Beof and the sexy and beautiful Megan Fox and man is she frigging' hot she made me sweat so much when I look at her. The best things the action sequences when it starts from the beginning to the end! and the bad thing is that some actors such as bernie only had a few minutes in the movie so he could have made it more funnier for longer but hey what could you do. What ever you do don't miss this astonishing movie on any account. Finally if like hot acteresses, cool cars and breath taking action then you won't be disappointed by this magnificent master piece that is from one the masters of action Michael Bay.

The special effects are mind Blowing and most of all The soundtrack fits perfectly with this Sci Fi flick. Shia leabouf's acting is very good. But the most outstanding thing which I saw in this movie were the fight scenes between the auto-bots and the Decepticons. But they should have extended the fight scene between bumbelbee and the decepticon.<br/><br/>The action just hits in your face. I cant wait till Transformers 2 comes.

"cas51580","10","0","2","5 January 2008"," Transformers lives up to the hype!
","This movie came with a lot of hype and in my opinion lives up to and maybe even surpasses it. I was a regular viewer of the original G1 series Transformers. I wouldn't call myself a fanatic but I still loved the series. The only problem I have is with Michael Bay. He didn't use the original voice of Megatron because he didn't like it. I feel that was a mistake on his part. There are several other things he changed but with good results. Bumblebee was a VW Beetle in the original but he jazzes it up by making him a 2009 Camaro, Optimus Prime was a cab-over(short nose) semi rather than a long nose which I think has more presence, and Megatron was a Gun instead of the creature they cooked up for the movie which I think was a great move. I don't think a gun would have gone over very well. One of the other voice actors from G1 also got to reprieve his role, although I can't remember who. I personally wouldn't ever give this movie less than a 10. I just hope the second installment can live up to the first. If you have an HD-DVD player I would suggest getting that version as it has lots of extras that give more back story and further round out the movie. I just wish they had released it on Blu-Ray."
"sme_no_densetsu","7","0","2","5 January 2008"," Well-constructed but no more than meets the eye
","Since the original Star Wars took home loads of cash about thirty years ago there have been tons of directors trying of create the next great action blockbuster. ""Transformers"" is a noble effort in that tradition but ultimately falls a little short.<br/><br/>Say what you will but I think that Michael Bay is as talented a director as you will find in action movies today. Bay and the film's editors know what it takes to make a movie that rolls forward with locomotive force. The visual effects are impressive as well, though I can't recall anything that was particularly breathtaking.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good, which is no surprise since Bay's pictures usually attract talented actors looking for a big payday. Special mention should go to Shia LaBeouf, who is magnetic in the lead human role. Unfortunately, a sometimes goofy script means that talented individuals like John Turturro get saddled with some especially corny lines. Luckily, the script is, for the most part, at least superficially serious. However, it is undeniably aimed at a teen audience, so expect a boy-meets-girl subplot and photogenic teens in several of the key roles.<br/><br/>The main problem with the picture is that it is difficult to present a story that is in any way plausible without veering too far from the original concept. That being said, the movie moves at such a pace that you don't have time to consider any of the flaws in the 'scientific' explanations. Nevertheless, the screenwriters deserve credit for producing a story that is semi-plausible yet still true to the TV show that fans grew up with.<br/><br/>So, if you're looking for an enjoyable action flick then I can't imagine you being disappointed with this. However, when it's over you may realize that there is nothing beneath the shiny, metal surface."

I felt it could have had more action in it based around the transformers themselves. Aside from that, i think its an outstanding movie. Exceleent soundtrack and score, crystal clear sound effects and visuals, and a superb cast. This movie features action, adventure, comedy and romance. I could watch it again, and again, and again!

It has everything necessary in it to entertain you from beginning to end: good acting, special effects, excellent cinematography, good story, excellent music,... Michael Bay knows how to make a movie, that's for sure! Shia LeBoeuf is very well cast as the lead actor, and also Megan Fox is well chosen because she acts pretty good and she looks nice too! The transformers are really well done. That surprised me,because I thought the robots would just be stupid fighting machines, but here the Autobots have actual emotions and that I really liked. I loved the interaction between the robots and the humans. The things Optimus Prime said about the human race were nothing less than beautiful and was one of the best parts of the movie. The film was also pretty funny sometimes. Now some critics apparently hated this movie, but I don't care at all. Almost everyone whom I talked with about Transformers liked it. And that is what really counts. Transformers is an excellent combination of action, romance, humor, emotions and CGI-effects. With all these things I still add the excellent cinematography and music and simply excellent direction in general. I've seen all the films by Michael Bay now and I'm really looking forward to Transformers 2 and 2012: The War For Souls!<br/><br/>Go and watch Transformers! It's really good!"

"windypoplar","7","0","2","1 January 2008"," more than meets the eye
","Again a great movie I missed till it came to DVD. Sigh. Tranformers, re-imagined by director Michael Bay, is loud, funny and fast. Its a perfect popcorn movie and a real feast for the eyes. And no, I don't just mean Megan Fox. The effects in the movie are some of the best I've ever seen, truly good and utterly convincing. Of course the characters reactions aren't always so real, but hey its a summer movie.<br/><br/>For anyone unfamiliar with the toys from Hasbro or the ludicrously popular cartoon from the 80's, this is probably confusing. Hence Optimus Prime delivers the prologue himself. Very cool, even cooler its still Peter Cullen doing the voice. Kudos to the film's makers for that. I did miss Starscream and Megatron but I think those performers might be dead. Hugo Weaving did a nice job as Megatron.<br/><br/>Shia Lebouef, awful name but nice kid, does well as Sam, he really carries the film at times. Megan Fox is the love interest here and I take umbrage with any complaints about her acting, you try acting in a piece like this! She was smoking hot and very convincing to me. So there. To those who said there was no plot or development, did you actually watch this movie? C'mon, Mikhala is pretty shallow till she meets Sam and she proves her mettle by hanging with him in this crazy situation. Remember the line, ""get in the car""? She did, remember that.<br/><br/>Optimus looks great and the Bumblebee Camaro is awesome. I love the in-jokes, especially the one about ""Armageddon"" this movie had me laughing and cheering, just like a popcorn movie should! My only complaint was I thought the final battle was slightly off, not bad, just should have been bigger, less stupid extras and more demolition. Other than that it was great. Oh, one other complaint, other than the great old songs used by Bumblebee in the beginning of the film, lousy music score, oh well. Still a great flick."

","When I went to see Transformers I was expecting the worst.<br/><br/>Another film based on a cartoon series! And it was for the kids, so the Transformers have been all good, and the evil Decepticons were simply evil. And Michael Bay as a director, most of his movies are pretty bad to my mind (Armageddon, Pear Harbor, Bad Boys, The Island). Perfect ingredients for another cinema-disaster.<br/><br/>But I liked the Transformer-cartoons, so I had to watch.<br/><br/>What a surprise. The main theme is not really about the robots, but about a teenager and his (of course) problems with first love. This theme is told with a lot of humor and irony, making it bearable and in fact entertaining.<br/><br/>The robots add to the fun and deliver the action, otherwise no one would watch the film. Very good effects and a nicely dry tone of storytelling make this good fun too.<br/><br/>So it is not a great movie. But it is entertaining and worth the money.

"TransPM","7","0","3","30 December 2007"," Haven't seen a better Transformers movie yet, but not happy about the TF-side story.
","If you're a general fan of PG-13 sci-fi thrillers, this movie is very entertaining thanks to its visuals and non-stop action. Another positive side of this movie is the humor abundance.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the animated series (G1/G2) though, you'll notice some alterations compared to the original concepts. They might be awkward and unpleasant to the classic series fans like me. Here are some of the movie's details I couldn't agree with.<br/><br/>First, there is the all spark cube that gives life to technology. I'm OK with the life giving part, but to technology? Any kind? That's ridiculous. Next, the cube was lost in the universe, and it had to fall down EXACTLY on Earth, as if there could be no other planets out there in the whole universe. Megatron rushed to find it but crash landed in the polar region of Earth. (Ummm, no spacecraft for Megatron was available at that time? Hello, it's Cybertron technology; they're supposedly advanced.) And he froze in the ice, of course, like a human without a fur coat. Then an attack on the army is stricken by a military chopper shaped decepticon, who happens to be piloted by a holographic image of a man with a mustache. I think the same holo-pilot with a mustache sits in the police car decepticon later on. Why was such holographic imagery ultimately needed? Especially, with a mustache. For protection against humans? Autobots soon arrive on Earth, again just like Megatron, without an apparent spacecraft, but as if meteorites instead. Their method of acquiring an ""alternate shape mode"" is rather magical than scientifically possible by any complex and rationally explainable theory. By scanning a nearby vehicle, their new shape is instantly changed. It's weird, but in cartoons, Megatron had to manually reshape his sports car team in order to turn them into transformable robots. The same goes with Alpha Trion fixing Orion Pax and Ariel, and not waving some magical Harry Potter stick over them to heal them. But here, in the movie, it's done so effortlessly. I never thought that Megatron would accept to be nearly indistinguishable from his ""buddy"" Starscream, but he was decided to be another jet instead of his ultimate weapon shape. And finally, back to the all spark. Its ability to give life to any kind of technology is probably the most idiotic idea a writer could come up with for this movie. The cube first turned a mobile phone into a psychotic weeny bot with on-board micro weaponry, then later it accidentally sparked a phone booth into another transformer with a readily loaded arsenal. It might as well transform a microwave oven into a robot that pops corn, or worse - a toilet seat that shoots you know what."
"wolfbeast","8","0","4","30 December 2007"," Very much ""old school"" transformers
","This movie is obviously geared towards the ""old school"" transformer lovers. It is also a surprisingly mature movie.<br/><br/>Like many people I expected it to be a kid's movie, with lots of animated series alike flat humour and little story to it apart from the ""fight against the Decepticons"". Nothing was less true: the movie is surprisingly mature, has lots of humour in it that a kid would never understand. Lots of jabs towards current politics in the USA as well, some surprisingly daring in how blatant they are.<br/><br/>The characters: another surprise. Having seen many transformers episodes myself in the past, I didn't expect much depth to the robots' characters, but they are clearly individuals, and a good effort was made to make them more alive than just ""a sentient robot"". They are unique in their own way, and each individual was put down solidly in this movie.<br/><br/>The action: as expected, a lot of action. A lot of destruction, too.<br/><br/>The plot: More than a few plot holes or bad logic there, some so obvious that I was surprised it passed in the script and got executed in the movie. It's probably the only big downside to this movie.<br/><br/>In general: A nice movie if you don't mind the story of the transformers being taken in its own direction, and can forgive the holes in logic and story, and certainly if you like the old school transformers.<br/><br/>Recommended to see at least once and decide for yourself."

"JmfDiver","9","0","3","20 December 2007"," Transformers fan or not...this movie is astounding.
","I've always been somewhat of a fan of Transformers, manly Beast Wars and Beast Machines. G1 was a few years too old for my age group. (However, at around age 12 I began watching G1 episodes online) Anyway, I had been pretty excited for this movie from the get-go. It began when I saw the teaser trailer. Months later, I walked into the theater praying that this wouldn't be a 3.5 hour CGI induced headache. It wasn't. It actually had a very good plot line, excellent foreshadowing, AMAZING visuals, and pretty good acting. First: the plot line. When I first heard that there was going to be a Transformers movie, I thought, how would they do that? Well, they did it. The very first shot after the opening titles pulls you in to the main tone of the movie. I've explained that to the best of my abilities. Second: Foreshadowing. They pulled this off with impressive set design and fantastic locations that really gave the fantastic illusion to the audience that we are really facing an alien invasion with BA giant alien robots. Third: the visuals. Every shot had it's own art form. From the MH-53 Helicopter flying away from the Qatari sunset, from Megatron's gigantic Cryo-Prison. Along with that, they made the Transformations look real. You could see where every single part of the car was going whenever it turned into a robot. Fourth and Finally: the acting. When I saw this movie, I took note of the lines. I'm a stage actor, so I like to picture what the lines look like on paper. On paper, they look pretty dry. It takes a really good actor to take dry lines and make them serious, comical, and emotionally engaging. That's exactly what they did, especially on Shia LeBeouf's part. What he did with that script was just fantastic. <br/><br/>Overall, you really don't need to be a Transformers fan to thoroughly enjoy this film. Although Transformers fans get more of a kick out of it by seeing they're favorite Autobots and Decepticons on the silver screen, (I got goosebumps every time I saw Starscream and Ratchet) it's still an extremely fun thrill ride for everyone else."

","...I enjoyed this. The plot takes a few leaps in logic, but this is as to be expected for a movie about giant robots who transform into cars and assorted vehicles. Actually until the transformers speak it's a semi- realistic sci-fi film, after which it's just the Transformers cartoon, ""we are good they are evil, let's fight!"", which they do a lot of, which pleased me. It's basically a boys with toy's story, except the car to win the dream girl is sentient and out to save the earth. The films big draw is that giant robots trash each other in a crowded metropolitan area, and that was present. If this kind of thing doesn't interest you, your probably not gonna like this. Occasionally it was difficult for me to establish who was fighting who, until I realized this didn't matter, and was able to enjoy in my childish(infantile) fantasy comes to life before me. The original Animated film is actually a much more unique and stylized experience, but this was good too, by good I mean ""special effects/action scenarios"", nothing else worth mentioning.

","Went into this film with negative expectations, and left with the satisfying feeling of having watched something worthwhile and refreshing in the current political and social climate. For me the clinch point of the movie was its reliance on the comic-book genre, with specific set-piece 'storyboard' - style images accompanied with very few words - just like a comic.<br/><br/>Because the story and the whole experience is centred on alien creatures, the performances of the human actors had to be subordinate to the supreme beings from outer space, and the director delivered this big-time.<br/><br/>A greatly satisfying part of this movie was that it wasn't an all-American 'flag waving' exercise. Sure the robots were engaged in a battle obviously taking place in some US city, and the human heroes were clearly American, but it carefully avoided the normal cop-out involving multiple shots of the Stars and Stripes going into battle to vanquish yet another evil empire. In fact, in this film, it is the invaders themselves who, with the help of the humans, manage to provide the viewer with a very real sense of wonderment and appreciation of the movie for what it is - first-rate, engaging and surreal fantasy."

Any adult with attention deficit disorder should also like it, it may very well be the first film that is a distraction to itself. Mind-boggling computer animation built around a two and a half hour commercial for General Motors products might work better in the typical thirty second format.

","It is now the year 2007 and the time-line of the infamous robot wars from deep space that started back in the nineteen eighties and throughout the last thirty years has transmogrified into what we see hear today. Michael Bay's translation of this highly regarded cult is a more than modest attempt to not just widen the appeal of this sci-fi phenomenon but to use the technology of modern film-making to its full potential. While potentially seeming to be a teen movie, with its young cast of heroes set against over bearing, but kind and loving, parents, the generation gap never seems so agonisingly embarrassing, but comical, to our young hero here and the authoritative figures that wouldn't look out of place in the next Men in Black movie, Transformers is a wonderful action and adventure sci-fi that can, and should, appeal across the broad.<br/><br/>With the Autobots, the good guys, and the Decepticons both gunning for the same prize; Sam Witwicky, the unwitting teen who holds the one article that can save or destroy the planet, it now depends on which clan of robot will reach him first.<br/><br/>With its origins forming in nineteen seventies Japanese culture, these tiny toys were taken overseas by the American toy company Hasbro (My Little Pony, Monopoly, Twister) near the mid nineteen eighties. After this jump from the Rising Sun to the land of prosperity it was now time for these tiny 'bots to make a big impression on the minds of a new and willing culture: The Transformers had arrived.<br/><br/>This is pure Hollywood, pure Stars and Stripes, and being slightly a little formalistic in its delivery, with seemingly one dimensional and stereotypical caricatures, it isn't that bad a job in its more physical attributes. Whilst not altogether weak characters, some deeper development might have given this movie more scope, but, this isn't what Transformers is about, with its ethos of all action, all razzmatazz in its main concept of world domination by metallic ET's, this was never going to be a deep social comment on the subject of war and peace.<br/><br/>Divided into two acts, the first being the introduction of our characters and 'bots, with, at times, an amusing and witty dialogue, exciting action that captivates this theme well, not too slow and not too rushed; intriguing and more than capable both in the visual and physical aspects of this genre, there really is a fine blend to keep the ball rolling in the right direction, to prep us readily for the second act.<br/><br/>With Michael Bay utilising his skill of vision, direction and imagination it isn't long before the second act kicks in, when all are sitting comfortably in their respective roles it is now time for the action to kick in proper. It is the second act that we see these motorised warriors in their prime, it is the visual believability that holds its own, and the action and pace never lets up for a moment, this fighting of the metal giants is stupendous, fighting among the city streets and skies, if this had been ""scratch and sniff"" then we would more than quiver in our seats; This is where modern movie making takes a bow and it is the work of Academy Award winner (Cocoon (1985)) Scott Farrar, Visual Effects Supervisor, and his achievement at winning the 2007 Hollywood Film Festival ""Visual Effects Supervisor of the Year"" Award. His work on Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) and Jurassic Park (1993) et al show wonderment at his ability to make us believe that these robots are not mere fantasy but are actually among us, working larger than life size models of their tiny counterparts that seems now so far away from the early days of nineteen seventies Japan."

","Wow! First off the special effects are f--king awesome! No contest, 'Transformers' has the best visual effects of the year thus far. But as a movie...it's all right. I mean it's entertaining as hell, but the acting/writing are kind of lacking. Shia LeBeouf is fantastic as always. Veterans Jon Voight, John Turturro and the always amusing Anthony Andersen are good, but the rust of the cast is disappointing. Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel give commercial-calibre performances and the lead female besides having a knock-out physical appearance is jaw-dropping awful. The writing is seriously lacking as well. They should take more time to explain what the hell these machines are and what they want, besides rushing the plot so much. All in all, 'Transformers' is your typical Michael Bay movie -- BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! CHEESY PLOT! LACKLUSTER ACTING! BAM! BAM! BAM! But hey, if you want to see some awesome special effects, 'Transformers' is without a doubt the movie for you. Grade: B-"
"antrixinf","7","0","1","16 November 2007"," Good action, transformations need to look more practical.
","Well, definitely not ""aweful"" as few have added before. The problem's that the comic relief actually disrupts the harmony of all the serious ""human"" message that the movie has to offer. But we must also consider the movie was rated 12 in most of the countries, so obviously it was made keeping young viewers in mind.<br/><br/>Autobots exhibiting ""human"" emotions like anger and the fact that ""pride"", ""status"", ""authority"" have a similar meaning to them as us, gives them a human edge and an opportunity to interact and assimilate with mankind.<br/><br/>Their transformation could've been made better. For example a 10 wheeled truck is not an apt tactical state for a battle.<br/><br/>Good captivating action, but a little seriousness could have been added."
"emasterslake","Null","0","3","14 November 2007"," Great live action film for all time and new comer fans alike.
","I remember Transformers being a big series back in the 90s. I wasn't a huge fan of it, but I remember the cartoon being a cool franchise which still is today.<br/><br/>I first heard of this movie as far back as 2005. And found it to be cool for a new live action movie being made for the first time ever for the Transformers series. Even though I was entirely familiar with the series background, I read some history and story lines on the internet before seeing the big picture.<br/><br/>Eons ago on the planet Cybertron, lived a population of different life forms. Machines that have advanced into intelligent beings and formed a community on the hi-tech planet. Two sides were made: Autobots & Decepticons. The Autobots want peace and prosperity. While the Decepticons want communism and terror. Despite both sides thinking differently, they start their own war. One day a cube which is said to be the source of all their power went crashing on Earth. And it won't be found until a certain ""Day of Awakening"" occurs when either sides try to get their hands on the cube first.<br/><br/>And it was cool, every thing to make this movie a reality was more than amazing. With today's special effects, creating the robots in a live action film is accomplish-able and would of been impossible to do a decade ago. Every big franchise gets a movie like this one. And it was about time Transformers gets revised with a blockbuster hit.<br/><br/>There wasn't anything disappointing or boring about the movie in my opinion. Just a lot of the screen time is spent by the secondary characters than the robots themselves. A few changes made for the movie for obvious reasons. Including making both the Autobots and Decepticons look more machine like than their cartoon appearances. And there's so much detail when you look at them in the movie. I'm not an expert in cars, but I do find the transforming sequences to be believable.<br/><br/>Overrall this movie should please both the old time and new comer fans of the series. And it's going to get it's own sequel which is being predicted to be bigger than this one itself."
"jonnycrush","6","0","1","12 November 2007"," Hard on the eyes and ears at times, yet still bearable.
","Don't get me wrong, I thought this movie was entertaining. At times. But there are a lot of things wrong with it that you'll notice instantly if you stop paying attention to the explosions for two seconds. First of all, it takes place almost entirely at 5pm, with the few exceptions of a couple night scenes. The sun is always low on the horizon, beaming in light at impossibly dramatic angles. This rule goes double for the end fight. Don't forget about the well-placed slow-motion ""hero shots"". I can't tell you how many times I thought I was watching Armmageddon and that's not a good thing. Some of the ""hero shots"" are almost identical to this movie's. And having multiple slow-mo shots of your heros getting off of planes or helicopters gets old fast. The thing that really made this movie painful, however, was the script. I could handle the cheesy dialouge between the robots, but when the same crap starts shooting back and forth between the humans, there's a problem. Listen to what the people say in this movie and tell me that it even comes close to how people talk. I dare you. <br/><br/>Still, despite all that, and many other things to be assured, I still had a good time watching this. For a summer blockbuster, its works just fine and the CGI action, while a bit over the top, is still top-notched and fun to watch. It may not be brilliant film making, but it does its job well."
"conmech","8","0","2","9 November 2007"," Good movie, but definitely less than I expected...
","I waited for months for this movie to come out and I expected A lot from it. And it wasn't my fault doing so, before it came out two of my favorite directors, Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay said: ""This movie is going to blow you away"". I mean, they're Michael Bay and Spielberg. Also the trailer was amazing, giving the feeling the movie is going to be a cool, action packed, serious movie, and not like an episode from the cartoon. And it DID start as an awesome movie; a helicopter that was supposed to be a wreck comes out of nowhere, transforms and attacks with incredible visual effects. The next robot scene with the scorpion robot was also awesome, and until that moment I was so glad that I finally have another movie which I can buy and watch over and over again. But when the robots started to talk, things started going down. They lost all their coolness thanks to stupid conversations, the visual effects got somewhat worse and there came a moment where the camera just started moving around too fast to hide the flaws in the visual effects. And worst of all, Michael Bay HAD TO put his classic cheap humour from ""Bad Boys II"" or ""Pearl Harbour"" to this movie as well. I'm sorry but, most things robots do or the guy says is not funny, they're just boring parts to make the movie look longer. And HOW did Bumblebee start talking again? I thought it was only in ancient Turkish movies where people recover from major handicaps by getting hit by a car, blind people start seeing, deaf people start hearing. There's also a part which I looked up in the Goofs section but couldn't find it. When the robots were asked how they learned English they say ""from the internet"". But they had to come down all the way near a car store and look at the vehicles to analyse in order to disguise like them. Why didn't they just check the internet for incredible amount of information about any type of vehicle? I never like looking for mistakes in a movie and I try to enjoy as much as I can but, this is just humiliating the audience. Definitely less than what I expect from Michael Bay. Nevertheless I'm giving it an 8 out of 10 cause the good scenes are REALLY good, and they manage to make the movie a ""must-see""."
"TxMike","Null","0","5","5 November 2007"," Transformers take on the universe, with Shia LaBouf helping out.
","First I want to state one thing I like a lot about how this movie treats the subject. At times there are explosions, planes shot down, guns shooting, so you know that people die. But it never is glorified, you don't actually see anyone depicted as getting killed, which is a welcome change from so many movies that give you slow motion, close-up shots of people getting killed.<br/><br/>Second, I don't know anything about the ""transformer"" toys or the transformer comics if there is such a thing. So I was only able to appreciate this movie on the 2 hours I spent with the subject.<br/><br/>I think it is a cool movie. We have bad alien Transformers, and we have good alien Transformers. The goodness of the Universe is at stake, but the movie never takes its message too seriously. There are lots of laughs.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf is a natural, as Sam Witwicky. Somehow his old grandfather made a discovery and somehow a code got etched on his old spectacles that Sam is trying to sell on Ebay. So the good and the bad Transformers compete to see who will get the code.<br/><br/>Very cute Megan Fox, looking like a young Jennifer Connelly, is Mikaela Banes, a hot chick who never notices knerds like Sam, until they are forced into a situation together. Jon Voight is Defense Secretary John Keller. John Turturro provides lots of comic relief as Agent Simmons.<br/><br/>Overall an enjoyable movie, with almost non-stop action the final 45 minutes. See it, to find out if the Universe will be saved."

","Steven Spielberg and Michael Bay team up to bring the popular cartoon and toy series to a live action film. Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf) is your typical teen: trying to get the money to get the car and the girl. His father agrees to help him out with the car and after grabbing a slightly beat up Camero, Sam's well on his way. After several weird incidents it becomes apparent there more to the car than meets the eye. It turns out that Sam has an intricate piece for a puzzle that brings a group of Autobots (robotic shape-shifting beings) to Earth. Lead by Optimus Prime, the Autobots must find the all-spark cube to restore life to their destroyed home of Cybertron. But the evil Decepticons led by Megatron want it for themselves and will destroy any city to get it.<br/><br/>Pure popcorn fodder 'Transformers' could be nit-picked until the cash cows come home. This one has it all: silly script, annoying comedy relief, over blown CGI. You name it and it's here. But that's beside the point isn't it? What you want is robot-on-robot action tearing up the landscape. You do get a generous helping of it here with Bay's usual over-the-top MTV styling. The story does lag at times and only really works when the 'Tranformers' are on screen but again that's typical. The end result is a film that works perfectly for the little boy that lives inside many of us and that's about all you can hope for."
"darrenbjones","9","0","1","3 November 2007"," Definitely more than meets the eye.
","I wasn't overly hopeful for this movie. I was wrong, Transformers was the summer event movie we had all been waiting for. Stunning effects, awesome action sequences and more laughs than I was expecting. Transformers really exceeded my expectations. Now there were problems, the Transformers were flat characters and the Decepticons were not developed beyond snarling villains. Also if you are going to kill one of the iconic autobots you need to give the audience some investment in the character so they care. But these are really quite minor complaints and there was so much more to be happy about in this film which eclipsed these problems and with three Decepticons left running around there is more than enough potential for a sequel. This wasn't my Generations Transformers but I'm good with that."

Sure you all know this part <br/><br/>""Transformers More than meets the eye Transformers Robots in Disguise""<br/><br/>But there is an actually an entire song by a group called Lion.

","When I first saw the Transformers trailer I thought it looked pretty good....until the title read ""Transformers."" I never really watched the shows, but one time I happen to come across an episode of one on Youtube and I watched it and disliked it horribly. <br/><br/>Then around July me and my best friend (Along with her boyfriend, her boyfriends brother, and a friend of theirs) decided to go to the Mall to watch a movie. I was oblivious to which movie we were going to see until we bought the tickets. When my best friends' boyfriend said ""Transformers"" I was thinking ""Man, I don't want to see this stupid movie...but whatever."" so I went and watched it...and guess what?<br/><br/>I LOVED IT!!<br/><br/>On the way home every time we would see a car or an airplane we kept shouting ""Transformers!"" <br/><br/>I know a lot of people dislike the movie because there are so many different things between it and the show (Since I watched the movie I watched a couple of more of the shows, but I still don't like them) Here are some reasons why I like the movie better then the show.<br/><br/>1. The animation was really bad. I know it was made in like the 80s. The movie robots look so much more real. 2. The transformations didn't make sense. How could Prime turn in such a huge truck when he wasn't nearly large enough to transform into that? And how could Megaton turn into a small gun? At least during the movie they used cars and things that we're the robots size as well showing where each part was located. 3. Didn't like Megatron. He actually looked kind of like Dark Vader...except he's white. The Megatron in the movie looked a lot better and I like the idea of him transforming really was just an alien type of jet instead of an actually vehicle. <br/><br/>I think Michael Bay did a WONDERFUL job and I really hope he decides to go along and make the Transformers 2 <br/><br/>The movie also gave the robots feelings and thoughts as if they were humans just like you and me. When I was watching the movie in the theaters I almost cried when I saw Bumblebee being attacked by the S-Seven guys. I also love the transformations they did...it looked so real..as if they weren't really CGI at all and they were really 'actors'<br/><br/>I loved the actions scenes they were one of my favorite parts. One of the best action movies I have seen in a very very long time (maybe the best one so far!)<br/><br/>I loved the ending between the battle of the Autobots and the Decepticons.<br/><br/>There were some humor in the movie at just the right moments. I love the part how Bumblebee stops the car in the middle of the road and drives off and Sam says that he was a sensitive car and Bumblee comes back much much better looking <br/><br/>Right when it came out on DVD I knew I had to buy it. I've had it for almost a week now watched it like 5 times and watched all the features and the commentaries about it. (As well looking up info on the movie)So I know why Michael Bay decided to change some things about the movie, and I agree 100%<br/><br/>Here are some things that were semi-bad about the movie. 1. I think the Decepticons should have done some more damage. 2. It very little looked easy for the humans to defeat Blackout..however Prime easily defeated Bonecrusher and the humans took a LONG time before they defeated that scorpion and the Tank. 3. I wish Sam had a bit more feelings toward Bumblebee (I mean after all Bumblebee risked his life to save him.) I know he cared...but I don't think he cared as much as I think he should have.<br/><br/>Overall I think this is one of the best movies ever. It will always be one of my favorites. Thanks Michael Bay for creating such a wonderful film!!!"
"jenn-lupo","10","0","2","29 October 2007"," EXCELLENT... New favorite movie to millions.
","First all, I will admit now that I am a sucker for movies with fast cars, loud music , and sci-fi action so I guess that's why I loved this movie so much. It's got ALL of my choices. So I also have to admit that if the whole movie was just car chases, Autobot fights and loud music I would probably be happy! *grins* ""My favorite sound in the world is the roar of a V8 engine..."" Paul Newman<br/><br/>It I would have to say that they are the best CGI that I have seen to date... and that's saying something coming from me. I felt that the background sounds were perfect for the film. And as some have said that the score was very definite in it's purpose without making the audience aware what Bay was actually doing. Which as we all know some Directors just can't do this day and time. <br/><br/>Shia LeBeouf, what else can I say. He has come a long way from the Disney channel and I am so proud. I mean it's a great place to start but even on ""Even Stevens"" you could tell they (being Disney) were not using him to his full potential. SO I'm so happy it turned so good for him. <br/><br/>Okay I personally liked Megan Fox's performance on the movie... although I admit that there wasn't much to her, meaning her person and her lines in the movie... maybe 30 lines in all. But I can say that I DO NOT feel that Fox's performance was shallow. I believe that someone might need to look a little deeper to see that she did the best she could with her lines... But I have to give my props to writers for giving a woman a role in a movie in which she can stand up for what she believe in instead of bowing under the obviously male dominated power in the script. But I am a woman so I guess that's the only reason why I mention it.<br/><br/>I can only remember bits and pieces of the transformers cartoon and I don't read comics so I was needless to say shock at the humor in the movie. I loved the humor. Now some people say that the ""mumbo jumbo technical explanations the audience just doesn't care about""... UMMMM let me put it this way... YEAH that's wrong. That was one the best parts of movie. I loved all the ""mumbo jumbo"" personally. <br/><br/>I thought Michael Bay did an exceptional job at directing. I thought his use of light throughout the entire movies was fantastic. Light, as well as music, can enhance the mood of a scene without people realizing it. I believe that if anyone else had directed this movie that it would not have been nearly as good. Transformers is a movie that needs flashy over the top editing. We aren't here to watch a Documentary on Cotton Production... it's an ACTION MOVIE with nothing less than 18 foot tall Robots... so YEAH flashy works!<br/><br/>*Sighs* Ohhhh music the huge staple that holds a good movie together. Now I again admit I love loud blaring rock music and car chase scenes... but throw in a few tons of intelligent talking Autobots and we have a happy girl! I felt like the music was absolutely perfect! It just brought on the perfect mood that were perfect in the scenes where they were at. <br/><br/>So overall I have to say that Transformers was way beyond Great.. a movie that I will watch many many times!"

"Hannibal_Chigurh","6","0","1","26 October 2007"," Michael Bay Strikes Again
","I admit, the prospect of a Transformers film filled me with ecstasy. I'm too young to have seen the G1 cartoon but I grew up on G2, Beast Wars, and any other version I could get my grubby hands on. When I heard they were making a live film and that Spielberg was involved, I was over the moon. Then I found out that Spielberg was produced and the film would be directed by Michael Bay. Oh what a sad day. Bay is a master of special effects, but he can't make a stimulating and engaging film to save his life.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is (as I expected), thin. However, Bay does what he always does and stretches the plot as far as he can, thus making every flaw infinitely more obvious. This film could have survived with no plot at all, but instead he milks the bizarre story for way more than its worth.<br/><br/>Another problem: too many humans. I wanted to see a movie with robots beating the bolts off one another. I got some of that, but Bay allows the military and even average schmucks to square off with these mechanical titans. Shia LeBoeuf earns my eternal respect and admiration for pushing the part of Sam far beyond its limits, but in a good way. He's charming, funny, engaging; he must have shown up on the wrong set and decided to stay. Megan Fox is hot, but she only serves to set up more laughs from Shia. These should have been the only two noteworthy humans in the film, but no. We've got two hackers, the Secretary of Defense, a small band of soldiers, and even a government agency. In a film devoted to robots, the robots only appear on screen about 20 percent of the time. As with all Bay films, it tries to convey depth with a thin romantic subplot. Cheesy romance does not equal depth. Character development and analysis equals depth. Robots have no depth (even sentient ones), so just get to the fighting.<br/><br/>When Bay deigns to let us see the Transformers, he only looks at the Autobots. In the entire film we are allowed one snippet of Decepticon dialog where Megatron tells off Starscream. The rivalry between those two is hands down the richest and deepest part of the cartoon. How could you not go further with that? Axe the longing stares that Shia gives to Fox and you've freed up enough time to study the only intriguing subplot in the Transformers universe. But no, we instead look at the Autobots, who repeat over and over that humans must be protected. I appreciate it fellas, but I can't root for you if I can't see how evil the other guys are.<br/><br/>There are some funny lines here (notably involving Sam's parents), and the action is just what you'd expect from a Michael Bay film: loud, explosive, and awesome. However, this film would have been a modern action masterpiece if Spielberg had directed and Bay had produced. Steven would have given the explosions purpose. He would have looked at the bad guys. Bay could still put fire and bullets all over the place, but he couldn't bore us with yet another pointless romance. It's worth seeing and if you have an HD player, it was made for this film, but it's a vacant film that could have and should have been much more entertaining."

","Every summer, the ""Hollywood Cookie Cutter"" always brings out one or two big popcorn flicks. This one happens to be directed by Michael Bay(""Armageddon"", ""Pearl Harbor""). Now most people think they know what the direction of this review is going, but I'm afraid they're wrong. I thought this film was a fun, breezy, sci-fi adventure, with sharp wit, great direction, dazzling f/x, and a surprisingly effective script(which was written by Michael Bay too). <br/><br/>To give you information on why all the following events(which I won't give to much information or spoilers on), the story follows as so. There are two sides, good and evil. The Autobots(led by Optimus Prime), being the good, and the Decepticons(led by Megatron), being the bad. There is a talisman, called the Allspark, which gives basically immortality to whom ever has it. The Autobots had got it from the Decepticons, but Megatron went in search of it. Megatron landed in the icy waters of the arctic and was frozen... at least, until an explorer by the name of Captain Archibald Witwicky. A map of the location of the talisman was imprinted on the explorers glasses, in which Sam Witwicky, a high schooler related to the Captain, has in his possession. The Autobots are now aware of the glasses and their location, and they dedicate themselves to finding it. I will not give anymore information without spoiling it. This is pretty much the basic plot to the story. Although their is a lot more thrills throughout this engaging film.<br/><br/>I doubt this film is going to take home an Oscar or anything, and if it did, it would probably be for achievement in special-effects. Though I will say that this film is the best summer action blockbuster of 2007, without a doubt. With a reasonable cast, excellent script and Michael Bay's huge directing achievement, I predict this film could raise lot's of eyebrows. Another notable thing, is that this is an intense and action-packed update of the popular animated kids cartoon. I personally am not a huge fan of the cartoon show. Even though I've only saw one or two seasons, if not less.. So I'm not judging this film by a ""fans"" point of view. With that said, I'm sure not only by this, but in my mind, that anybody who likes a good action film every once in a while, will indeed enjoy this film.<br/><br/>3 of 4 stars"

","When I first saw this motion picture in the theater,I have to say that out of all the movies that I have seen,this one is the best. This film is just like the original series. The Autobots and Decepticons were a whole lot different than the original series. The movie was so great, I had to get this for my collection,and I did. When my sister got me this movie on my 25th Birthday,it was just like seeing the movie in the theater once again. It was really the best once again. I have to say that Peter Cullen does a great job playing the voice of Optimus Prime, just like in the original series and 1986 motion picture. I do feel bad that Frank Welker never to play the role of Megatron just like in the show.But however,this film is really okay. Favorite character I liked in the movie:Optimus Prime,Bumble Bee,and Ratchet. My favorite funny part was when Sam's little dog Mojo did his business on Ironhide's foot. That was the most funniest part I liked in the movie. So in closing,if you have seen this movie in the theater,them you have to see this movie on DVD,and it is the best."

","I was very excited when I saw the teaser. I knew exactly what it was and counted down the days until I was going to be able to be there, first in line, opening night. And so I was.<br/><br/>I was blown away. I was a fan of Transformers, and I was very impressed with all the things they showed. The action was amazing, Shia did an excellent job, and the robots kept to their roots.<br/><br/>Some of the bad reviews that I've read have been kind of naive. People complained about Jazz being a ""gangster thug"" or something, when the movie explains to you why he acts and talks the way that he does. This movie is set in modern day. I've heard people talk about the design of the robots, saying that they couldn't distinguish one from the other, or evil from good. The Autobots and the Decepticons were very easy for me to distinguish between the two, and in the fight scenes. It's obvious that the Autobots are more colorful, and the Decepticons are more sharp in their designs, giving you that sense of bad when you look at them. I just think that someone who isn't paying attention to the movie is going to be the one complaining about that. But nothing is real in this movie, of course... that's why it's called a ""movie"".<br/><br/>The acting was great. There were some parts here and there that were kinda iffy, but other than that, it was great and felt real. The whole time during the fight scenes, the transforming scenes, and all the other scenes, it felt as if you were right there. The depth of the movie was great. The references in the jokes and dialogue made you feel like this was happening right now in LA. It displayed the three groups of people that you follow in a great chronological order. You were never wondering what was going on with the other person. The kids related to the teenagers now-a-days, and the adults related to the adults as well. It's all very modern based.<br/><br/>Which is why the Transformers look as different as they do from the original. I mean, Megatron turns into this alien-like plane. If he were to turn into his gun, that would take away from how big and strong and mean he is. Some other Decepticon would have to put him in his hands and shoot. That's just not right for this movie. Optimus Prime doesn't die in this movie because it's the first film. First films in all sets of movies are there to explain the story, show you what the characters can do, and set you up for the next movie so you can jump right into the story then.<br/><br/>The special effects were amazing. All of the explosions and everything were real. Like the bus splitting in half on the freeway in that fight scene, that was real. The only thing that was added was Bonecrusher. The flipping of cars, crashing of buildings, everything was real. The robots were added in perfectly. Amazing.<br/><br/>I am definitely going to be there, at midnight, first in line for the next. One of the best movies I have ever seen."

There are sacrifices, but hey, there are always sacrifices.<br/><br/>The movie is full of edge-of-the-seat action. Amazing spl effects, especially the transformation of aliens.

","Normally CGI-based movies turn me off completely but Transformers has proved to be the exception. I had all the toys when I was younger (I won them in a competition) so watching this movie was virtually re-living my childhood all over again.<br/><br/>Being based on a comic, the plot is nothing to boast about and George Lucas would be proud of the special effects. But where this movie comes into its prime is the pure adrenalin rush you get from watching the heart-stopping action sequences. The film is also extremely humorous with the bad robots looking up auctions on eBay and doing searches on the Yahoo search engine. No prizes for guessing which two big web companies sponsored this movie! <br/><br/>Jon Voight plays a great Secretary of Defense that knows how to handle a shotgun. My only casting complaint would be that the Australian chick and her black hacker friend were tragically under-used. They had the potential to add a whole new dimension to the movie if they had been used more.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie is virtually setting up the sequel. I can't wait. In the meantime, I guess I'll just have to watch this movie another ten times!"

","In all honesty I never liked Transformers. I never watched the old cartoon. I got a few toys as birthday gifts but I never had the patience to make them fully 'transform'. The only attachment I really have with Tranformers is the old Beast Wars show, but that was only if nothing else was on.<br/><br/>But I loved this movie.<br/><br/>It's not perfect (it's a summer movie), but it's a rare summer movie that can beat you in the face with it's action sequences and still remain memorable. In all honesty it's a film that only Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg could make properly. Yeah the story isn't great, and the characters are underdeveloped, but it sticks to you anyway. And, really, when was the last time we saw a truly amazing huge-friggin'-robots movie? In my opinion Transformers is the best summer film of 2007, trouncing even my once-personal favourite 'Pirates of the Caribbean'. Michael Bay said he wanted to create a sort of 'family film with an edge' and that's more or less what this is. I can't imagine all the complaints he must have gotten when people were first introduced to the 'serious look' of a children's toy line. But that's really what it is. If your hoping for a scene where a Decepticon transforms, crushing a hapless human inside it's many moving parts, you'll be very disappointed. The violence mostly comes from the robot-on-robot battles, with relatively few on screen human casualties. The film itself is like the toys it is based off. You look at it and wonder how it's supposed to work, but in the end it just does, and it does it well."

","The visual effects, the sound design the humor were all undoubtly amazing. <br/><br/>Shia Lebeouf acted great. Not all actors act great. They seem great just because the role given fits their original personality but Shia Lebouf ACTS great and convincing enough (both humor and action).<br/><br/>Jush Duhamel fits the concept.Even Tom Cruise may not fit the movie this much. İt can easily be understood that he has given everything he has got to this film.<br/><br/>Micheal Bay is always a super talented director but there are some leaks in his flawless carrier in Transfomers as the music in some scenes could have been better, and the actresses he has chosen (if he choosed them) could have been better. I mean Megan Fox is not hot. Thin body and mini-skirt doesn't mean hot. İt's the carefully measured movements that makes the leading actress seem hot. And Rachael Taylor cannot pronounce English in British accent although she over acts it.<br/><br/>These are (not criticising a well rounded director as Michael Bay) just some humble and friendly wishes. May Allah give him opportunities to make better and more moral films. This is probably the best fantasy film of the year."

"lostflix","6","0","1","18 October 2007"," Started out strong....then quickly fizzled
","Very promising start to a dull movie. I got the feeling within the first 30 minutes I was watching some kind of Terminator 2 ripoff but with car robots instead of cyborgs. The similarities were completely obvious. But that was during the promising set up stage to this way too long flick. Then Mr. Bay must have taken some cues from the older George Lucas (yeh the older one being the guy who thought Jar-Jar and Darth Maul were cool) because out of nowhere some kick-azz bad guy robots developed annoying personalities and speech mannerisms...i.e the infiltrator bots suddenly had to whine and cry when they got hit and generally just become annoying. Period. From that point on the film looses interest and becomes a CGI palm fest. OK we get it... you can make really cool CGI.... can you have a somewhat non-annoying script to watch while you are at it? Does the lead lady always have to have her makeup perfect? Did Tyrese need to be in this film? Do the robots really not shake the ground significantly enough jumping around that we can't notice any vibrations? Can the good guy robots only drive (really slow to for some reason) while the bad guys can fly at will? Please. Can you promote Burger King any more? 60+ years of studying Megatron and landing on the moon is the best we got? Can we scrap Transbeaters 2 and pump that 300 mil into something we might want to watch more than 30 mins of? My suggestion: Watch the first 30 mins then turn it off and get the ending from a good friend. Save 2 hrs of your life and watch T2 instead. Over & out."

The robots themselves were really well done and at times I forgot that they were computer animated and not like real robots. The acting was A+. there was on scenes though in which the computer animation was vary noticeable but other wise I Think this is defiantly one for the best movies off 2007. I love how they stuck to music without lyrics it made it so much easier to concentrate on the movie instead of going OK so who sings this song. But a few time they do use snips o music but it works in the movie during those items. I love how It suck to the basic concept of th original also but they did however change a few things ons pretty big one but ow well I think it was for the3 best that they did change it.

","My overall problem with this movie is that there is nothing original about it. The ""all-powerful"" force angle has been done to death: in LORD OF THE RINGS, it was the rings; in STAR WARS, The Force; in this movie, it's a cube. The bad guys want it, the good guys have to protect it. On the upside, the good guys aren't able to just snap their fingers and save the day: they have to struggle, and it's not always a given that they'll win. Storywise, I'd give it a C-. The dialogue is some of the worst in movie history (I'd give it a D-). The saving grace is the cgi effects. That rates an A-plus. Despite the low marks, I liked the movie (so much so that I pre-ordered it). A good action-comedy."

It keeps me sustained until the sequel of the movie comes out. In the game, you can choose to be an Autobot, or a Decepticon; and you can save your game and go back and forth between the two sides. <br/><br/>I grew up playing with the toys. I had Megatron and Starscream. My parents saw the movie, and they didn't understand it. The movie doesn't appeal to them, cause they were too old to know the Transformers, like my generation and younger understand.<br/><br/>My favorite character from the movie, is BumbleBee. I was hurt to see how easily Starscream injured him.

It has to be said I don't think you'll have seen special effects that could top these, the robots look astonishing and are, as you would hope and expect the stars of the show.Who cares about lousy dialogue and slightly ropey acting, all I wanted to see was robots kicking ass and smashing thing up and boy do you get it!! The film has quite a long running time of nearly 150 minutes but it zips along at a good pace, you never have to wait to long for an action set piece and there's always the eye candy of Megan Fox to fill in the gaps.<br/><br/>Easily the Summer movie of the year, daft, action packed with a good dose of humour, looking forward to part 2 already....."

From the action sequences to the little touches of comedy such as Iron Hide commenting on wanting to shoot Sam's parents because they were annoying.

","Being familiar with the original cartoon series of the 1980s, I was interested in catching the Hollywood live action blockbuster version. Basically, this turns out to be a combination of THE TERMINATOR (1984), INDEPENDENCE DAY (1996) and even BLACK HAWK DOWN (2001). As was to be expected for a modern day popcorn flick, teenagers are involved but, luckily, the two leads (despite their anonymity to the undersigned) were unusually affectingalthough, in the second half of the show, they too are eventually sidetracked by all the spectacle.<br/><br/>Surprisingly enough, the villainous Decepticons are severely underused and their leader Megatron himself doesn't appear until the last half-hour or so! In fact, the most notable of the evil machines is a new addition to the fold – a hacker robot who grunts and gesticulates like a Gremlin! Also unexpected is the film's comic highlight set in the hero's backyard which sees the benign Autobots attempting to hide from the latter's overly inquisitive parents.<br/><br/>For all the spectacular CGI-infested action sequences, the look of the machines themselves is rather cluttered – would we have been as impressed with the original King Kong if we couldn't see the mechanism at work? – and the fast and furious pace of the action sequences becomes numbing after a while: imagine the chariot race in BEN-HUR (1959) where the crucial antagonism between him and Messala is all but lost in the shuffle! Also, aren't we all tired by now to see every disaster to hit the planet nowadays being given the paranoid 9/11 spin – with the resulting affirmation of the ingenuity and superiority of the U.S. Defense system (even if they require the services of the world's top teenage hackers to crack the alien code)? <br/><br/>Anyway, this is not a film to break down and analyze but one to take your breath away with awesome special effects and, in this regards, it succeeds well enough; for what it's worth, the human cast, apart from the afore-mentioned teenage leads, includes Jon Voight as the Secretary of Defence and John Turturro as an oddball member of a mysterious government agency."

Nearly and hour of robots fighting. It was so exciting and intense. I couldn't believe how much action there was.<br/><br/>All in all, Trannies is the perfect movie.

","I'll admit it- this Transformers review is more than a month overdue. Certain details will not be discussed here due to my memory simply forgetting about them. But then again, is it humanly possible to forget the experience you had after watching Transformers? The movie featured everything- giant robots duking it out, a Secretary of Defense who can wield a gun well, the obnoxious Anthony Anderson, and a funny cheap shot at the President. What's not to love? Well, the lead characters for one. Shia LaBeouf plays Sam, a semi-geeky teenager who is just like everyone else- he wants a car, gets moderately good grades, and wants to get a girlfriend (the way he tries to get a GF, however, is not like everyone else). After getting good enough grades to warrant him a used car of his choosing, Sam and his dad go to a car dealership to pick out a ride. Sam feels a connection between himself and a heavily-used Chevy Comero, which turns out to be a robot in disguise. Soon thereafter, Sam meets a hot girl named Mikaela (Fox), a name that's more sophisticated than her character. She is, however, a brunette, so something's gone array. Sam and Mikaela have the stereotypical relationship where the guy tries all he can for the girl, who eventually falls for him.<br/><br/>Now it's not like any of that really matters. The movie is all about the giant robots, even though the Sam:robot on screen ratio is nearly equal. The major draw for the movie is the Transformers, and they sure as hell deliver. Michael Bay, in typical good fashion, wastes little time in introducing the main players. After the Decepticons (the evil robots) attack an American base over in Iraq, Secretary of Defense John Keller (played magnificently by Jon Voight) alerts the nation on the problem and the bizarre situation at hand. Working under Keller are many people, including a blonde woman, to whom I ironically forget the name of. Anyways, she takes the invasion seriously, and investigates is illegally with her adviser Anthony Anderson! Meanwhile, to sum things up, Sam's car morphs into Bumblebee, an Autobot (the good robots). Not soon after, the rest of the Autobots come down to earth, led by Optimus Prime, a kick-ass version of Arnold Schwarzenegger, only in robot form. From here on, the Autobots and Decepticons wage war on each other. Both ""races"" of robots are trying to locate a cube, which holds the power to their world. Be warned: the fights feature some of the most incredible special effects you have likely ever seen. The showdown at the end of the movie is pure mastery.<br/><br/>Transformers has been in release now for more than seven weeks, and it's domestic gross is over $300 million to date. That puts it on an elite list with Spider-man 3, Shrek the Third, and Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End as being the movies of 2007 that have reached that mark. Inflation, you may say? Correct, yet $300 mil is still something to brag about. That money can be drawn to the great effects in the movie and the mostly spot-on sense of humor the movie has (Sam ain't funny, everyone else is). I highly recommend seeing this blockbuster.<br/><br/>Good) Ridiculous effects, amazing robot on robot fight scenes Bad) Lead humans: not necessary & annoying, sometimes poor script Anthony Anderson) Is he not in every movie out there?"

","Word to the wise: If a film makes $300 million without being a sequel, chances are it's probably a good film.<br/><br/>I wish I adhered to this lesson sooner because I ended up stumbling upon this movie inadvertently (I was waiting for another movie to start and wandered into the Transformers theater) and I was fortunate to discover THE event picture of the summer even if it was eight weeks past its release and there was no one left who hadn't seen it that I could proclaim it's greatness to.<br/><br/>Produced by Stephen Spielberg and directed by Michael Bay, I'm happy to report that between the clash of these two creative visionaries (or should I say one creative visionary and a guy whose primary interest as a movie director is making things explode), that the end result is a movie that's far more Spielberg than it is Bay. Transformers plays out along the lines of Spielberg's ""Things are best seen from a children's point of view"" theme that is most closely associated with E.T. Along the lines of this E.T. analogy, massive credit goes to the casting department for using Shia LeBouf in the ""Drew Barrymore"" role, because he is largely the reason the film works so well. Charismatic, a little vulnerable, and witty, Shia LeBouf balances the heavy mythology with lighthearted fun reminiscent of Han Solo's role in Star Wars. I think it's also a good bet that like Harrison Ford, Shia LeBouf will enjoy a rich and long-lived career.<br/><br/>While coming off as the second coming of E.T., the film also has a touch of Roland Emmerich films like The Day After Tomorrow and Independence Day where the impossible task of trying to portray an entire planet as it deals with a global attack is portrayed through a cross-section of people whose story lines weave closer together as the plot progresses and there were plenty of interesting characters from Jon Voight's airhead Secretary of defense (a little reminiscent of Rumsfeld but a slightly better listener) to Jon Turturro as a special agent to Rachel Taylor as a sexy intelligent computer programmer to Megan Fox as a very compelling girl-next-door type who commands the protagonist's interest.<br/><br/>Of course, with Michael Bay as the director, the action gets a little excessive (especially in the final battle scene), but ultimately, the film is all about character and that's what makes it memorable"

","I came into this movie not expecting a lot. Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay have always been an impressive pair (The Rock, Armageddon, Bad Boys I & II) and to throw in Steven Spielberg just added to the allure. But, what was beginning to look like a summer full of noise and fluff, this seemed like it would be stuck in the rut of a many summer popcorn flicks...<br/><br/>But was I wrong! From the first frame till the credits (I will maintain the best use of a Likin Park song in a movie) I was on the edge of my seat, excited for the next scene or sequence. I consider myself a reasonably seasoned movie goer, even if I maybe interrupted by deployments. It has been a long time since I had a movie leaving my mouth agape. Wonderful animation, fight sequences and story.<br/><br/>True, it definitely got cheesy at points, the two incredibly hot women in the movie (I still maintain the Aussie chick moved her mouth way too much, possibly hinting at a fake accent) were kind of over played, and it had its groaner moments.

","-Very few spoilers.- <br/><br/>If it weren't for the talents of Shia LaBeouf and Peter Cullen, and the inventiveness of Bay and Spielberg, it would probably be yet another flop. Transformers is truly astonishing. An action-packed and downright fun film that seamlessly blends live action footage with computer animation. <br/><br/>I didn't grow up watching the original cartoons but I did spend a good deal of my childhood watching the ""Beast Wars"" saga in the Transformers franchise. That particular computer animation was also neat but not as fiercely pitched as the movie. Obviously, when was the last time you saw a vehicle speeding and transforming and the same time.<br/><br/>The 1986 cartoon movie was blatantly a ""fans only"" film, Which I didn't see at the time. As I saw that on DVD I was very disappointed. Not only did it have a convoluted plot, but also deaths of major characters in less than the first half of the film. As the film went on my interest grew less. The 2007 movie, however, kept me interested and smiling from start to finish. Full of action, style, and humor. Die hard fans of the original cartoon might think this update was stupid. For everyone else they will be excited to see 2 sequels in a not so distant future. And at a current worldwide box office gross higher than 600 million dollars. The dream of seeing more ""Transformers"" is not far from being a reality. Well done Michael Bay! You've conquered the 1986 Transformers as expected!"
"devil_may_cry_318","9","0","1","23 August 2007"," Transformers fans rejoice!
","Having been a big fan of the Transformers back in the 80's I was thrilled to hear a new film was coming out, and I got the chance to see one of the first viewings. So, what's my overall verdict on it? Awesome! Transformers fans will love it.<br/><br/>Right from the get go, there's action, and it doesn't stop until the end of the film. Some guys in the seats in front of me gasped in awe and said ""oh my god!"" at most of the fight scenes, and rightfully so. The effects are breath-taking and the transformations are brilliant. I actually shed a little tear the first time Optimus Prime came onto the screen, it was like all my childhood fantasies came back.<br/><br/>The actual people in the film are never too annoying or in your face, and there are some genuinely funny moments within the film (Bumblebee's ""lubricating"" scene being one of them) There are a couple of negatives though. There is one particular mini-con that becomes genuinely irritating the more you see it in the film and by the end you'll be glad to see it's comeuppance. Also, the sheer amount of needless product placement is almost shameful. To name a few: X-Box, Mountain Dew, Chevrolet, and let's not forget E-Bay. There are also a couple of really corny lines, but I'm just glad they got most of the original quotes in the film somewhere.<br/><br/>When the film ended and the credits rolled, the entire cinema applauded, and it deserves it. Transformers is truly a non-stop action-fest that is highly recommended"
"TimBoHannon","8","0","1","23 August 2007"," What a Career Change for Bay
","Michael Bay has directed seven theatrical films now. For a long time he was a trash director. Before ""The Island,"" he had five to his name: ""Bad Boys (1995),"" ""The Rock (1996),"" ""Armageddon (1998),"" ""Pearl Harbor (2001)"" and ""Bad Boys II (2003)."" Only ""The Rock"" is not deplorably bad, and the other four sometimes border on unwatchable. I refused to see ""The Rock"" for a long time, but did on the advice of a friend, and after seeing it, I felt that Bay could be a legend one day if all of his films were that good.<br/><br/>Bay has now increased his record to three for seven. ""The Transformers"" is a first rate Science Fiction film that abundantly brings action, drama, computer visuals and inventive sound to the screen. While I contend that ""The Matrix"" did not deserve its visual effects Oscar, I give no argument to its sound effects award. ""The Transformers"" employs equal inventiveness and raises sound effects to a level never achieved before.<br/><br/>The most challenging effects are the complex transformations themselves. They take place so quickly that it is impossible to see most detail, but the ear has no such limitation and the terrific sound sells the illusion. I look forward to the DVD release so I can discover how many creative noises were used in the symphonic cacophony of sound (how's that for an oxymoron?).<br/><br/>The brilliant audio is not limited to the transformations. A transformer named Frenzy attacks with hurled blades with a distinctive hum that will be tattooed on my mind forever. The transformers' voices are all mechanized and deepened, yet easily distinguished from each other. Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith from ""The Matrix"") voices Megatron and his voice is altered so well that I could not tell it was him, yet their speech is easy to understand. There are a host of other examples like the whizzing of Scorponok's blender hands, the hum of Starscream's jet engine, the sound of the robots' computer hacking, missiles zooming through the sky, shockwaves, and the crunch of metal beings striking one another.<br/><br/>The opening narration explains the premise. ""The Cube"" can create planets and fill them with life. On the transformers' home world, a group called the Decepticons used the Cube for evil, and the entire planet was rendered lifeless in the following war. The Autobots, led by Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen) scour the stars in hopes of destroying the Cube to prevent the Decepticons from ravaging other worlds.<br/><br/>Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBouf) is the grandson of an arctic explorer. The explorer found the frozen Megatron, leader of the Decepticons. Megatron's followers come to Earth and believe that the Cube is here and Sam holds the key to finding it. An Autobot named Bumblebee locates Sam and protects him until his comrades can arrive.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Secretary of Defense John Keller (Jon Voight) gathers the most brilliant computer students in the country to identify who hacked into their defense system. One of them (Rachael Taylor) asserts that an artificial intelligence did, and is bluntly dismissed. Witwicky picks up Michaela, the High School belle (Megan Fox), and they are both thrust into the crisis when Bumblebee fights a Decepticon disguised as a police car. Another Decepticon destroys an airbase in the Middle East.<br/><br/>Complicating the matter is Agent Simmons (John Turturro) of Sector 7, a secret group whose existence is unknown to even Secretary Keller. This point is where the film works against itself. Simmons knows enough to realize the scale of the threat, yet he takes the simplest course of action--arrest the Witwickys. No questions, no thinking, no planning, just barging in with handcuffs. Simmons waves his ""do anything I want and get away with it"" badge in their faces like a power hungry child. Optimus Prime frees the family, but when the largest SWAT team comes out of nowhere, the Autobots no longer help, even when the government peons capture Bumblebee.<br/><br/>""Why should we protect them?"" protests Autobot Ironhide, ""they are a primitive, violent species."" When I heard that line, I almost agreed with him. The government had made its noose and placed it around its necks, and were about to jump. It all works out, of course, when Keller intervenes, but suppose it had not. The Decepticons might have won. I have no problems with Turturro's work, but I hate seeing him on screen since he seems to always play idiot of the decade.<br/><br/>I wrote in my review of ""Spider-Man 3"" that the Academy could hand it the visual effects Oscar. After seeing the awesome climax, I have to reconsider that statement. The sand effects in the Spider-Man film were more impressive, but nearly the entire finale here is computer created, and it is long. It is sometimes hard to follow who is who, since only Bumblebee, Optimus Prime, Megatron and Starscream have their own personalities.<br/><br/>Were it not for Agent Simmons, this film may have received a ten star score, although I wanted to see more of the Optimus, Megatron fight. The human characters exceeded my expectations and the setup allows a strong foundation. In any case, Michael Bay is now a respectable director, and I look forward to his next film."
"dias0511","6","0","1","23 August 2007"," good looking, but not much underneath
","After seeing the trailer for this film, i must say i was very much looking forward to seeing it in the cinema. It looked like a fun, quick-paced film filled with hard-to-keep-up-with cgi sequences, which it has a lot of.<br/><br/>Straight after seeing it, i really liked it, but after further thought i've decided that its a bit of a 'nothing' film. The plot isn't that great with the most part of the action happening in the last 15 minutes and before that its mainly the story of some big alien robots looking for a pair of old broken glasses. Shia LeBouf and Emma Fox make decent attempts with characters that don't really go anywhere and the sub-plots put in, i feel, were only there for the sake of trying to make them more interesting.<br/><br/>So, overall i think that Transformers is fun to watch for the action and explosions and impressive looking cgi sequences, but other that that it's not got much good things to say about it."

Shia LeBeuof did a great job as Sam Witwickey. The transformations were excellent and the graphics were out of this world., and it was great tieing in the military, it really gives the action side of the world.

","i didn't expect much form this adaptation but nevertheless i was disappointed.<br/><br/>to begin with the good part: of course, the sfx were stunning (1 point); but by times the movements of the robots during the fight scenes were so fast that it is hard to tell the good robots from the bad ones.<br/><br/>but then: there is practically no plot. there is NO dramatic development of the scenes: every scene starts with an explosion or an attack without any preparation, thrill or suspense (nor even surprise). and the worst of all: the dialog is absolutely ridiculous and stupid throughout the hole movies. not one sentence hasn't been in at least 100 other movies (inclusivly the introduction of a catchphrase, full of pathos of course, in the beginning that will be picked up again at the end - a method that always makes me nauseous). not to speak of the apologetic (and politically dangerous) depiction of military ""heroism"" i.e. violence.<br/><br/>the only silver lining was john turturro who manages to bring some humor and satiric twist into the movies - therefore two points."

","Pretty oh so pretty picture. Thats what will hit you when the first transformation takes place. And the build up to this is handled fantastically. Young Shia does a great job and Bay, i believe for the first time in his career, has created a like-able character. And the initial action is great. The daylight desert attack was brilliant. Then it turns into a parody of itself. Masturbation jokes, bumblebee peeing on john Tuturro (i doubt even the Coen brothers would have thought of that one) and the worst bad guy in living memory. Yes transformers boys, he looked cool and from the cartoon you know he's evil, but from the man in the streets point of view this guy just wakes up, screams ""I am Megatron"" then dies. The initial action sequences were very exciting then they turn monotonous. A giant robot movie should be 2 hours max."
"The_Orenda","7","0","1","20 August 2007"," Fans of the series rejoice!
","Ever since Steven Spielberg attached his name to the project many moons ago, I followed the movie's progress with a passion ever since. And seeing children in the theater, who were my age when the cartoon was airing new episodes every day after school, brought memories of a time when I thought there would have been nothing cooler on Earth than seeing a live-action version of the Transformers on the silver screen. Thankfully, the movie did not disappoint, for though many spots throughout the film were overly cheesy or flimsy, the essence of the Transformers remained strong from beginning to end. Any fanboy would take immense pleasure analyzing this film from front to back.<br/><br/>An opening introduction to Energon... err, AllSpark, leads us to two stories. The first is of a helicopter, thought downed in Afghanistan, reappears on a U.S. Army base in Qatar, transforms into a giant robot and attacks, trying to steal all the United States' defense hard-drive. The second is of Sam Witwicky, who after buying a car with his father, finds that it also could be more than meets the eye.<br/><br/>What made the Transformers great is all present and accounted for: the exceptional voice over work, the smooth transforming of the Transformers, and the unbelievable wit and hilarious one-liners of the Transformers themselves. There's nothing funnier than Megatron's reaction when he's lying next to a human, or Barricade's interrogation of Sam when he's caught, OR the cop's questioning of Sam at the precinct (""Take some Mojo, huh?""). Some of the overlong script's wit wanders a little though when it's all decided, including a Captain of the U.S. army, that taking the AllSpark, hence, the Autobot/Decepticon battle royale, into the CITY was a good bet, where millions of terrified humans would run for their lives and get stepped on. But some of the Tranformers' best episodes are also explored as well, such as why the Autobots even bother to help the humans with groups like Sector 7 around to annoy them. It's another overblown blockbuster, sure, but this film has a loyal fanbase to embrace what was an excellent transition from cartoon to film. Many thanks to Bay and Spielberg."

At the bottom of my heart, I feel Steven Spielberg should be a film director and Michael Bay, an action director in upcoming transformers sequel. Michael Bay needs more improvement in direction platform. I watched this movie because Steven Spielberg is an executive producer. As a film critic, I will rate this movie 7.2/10 just because of flaws. As a normal audience, Its 9/10. Overall, Transformers is very good movie but could have been more better without these flaws.

Terrific acting from Shia LaBeouf who has been doing great with his career (Disturbia is his next summer blockbuster) and also the wonderful Megan Fox, who, in which many gentleman will agree, is a girl you would drop everything to look at her.<br/><br/>The special effects were excellent, the best I've seen yet, especially the transformation of the robots (which are the main point about the transformers franchise). The only let down, is that there isn't much emphasis on the characters. Sure, it does start off as a steady drama and does show the life of Sam Witwicky, which escalates when he meets hot chick Mikaela Banes who is most obviously infatuated by her. But yes the balance of personality of the characters and the action is just too bias. Near to the end you kind of think, ""what's going on?"" you get a bit confused with all the quick action, you're just overfed with action, and sometimes does get rather annoying. There are some quirky, witty and humorous moments in the film which gives it a more happier tone to the movie.<br/><br/>All in all this is one great film, and i recommend it to all!

Although Shia doesn't seem to be having a bad year, it's ""hot babe convenience"" seems to be running his adolescent years quite well. I had no problems with Shia in this film fortunately, he portrayed a more realistic, less clichÃ© ridden teenager than in that waste of time Disturbia. <br/><br/>Once again Michael Bay's objectification of women shines through in brilliant clarity....taking the forms of Megan Fox, and Rachael Taylor (the former, a hot chick who also knows all about cars and really isn't snotty, the later, a top of the line computer ""code hacker"" of some sorts who is hired by the Pentagon to crack some signal code....she looks about 15 years old.) Never for a minute did I believe any one of these ladies...and i'm not saying women can't be beautiful and intelligent, but how about being realistically portrayed? Nothing in the ""Pentagon mystery code"" was complicated enough to convince me why the guy cleaning the building couldn't have made this connection!<br/><br/>Anthony Anderson shows up with the comic relief. This time, he's a super hacker trying to be funny, be amazed as the movie about giant transforming robots treats you to scenes of Anderson scarfing down an entire plate of donuts by himself, and yelling at his grandmother to drink her prune juice.<br/><br/>The storyline could've used more Megatron (esp a transforming Megatron), more Transformer scenes (they aren't revealed until late into the movie). Less emphasis on the angsty teenage portion (who really cares?!) Marvel at one scene where it's broad daylight, and the next when it's pitch black at night. (Guess your continuity people took a big nap.)<br/><br/>The forehead slapping, overlong scene of the Transformer's stumbling around the backyard like a bad episode of Mr. Bean, knocking things over, crushing flowers, and saying things like ""oops"" and ""my bad"". Awful. YOU feel embarrassed! <br/><br/>It's also really difficult to tell who's who in these robot battles, and all the decepticons look the same, so it's difficult to tell what robot is entering a battle or a scene. Also, why didn't they leave Prime's face mask on? He looks way cooler with it, without, he just looks like some sort of a metal bug with these weird lips.<br/><br/>The climatic battle? In the middle of a major city? Not likely, even for the most dull witted hero. As far as I can figure out they did this for ""more stuff for robots to knock over, and for humans to climb on, and for Bay to blow up.""<br/><br/>On the up side, Shia didn't annoy me, it was awesome that Peter Cullen voiced Optimus, I always liked Bumble Bee, but why change his car for the flashy stick out like a sore thumb Camaro? He could've at least been a new VW bug. Sam's dad is funny. (The mother however makes you want to hang yourself with a shoelace.) John Turturro, (i'm still wondering what he's doing in this movie, and if he really needs a paycheck that badly.) Not the worst movie i've ever seen, but nothing I care to watch again. 4/10"

","Why 8 and such a title? Well because if you look for a cool action packed Blockburster, with amazing CGI, great soundtrack, wicked humour, a storyline written on the back of a Subway Ticket and good looking war-machines then this is your movie<br/><br/>If you like Transformers then this has nothing to do with it, the only respect (aside from reusing the same dubbing actor for Optimus Prime) is the colour scheme, Yellow for Bumblebee, Red/Blue for Optimus Prime, Greyish for Megathron and so on, aside from that I Challenge anyone to tell me what transformed robot is supposed to look like when in his vehicle shape. For me this is the biggest disappointment as rather than say that call them Transformers I would call them Mimickers or Dopplegangers...even some car advertisement have car/robot transformation more realistic.<br/><br/>-----------------------------Spoiler bellow---------------------------- I know there is little room on the back of a Subway ticket, but once they have the ""Cube"" and they know that upset and bloody minded Decepticons are chasing them, where should you go for safety and fighting your ground? In the middle of a City, but of course, where you can have maximum collateral damages doh!!!!! Sorry but even though the fight were awesome why the hell didn't they made the stand at the Dam? Just imagine, 5 Autobots VS 7 Decepticons on a narrow Dam fighting between life and death with a couple Decepticons trying to destroy the Dam to add some more casualties wouldn't it have been really cool?<br/><br/>Go watch it as it's place is in a Theatre or at best a Home Cinema, but don't buy it"

Cars Massive Fight Scenes and Destruction!!! Quick Start.<br/><br/>Cons...

"jurgkaufmann-1","7","0","1","13 August 2007"," Eyebreaking action for a rather silly plot
","As a kid I was a huge fan of the auto-bots (my favorite character in the series - I guess he's everybody's favorite- was Optimus Prime). Man, I even had Optimus as a play toy. It was really cool seeing him transform into a truck with my one fingertips. Well, I don't want to get all mushy and stuff, so let's just say I really looked forward to see this new summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>Having seen a lot of Michael Bay's movies, I was pretty sure the movie wouldn't lack the action scenes, but in my head arose two questions: could his team really make these fantastic robots look real? Would the story be OK? As to the first question, let me tell you that these robots really rook on the big screen. I must give the visual effects team huge credit, because they did their homework. The robots are amazing (I mean visually) and the battle scenes are breathtaking. In my opinion the movie has some of the best special effects since Matrix hit the box office.<br/><br/>But I guess that this represents also the weak points of this movie. Once your eyes get accustomed to see the robots on screen, you realize that their personalities are very superficial and stereotyped. And their isn't really a plot, but that is for you to decide. I guess with all the action packed scenes, there wasn't much time for anything else. So, as I suspected, the answer to my second answer is a big NO.<br/><br/>The + aspects of the movie: The action scenes, the visual design of the robots, the acting of Le Beuf, (he's really funny when he tries to impress Megan Fox with his new car) and some good chokes.<br/><br/>The - aspects of the movie: no real plot, abuse of the action scenes, the humor get's silly and childish at times and not to forget the grandiloquent end speech of Optimus Prime, come on, is this for real) So my recommendation is, if you want to enjoy yourself, have some good laughs and see some cool actions scenes and over the top special effects without having to think a lot, than this movie is definitely made for you. But if you expect more, let's say a real story and some good characterization of the robots, think again. But hey, this is Hollywood at its best!!!"
"a-little-squeek","6","0","1","12 August 2007"," ...oil can ! ......
","Pretty good yarn with lots of visual and audible stuff going on that you can never really put your finger on. Gears twirl, shafts slide, hinges fold and unfold but you cannot really discern what the heck is happening until the robot actually becomes the vehicle or vice versa. Meanwhile, metallic sounds grind, whirl, sproing and groan during the transformation. It's all pretty good stuff and, I guess, represents the next generation of CGI potential. Shia LeBeouf (?) is very good as the star in this and someone to keep your eye on for future projects. He was amusing as the trash talking kid/friend of Will Smith in ""I, Robot"", and I enjoyed him in that very minor role. ""Transformers"" has hot vehicles and hot girls and is generally appealing. The plot is good and unfolds well. Sound effects are superior and it would be well worth seeing this film in a movie house with a wiz-bang sound system if you DO decide to see it in the theater."
"mr-wmouse","10","0","3","12 August 2007"," Absolutely wonderful movie
","I was one of the boys who grew up with Transformers.<br/><br/>It was in the beginning of 1990 when Transformers were introduced to China. As a boy from a poor family, my only transformer toy was bumblebee. I used to stand in front of the shop for hours and hours every weekend just looking at the toys until they were all removed from the shops in 1996. It was a dream of a young boy.<br/><br/>Now I have huge collection of the G1 toys, however, the feeling was deeply hidden in the heart of the boy until he heard the familiar voice: I'm Optimus Prime.<br/><br/>I watched it three times. The return of the transformers means a lot to me.<br/><br/>Thank you, Michael Bay.<br/><br/>Thank you all who made this movie."
"cinematicparadox","10","0","3","11 August 2007"," amazingly greatly made movie
","Firstly, it wasn't my choice to see this movie. I would have seen Blades of Glory, Bridge to Terabithia or something like that. But it just happened that this was on at a reasonable time. I knew this was labelled ""good fun for the boys"" and me, being one who would rather watch girly romantic comedies or just a comedy itself, i was doubtful. It exceeded all expectations... it was funny (really funny) and rather action packed (but since i enjoyed casino royale then i don't mind a bit of action). The cast was perfect, Shia LaBeouf (my new crush) just livened up the screen with his geeky retarded-around-girls Sam Witwicky. Megan Fox is not only gorgeous, but great for the role of Mikaela. And as for Sam's parents- who could choose better. The rest of the cast were great as well! Micheal Bay took on Transformers and made it a film to remember forever. Honestly it was funnier than most comedies that are supposed to be comedies I've seen and really, I was impressed. If you want to have a little fun, a lot of laughs and a bit of action, this is a must-see!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

","Was unsure if I should take my 8 yr old son to see this movie but did it anyway & he couldn't stop saying ""this is cool!"" It was really good mainly due to the AWESOME SPECIAL EFFECTS! The acting I would give a b+ rating. But I highly recommend it if you are a transformers cartoon fan. You won't be disappointed. I wouldn't take children under 7/8 yrs of age due to some adult subject matter - like masturbation. My son asked me during the movie what they meant by that - but forgot to ask again once we left - thank goodness! I am not ready for that talk yet! Otherwise it was one of the few movies I have seen at the theater that was actually worth the money to see on the big screen. ENJOY!"

","As i kid i never liked transformers or really ever associated about them. So, when i first heard about it, i thought it was going to be some stupid movie. But then as trailers went up i got interested. Eventually, when i saw the movie it was the movie that changed the summer movies. I never really heard any really hype about it till it came out and blew any movie disappointed i had.<br/><br/>I don't see anything bad about the acting or the story at all. It was complex or anything. It got the point and had amazing action in it. It also had comedy which was appreciated too. You need to watch this movie."
"satori_anaide","8","0","1","10 August 2007"," ""Great, but not excellent.""
","In my opinion, the movie is great, but not excellent.<br/><br/>The movie is great since they have done a great job of porting the animated series into a live-action film, and it has been a long wait for that. The effects are also great.<br/><br/>Now the single downside in my opinion is: the plot. Part of the plot, that is. The plot is OK but it's kind speed-ed up at the end. There are a lot of stuff that they didn't include in the ending. One thing is Sam's parents. Where have they gone? Another one: where have the other transformers have gone to? I didn't know what happened to Starscream, or even Jazz after he got dismembered by Megatron.<br/><br/>Well, in any case, that's about it. Don't get me wrong, the plot is working with the animation in my opinion. It's just that the movie is sort of lacking in the end. I would still recommend it to anyone, it's a great movie."

","First of all id like to say that growing up i only saw a few episodes of Transformers so when i went into the cinema iwas still a bit hazy about all the characters and story lines.<br/><br/>Now id like to tell u that this is one of the best movies of the year. The director Michael Bay keeps the action flowing mixing it with a cheeky script. The CGI is top notch as you would expect and the acting is spot on. The voice acting is also very well done.<br/><br/>The autobots led by Optimus Prime come Earth to destroy the All Spark which the Decepticons led by Megatron are after. Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf) gets caughts up in the action and is joined by a fantastic supporting cast which includes Megan Fox, Josh Duhamel (Las Vegas), Anthony Anderson (Scary Movie 4), Jon Voight and Rachel Taylor. <br/><br/>In short this movie is awesome definitely worth seeing in theater's"

","WOW!!! What a fantastic movie. Sure a few flaws and goofs, but really a neat movie. The special effects and flow are very well done. Looks like a sequel may be coming, as the ending is like the 1st Star Wars (Episode 4) ending, with Darth's ship still intact at the end of the movie. It is worth to stay during the credits for the entertainment by the parents. Forget the laws of physics in this movie as the Transformers appear to be able to not only change their appearance, but their mass as well. OH? What do they feed on?? They appear to have unlimited energy resources and liquids, but we never see them digest anything to replenish their energy levels. Anyway, why would anyone consider laws of physics when attending this movie anyway --- just enjoy it. The movie is a good the 7th time viewing as it was the 1st time. Fortunately a theater here has $3,$4, $5, and $6 tickets available and every show is in DLP --- WOW!!!!!! If you love science fiction which defies laws of physics, then this is a fantastic movie. A lot of violence, so younger children may not be appropriate viewers."
"Superman6011","Null","0","2","8 August 2007"," ""Men in Black"" meets ""Herbie Fully Loaded""
","The movie is like ""Men in Black"" meets ""Herbie Fully Loaded."" These two parent movies mixed the aliens and action with a talking, emotional car along with several other popular culture references. In the list of similarities that don't offensively rip off the other movies, but are still striking nonetheless, there is a small robot that resembles some of the skinny and shifty aliens from the ""Men and Black"" movies. (He originally appeared as a radio on the airplane.) The car buying scene in ""Transformers"" also strikes some familiar chords with ""Herbie Fully Loaded."" In both, the dirty, unwanted car chooses the Shia Labouf/Lindsay Lohan by destroying the car they wanted to buy. Awkward dialogue plagued ""Transformers"" like it did in ""Herbie Fully Loaded,"" However, Transformers managed to use it to its comedic advantage. The movie doesn't reach the classic height of ""Men in Black"" but certainly builds a mountain over it's other parent, ""Herbie Fully Loaded."""
"davetrave69","8","0","2","8 August 2007"," Better than I expected.
","I had been warned by a close friend that Michael Bay had directed some stinkers in the past namely Pearl Harbour and Armageddon. Not having seen either of these excerpt a small except of the attack scene in the former I was determined to give the film a fair viewing. I was pleasantly rewarded! <br/><br/>Yes there are faults, the worst I believe was the extreme close up nature of most of the action sequences which rendered them at times confusing, but on the whole I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The dialogue for the first half of the film is actually quite amusing and at times downright funny. The main character Sam is very likable and his love interest very lickable! LOL (Couldn't resist).<br/><br/>When the moment came in the heat of battle for the two to declare their love for each other it didn't quite happen, which was a relief, so my stomach contents were kept down nicely.<br/><br/>Of course the story is preposterous, it's a film about robots from outerspace disguising themselves as everyday machines. A realistic plot line is not the order of the day here, and neither should it be. I thought the cast were all excellent in there rolls and whilst the film lasted way over 2 hours it certainly didn't seem like it. It moves at such a pace that in the brief moments of little action there is humour. I had to nip out to the toilet at a part I thought was going to be not so interesting and apparently missed one of the most amusing scenes in the film!<br/><br/>So in summary, forget his previous, don't expect The Da Vinci Code, switch off brain and engage your fun chips. Enjoy for what it is, a fun, fast-paced, action adventure, roller-coaster ride of a film and other tired old similes. Great stuff!"
"chicana_tigre","10","0","2","8 August 2007"," That One Darn Scene
","On a scale of 1 to 10, I give this movie a 10, with 1 stipulation which I will expound on in just a moment.<br/><br/>The movie was very well written. Orci and Kurtzman have proved themselves time and time again while working with J.J. Abrams. These polished writers were able to mix up enough of the traditional Transformers storyline while putting in a horde of exciting scenes and a driving storyline.<br/><br/>The film making was exceptional. The editing made the movie easily viewable and the extravagant special effects added to the ""wow"" effect of the whole movie.<br/><br/>Now about that stipulation I was talking about. In one scene, when Witwicky's mother was wondering about his delay in opening up his bedroom door, she asked ""Were you masturbating?"" I submit that this did nothing but drag the movie down. I am from Utah where Mormonism is the most prominent religion, and they, as well as several other religions, believe that any sexual act before marriage (including masturbation) is strictly forbidden by commandment. Therefore the open discussion of masturbation is as much a taboo as talking about any other sexual act.<br/><br/>Friends of mine were so offended at this mention of masturbation that they got up and left the theater. I cannot blame them. At this juncture in the movie, I was uncomfortable, while holding my wife's hand (having been married nearly 3 years). I quickly looked around the theater to notice that most of the seats were filled with pre-adolescent youth. I sympathize with the parents of all those who took their children to the movie and were confronted with this dilemma.<br/><br/>I'm sure there are millions of people who had no problem with the comment, but I believe IT IS NOT HOLLYWOODS PLACE to teach (or incite a discussion about) the birds and the bees to our youth.<br/><br/>At the video rental store, I got into a discussion with one young mother (about this particular movie scene) who informed me that ""I won't be taking my children to see Transformers, now that you've told me that."" The movie was great, but I'm not going to buy a copy of the movie until I can find a way to edit that phrase out of the movie."

","I'm not a fan of this type of movies, but this one, in spite of all the flaws, surprised me for good. <br/><br/>Yet, unfortunately, like almost of all action movies that i've seen, the bad guys must be benevolent and retardos in order for all the good guys win (i call this the ""Syndrome Of The Action Movies""!). It just repulses me!<br/><br/>Generally, and although there's a lot of parts that are predictable and look somewhat forcible (like, for example, the platonic romance between Mikaela and Sam), the movie provides a good all-around touch of genres: drama and some romance (without being too lame), comedy, thrilling moments and especially, of course, the constant amazing action scenes. The jewels of the crown are the spectacular sound and special effects present in all the movie that are way(!) above the average, and they just make the movie worth of being seen."
"mishozivanov","6","0","1","7 August 2007"," Transformers! Play dumb!
","First off I would like to say that I'm glad to see Transformers live action feature and that I'm thrilled by all the cgi and the realism it portrayed but... I kinda expected it to be more serious and with depth. Autobots turnout to be like over-sized kids who play all the time, while Desepticons were to scary (maybe that's the good point). Other thing is that there were to many characters that play important roles but haven't been developed enough and yet to many scenes that were just a cgi show offs. Megatron turned out to be twice the size of Optimus, and Bumblebee is a Camaro? O.K. I understand that Volkswagen didn't gave their permission to use Beattle, but hey, why are Autobots modeled after American cars only? Another cheap patriotism trick, or good marketing. I hope that we will see some more serious plot lines and less ""kids play"" in the sequel that will surely follow."

","For all those who don't believe this film is good, think about the tight line the director and scriptwriter have to tread when creating a film with such a steeped history and so many fans. <br/><br/>Ill make my point very clear this is a recreational film, its for pure enjoyment. Don't criticize this film for a poor plot line and tedious characterizations because it was not made as a dramatical feature presentation. It was made purely to wow audiences with special effects and tell a story that is about 25 years old. You couldn't expect much from a plot line that old.<br/><br/>I agree the film has many plot holes poorly developed plot twists, but you have to take the good with the bad. This is a recreational film for not only those who grew up with this beloved cartoon/comic but everyone who likes a bit of action a special effects once in a while. For the the die hard fans it certainly pays homage to the original cartoon even using the original names and vehicle types of the transformers(Deceptacons and Autobots). Those of you who are thinking of watching this film, please watch this film without any expectations, a neutral outlook on its various cartoon predecessors, and just a little bit of background knowledge on what the films about(... and I don't mean a full history). <br/><br/>The less you expect from this film, the more surprised you will be."

If it wasn't him film wouldn't have been interesting in the first half also. Dialogs are very good and have been acted out pretty well. In the first half the seriousness and comical moments make the film interesting. Later it becomes very repetitive.

"Flower_of_the_Lily","8","0","1","5 August 2007"," Oscar nominee? Nope. Fun? Hell, yes!!
","Okay, let's get things straight here: 1) this is a film based on a cartoon, which in turn was based on a range of toys. 2) It's being directed by Michael Bay. If a thoughtful, well-written movie with much character development, suspense, and understated but gripping action sequences are what you want, save your money and go and see ""The Bourne Ultimatum"".<br/><br/>Right, now that's out of the way, let's focus on Transformers - it's by no means an award winner (except possibly for the CGI - more on this later). It's not going to join the ranks of the classics. But it is quite simply the most genuinely FUN film to hit screens this summer. It's plain, simple, crazy enjoyment.<br/><br/>After the mild disappointments of Spider-man 3, Shrek 3, the near ship-wreck of Pirates of the Caribbean 3, and the much improved but still rather lacklustre Fantastic Four 2, things were looking a bit dire on the blockbuster front in this summer's cinema, with only Bruce Willis managing to come up triumphant in Die Hard 4.0. That was, until this film came out. I never thought a Michael Bay film would prove the best surprise of the season, but hey, I've been wrong before.<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, Transformers is quite simply the most fun I've had in a cinema this summer so far. The plot's non-existent (it's tied to the hero's explorer great-grandfather who found a giant robot in the Artic and got the co-ordinates to a special weapon printed on his ... oh, never mind. Goodie robots fight baddie robots, humans get in the way. Finis.) The script veers between quite sharp and bombastic clunkiness. The acting (particularly among the older actors) is supremely hammy for the most part, though there are some exceptions. Quite a few secondary characters simply fall by the wayside as the film progresses. And it's terribly hokey in places (the heroic solider Captain Lennox has a baby daughter he's dying to hold for the first time - ought to be sweet but in fact prompts much eye-rolling).<br/><br/>So why is it so much fun? First and foremost, Shia LeBeouf, in a stroke of casting genius. He really is like a young Tom Hanks on screen - smart, effortlessly likable, and filled with boundless energy. In his hands, the character of Sam Witwicky, which could easily have descended into corniness or geek-turned-macho stereotype, becomes the lynchpin of the film. Then there's Sam's character - our hero is a plucky nerd who has an aptitude for talking himself out of a tight spot. He's a not quite ordinary young man who gets thrust into the most outrageous of situations and somehow manages to deal with it.<br/><br/>Then there are the Transformers. Words very nearly fail me - they are spectacular. The CGI is faultless - they look 100% real. You believe in them completely. And it's with them that Bay comes into his own. His forte is action, and this film has it in spadefuls. The on screen battles and action are just fabulous. End of.<br/><br/>The film's third main asset is a rich vein of humour and a little knowingness (it even manages to get in a few sly digs about Dubya's government). Sam Witwicky is the main proponent of this (LeBeouf proving a natural at comic timing) but it runs throughout the film. My only criticism is that it is perhaps a bit overdone at times.<br/><br/>Mix these together and the film somehow works. I'm not terribly sure how - apart from in the case of Sam Witwicky character development is minimal, although there's a nice little aside about the heroine Mikaela's criminal record. Plus despite the obvious fact she's there to add sex appeal, she does get down and dirty (ahem) in the fight scenes, going on the run with Sam and aiding good robot Bumblebee in the final battle. The only other character to fair nearly as well is Captain Lennox, played with aplomb by Josh Duhamel, who is basically there to kick the crap out of the bad robots and to look super-sexy doing it. He succeeds admirably, but manages to add a little more depth as he does it.<br/><br/>But in the end the film comes back to Sam Witwicky and his precious first car, which happens to turn into an alien robot. This is what we're most interested in - not what's happening in the Pentagon, or cracking codes, or government secrets. If anything, the film needed more of Sam and Bumblebee. What there was of these two was great, with Bumblebee functioning as Sam's protector and taking big risks to do it, and Sam becoming friends with and remaining loyal to his robot/car/new best friend. This plot strand could have been so much more - it's every little and not-so-little boy's dream. And probably that of a fair few girls as well. That something ordinary turns out to be extraordinary. And I'm not just talking about the car here.<br/><br/>So Michael Bay, if you're reading this, congratulations, you somehow made a great film with room to spare. And for the sequel that is sure to be in the works, forget the government, forget the military, just give us the robots and their humans. They're not only fun, they might just tug a heartstring or two."

","For those who like this type of movie it is two hours of action and entertainment pure. It is some kind of Alien Vs. Predator not pretending anything different than what presented. Special effects are amazing, especially the transforming ones and the idea of the film is also not bad. The hiding of the transformers with eventual destruction of the garden is funny, but their stupid way of talking and behaving is so typical of a certain country in the world. Typical clichés are presented (cars, romantic sunrise etc.). However talking about live cars, the beetle was much more original. The way the protagonist gets to know her is not very convincing. They could have done something more creative. All in All this movie is typical American, some kind of fast food movie, no substance and a lot of artificial effects."
"sunny_ahir","8","0","1","2 August 2007"," Its a ""O.K."" movie.
","This movie was an excellent one with a varied cast, but the film makers left a lot of details out. It went from showing one thing to another and it seemed as though the director forgot about what happened in the movie in the last scene- It went from showing a robot attacking humans to another scene leaving you asking what happened to the robot? The movie had a pretty diverse cast with actors from all over and it had its shares of laughs. It has nice GM vehicles and very great special effects as well as its shares of explosions too. All in all it is an enjoyable movie with a lot of humor mixed in but they should have done a better job directing it."
"Merklin","5","0","2","2 August 2007"," Watchable , but not without its problems....
","Transformers is a mixed bag. For every great moment, there's something corny and annoying to counteract it, resulting in a patchy viewing experience that's watchable but filled with flaws that stop the film from being first rate.<br/><br/>The transformers themselves look amazing; they are well realised visual effects that are stunning to watch. But whenever they're not on screen (which, sadly, is often) you have to sit through a holey plot that focuses on tons of one dimensional soldier and geeky hacker characters who do not need to be there. The only interesting human characters are the witwicky family who are a likable, quirky bunch .If the transformers and the witwickys were the main focus of the movie then things would be a lot easier on the attention span .<br/><br/>What's great about the film is its sense of humour, the jokes are well timed and hit their mark perfectly (although some of the humour is unintentional).Even the autobots are in on the chuckles (look out for what bumble bee does to john tutorro) .<br/><br/>Surprisingly, things are a bit disappointing on the action side of things. Sure, there are huge action sequences but they are so poorly shot and edited that you'll have to squint to see them . You'd think that Michael bay would want the audience to have a clear uninterrupted view of the millions of dollars worth of robot action on screen , but puzzlingly he does the exact opposite and decides to shoot almost every action sequence with violently shaky, amateurish camera work. Not recommended for anyone with motion sickness......<br/><br/>Transformers is filled with annoying and unnecessary bits but it's a watchable film with great visual effects and a welcome sense of humour."

","Damn you Michael Bay and Damn your Transformers Movie!!!! I finally saw the film today. The whole thing, front to back, all the way through and on the big screen. I sat down prior to the film with my big Icee and Whoppers prepared to hate every gut wrenching second of it. (it should be noted here that I bought tickets to the film Live Free or Die Hard which was a totally awesome movie I saw already and then walked into Transformers) There is no way it could be good. It's Michael Bay. He only makes crappy mainstream formula movies.<br/><br/>*sigh* Transformers is actually a good movie. I liked it. Not only did I like it, I really liked it. I'm the kind of person who admits when he's wrong and I was wrong in this instance. Michael Bay's style was actually perfect for this movie. It definitely brought out the big kid in me. If you were a fan of Transformers you just can't help but get all excited and get into the movie. Optimus Prime, Jazz, Ironhide, Bumblebee, Rachet, Starscream, Megatron, they're all here and it was fun to watch. Just plain fun.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, there was some stupid stuff in the movie. Some scenes were meant to be nothing but funny and they were trying too hard. And some things just don't make any sense. But Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox are the keys to the whole movie. They win you over, they make you care, and they carry the movie through some of the absurd parts.<br/><br/>Is Michael Bay a good director? I still say no. I hate his work actually. One good movie out of the dozens of others he's made doesn't make you a good director. But Transformers was a good movie and I really liked it. I can't believe I'm saying it, but it's true. In the hands of a better director this movie would have been great, but instead it's good. And it did win me over in the end. I didn't buy the ticket to the movie because I couldn't in good conscious let the film have my money, but in the end, I would have bought my ticket."

","i had high expectations of this movie, but its been somewhat of a disappointment, first of all the movie's pace is somewhat slow the first half of the movie. The plot is too standard in my opinion and predictable at times though the story did have some good parts in it. I didn't buy the Glasses idea, i think they could have come up with something way better as the same device. most of the dialog of the robots i found to be really uncreative especially the cheesy lines of megatron and optimus prime towards the end could have been better. The plot seemed to focus a lot on the human characters with not enough focus on the transformers themselves and their backstory.<br/><br/>the ending was good though as well as the CGI and it was funny at times, i just wish there had been more action and less drama. <br/><br/>all in all its a reasonably good movie but don't expect to see a great movie you would want to watch more then once."

","When I first entered the cinema, I thought this was going to be another childish, immature movie with a an amateur plot. I quickly thought again. Suddenly, we were flashed into a film, in which children, teenagers and adults would thoroughly enjoy. If you like action, adventure and thoughts far beyond the imagination, this film is definitely for you!! With occasional scenes of comedy, which give that extra touch to the film, this film definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. Typical life for teenagers is combined with fantasy and happenings in this remarkable movie. Some negative points include occasional glitches in special effects and some make-up mistakes. Overall, it is a must see film which I thoroughly enjoyed."

","I could have saved the price of admission by stringing a couple dozen tin cans together, swinging them around in a circle, throwing them up in the air and letting them come down on my head fifty times or so, pausing only to sneak an occasional look at the mean-looking lady down the block. She is over thirty, just as the girl who's supposed to be still in high school in this movie looks to be, but is probably a much better actress.<br/><br/>But then, who wouldn't be? <br/><br/>If you choose to do it my way, be very sure to swing those cans around really fast, so you'll be good and dizzy when they hit you in the head. That way, you'll experience the director's technique of constantly revolving the camera around the actors and the tin cans, whether it needs to be or not.<br/><br/>Hmm...

","Look, I was looking forward to this film, lots and lots. To a film nut movies like this are the meat on which we feast. I thought it could have been a lot better.<br/><br/>It was too long. It has a good pace but seems to wain towards the end. Michael Bay is not a great story director. He just likes blowing stuff up eg The Island which was going well till the middle when he realised that he hadn't blown anything up and then it was like he decided to make up for lost time and destroy everything that moved including the story. The fact that the only two women in it were hot as hell, im not complaining but it doesn't help the realism or gain the respect the film needed. The graphics were good but as with all big movies of late the graphic were wasted by the massively jerky and fast shots.<br/><br/>The morals were forced down your throat like a mother feeding their children vegetables. It was cringworty at some points. And the voice over at the start OH DEAR OH DEAR OH DEAR.<br/><br/>Apart from that there were some good points. Shia LaBoeuf was excellent and the relationship with his parents was very well done. The acting as a whole was pretty good with the script they had. The effects (when shot properly) were very impressive. And Optimus Prime, HE THE MAN."
"SkidMcCormick","7","0","1","28 July 2007"," Great fun, but could've been so much more...
","I saw Transformers today (in England) and thought I'd start off with...<br/><br/>The Good parts: For me, the first hour-and-a-bit is the best, because we get to know Sam Witwicky & Shia Labeouf's natural comic timing (I'm being followed by Satan's Camaro!) Bernie Mac's turn as an auto salesman was great and of course, those wonderful autobots! Loved how the gang were eventually introduced, particularly Ironhide's trigger-happy attitude and his willingness to assassinate Sam's parents! Thought Prime's attempt at humour wasn't bad but they should've kept him serious as he was in the cartoons & leave the laughs to Jazz & co (was it Jazz who bit the dust in the end?) For me, I loved Bumblebee who was probably the most emotive of the autobots. Mr & Mrs Witwicky were great comic relief & to a lesser degree, John Tuturro & was that Gary Cole in a beard??? Oh, the scene where the bots descend on Sam's house is hilarious! The bad parts: Megan Fox, who's good at pouting but definitely isn't a Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Sorry, but I can't believe her character would find Sam attractive in a million years. Why was the fight between Optimus & Bonecrusher short-lived? This was meant to be a money scene from the trailer, but guess I was wrong. Also, while there were gleeful exchanges of dialogue between Megatron & Prime (It's just you and me, Megatron! No, it's just me!!), nothing was fully explained as to why they hate each other so much. And poor Josh Duhamel, so good in Las Vegas, but very under-used as Capt Lennox (as well as the guy who plays Sucre in Prison Break). I felt that the last 20 minutes was just there for the hell of it and could've been broken up some more in the movie. Not sure about Optimus having a mouth that moves and were they going for a slightly human angle with him? This is a teen comedy that happens to have big, cool robots, but if you're going to pay homage to the Japanese fighting flicks like Godzilla vs King Kong, then at least show proper slam-bang action & destruction. They should make 2 more films and not the 5 as planned. If you're going to take a girl to see this, my advice is to wait and see The Bourne Ultimatum."

","Don't tell those robots that I told you this; they are very sensitive. Transformers is an adequate film adaptation. What it lacks in plot it makes up for in extraordinary animation and effects. It all begins on the premise that there are ancient intelligent robots out there in the universe, fighting a millennium long war. I trust that you already know this. It also begins as so many movies do, with a dude humiliating himself to impress a girl (Mikaela=Megan Fox), a real fox. Who didn't see that coming? <br/><br/>The plot of the film is minimal at best, a set of short stories haphazardly assembled into a dizzying adventure. It might have been the filmmaker's intention, to create a pseudo documentary. The script is also believable, with very little thought put into it as if the actors were winging it. Maybe they were? One thing that is unmistakable is that the effects will be unmatched for years to come. A solid 1/2."
"erikgloor","6","0","5","23 July 2007"," Beyond Brainless but Mostly Good Fun
","Let's face it, when working for Steven Spielberg, Michael Bay could make an entertaining movie about a guy peeling a potato. We're into some serious trade-craft with these guys. From effects to casting to pacing -- as something to take your mind off your troubles for a couple hours, you could do a lot worse than this spectacle based on a children's TV show.<br/><br/>The new Michael Bay film ""Transformers"" chronicles the adventures of a race of alien mechanical lifeforms and their human allies as they seek to deprive less enlightened Transformers of control over a magic cube that can turn a toaster into a terminator. Sound stupid? Oh, you bet it is.<br/><br/>But when a Blackhawk helicopter lands at a U.S. military base and then ""transforms"" into a giant lumbering robot that lays waste to everything in its path, with effects so realistic as to be eye-popping, the menace was palpable and frightening.<br/><br/>Along the way we get your standard boy-and-his-dog, boy-and-his-Camaro, come-from-behind Woody-Allenesque tale of some dippy nerd who manages to woo the hottest hottie away from the football jock in an earnest v. yearnless 2-scene battle of puny proportions a la every Hollywood script ever written.<br/><br/>But if you pair your giant killer robots up with an absurdly appealing Megan Fox as the hottie in question, you are gonna have a hard time making a movie 99 out of a hundred American men are not going to enjoy. And goofy though it was, I'd have to count myself among the 99. It was a good time at the movies and there's just no two ways about it.<br/><br/>Here's a few things I think they could have done differently:<br/><br/>First, the volume and mass of the robots seems off when they ""transform"" into vehicles and back again. When they're robots they seem much bigger than the vehicles they can turn into. If you stood a Camaro on end and give it some legs, it seems you'd only achieve half the height of the robot we're seeing. But I'm probably just being picky.<br/><br/>Second, I understand it's desirable to have expressive faces of some kind, but if these alien creatures can morph into roughly any manufactured piece of equipment, wouldn't they just grow speakers instead of anthropomorphic mouths with which to speak? Just splitting hairs, here.<br/><br/>Third, the processes and scope of evolution are probably far vaster than even our smartest smart guys can fathom but it seems HIGHLY dubious that a race of machines could evolve without, presumably, the impetus of some organic life form initiating it. But hey, I guess in a nearly infinite universe, the possibilities are similarly infinite.<br/><br/>And last but not least, these machine warriors, sadly, are probably playing heroes to a segment of the U.S. population's children growing up without a lot of moral or intellectual curiosity around them. These kids will grow up asking themselves what would ""Optimus Prime"" do when Billy from the trailer next door steals my Slurpee at the NASCAR trials. You know, when dad's passed out on Meth and mom's working her third job, kids face these dilemmas. And this is why you have to be careful with what you show these potential heroes doing and how they treat their enemies.<br/><br/>And THIS is why you probably don't want to include a scene in which, after subduing a group of humans, a giant robot pees on one of them by way of compelling cooperation. And though it's played for laughs, like it or not, this is a real way the coarsening of our culture happens -- one mean-spirited movie scene played-for-laughs at a time. It's funny when it happens to a bad guy in the movies. It's not so funny when you're being mugged or car-jacked and the perpetrator decides he'll throw in an homage to the latest Transformers film and starts unzipping his fly. State Farm can replace your Lexus, but not your dignity. Spielberg oughta know better.<br/><br/>Did I mention the movie has Megan Fox?"
"boggy1979","6","0","4","22 July 2007"," Flawed but excellent nonetheless..........
","I so badly wanted to give this film a ten. How could a story about huge transforming robots fighting be anything but cool. I know that sounds geeky but it's true.<br/><br/>Well the answer is that the transformers are, as expected, bit parts to the humans. Of course the human side needs to be told, it is easier to relate to humans than robots after all. Unfortunately there is little characterisation of either Autobots or Decepticons. Minor side plots for unimportant characters take up more time than the 'bots which in my mind weakened the story. On the plot side of things, the story is pretty weak and contrived but I wasn't expecting anything special.<br/><br/>Most summer blockbusters feel the need to cover all bases, action, love story etc. and Transformers falls into the same trap of adding poor childish and inappropriate humour. Making comedy characters out of Jazz and even Optimus at times doesn't work and had me shaking my head in disbelief. <br/><br/>Now you may be wondering why I scored this film eight out of ten as I keep slating it. The answer is simple, the subject matter is so good that it would have been hard to mess up. The grin that appears every time a 'bot transforms stays for ages. Every fight scene looks great if a little bit shaky. I'm not one to be wowed by fancy cgi and explosions but Bay has done well this time. There is a sense of size, bulk and power behind each Transformer that helps you feel every blow.<br/><br/>In spite of all the negative comments, I really enjoyed the film and I recommend it to every one. If you see it, see it in the cinema.<br/><br/>Now all we can hope is that the sequel concentrates on the title characters a bit more. After all that is what we all want to see the film for isn't it?"
"allan_traynor","4","0","4","22 July 2007"," An unbalanced movie delivering good and bad expectations
","Firstly, let's get the obligatory bit out of the way - yes I am a fan of G1 Transformers, however I was not expecting a direct adaptation, had given Bay the benefit of the doubt and had even come to like the new designs.<br/><br/>I expected a film with a lot of action, but little plot - as long as there was plenty of action, robots fighting and transformation. The film fell short in both departments - in action and in plot.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of action, however not consistently throughout the movie and in particular the very, very brief encounters with some of the Transformers compared to the length of time spent with 2-dimensional, cheesy human actors.<br/><br/>Whilst not expecting a good plot there are still expectations that there should be one, and certainly an action film should be remembered for its action sequences and not an analysis of the many gaping and open-ended plot holes. The film is very unbalanced leaving a lot of the expected action crammed into a 'suger rush' at the end, with a very long, drawnout and not very interesting hour or so sandwhiched between great action, good humour and character development. By the time the real action sequences came around I was so bored and disinterested I didn't actually care - a good plot needs to carry viewer empathy otherwise it's no better than a video game.<br/><br/>Bay's greatest problem with this was in trying to make the film credible and based on real physics as there are moments in this film that throw that whole concept out of the window, and the minute you stop 'believing' the film is when you see it is no more realistic or 'adult' than the cartoons. For such a simple, childish plot, why have it a 12a certificate? One or the other - is it for adults or for kids? In short, the robots are great but the plot is embarrassing. Hopefully the sequel will be better thought-out."
"kevin_crighton","7","0","1","21 July 2007"," brilliant CGI and action let down by an uneven script
","Transformers, based on the toys of the same name, has a very simple plot. The Autobots led by Optimus Prime square off with the Decepticons led by Megatron. Both are searching for something called the Cube. Their search and war brings them to earth, causing massive destruction. Earth's hope lies in a teen called Sam Witwicky, whose great-grandfather found something buried years earlier.....<br/><br/>Directed by Micheal Bay, this has everything you expect from one of his movies: camera's continually on the move, quick-fire editing, and LOUD action sequences. Probably the most surprising thing about it though is that apart from a couple of performances, it's very well acted. The cast, led by Shia LeBouf as Sam are pretty good. The only one who lets the acting side down is John Turturro, as a member of a secret operation known as Sector Seven. But Turturro's performance may be as a result of the script, which has an uneven tone through-out.<br/><br/>Let me explain. The movie opens with an attack on a US base in Quatar. It's a well shot and impressive opening, with Bay showing you the CGI transformers in action right from the start. The attack itself is brutal and kills just about everyone. Things calm down for awhile after that as various characters are introduced as the plot evolves. However at times during these moments there is some humour that is at odds with the intensity of the action. Don't get me wrong. Humour in an action movie is always a good thing, but here it's the wrong type of humour. The sequence at Sam's house as he searches for an item that the Autobots need, while they wait outside is the case in point. This is more slapstick humour than, say the humour of a movie like The Rock (another Bay movie), where the dialogue was funny . This brings me back to Turturro. His performance as the agent of Sector Seven tries to be comedic, but it feels like it should be in another movie. A Men In Black approach to Sector Seven would have been better, and funnier than what we get here.<br/><br/>The action when it explodes on screen is spectacular. Be it the opening sequence at the airbase in Quatar, to the final battles in the city they are all very impressive, as is the visual CGI by Industrial Light and Magic. The way the human actors blend in with the CGI is stunning, putting them right in the middle of the transformer battles raging round them.<br/><br/>The faults with the movie, which as I said lie with the script, are not fatal. For it's running time it's enjoyable, never dull and like all Micheal Bay movies looks stunning, even during the scenes of destruction! The ending leaves the way open for potential sequels. If they can get the tone of the script right, they could have a brilliant follow-up to what is a good summer blockbuster."

","I waited a week before heading to see the Transformers. I have to give it 6 out of 10. First because it was freaking hard to actually enjoy the fighting scenes because they were so out of focus ( The movie was clear and sharp until the fighting scenes) They moved to fast and from one side of the screen to the other. As a fan I could not appreciate the action at all. Secondly, the plot was really bad, nothing to do with what we grew up (I understand is a new era but at least make the story interesting) And finally too many dumb ass jokes, what was the director thinking? Would had rather waited to see on DVD than to waste money in the theater. Just another average movie, this summer has really been a let down. Hopefully for the sequel they improve the plot and make it a more part of the story than just fancy graphics."

","I braved the torrential rain last night to go see the UK midnight screening of Transformers. But the real thunder was inside the theatre.<br/><br/>First, off ignore the snotty critics who have an issue with the premise. Anyone who goes to see a Transformers movie should be ready for metallic brawls and cheesy dialogue. The film gets off to a rip-roaring start, settles down into the story and closes with an extended smackdown between Autobots and Decepticons.<br/><br/>The special effects are astounding and will surely bag an Oscar next year, whilst the main performances from Shia LeBeouf and Peter Cullen were brilliant. Fans will be pleased to see various elements in tact from the cartoon. Bumblebee and Sam/Spike's special friendship is the main success at the heart of the film. Also, the Autobot dialogue is pretty much lifted from the cartoon with Megatron and Prime taunting and exchanging dialogue during their climactic fight.<br/><br/>The humour was spot-on although it felt more forced as the film got down to business. Typical Bay-isms were all present and correct, which leads me to my main criticism. The action was at times disorientating and hard to distinguish. Transformers dive past the camera so quickly that it spoils an otherwise flawless sequence.<br/><br/>If anyone was left disappointed by the lack of Decepticon footage, then I'm sure the inevitable sequel will up the stakes. All in all, the film did exactly what it set out to do and I have no issue with that."
"starlit-sky","4","0","3","20 July 2007"," a typical Michael Bay movie
","Too much action and not enough character or story development. Michael Bay seems to think that if he shoots impressive action sequences (like he did in Pearl Harbour for example) then he thinks the movie will work. But it doesn't. Typically, his movies begin with people trying to connect sexually-there is always some reference to that (this is almost traditional - see Armageddon and Pearl Harbour). I can tell that almost every Michael Bay movie will have some sort of love/romance in the beginning. OK, it is a big part of life but the way Michael Bay presents it is so typically Hollywoodish and unoriginal. I don't like the way filmmakers throw romance in every movie nowadays. It seems they feel like they have to include romance as if it is an obligation. That's why, it feels completely unnatural and unconvincing. Same comments apply to the humor in the movie (so cliché and predictable). I haven't seen the Transformers cartoon or read the comic book so I cannot comment on that but this movie seemed to me unoriginal and poorly constructed piece of cinema without any real value except for visual effects, which is why I gave 4 out of 10."
"the_rattlesnake25","6","0","1","19 July 2007"," Transformers: Roll Out The Money!
","While the acting is lifeless and the script is stale, the real gem in this movie is in Michael Bay's way in which he can magically orchestrate the use of CGI into a visually stunning and mesmerizing spectacle bringing out the small child wriggling inside every adult that goes to see Bay's overblown, massive and hugely lucrative blockbuster 'Transformers'.<br/><br/>'Transformers' is every young boy and young man's dream (or wet dream in some cases) as the film focuses on the generic line of aliens crash landing on Earth and doing battle in the heart of America with the obligatory interference from the US Military and all their gadgets at there disposal. Based on the television series and the popular Hasbro line of toys, 'Transformers' see's the good 'Autobots' and evil 'Decepticons' face off against each other, while Shia LeBeouf (Sam Witwicky), one of the most sought after actors on the Hollywood circuit at the moment, try's to impress local bad-girl Mikaela (Megan Fox) with his beaten-down '76 Chevy Camero which mysteriously changes into a robot during the night to make contact with other UFO's via laser beam.<br/><br/>While Sam stumbles around trying to impress Mikaela, with his Camero not helping playing the right song at the right time with ""Baby Come Back by Player"" being played as Mikaela leaves the car after it stalls, he is also caught in the middle of the largest robotic battle on Earth, with all the planet's hopes being placed in his small nerdy hands. However the relationship falters, as there is little passion or connection in the relationship between the two seemingly distant characters who seem to have the emotional connection of a recently divorced couple until the final scene, where a minimal connection can be seen and believed between the character's, a good two hours too late.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in the Middle Eastern country Qatar, American soldiers (Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson) come under attack by an robot which transforms from a Military helicopter into one mean and vicious piece of steel, that destroys anything in it's path while trying to steal 'classified' files from the computers of the United States Department of Defence, leading to the Secretary of Defence John Keller (Jon Voight) calling a press conference and all the available technology and analysts at his fingertips. Like Josh Duhamel (Captain Lennox), Bay fails to bring Voight to life at all, however some may see this as making an even more believable politician in the age of deceit and deception. However the script also leaves little lee-way for the actors themselves, as it's as simple and streamlined as possible, showing that the action takes centre stage over everybody else.<br/><br/>Sam's connection to the robots, is due to discovery one of his ancestors made and piece of his memorabilia he has in his care, which the 'Decepticons' (or evil robots) will need to find the 'All Spark' or the big-energy-cube that would the universe go, with quite a loud bang, kaboom! Sam's '76 Camero is one of the good guys, an 'Autobot' known as Bumblebee who along with the 'Autobot' leader Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) have taken base on Earth to stop Megatron leader of the 'Decepticons' and his cronies from destroying Earth with a fair bit of opposition in the way.<br/><br/>Unlike Michael Bay's earlier films ('Armageddon'), there's a subtle political undertone running through out this film sometimes making it feel like a George Bush speech circa 2001, with both Russia and China originally being blamed for the attack on the US, providing speculation the Cold War is still alive and the heroic portrayal of the United States Air Force, and their help and patriotic nature in the fight, making it look more like a video for 'Uncle Sam And Iraq 2007' rather than a fight between alien forces and man, something which Bay touches upon in the majority of his films, something tells me he's quite proud to be an America.<br/><br/>Everybody viewing the film knows the actors are just 'extras' in a hugely spectacular and stunning CGI-mad mega-fight between large, intimidating robots in a live-or-die affair to save the fate of the universe and while the acting and script, which were never Michael Bay's strong points detracted from the film, nothing could stop me from grinning from ear to ear like a little boy who got caught with his hand in the cookie-jar as the stunning final fight sequence took place and my enjoy-o-meter exploded."

","This film will make guys wonder why dramas are even a movie genre, and females (and most males) will appreciate the witty script and great performances by LaBeouf, Julie Dunn, and Kevin White (the latter two play parents of the young human hero). A few plot holes (if the All Spark is raw power, then why the lame ending to Megatron and Prime's battle?) will anger ardent fans of the TV show, but everyone has known that plot holes are flaws of 98.9% of action movies since they were ten. The last battle is in crowded L.A., so the Transformers kind of blend in with the set design--watch it closely or you'll miss a few bullets. What also bugged me was the rapid camera pacing in battles; ten camera changes in seconds made it hard to determine the fights' progress. What would have made this movie great is if Bay didn't reveal the robots right away, adding to the movie a magic that made the child in most of us love the show in the first place. Great fun that will satisfy both sexes."

","I grew up watching Transformers. Absolutely love the series. But with this movie, I fell in love all over again with the franchise.<br/><br/>The Transformers were awesome. Their movement were real and believable. Though their design have changed, which might have been a disappointment for the hard cores. But i felt that it was okay, and it was for the better.<br/><br/>The jokes and funny moments were easy to understand. I love Bumblebee's comical act during the part at Sam's house. It got me laughing out loud.<br/><br/>The action throughout the movie was great. I was at the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>The storyline were also better than that of the series. This time around, the Transformers have a really good reason to be here on earth. It was engaging and easy to follow.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie have all the great elements in it. Awesome CGI, storyline and action mixed together to FORMS a great movie.<br/><br/>Another thing is, I'm looking forward for the sequel as i've heard that it might include the planet eating, UNICRON.. I'm really wondering how they are going to achieve that!! <br/><br/>Till then, Autobots, roll out!!! Haha.. Love that line!!! Chow!!!"
"silverstormprod","9","0","2","18 July 2007"," Worth the hype.
","TRANSFORMERS was worth the hype. It is a Summer popcorn action movie. And, as such, it delivers exactly what you want to see. There is humor, wild action, special effects, a story, a compelling main character and a well driven pace. Plus, it was just cool. In that, it reminds me of another fun film I saw recently called AWAKEN THE DEAD. AWAKEN THE DEAD is a wildly independent lower budget horror film but, like TRANSFORMERS, it delivers within the parameters of expectations. Go watch them both. And, while you are at it, check of the Vengeance trilogy by Park Chan Wook (OLDBOY, SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE, and LADY VENGEANCE. Wook is a growing power in cinema. And, if you still need recommendations, check out LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD. Again, just for fun."

","Standing in a crowded line waiting to watch Transformers yesterday, I had come prepared to see what Micheal Bay had transformed my childhood favorites into (pardon, the pun) Now as an adult I know that as a kid I also liked to eat candy that looked like worms. So looking back I know very well that the series looked much cooler then trying to digest them as adult now.<br/><br/>Apart from that, I believe that that 8.0 user rating you see (on 17-07-07) will melt before your very eyes in the coming period and here's why; as you may know, Micheal Bay usually makes up for what he lacks in storyline with special effects and American patriot propaganda. In this case, the perfect choice if you want a cartoon to look like a real movie and if you want it to appeal for a war-tired/teen American audience. <br/><br/>Unfortunately for Micheal Bay the rest of the world has yet to judge it too. I also think it is people who have been counting the days till the release of this movie who have been grading it so well. The rest of us did not bother to get in those long lines just yet. To be honest though, it does transcend the cartoon series...but just by the skin of it's teeth. Which is the best way of looking at it because looking at it in a different way, it will be a total suckfest. <br/><br/>Script: Thin as a sheet. Ironically, it almost felt like I was back in the eighties when I watched this movie. Tiresome Americans (military) saving the world with guns blazing with big breasted women running around screaming and guys getting blown away all over the place...by robots. <br/><br/>Direction: Sugar-rushed paced. It's a shame that Micheal Bay still does not understand that action is defined by the moments of quiet in between. In the action, things get very confusing during fights but you do get the notion of the sheer size, weight and power of the transformers. <br/><br/>Special effects: Very good. The fact that computer graphics always have a plastic and synthetic like feel to them works very well in this case of course. The Transformers look perfectly real in the movie. Although, who has ever seen giant robots walking around?<br/><br/>Acting: Mediocre. Unfortunately Micheal Bay tries to appeal to all audiences with the strange effect that you get very clownesque or very serious acting. I did get a great feeling of nostalgia to hear to Peter Cullen do the original voice of Optimus Prime but, as with all the actors, I cringed with the bad lines they put out there. <br/><br/>Maybe James Cameron next time. He's got a thing with robots... 6 out of 10"
"Buddy-51","7","0","4","16 July 2007"," when humor trumps even special effects
","The thing that strikes you the most while watching the movie ""Transformers"" is not how spectacular its special effects are or how ferociously its action sequences come across on screen, but rather how very FUNNY so much of the movie manages to be. After having sat stone-faced through many of the alleged ""comedies"" foisted upon us in recent months - ""Evan Almighty,"" ""License to Wed,"" even ""Shrek the Third,"" to name just a few - I'm pleased to announce that I laughed quite a bit throughout the course of ""Transformers"" - and I do mean good-sized belly-laughs, not mere titters or snickers. Prime credit for that obviously goes to screenwriters, Roberto Orci and Ales Kurtzman, but I would be remiss if I didn't also acknowledge Shia LaBeouf's contributions in this regard. In this his first certified blockbuster, LaBeouf finally achieves the superstardom he's been steadily heading towards the past several years.<br/><br/>As everyone already knows, ""Transformers"" is based on a phenomenally successful line of Hasbro toys as well as the animated series derived therefrom. Transformers are giant robots from outer space who have the ability to metamorphose into the shape of virtually any everyday mechanical device - cars, cell phones, boom boxes etc. - they so desire. In the film, the transformers have just arrived on earth in search of a mysterious box that has the power to create an army of such robots that, given unbridled freedom, would be able to take over the world. Some of the transformers have evil intentions while others have an affinity for mankind and do their best to keep us out of the clutches of the bad guys. LaBeouf plays Sam Witwicky, a brainy, perpetually tongue-tied (especially when he's trying to impress the unreachable girl of his dreams) social outcast whose father agrees to help him buy a rundown Camaro that, unbeknownst to either of them, is actually a good transformer in disguise just waiting for Sam to become his owner.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that, on a strictly technical level, the transformers have made a stunning transition to the live action format. There are brief moments when they appear a trifle fake, but director Michael Bay keeps the action moving along at such a dizzying pace, that we rarely have time to notice that flaw. I'm not one who normally goes in for Bay's cuisinart style of movie-making - near-subliminal quick cuts mixed in with endless explosions and rafter-rattling sound effects - but I think it works quite well in this instance. He's also blessed in having LaBeouf as his lead actor, for it is LaBeouf's non-threatening All-American Boy looks and wide-eyed innocence that give the movie the emotional grounding it needs to be more than just the lumbering mechanical creation it could easily have become without him. In fact, whenever he isn't on screen, the movie does, indeed, threaten to devolve into just the standard popcorn action movie filled with jaw-dropping special effects but minus a heart or soul (the transformers themselves are never very interesting as characters and they are stuck mouthing sappy platitudes whenever they do get a chance to speak). But LaBeouf brings to the movie the human dimension it needs to keep our interest.<br/><br/>Kevin Dunn and Julie White are thoroughly delightful as Sam's well-meaning but utterly befuddled parents, while Bernie Mac and Anthony Anderson also score high on the laughter meter. For purposes of gravitas, movie veterans Jon Voight and John Turturro are also along for the ride.<br/><br/>And quite a ride it turns out to be, I must say. ""Transformers"" has pretty much everything a modern-day blockbuster needs to be successful. But it is the rare good humor with which the movie plays its hand that is so completely unexpected - and so very much appreciated in this quarter."
"samuelthemovieman","7","0","2","16 July 2007"," Congratulations Mr. Bay
","Through observation, it seems the modern summer moviegoer doesn't care about corny dialouge and mediocre acting, but only about being being thrilled and entertained and being blown away by extravagant special effects. In this case, Michael Bay has created the perfect summer movie. He doesn't let one moment get boring, and even though I have never been a transformers fan, I couldn't help but be thrilled when a blue and red truck transformed and uttered the words ""I am Optimus Prime."" The action sequences are breathtaking and the final half an hour does not disappoint. After god knows how many movies that were just plain bad, Michael has made fine, check-your-brain-at-the-door, entertainment for millions. Congradgulations."

","Having not grown up w/ the toon or the toys-that was a good 10 years after my time, ya know? I donno 'Barricade' from 'Starscream' from 'Ironhide'. Seriously I don't. Reagan era war-toys ala this and GIJoe etc were just the DIC-studio produced junk Hasbro stuck down kids throats while I was in College. Nothing more, no interest here.<br/><br/>But I do like Michael Bay's movies ala Armageddon and the Rock, so--I thought I would check this out. It really does work more than it doesn't-I liked the set-up of Shia's character, I liked Bumbleboogie there, and it was fun to watch John Voigt doing his crusty politico thing. All well and good.<br/><br/>You can't tell the Bots apart though, to be honest-they DO look like walking junkpiles, save for Prime there. That one I do remember just because. They did a decent job w/ him. The much maligned 'sneaking around the house' bit-that was funny. I liked it, showed some humour and character. They if anything needed to slow things up like this later on so you could follow the action.<br/><br/>And that's where I did have some problems. Megatron/zoid there is a baddie, but not really introed as such the way you'd like. I couldn't tell his cronies apart-if you didn't watch the show as a kid regular, how could you know 'Starscream' or 'Bonecrusher'? One was a copter and one a cop car, I guess.<br/><br/>The fights-really chaotic, lots of action, convincing to a point. You can't tell what robot is doing to the other robot though, it would behoove Bay to pull the camera back some, and for them to be better differentiated next time out. What we got wasn't bad though.<br/><br/>Shia was good, the girl easy on the eyes but a flat actress, Turturro embarrassing but then it IS a broadly etched Toon-based flick we're seeing here, he knew it and there ya be. Bay fills this w/ his trademark familiar faces, names (COL SHARP!), music and sunset-drenched stuff. For the most part it does work.<br/><br/>Do watch it in a theatre to get the full effect, don't expect anything beyond action, some product placement and sledgehammer level 'subtlety' throughout. It's a decent time over-all, sure.<br/><br/>**1/2 outta **** or so, has potential in the sequels to be better."

I didn't hear the cool Transformer sound. There was sound but not that classic sound we all know. The toy line seems to lack this as well. Overall I loved sharing this movie with my son. I loved the Transformers as a kid and I love it that he is just as excited about it. His favorite is Bumblebee. Mine was too but I like the classic Bumblebee. Don't get me wrong the Camero is cool but I miss the Volkswagen Beetle. If you are looking for a fun movie with lots of explosions and cool graphics this movie is a good one to see.

","Let me paraphrase my summary theme. I remember a lot of pioneers films who leaded a totally new era by the aid of digital camera, CG, etc..There are many movies which deserves to be called a ""landmark""in SiFi movies. For example, E.T. Starwars, T2..As time goes by, it appears that computer graphic technology gets much more core things in making films more and more....Now nothing is impossible in the name of CG. making thousands of mob(Lord of the rings), completely complicated battle scene(Matrix), and much more.. Now what remains in the sketch note of the CG designers?now it is definite that Hollywood keep their eyes on making cartoons REAL. Spiderman, Gozilla, X-man..and finally , Transformer. The first impression of this movie to me is, perfect realization of Japanese animation which I am so familiar since young.<br/><br/>Motive is very much like classical Jap. animations(Steelman No.28, Gundam,etc..)Boy, and gigantic android with transformation capability, and romance...so classical.<br/><br/>Seeing this movie, from start to end I could not resist myself feeling as if I had been seeing an animation. Again, CG is now cooler than animation movie. And, CG takes already too much room in Movie business and structure, so CONTENTS of the work is behind that. Whether this movie's plot is good or bad, earth-breaking CG makes this film almighty."

Talk about a shameless marketing plug Hasbro placed quite a few of their toy lines in the film, for what reason. They already a giant CG toy line come to life. How many cliché lines can Bay fill a movie with, that might be the Bay's true goal. Maybe one of his future movies will have actual actor dialog to replace the 30 second TV commercial dialog that just inundates this entire movie. Why did Michael Bay insist on putting lips on Prime even though he rarely spoke it seemed like none of the Transformers rarely spoke. Bay have you heard of character development. But the battles between the bots were cool. Its still a watchable movie. One shall stand, one shall fall.But why couldn't Bay take the fall."
"quikbdr720","9","0","2","5 July 2007"," i've waited all summer to be blown away, and now i have been!!! PLOT SPOILERS
","so there have been some good movies out this summer, but so far this year the ""blockbusters"" just haven't given me a total rush. the last time i was blown away was definitely star wars episode 3. but after seeing transformers, i was absolutely blown away. Michael bay has always released entertaining movies, but usually dumb movies with overblown action scenes and poor plots (ahem...pearl harbor), with the exception of The Island. this movie however, was yes, an action movie, but one that is very true to the transformers cartoon. while the autobots and decepticons went through some ""transformations"" (no VW beetle or Porsche, instead replaced with a sweet Pontiac solstice and the bangin new 2008 camaro!!!), it was meant only to update an 80's classic into what now doubt will be come a 2000's classic. transformers has it all to transform now adults who loved the cartoon into teens again, i can't say kids because this movie is more than a kids movie. you have the smoking' hot Megan fox, shia lebouf's love interest in the movie and some sexual innuendo but nothing over the top, then you have the entrance of the transformers, WOW! i have never seen such realistic visual effects, HONESTLY, and i have seen every effects packed movie out there, you seriously cannot tell the difference between the live action and the CGI, ILM totally outdid themselves, creating a believable alien race.<br/><br/>SOME PLOT SPOILERS!!! SOME PLOT SPOILERS!!!! the plot even was above acceptable for a Bay action flick, sticking very true to the cartoon again by having the Cube get lost here on earth and having Megatron come looking for it, only to be trapped until Leboufs grandfather accidentally discovered him. years later, lebouf is out buying his first car (and after a hilarious cameo from Bernie mac) buys his '78 camaro which turns out to be bumblebee, sent to protect Sam (lebouf) from megatron.<br/><br/>the movie is jam packed with what we expect from Michael bay, awesome action scenes, by far the best seen this year or even in the past few years (the final battle is at epic proportions), the chemistry between the characters is very well done, Jon voight's performance is stellar as we can expect from him, being the veteran actor in this movie, but i have also finally been very impressed with lebouf's performance, he brings about a new maturity, and also a great sense of humor to the movie, something that i believe will finally bring him out of his Disney acting and break him out onto the Hollywood scene, the hacker scenes are hilarious the bads??? well, only 2 actually, Megan fox is mad hot, but lacks, well, lacks acting basically as her performance was wooden to say the least, and there was way to much technical jargon that would even give bill gates a headache, but otherwise, this movie is destined to be 2007's blockbuster and should go on to become a classic in years to come (AND SPAWN SEQUELS???? bay has announced the possibility), in all, this movie is a definite 9/10, and definitely Michael Bay's best to date.

I can accept the fact that these things can do super human type things or unrealistic type things. But when humans start doing stunts that just aren't realistic at all, I just start to lose a bit of my interest. Some of the lines and scenes just seemed completely awkward or un-needed. The script could have been a little cleaner and a few scenes could have been left out (i.e. tooth-fairy) The movie is pretty long too, or at least it seemed like it. I love going to the movies and sitting down for a long time and soaking up the excitement, but in this case I thought it might have dragged on a little too far. This really didn't have too much of an effect on my rating, but I thought I'd throw it in.<br/><br/>I'm glad I saw this movie (more like got forced to from all the hype).

Michael Bay has brought us a formidable adaption with the best CGI money can buy and crunched out a story that isn't too corny for the average viewer and which also combines great action and special effects with tons of silly humour which prevents the film, in all its massiveness, from becoming horrifically dull.<br/><br/>The film also has a well executed human-story, but by the end of it you kinda realise that this stuff was really intended for the kids.

If you are a true Transformers fan, a fan of the original 1986 movie and even more so of the 1984 animated series, then you will be highly disappointed by the movie. The humans of the movie are very ""strong"" and are able to fight against 70 foot robots. In the original series, the humans say a couple of phrases like thank you Optimus Prime and are not included in the fighting. The only good part of the movie was the action scenes in the end when the transformers actually fight against each other but these actions are very few and far between. Shia LeBeouf cracks many jokes which I don't find funny but the many 11 year olds that were able to sneak into this movie laughed hysterically. All of my friends ripped their ticket stubs in half."
"crumpton23","6","0","3","7 July 2007"," Not Pleasantly Surprised
","I have a few memories of the original cartoon growing up, and I liked it. I am not a huge fan, so I went in only remembering the names of Optimus Prime and Megatron. The special effects were very good. The fight scenes for the most part were well-staged with a big exception. Many of the autobot versus decepticon fights were difficult to follow or enjoy. The movie was building up to a big fight between the two aforementioned leaders, but right as the fight started it cut away to more stuff with the soldiers. By the time we rejoin Optimus Prime and Megatron, the fight was nearly over. For a director whose main trademark is staging actions scenes, this left a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>I went into the movie knowing pretty much what to expect. That is not to say I was prejudging the movie, but you don't see a Michael Bay film for character development. The storyline was a jumbled mess. We followed way too many story arcs throughout the film, and the only interesting one was Sam and Bumblebee. The movie seemed to forget about the fight involving John Turturro and Anthony Anderson at the end. Why did the army/sector 7 intentionally lead the Decepticons to a major city for the final confrontation? They put a lot of people at risk for no particular reason. Why was Sam entrusted with carrying around the cube during the climactic scenes? It made sense to involve the hero in this way, but shouldn't one of the autobots been carrying it? How did Sam understand how to use the cube at the end, when he killed Megatron? A lot of time I think about these questions after the movie, when I am discussing it with friends. These jumped out at me during the movie, and they hampered my ability to enjoy it.<br/><br/>I love mindless action popcorn flicks, but this movie had a lot of problems. It was miles ahead of Armageddon and Pearl Harbor, but it missed the mark in a big way. I did like Starscream quite a bit though."

","I found Transformers a mixed bag, sure I loved the special effects, I thought the actors handled their cotton candy roles well, the pacing was decent in places, but the ""director"" good old Michael Bay #$@#ed another movie up. From the start there is a lot to like about the Transformers, Shia Lebouff is very good as Sam the movies protagonist, the aforementioned special effects are dazzling, and the movie moved at a brisk clip, but it is the fight scenes that sink this movie. The reason I hate Michael Bay is his reliance on quick cuts. I love to absorb an action scene, to see the chaos of the situation like pure ballet, if I directed this movie you would see fists flying, gears popping, and slow explosions galore. With Bay you get a flash in the pan, a scene shot with so much disorientation that it is hard to tell what the f$#$ is going on. <br/><br/>SPOILERS There is one scene in particular with Optimus Prime fighting the police car Transformer and we barely see the fight, in fact Bay cuts out most of the fight. We see the aftermath of the fight sure, but we don't get to see the fight itself, and isn't that the reason we all put our money down in the first place. SPOILERS END In summary it is a shame this movie doesn't flop outright, and the Prince of Persia doesn't follow it into shame, while this movie hardly deserves to flop its demise might rid us of Michael Bay once and for all.

","I'm going to do what few have done--I'm going to review the movie, not the director, or the plot holes, or the fact that it's derived from an 80's cartoon genre. I'm going to review THIS MOVIE! <br/><br/>The good -- The CGI, fight scenes, and transformations were beautiful. You truly believe that huge robots are turning into vehicles and back again. During the fight scenes, the robots interact seamlessly with their environment. The human acting wasn't too bad either. All the MAIN human characters did well overall and were developed well. They also responded well to the robots who wouldn't ""be there"" during filming.<br/><br/>The bad -- All PURPOSEFUL attempts at humor were freaking awful! I moaned much more than I laughed, it was really pathetic, so don't watch this movie for any comedy relief. There were some funny moments, but they were more accidental than planned. My biggest complaint is that, aside from Prime (played PERFECTLY by the great Peter Cullen), none of the other robots had much of a chance to either speak or show their personality other than their endless butt-kicking. I know it was 2 1/2 hrs, but more could have been done to show the personality of the robots other than Prime.<br/><br/>Summation -- The humans were there for acting and the robots for fighting. If you see this movie expect something like Starship Troopers, only this time some of the bugs are on our side. My opinion is, if the personalities of the robots would have been taken 1/2 as seriously as the people, this movie would have been excellent. Next time they should let the voice actors develop their characters before making the second movie, then they can have more lines for the robots. Only expect a good performance from Prime, all other characters were wooden and underdeveloped.<br/><br/>7/10 for a good effort, it's worth seeing ONCE just for the action. If you're not into huge, beautifully detailed, sentient robots beating each other senseless, it's NOT for you. And no, you don't have to have seen the 80's cartoon to enjoy it."
"jjthmpsn","6","0","1","7 July 2007"," A Mixed Bag - A Transformer Fan Review
","I came to a summer matinée blockbuster not expecting much, but rewarded far beyond my expectations. Transformers is a pleaser on many fronts. Main favorite characters are there, in pseudo-recognizable form, and many of the personality traits of the beloved television characters are there, as well as the voices. The movie is genuinely funny at times, and I am hard to please. The interaction between the humans and the Transformers is artfully written and acted. However, to my supreme disappointment, neither Starscream's voice (Cobra Commander) nor Megatron's voice is similar to the old series (Optimus', however...awesome). However their personalities and especially one-liners seem ripped from the comic book. If any of you out there are Starscream fans, you'll love the stuff he says. =) The cons: 1. No Soundwave. They have one of the little guys (Frenzy, I think) doing Soundwave's part as intelligence engineer. 2. No Shockwave. 3. No Ultra Magnus. 4. Too many ridiculously hot chicks. I mean, there's such a thing as a good amount, and then there's too much. 5. OBVIOUSLY Military funded! The entire movie is a 2 hour recruiting spot for the U.S. Army, filled with pro-war slogans, like ""No Sacrifice, No Victory,"" and ""You're a Soldier Now! You HAVE to do it!,"" and ""For These Guys (soldiers), Losing's Not an Option!"" It reminds me of Starship Troopers. Planes and tanks are destroyed, but only one actual soldier is seen dying, after a 3 minute battle between a detachment of Rangers and a downsized Skorpicon. Somehow, they are capable of holding off a 20-ton armor plated robot firing plasma wave cannons and heat seeking missile packs while hiding behind sandstone walls in Iraq and using hand grenades and M-16 fire. Gimme a break, kids. (The military stuff is the biggest downside, not that I don't support the troops, but I don't support the Iraq war, or war in general, and I don't think it's a good thing in any movie to make war appear to be anything other than what it really is. See Saving Private Ryan, that's the truth about war.) The whole military thing is the biggest drawback, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Other than that stuff, awesome!"

","So I went along last night to see this film. Incidentally, if you can get to see a DLP screening of it, do, the digital projection is awesome.<br/><br/>So, I thought the acting was OK, the plot mediocre, but the effects beyond anything I have ever seen.<br/><br/>However, as a kid who grew up obsessed with transformers, and would probably be able (I know, I don't need you to tell me how sad I am) to recite the lines of the 1986 movie from heart I've seen it so often, I was disappointed at the god-awful plot and this is the reason for my OK-kinda good score.<br/><br/>There is light at the end of the tunnel however.<br/><br/>I understand that most people going to see this movie now would not be as familiar with the transformers as I am, and so launching them into the plot of the original movie would be far too complex and confuse too many people.<br/><br/>I have a theory, or rather a theory borne on a wish. I am hoping, taking a long view of this, that these transformers movies will end up being a trilogy, with the last movie being the re-make that I would so love to see.<br/><br/>The best thing about this theory is that the plot and some of the dialogue is already written, you just need to update it, take out the original jokes and replace them, and (sadly - I don't want to say this) replace the 80's cock-rock soundtrack with whatever today's equivalent is, and you've got yourself one fine movie.<br/><br/>So if it happens - you heard it here first!

","Transformers (2007) ***<br/><br/>Perhaps its the kid in me. Perhaps its the kid I was; back when I adored the Transformers cartoons and toys. Whatever it is, its not because Michael Bay knows how to craft beautiful art. It might be though because Michael Bay finally kicked the paint can with enough force and accuracy that when it hit the canvas it made some pretty neat patterns. <br/><br/>Yes, Transformers has faults and plot holes that an Autobot could fall through. Yes its over stuffed and overblown. Yes its far too long and filled with more product placements than you see during the super bowl. Yes 90% of the dialogue is cheesy and no Michael Bay still cannot direct humans to save his own life. But I'll admit, when I was enjoying Transformers, I enjoyed the hell out of it.<br/><br/>Michael Bay, who has arguably directed some of the most awful movies in the world (Armageddon, Pearl Harbor) and my choice for the worst (Bad Boys II), has finally done something right. Its too bad that he realized it at some point and kept running a few miles past the finish line with it. The movie starts out with some traditionally cheesy moments and gung ho join the army because we're awesome junk. No big surprise, Bay stuffs in the greatness of the US Army wherever he can. However he does poke some fun at Bush and the US Government's lies. Too bad its regarding Aliens and nothing actually significant. But even the staunch member of the opposition that I am, I was able to ignore it most of the time. When there is humans on screen, when they work its because of one reason only, Shia LaBeouf (Well John Turturro has his moments). He is showing himself to be a great actor, even in the middle of otherwise mediocrity. <br/><br/>The movie works because of the Transformers and LaBeouf, and the completely over the top and silly action sequences of which there are many. The CGI is great, but Bay who seemingly realized this flaunts it to the point of exhaustion and tedium. And because of that, Transformers just about overstays its welcome. So much time is put into the final fight, that it feels like they were unsure where to go from there and how to actually end the fight itself, which seems to come quickly considering how long the fight lasts. <br/><br/>But for all its faults, Transformers is far and away Bay's best movie. Though if there is a sequel i would much rather see someone else direct. If you go into this with low expectations and in the mood to see popcorn movies at there most buttery, then I think you'll feel you didn't waste your money... well that kid inside you will feel that way.<br/><br/>3/4"
"panzonito","8","0","1","6 July 2007"," Not much more than meets the eye
","The most horrendous part of the movie is its sad excuse of a story. The story is simple and even with the addition of Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and Mikaela Banes' (Megan Fox) teenage love tangent, it still remained painstakingly barbaric. A quick synopsis would be: Robots are fighting over an omnipotent cube, one side must destroy it, the other wants to use it for evil. Oh and by the way all of mankind will be destroyed if the bad guys get it. The End. You won't get much more out of the plot. D-.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie was above mediocre, yet below excellent. Shia LaBeouf, The military guys, and his father were excellent, as for the rest of the characters (mainly Mikaela and the Sector Seven people) -- not so much.<br/><br/>It's hard to say exactly whether the directing was good or not because most of the people being directed are probably CG animators. Some more moving or artistic camera angles would have been a nice touch rather than bland and typical action shots.<br/><br/>Even in the visual department, the movie failed to deliver any moving, or artistic camera angles and instead focused on morphing cars and hardly distinguishable battles between Power-Ranger-esquire battling robots. This is probably the best reason to watch this movie.<br/><br/>Over all, Transformers is a mainly a movie targeted at people who love to see fighting, broken metal, and bullets. In my opinion, there really isn't much more than meets the eye in this movie."
"vpamir","6","0","3","6 July 2007"," how they destroyed my childhood dream
","I saw the movie tonight with my sister and mom. I still can't believe how they destroyed my childhood dream with this. I just want to list some goods and bads: THE GOODS: 1. The animation was fantastic. The Transformers were very detailed and the transformations were absolutely beautiful.<br/><br/>2. Action scenes were really fast paced and trying to catch the action was challenging and entertaining.<br/><br/>THE BADS: 1. They somehow decided not to include the main Transformers theme music !!! I just can't believe it! We grew up listening to that music, ""Transformers, more than meets the eye... Transformers, robots in disguise!"". You're making a Transformers movie and it's an insult not to include that music...<br/><br/>2. The robots have eyebrows and lips. Gad damn it. It was OK for them to have lips in the original cartoon, it somehow blended with the overall art. But it certainly didn't go well with this one. Especially I personally hated the face of Optimus Prime, its face is all better when its closed. In fact they didn't have to have a face, a plate with holes covering their faces would be more convenient, after all they're robots remember? 3. The most beautiful girl in school is hanging with the captain of the football team who is rich and drives a Hummer or something, and all of a sudden she decides to try her chances with Sam. And they somewhat get closer and everyone is happy. How many times did we see that cliché, 100? 1000?.<br/><br/>4. That little decepticon robot was annoying as hell. He was infiltrating the computer network of the national defense, that's OK but was all that giggling and stupid noises he makes necessary? Couldn't he be more clever and stay silent and do his job? Whoever thinks his movements or the noises he makes are funny is an idiot.<br/><br/>5. The Allspark gives life and transformation abilities to electronic and mechanical objects and that's cool. But can anyone explain to me why they all end up being hostile? 6. The decepticons didn't looked like robots, the looked more like aliens. Megatron have teeth can u believe that? What does he need that teeth for, does a robot eat? Megatron was a gun and he should have been stayed that way. Seeing the allspark shrink all that way down i don't think that transforming Megatron into a gun would be much of a problem.<br/><br/>7. Storing the coordinates of the allspark in the glasses of Sam's grand grand grand father's glasses was completely moronic.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a 8/10 without even seeing it for the sake of good ol' times but i'm giving this a 6/10 now that i watched it."
"dr_evil684","6","0","1","6 July 2007"," excellent film... not at the end
","6/10... which equals 2/3. Fitting, considering about 2/3 of the movie was good. I'll explain. For the first two thirds of the movie, I was INTO it. The acting (while corny) was good, the gags funny, the giant robots cool-looking. I was interested in the plot, as well. The robots look amazing, and Shia Lebouf does an excellent job acting around them. Now to the bad part... after all this great acting, plot, and technology, the last third of the film devolves into one climactic battle that lasts about 20 minutes longer than it should have. Since there has been next to no fighting in the early portion of the film, it is all shunted to the end for one anti-climatic battle. With Michael Bay's ""ADD editing"" (thanks to whoever coined this phrase), through most of the battle you can't even tell who is fighting who amidst the chaos.<br/><br/>Although the robots LOOK cool, you will develop almost no attachment to them. Well... maybe Bumblebee. When one of the Autobots dies in the battle, you say ""who was that, anyway?"" But you don't feel attached to any of the robots. When it comes down to the final battle between Optimus Prime and Megatron, which should have been edge-of-your-seat material, it has almost no extra tension, and just feels like another smash-em'-up.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is basically what I expected it to be. The action is fast, the jokes keep coming, and the CG amazing. I probably won't go see the second one, but it was a good way to finally get some closure to all those hours playing with transformers on my living room floor."

","After a good movie, you recap the plot, characters, and favorite scenes as a form of ""after-entertainment."" After watching ""Transformers,"" however, I could only think whether I liked the movie or not. Although I praise the awesome CGI and the fact I was a die-hard for Transformers as a kid, the movie is painfully nostalgic.<br/><br/>""Before time began, there wasthe cube"" booms a resounding voice-over of the omniscient Optimus Prime. Oh sure, that means the cube is antimatter. Yet when I tuned into every half hour Transformers animated TV show as a kid, I could care less about the physics of the picture. Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" has been a success at the popular level because nobody cares to rethink the impossible and ridiculous. I dare not to claim that those who liked his movie are mindless goofs. The movie doesn't deserve to be digested for its plot and meaning; ""Transformers"" is like a cigarette buzz that you want to last a bit but rewatch with guilt.<br/><br/>With much merit, I liked Bay's ""Transformers"" because of its sweet CGI work and kinetics of robot battle. The most exciting but brief parts were the swift transformations between vehicle to robot and back, where you can see the dynamics and structures of its individual parts. Yet all the CGI and the pounding sound of twisted metal reminded me of watching football (and probably both more entertaining over several beers) where the entertained gets torn apart while I sit through the ordeal of both teams pushing and pulling over the fifty-yard-line, all in two and a half hours.<br/><br/>In the end, as a long-lost Transformers fan, I go home and dig through my old childhood toys to find my Transformers collection. I feel sorry and I have the urge to cry over them because I miss my childhood, when my mind could not fathom the intricacy of plot, character, and believability of movie adaptations of my once-favorite toy."
"kgprophet","6","0","2","5 July 2007"," Disturbing Pro-War Propaganda Disturbs otherwise Harmless Action Flick
","I was ready to switch my brain off walking into the theatre, especially when it comes to Michael Bay. But what bothered me were the obvious pro-Iraq war messages being delivered front and centre. A lot of current events involving world affairs play a part in the story. Why? This is a dumb movie based on a kids toy. That's what's disturbing. The pro-Military message: ""We are in for the long fight"", (like Bush's perpetual War Against Terror) is being drilled directly into young teenagers heads. For the sake of the Transformers legend (Good robots battle Bad robots over Energy Cube) there isn't much need to bring Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Bush, and Rumsfeld (played by Jon Voight). Worse, there is the heavy line at the pinnacle of the movie, where our hero says ""No Sacrifice, No Victory"". Pick up your Army brochures in the lobby. <br/><br/>The film gets off to a disturbing start, with an all too familiar site of US soldiers (and civilians) fighting and dying in the middle east. What is this scene doing in a kids Transformer movie? There are also jabs at outsourcing in India, immigrants speaking Spanish, and clichés about African-Americans. Technically, there was too much reliance on CGI to wow you at the end. Unfortunately, Michael Bay's patented moving camera shots left me feeling a little dizzy, and mostly unable to get a good angle on the robot fights. Seriously, when you cut from a tracking shot straight to another tracking shot, you need to be able to get your bearings. But no, you cut away too quickly for anything to register. This carries on at the end for way too long. There are really so many wow shots one can handle in succession to have any real appreciation for the peril that anyone might be in. <br/><br/>It is really too bad this all falls apart in the third act, because I could feel the Spielberg influence in Shia LaBeouf's character, and could dig the Boy and his Car subtext. I also applaud the over-the-top attitude about how the robots behave. This is the first American movie that has really embraced the kooky Japanese MechaGodzilla type of nonsense. This comes complete with a clueless military, two kids that always hold the key to everything, and kid-friendly heroes. Michael Bay has no idea how to make a proper film, having directed 1000's of TV commercials. At least there was some decent story elements that entertained me most of the time. But Bay will never get any legitimate credibility as long as he literally has no ideas beyond - keep the camera moving."

Are those the good guys or is it the bad guys who are losing (of course the bad guys are losing .... but its so damn confusing) .

"am-prudente","6","0","2","5 July 2007"," Transformers, little disappointing
","I have been a huge transformers fan for as long as I can remember. I was a little skeptic going to see this movie, one because it is rated PG-13 even though the Transformers Movie 1986 was PG and the fact that Michael Bay directed, more known for his action sequences and emphasis on effects(which worked for this) not storyline. The storyline could have been better, should of focused more on the transformer characters rather then the humans. The one reason I gave this a 6 is because of the language. I took my 9 yr old to see it even though it is pg13 transformers is suppose to be for everybody there toy & TV series market does target kids 5+. I don't mind the occasional S..t here or there with him, he knows the difference between right/wrong. But having a transformer ""frenzy"" say it that kind of crossed the line and with the corny bumble bee air freshener with Bee-och. There was way to much sexual references, talking about masturbation and throwing in Mother .... than a sound effect. Come on if you are going to put a Hasbro name in the credits then make it PG and no need for the sexual references. Look at Star Wars the greatest original trilogy of all time. Lucas never put any of that crap into his movies and transformers to me should be in the same class of movies. If I wanted bad language, sex & cars then I would go see bad boys. The performance from Shia LaBeouf was excellent he played a good spike."

It's supposed to be about the war between the Autobots and Decepticons, but there was too much talking among people about nothing. Granted, the transforming was cool, but it felt like it took forever for 1 Transformer to change.<br/><br/>At some point, I was looking at my watch to see how long it took Optimus Prime to go from truck to robot. In the cartoon, you heard the ""transforming noise"" and a few seconds later he was in another form. In this movie, I could leave for popcorn and come back to see him still transforming.<br/><br/>The view of the robots was so ""busy"" and cluttered, you couldn't recognize which robot was which.

"jboren","6","0","1","5 July 2007"," More than Meets the Eye
","Transformers 6 out of 10 There was a time in my life where a certain toy was my most prized possession. That toy was Optimus Prime. Aside from G.I. Joe's, Transformer's were my favorite. I would set for hours playing puppeteer to one after another autobot/decepticon battle. So, much like the hundreds of thousands of TM fan boys out there I waited to see the live action version with much anticipation. The only thing I wasn't sure about is Mr. Michael Bay being involved. After unleashing such warmed over mediocrity over the past ten years (Armageddon, Bad Boys II, etc), I had my reservations about how he would bring TM to the big screen, but surprisingly he got a lot right. Not everything though.<br/><br/>The film starts out with an Optimius Prime voice-over setting up the struggle between good and evil then takes us straight into the life of Sam (Shia LeBeouf). Sam is just your average teen, trying to buy a new car to impress the girl. But, when his father buys him a vintage yellow Camaro, Sam doesn't realize that it is a robot in disguise. The Camaro ends up being the autobot, Bumblebee. (Bumblebee was originally a VW bug as a toy, but in an effort to totally be a whore to general motors and to make Billy Woodring enjoy this movie he was turned into the newest model Camaro) There's a great sequence when Bumblebee drives away in the middle of the night and Sam gives chase, thinking his car is being stolen, and then discovers his Camaro turning into a thirty foot tall robot. From there all the pieces start to fall perfectly in place. The rest of the Autobots are introduced. Jazz (voiced by none other than Eddie Winslow from Family Matters), Ratchet, Ironhide, and yesOptimus Prime! Optimus explains the battle between good and evil again to Sam and reveals to him that the key to saving earth lies in Sam's great grandfather's eye glasses that Sam is currently trying to pawn on eBay. (Yeah I knowjust go with it.) At this point Bay has done almost everything right. The acting is pretty much what you expect from a summer blockbuster, except for LeBeouf. Shia LeBeouf is subtly becoming the next big thing in Hollywood and I think he will have a bright future as the leading everyman. He does the best that he can with the script and turns out a great lead performance I could have done without Tyrese and Josh Duhamel's characters. I mean come on , do we really need to see Duhamel jumping off a speeding motorcycle and then sliding on his back on the street fifty feet all while double fisting machine guns at a Decepticon? Come on Bay, not everything has to be that over the top! The FX and the overall look of the film are great. The Transformers look really awesome and the CGI blend in with the real background almost flawlessly. The main problem I had with TM is the running time. There is no reason the running time needed to be two hours and thirty five minutes. My nostalgia started to sputter out around one hour and forty five minutes and I think they could have saved some face by cutting the last thirty minutes of CGI battles. Bringing back Peter Cullen to reprise the voice of Optimus was a nice touch, but I was a little disappointed that we didn't get to hear ""You got the touch"" at the closing credits. That song was from the 1986 animated feature and the song was later hilariously recreated by Mark Wahlberg and John C. Reilly in Boogie Nights. I guess that's the difference between Michael Bay and me. I would have chosen ""You got the touch"" for the closing, Michael chose Linkin Park. This is definitely an improvement on Bay's recent work though. I'm not saying its Armageddon bad and I'm not saying its Bad Boys good. I think it is somewhere right in between.<br/><br/>So, my suggestion to you is that if you are a Transformer fan boy like me, find the biggest screen in your town and go see it with 500 other people. The robot battles will keep you entertained for two hours. If you're not a fan and you don't know even know what a decepticon is, then I hear A Mighty Heart is pretty good.<br/><br/>JB"

Also because the good and bad guys are strangled together, hard to distinguish who is who and who is doing what.<br/><br/>Another short coming is the bad guys.

","I was a bit disappointed at the way the movie turned out. Being a Transformers kid, and having collected comics and watched the 1st generation Transformers TV cartoons in the early 80s, I expected more sensibilities from the story and lesser plot holes at that. I gave this title a higher rating because of the fact that it's about Transformers and that Transformers, as a personal favorite, played a huge role in my childhood years.<br/><br/>The saving grace for this movie was its special effects, and then the fantastic CGI rendering and animation. I would have desired the look of the robots to resemble the 1st generation robots more but the production team, unfortunately, may have opted to focus on realistic physical aesthetics. Also, I found out that they mostly drowned the transformation sound - which they claimed to have reproduced for this movie. This distinct sound is a very important key element for the movie's overall success as it would have provided nostalgic inspiration to the Transformers fans of my generation.<br/><br/>Maybe I was expecting too much from the story but that's just me. In fact, I actually have high expectations for movies coming out from Marvel's comics line. Seeing Michael Bay direct this movie got many people excited about the kind, ferocity and quality of the action scenes and special effects they were going to expect. I give this aspect a near-perfect score but the story and the script should have been improved more, I think.<br/><br/>I still enjoyed the movie nonetheless for all its action-packed merits. And simply because Transformers is just a hands-down favorite."

","I was cautiously optimistic about this movie because, while Transformers were a huge part of my childhood, I haven't really been a fan of other Michael Bay movies. But this movie was superb in my opinion. I was a little disappointed that the transformation sounds were modernized, with little of the original sound, and also with the apparent inferiority of the autobots compared with the power of the decepticons (don't remember this from the TV show and original movie). But I was ecstatic that the original voice of Optimus returned for the movie. If you were a fan of Transformers at any point in your life, you probably don't need any encouragement to see it. But if you weren't, or don't know what they are, don't let other insipid efforts by Bay (e.g. The Island) discourage you from seeing this movie. It's what Independence Day would have been if they hadn't given a starring role to Bill Pullman."

There are many individual scenes that stand out on their own. As a whole there are plot holes, like the whole importance of the cube just goes up in smoke, but I enjoyed the movie like an amusement park ride. It was a rush.

Before I went to this movie, I heard all transformers have a different look compared to the transformers of the cartoon. Most people don't like that, my wife doesn't like it either. But it didn't bother me. The most thing that did bother me was that Megatron and Starscream were shallow.<br/><br/>The jokes in the movie were not funny. Most people who are going to watch this movie are adults who had been a fan of the cartoon. Kids of today don't want to watch transformers, but Harry Potter. The jokes were more for the youngers. I did not like the small jokes about the movie E.T. from Spielberg, or about the movie Armageddon from Michael Bay. These jokes were complete unnecessary. Even when the agent was handcuffed in his underpants, was not funny.<br/><br/>The movie was like terminator 2: Sam Witwicky was like John Connor, protected by the terminator Bumblebee and hunted by the T1000 Barricade. Even in a fight sequence I heard the drum sound of the movie T2.<br/><br/>The transformations were amazing! But the way how the fight sequences were followed was messy. The flight of Starscream between the other jets was awesome! The fight between Optimus and Megatron was short and not really exciting.<br/><br/>All the actors and actresses speak normally American. But Rachel Taylor had to have a messy English accent. This was really annoying! Megan Fox on the other hand was nice to see. I liked the fact that Hugo Weaving did the voice of Megatron, but he didn't have a lot of lines to speak.<br/><br/>The way how the transformers hide themselves at the house of Sam was not funny. In this way the viewer cannot take the transformers serious. That was a pity. There was a mistake made: Sam goes on a pink bike in the morning for a ride. He gets followed by Bumblebee. Then he gets in with Mikaela and gets chased by Barricade. And sudden it is from morning evening! This movie was about 2,5 hours. For this time I saw too little action! It took too long to make an introduction. In the middle of the movie we see Optimus.

It is extremely intense but flat-out cool.<br/><br/>Director Michael Bay succeeds in finding a good balance between the humans and the Transformers, as the film is not overloaded by supreme special effects as ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"" fell victim to. Steven Spielberg, as the ""people's director,"" does a fabulous job in causing the audience to relate to Shia LeBeouf's character, among others, as they struggle to survive among a race that's warring on a planet which isn't even their own. Incredible visuals, interesting story. 3.5/4 stars"

A limited circle of characters to focus on, better scenes (who can forget the scene when Optimus arrives and saves the day at the beginning) It also had more of a dire look at the Autobot's situation.

","First I have to say, get there early, or wait till the movie is old. We ended up in the extreme first row, so we ended up with neck pain from trying to see all the action...of course we couldn't...so we are determined to buy this when it comes out...plus, go see it again in theaters.<br/><br/>What an incredible and entertaining movie! So action packed, and the original voices was a definite plus! I was surprised that my kids remembered the voice of Optimus Prime! This movie is full of super action, very intense, and the humor is fantastic. I do remember my kids afterwards complaining (a little) about how they changed some characters, but believe me, I know they completely enjoyed the experience. Anyone who watched this as a kid (or like me, mom) will completely enjoy this movie. The human characters were so entertaining and enjoyable, and the Transformers themselves were so great, and enjoyable.<br/><br/>The few technical errors were not important, and never detracted from the movie experience! But my suggestion is go early to make sure you get seats where you don't need a chiropractor afterwards!"

Sure they're robots but they have AI and it's not used much. The screenwriter really sucked or was really pushed into writing crap. It was an amazing movie visually and the CGI is out of this world! But come on, people love Transformers why not give them the characters that they love on the big screen too? Baffles me.<br/><br/>Where was Soundwave and his mini characters? Replaced? Why?

","There was a lot of build up for this move, but I believed it to be warranted. As not only Micahel Bay was the one directing, but the great Steven Spielberg was involved as well. While standing in line to see it, I told myself, ""There is no way this could be bad."".<br/><br/>Walking out of the movie theater, I thought about what I had said while walking in, and wondered just how they had screwed this up. After all, the action scenes were great, and the special effects were top notch. There was nary a dull moment throughout the entire film. The acting was good for the most part. They were talking to robots.. that has to be hard to make it look good.<br/><br/>However, as great as the Transformers looked, and how much I loved them as a kid. They had just seemed to have too many unbelievable flaws. These guys are supposed to be super intelligent, uber evolved machines, yet they came off as adolescent teenagers. Their dialog was painful making me cringe at times, and left me wondering if a 10 year was playing the part of Optimus Prime. I would go into the details, but I'd rather not give away spoilers for those who have not yet seen it. It's unfortunate they didn't make a better movie."

","High-school student Sam Witwicky buys his first car, who is actually the Autobot Bumblebee. Bumblebee defends Sam and his girlfriend Mikaela Banes from the Decepticon Barricade, before the other Autobots arrive on Earth. They are searching for the Allspark, and the war on Earth heats up as the Decepticons attack a United States military base in Qatar. Sam and Mikaela are taken by the top-secret agency Sector 7 to help stop the Decepticons, but when they learn the agency also intends to destroy the Autobots, they formulate their own plan to save the world.<br/><br/>I was quite surprised that many people were at the earliest showing today, July 4th. Hoping to watch the movie with a couple of people with teenagers and crying babies away, I was quite disappointed but it didn't ruin my movie experience.<br/><br/>The film was decent. This is coming from a guy who knows nothing about Transformers. The oh-so-incredible action sequences weren't that good and the plot, well, you know, was paper thin. Sure the CGI was flawless but you expect more. I found the camera work better than Bay's past films and the score great (except Linkin' Park).<br/><br/>This is all you know when you see this film: Good robots vs. bad robots trying to find this mystical cube. If you want to watch this film for its plot and story, you'll be disappointed. Do you even think this film needs a good plot? No. It's a fun filled action film.<br/><br/>I thought the film excluding the last forty minutes was decent. I expected more from Bay but as the last forty minutes rolled in, it gets thrilling. The action is non-stop. I liked the humor throughout the film which makes it entertaining. Shia LaBeouf plays a charismatic character and Megan Fox a sexy, but smart, girl. Others like Josh Duhamel and Jon Voight was good.<br/><br/>Do not watch this movie expecting a great story. Watch it to be entertained with the action sequences and humor. Michael Bay isn't a grand storyteller yet but he is a professional popcorn movie director."

Starscream (didn't he used to be an F-15?), Soundwave (who their calling Frenzy) and Bumblebee.<br/><br/>I liked the use of the ""More than meets the eye"" line twice and they actually DID use the Transform noise that we all know, love and grew up hearing in the 1980's.<br/><br/>Basically this is The Autobots trying to stop The Decepticons getting hold of a cube that can animate technology to allow them to create an army aligned to them.<br/><br/>The robots look brilliant and the original voice artist returned to voice Optimus so it was like the time had never passed.<br/><br/>I would have liked to have known more about the boys grandfather and his back-story when he discovered Megatron.<br/><br/>At least the ending was open enough to allow a sequel to be made. This wasn't really worth the wait as some of the battles were shot and cut too fast to make them watchable which seems to be a problem lots of current films are suffering from.<br/><br/>The look of the robots made it watchable and the plot wasn't bad."
"yingzi-zhang","8","0","3","4 July 2007"," No sacrifice, No victory
","I am still under the shock of TRANSFORMERS even one night passed. It's soooooooooo cool! All the robots and SAM! But just like Optimus Prime said ""no sacrifice, no victory"", Michael Bay sacrificed the climax for the compact plot and the cool visual effects，which is the biggest flaw of the film script. Also I dislike the way Megatron was portrayed. In my impression, he should be a sly and powerful ""BAD"" fighter, while in this movie, he was frozen for almost all the time except the final all decisive battle with Optimus Prime. Even then, he was defeated in a very very weird way. How will they make the sequel? Anyway, I like TRANSFORMERS as it reminded me of my childhood and all the heroes in my dreams."
"ackthpt","9","0","3","4 July 2007"," That there's one Awesome flick
","I'd been psyched up a bit after hearing about this film for months, back into 2006 even. Leaked pictures and rumours piqued my interest and I hoped beyond hope it wouldn't be bogged down in some meaningless tale (a la Spider-Man 3) or be utterly preposterous (geared towards fans or kiddies only.) As it turned out the film has a couple human threads entwined in the tale of the Transformers. Some of it's cute, a good bit of humour and doesn't get bogged down in it. Some of it is silly, but it still works well as an action movie. Optimimus Prime (and the other autobots) are bit bit impatient and it's inspired comedy to watch these metal monsters creeping around and trying to hide.<br/><br/>The action sequences are fast, very fast. I have been informed I missed a couple details, not necessary to enjoying the film, but perhaps meaningful to the character of a certain Decepticon. The action moves along very well and when the final battle takes place it's fast and furious. Saturday morning cartoons were never like this. The Transformers were never like this and this, this is GREAT! For those looking to nitpick plot-holes or the re-imagining of your childhood, you may as well stay home and play with your Rockem-Sockem Robots, because this is going to be different. I didn't mind one bit as I was watching a spectacle which suited the big screen. I'll see this again and again. Fun and exciting, well executed.<br/><br/>To Mr. Bay and his team, well done lads! Well done!"
"TheMysteriousBox","9","0","3","4 July 2007"," Outstanding.
","I thought Live Free or Die Hard was completely action-packed...<br/><br/>It's interesting to see what a complete 180-degree turn the reception to the Transformers movie has made on the movie-going public. Most took it as some bad joke but as the trailers emerged and we got a glimpse of the robots in disguise, we couldn't take our eyes off of them.<br/><br/>Transformers works well as an action movie, especially when it's an action movie based on one of the longest-running toy lines ever. It's intriguing that so much occurs in the first half-hour or so between the Decepticons' attack on the world and a fight between Autobot Bumblebee and Decepticon Barricade that you forget that the other Autobots haven't even arrived to Earth yet. I'd never been in a more enthusiastic theater. Cheers were everywhere when Bumblebee becomes the '08 Camaro, and when Optimus Prime transforms and introduces himself. The filmmakers understood that we want to see the action between the good guys and bad guys and thankfully refrain from some 'adjusting to life on Earth' subplot.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf gives an incredible of a performance as Sam. He gives in way more than was probably asked of him for the role, and he ends up being just as good a part in the movie as the robots themselves. He's got a lot of awkward charm that is a great balance with his love interest Mikaela. The scene where Bumblebee, because of his lack of speech, uses the car radio to help Sam win Mikaela over is a riot. The movie manages to do fish-out-of-water comedy well. Some moments seemed to overdo it a bit, but they're made up for by the fact that it was genuinely funny. I also enjoyed how the Witwicky family is your average American family with its ups and downs that aren't victims of Hollywood screen writing. They're likable enough people without being obnoxious and obnoxiously sappy.<br/><br/>The one thing one must prepare for when walking into the movie is that it is a brutal, intense, violent movie. How many times has the shot of Bonecrusher smashing through a bus made people drop their jaws? The robots don't get into comic-book fights where ""Pow!"" and ""Kablam!"" fill the screen. They are out to kill one another, amongst a really powerful score for an action film, no matter what it takes. Some characters get hit worse than others. They're glorious battles, but neither faction holds back. Michael Bay certainly didn't, which is why he was the man for the job. Some shots during the fights were all over the place and were kind of disorienting with the thousand robot parts moving everywhere. For the most part, the action is beyond well-done. The movie also features some of the most inspiring uses of CGI in a film. In a world that's getting tired of the technique, it is amazing to see them transform every single time.<br/><br/>Fans, hardcore or casual, can breathe. It was that good. It isn't the '84 cartoon, and thank goodness for that. Also, Hugo Weaving is very scary as Megatron."
"brainofmonkey","10","0","3","4 July 2007"," An intense, enjoyable movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.
","This movie is not about being an emotional and thought provoking experience. This movie is about giant robots and explosions. And it excels. The movie starts quickly, there's not much in the way of an explanation as to why the Transformers come to earth. Basically, there's something they want, and they've come to earth to fight over it. The plot is mostly just an excuse to get some robot action going. It's actually nice that the plot is so simple, because it allows the movie to start fast and keep going. The movie has quite a few, somewhat awkward funny moments. They all seem a little bit forced, but that doesn't stop them from being funny. In fact, some times it actually makes them funnier. Some people would argue that it's not realistic, but when I go to see a movie about cars that turn into giant alien robots, realism isn't at the top of my wish list. <br/><br/>Whatever the movie lacks in the drama department, it more than makes up for with its original brand of robot action. The Transformers and Decepticons are a sight to behold. Whether they are fighting, flying, or transforming, they all look amazing. When a large fight breaks out, missiles and laser blasts decimate buildings, and send cars flying. Not all Transformer technology is a weapon though. And there is a rather funny incident involving their alien technology and a Mountain Dew machine. I will say no more. To wrap it up, the final showdown Between Prime and Megatron is and genuinely intense, and you really don't know who's going to come out on top until it's all over. And I can honestly say, I wasn't expecting it to end the way it did. It's not a twist that will blow you away, but it keeps the movie from being predictable. If you're into robots, or action movies in general, check this one out."
"walken_on_sunshine","9","0","3","4 July 2007"," Michael Bay Does It Again
","Michael Bay once again delivers with the best Hollywood blockbuster of the summer which is saying a lot considering the large amount of great summer blockbusters this year. Spiderman 3 was disappointing but entertaining, Shrek The Third was funny but again disappointing, Pirates 3 was better than the second but not as good as the first and Fantastic Four 2 was entertaining but gave too much away in previews. Michael Bay's Transformers was pretty much my last hope in this years blockbusters and you can damn well bet that Transformers was the most satisfying, entertaining, and enthralling movie of the summer. I was never really one who followed the Transformers cartoons when i was young with the exception of Beast Wars but like most people not living under a rock i knew of their existence. After seeing Michael Bay's action packed and promising trailer i decided to familiarize myself with this franchise and honestly i did not like what i saw. I watched the original animated film and a spin off series called Transformers:Cybertron and while the film i felt was dated and cheesy the spin off which is a show of the 2000's was more cheesy with worse dialogue but they gave me the back story behind the Transformers and i was ready to roll. First of all Transformers is one of those movies you absolutely must see in theatres, IMAX if you can because the carnage, destruction, and mayhem is hardcore and gets you're adrenaline at an all time high. The script is surprisingly solid i figured Transformers would be 2 and a half hours of stuff blowing up but there is definitely intelligent writing behind it as well. The comedy is written perfectly i don't think i rolled my eyes once at any of the jokes because none of them sucked, and while it is sitcom like writing (meaning the actors timing makes or breaks the joke) it's not bad sitcom writing like in Ghost Rider it's hilarious and really does a great job at lightening the mood. The special effects are the best i've seen honestly better than Star Wars or Peter Jackson's King Kong absolutely flawless, nothing looks too CGI, nothing looks puppet like everything looks pretty damn real for a movie about transforming robots. The action is also extremely solid Shia LaBoef is great and definitely an up and comer however Megan Fox gives a passable performance she seemed to have some bad line delivery but still accomplished the job, Shia clearly overshadows her performance by a mile though. If you are a fan despite the little changes (Bumblebee is now a Camaro) it won't matter trust me they do such a great job at bringing a very difficult thing to the big screen with slight changes that don't detract from the overall picture. For non fans everything is explained very well you are not in need of searching for a back story before seeing the film, non fans will definitely enjoy the ride of full out non stop action. The movie overall met and slightly exceeded my expectations unlike every other film this summer so if you are expecting this movie to be amazing do not fear disappointment because it is more than meets the eye."

","Sam Wittwicky is a high school kid with dreams of owning a vehicle in order to attract his crush (who is thankfully NOT a typical blonde).

They discover, through Ebay, that said glasses could lead them to the Earthly hiding spot of the 'All-Spark' (a cube of raw energy which brings life to anything mechanical). The Autobots send in BummbleBee as a classic Camaro to protect Sam. Sam see's the Camaro in a used car-lot and decides it is the one for him. In a hilarious scene, BummbleBee ensures that he is indeed the only car for Sam. Later, Sam watches his car drive away and follows it, thinking it's been stolen. BummbleBee eventually leads him to the arrival of Optimus Prime and the other Autobots. They have arrived to protect the Humans and retrieve the All-Spark before their enemies can. A simple enough plot and yet it is complicated by secret government agencies, high school bullies, military air-strikes and a boy's love for his new car.<br/><br/>This movie had just about everything. The film saves us from any sort of mushy-romantic scenes between Sam and his crush, allowing us to focus on the more important relationship between the humans and the Autobots. It was hilarious at times, mostly due to Sam's nervous ramblings and a few good one-liners from the Autobots. The Autobots were definite pride-surging heroes whenever they came on the screen, although they appeared more to be the muscle than the actual heroes of the film. The movie leaves the butt-kicking to the human element of the film, even when it comes to killing Megatron. It blends well, but if you were looking for space-battles and Autobot-on-Decepticon death matches, this film will disappoint."

It would've been easy for director Michael Bay to simply focus on the robots and use the humans as cannon fodder, but humanity actually has a say on the Autobot/Decepticon showdown. Shia LeBeouf, who is the main character, excludes charm and sardonic wit as does minor character John Turturro (nice undershirt pal!) who plays a spoof of Will Smith's character from MIB.<br/><br/>There were many problems with the movie. While Shia Lebeouf is in fine form (the comedians in this movie were the best - Bernie Mac and Anthony Anderson), some characters were cardboard stereotypes (Megan Fox and Josh Duchamel and his men).<br/><br/>Another issue was some of the fighting scenes. It was hard to make out who was who and the first fighting scene with Bumblebee and Rampart was virtually unwatchable (I mean, all this is CGI, why are the robots out of focus and off centre!?) Also, you can't really tell the difference between Ironhide and Rampage when they are robots.<br/><br/>Another issue is the inclusion of a ""Michael Bay"" eye-rolling moment. Whether it is the sappy exchange in Pearl Harbour (okay half the movie is sappy) or the animal cracker scene in Armaggeddon, why is there tender moment in the middle of a fight? However, these issues are minor complaints to a movie that doesn't aspire to be what it is (and it actually has a shout out to Hasbro in the credits). It is an engaging, funny and spectacular spectacle."

","Excellent film, but refusing to give it above an 8 because I kept thinking their holding back for sequels. The transformations were INCREDIBLE. I was one of the fans of the cartoon that feared they'd screw up the whole reason we've come to love Autobots/Decepticons. Everything looked like the people were actually acting with the robots rather than green screen. **Spoiler**Starscream, his survival instincts intact, guts an entire squadron of aircraft and takes off to presumably rally more Decepticons. Very nice! Peter Cullen brought back so many memories just hearing his voice. **Spoiler**Also, they made Optimus a bad ass. His fight with Ironhide was awesome and he showed no mercy.<br/><br/>They're going to have to make a choice in the future: make every battle a battle for Earth or have the Autobots and Decepticons become more of the story and focus on their interaction. Hopefully they create a happy medium because Shia Lebouf did a great job (loved him in ""Even Stevens""; can't wait to rent ""Disturbia"").<br/><br/>Please God let GM mass produce the new Camaro. Bumblebee is better as a Camaro.<br/><br/>I'm going to see it again on the Cine Capri screen (largest non-Imax screen in AZ). I hope it's twice as loud as it was this evening! Be prepared to go again, it's that good.<br/><br/>Finally, Michael Bay has redeemed himself after ""The Island."" If he's smart, he'll do the trilogy and hopefully get better with each film.

I also liked that this film (mostly) steered clear of the action sequence-sarcastic comment/catch phrase attempt convention. Shia did an excellent job. I look forward to his future. If you are on the fence about whether or not to catch this film, I say go see it. It has some extremely creative action sequences and likable characters.

Or the scene when the robots are hiding out at Shia's house (not a spoiler it was in the previews) it was drawn out far too long. The action scenes on the other hand were very impressive, even the bits where humans were fighting the machines. (Though the machine on machine battles were freaking awesome)Casting was good in my opinion and the voices for the robots was good, specially Optimus Prime, it was a very 'demanding of presence' voice.

The romantic part, fortunately, was realistic, light, and not overdone. What the movie could have done without was the extremely C-H-E-E-S-E-Y conversations between the Autobots about saving humanity, at the sacrifice of consistency to the plot, i.e. keeping the All-Spark out of the hands of the Decepticons to stop them from achieving insurmountable powers and threatening all organic life in the universe (not just the human species, which is only one of millions on our planet alone).

","Michael Bay has long been a target of detractors who say his movies are long on style, and short on substance. With that in mind, you'd think ""Transformers"" would be the perfect vehicle for him (No pun intended). After all, no one is going to attend this film for the actual humans that inhabit this world. They are going to see some giant robots blow stuff up real good. In that sense, you get your money's worth. The problem is, that only accounts for about 45 minutes of the movie. For the remaining 1 hour 45 minutes, we have to sit through one of the most poorly scripted summer movies of the year. That's really saying something considering the lackluster year it has been for summer movies. The people in this movie are just not interesting. Not even for a Michael Bay movie. Shia Labeouf (Sam) and Megan Fox (Mikaela) do their thing in relatively harmless fashion. Their characters are the definition of cookie cutter. He's the geek that is determined to win the heart of the hottest girl in school. She's the hottest girl in school. She dates the star athlete, but isn't into his mentality. She has the requisite heart of gold. Of course they'll be smooching by the end of the movie. They go through the motions as actors. Unfortunately, they are surrounded by way too many useless characters. Some are supposed to be their for tension, others for comic relief. None of them works. Rachael Taylor leads a group of high school students that crack the robot's code and discover what they are up to. (ID4 ripoff?) It's amazing that the smartest people in the world, using the most advance equipment in the world can't crack this code...but a hot blonde with great legs can. Only in a Michael Bay movie. When she can't figure it out? Who does she turn to? Anthony Anderson. Who divides his time between hacking the internet, and playing Dance Dance Revolution in his bedroom. John Turturro cashes a paycheck as a government spook is neither threatening or funny when he needs to be. The worst offenders are Kevin Dunn and Julie White as Labeouf's parents. Every scene they are in is cringe worthy. Their annoyance continues into the end credits where they continue to pop up as if we needed more of their inane blathering. But like I said, no one is paying to see them. You're paying to see giant robots throw down. That you get. You have 2 sides...the noble Autobots, and the evil Decepticons. Only a hardcore fan could keep these things straight. They are a sight to behold. However, the novelty of them ""transforming"" grows old after the first few times. It's one thing if they change quickly from robot to vehicle or vice versa. It's quite another to have long tracking shots of every little piece of these things reforming. We know ILM can do amazing CG work. We don't need it drilled into our heads. As characters, none of the Transformers is particularly interesting. They learned to speak English by watching TV. (Obviously they got the idea from watching Splash. At least they're as smart as mermaids) So they all have their own ""personalities"". The wise leader, the shoot first/ask questions later hothead, and the token urban Transformer. The villains...well...they growl a lot. They also like to say their names a lot. To be fair, there are couple of great action scenes. A chase between a Decepticon police car and the hero Camaro called Bumblebee is fun, and an aerial battle between an evil Decepticon called Starscream, and a pack of military fighters is quick and inventive. There's also a nice final throw down between the leader of the of the Autobots, Optimus Prime, and the Decepticon leader Megatron. However it is not enough to sustain this movie for it's run time. This is a good 90 minute movie, with 60 minutes of filler, useless characters, childish humor (did we really need TWO urination jokes?), and inane plot devices. If you grew up on Transformers, well then I guess your time is here. It's probably everything you want in a movie. For a movie lover, like myself, it's yet another in a long string of summer movies that are long on hype, and short on delivery. What's worse is, all the best parts are in the preview..and the worst part of all...it's something that I don't care if I ever see again. If non-Tranformers fan boy thinks as I do, and I suspect a lot will, that will not bode well for the movies box office after what I'm sure will be a HUGE opening weekend. But hey...par for the course this summer. Too bad Michael Bay, except for this and Pearl Harbor, I like your movies."

","Great visual effect, Great comedy, and lots of action, what more do you need? <br/><br/>Transformers is one of the few movies that managed not to take itself very seriously, even though it could and the storyline seem to ask for it. It is full of comedic moments and I find myself laughing almost throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The only bad thing might be it drags a little towards the end. I mean, come on, we already know who's going to win and who's going to lose; there's no point on dragging the battle. The battle look amazing though. <br/><br/>The visual effect was simply amazing.

","Transformers - I have to admit was not terrible as I had anticipated. I found myself absorbed, if not completely, in the story but most importantly.<br/><br/>As you would expect from a Michael Bay film, lots nay LOTS of action - a lacking yet entertaining script filled with many tacky and highly laughable one liners (that are completely infectious and you find yourself, hours after the movie ends quoting Megatron or Optimus Prime) - also incredibly handsome men running around the screen, along with their almost always half naked woman.<br/><br/>Again, the movie though entertaining and a good way to spend two hours (or more - honestly I was too involved in the movie I didn't even notice that I went in the theater at 8:30 and got out at 11). Keep in mind however this movie is not for everyone. If you are that kind of movie goer that hates feeling out of the loop, or feel like a nerd for going to a movie about robots modeled after a toy which was a TV series (like I did at some times).<br/><br/>Funny.

Without a doubt, the visuals in this film are the main attraction, and ILM clearly made every effort to impress to create one of the best animation to live action films in the recent or distant memory. The human cast is exceptional Shia Lebaouf is humorous and more impressively believable, Megan Fox nor Josh Duhamel are hard on the eyes, but pull more than just eye candy out of this adventure film.

You can complain about the smaller details (government representation, John Voigt) but the story was great (realistic as it can be) the CGI was amazing. I wasn't totally convinced of Shia L's abilities (being so highly touted), but you can definitely see how he can be considered one of Hollywood's up and coming.

"amf101","9","0","3","3 July 2007"," Transformers really is more than meets the eye.
","Going into Transformers I had a lot of preconceived notions of what the film would be like, quite frankly I was expecting a lot. I am pleased to say that I was overall happy with the result. I, like a lot of the fans, was wiry about how much Michael Bay changed the look of the robots but once the movie starts you don't really notice it. In Transformers there a three main ingredients action, jokes, and good CGI. The plot kind of gets lost in the mix. This movie is the definition of a fun summer popcorn flick; witch is Bay's specialty. <br/><br/>Overall the movie works. But, the name of the film is Transformers, and for some reason, (I'm guessing budgetary) the Transformers themselves aren't the movie a whole lot. The majority of them show up halfway through the movie. A few of the good guys get decent screen time and character development, that being Optimus Prime and Bumblebee. But the rest of the Autobots are relegated to bit parts. Optimus introduces all the Autobots to Sam, describing their function within the group and that's all the back-story Ironhide, Ratchet, and Jazz get. Furthermore they only get a few lines each, I guess to add insult to injury. Worse, the Decepticons get even less back-story that the Autobots do. Megatron and Starscream have a few lines each, but it seems the most prominently featured Decepticon is Frenzy. All of the other Decepticons are left out in the cold, they are just there to blow stuff up.<br/><br/>The plot itself is not too complicated and it's easy to follow. The story is good enough to get to the next action sequence and really, that's all it needs to do. Big robot fighting another big robot and so on. And lets face it that's the real reason that people are going to the movie anyway. Just like in other Bay films (Bad Boy, Bad Boys 2, Armageddon) the joke are interspersed with the action and it plays well for the most part. Its shot with his signature style and edited that way to. So, if you don't like his style of shooting, you'll probably not like this movie either. Personally, I'm a fan of Bays work, and this kind of movie is where his talent shows,its his best film since 1996's The Rock. The car chases, stuff blowing up, and style all come together well.<br/><br/>As a whole the film generates more cheers than jeers. I was only really disappointed with a few things, one in particular, ***WARNING Spoilers*** the death of Jazz was pointless. I felt that it was just thrown in there because ""hey we need some Autobot to die, it might as well be him"". I didn't want to see any of the Autobots die. Even thought they said he couldn't be saved, I hope that they will find some way to fix him up for any possible sequels. And while were talking about sequels (Yes, the movie sets itself up for another one) have more screen time for the robots since that's what everyone is going there for in the first place."

","Transformers is an awesome movie that is way different from the cartoons in a good way(though I probably say that partially to the fact I hate the cartoons a lot) and was actually a really good film. When I saw they were making a new Transformers movie I just went ""no way in hell am I seeing that movie"" but when I saw that Steven Spielburg did it I thought that it might no be that bad so I went and saw it and it was even better then I ever could have thought as it had good action, comedy lots of things good about it. I guess though it proves though that you can not judge a movie by it's name. Overall I think that movie is great there is a couple of floors but really it is an awesome movie so I rate it 89%."
"Legendary_Badass","8","0","2","2 July 2007"," A visually astonishing film that will please fans but lacks consistency
","Michael Bay brings Hasbro's popular toy line to the silver screen in 2007's Transformers, a visually astonishing film hindered by unbalanced performances and questionable stylistic choices.<br/><br/>For those of you who weren't a child in the mid to late '80s there needs to be an introduction. Transformers are beings which are not robots despite being mechanical. They are best described as humans made of metal. Each has a personality and an ability to ""transform"" into a much less interesting everyday device. This allows them to hide, and in the case of the film, gives some believability to their existence on Earth. Their home planet is at war. On one side are the Autobots, the honorable protectors of the galaxy. In this film's case, they appear to be sponsored by GM as each of them masquerades as a vehicle produced by the company. Fighting against the Autobots are the Decepticons. Their purpose is to destroy everything be it Autobot or human. Both sides are looking for a cube called the Allspark which can bring life to electronic devices. Just so happens that this device has landed on Earth and their eternal struggle for it is resurfacing in present day. When a lone Decepticon causes a stir in the desert by hacking the army's intel, the Secretary of Defense (Jon Voight), must coordinate between Sergeant Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and a savvy technician (Rachel Taylor) to find the one human (LaBeouf) who unknowingly processes the key to finding the Allspark.<br/><br/>Let's get to the strengths. Transformers is essentially The Terminator with different robots. This isn't a bad thing, as people are going to see this film just for the robots. LaBeouf's character is basically caught in a chase as he is protected by one powerful source while another pursues him. Most of the acting is strong. LeBeouf is especially strong as the lead. The special effects are not just contenders but a hands downs Academy Award winner if ever there was one. Few films in this decade offer visuals that are truly unique. We have all seen spells, ghosts, and dragons. Here we have a unique franchise that showcases vehicles changing into robots. These robots look absolutely incredible. Adding to their believability is the fact they are designed to be composed out of everyday materials. The artists of Transformers have recreated these materials using computer effects in a manner no other film has accomplished. To my eyes, cars coming to life with spot on real glass and polished doors, look far more real than any contrived squid or suited superhero because we are so familiar with these common items.<br/><br/>Some of the best moments in Transformers are provided to please fans. Hearing the iconic Optimus Prime speak with his original cartoon voice-over supplied by Peter Cullen is a good move in this area. Having him pull double duty with an opening voice-over, subtracts from the impact that could have been when Prime first rolls onto the scene. There is plenty of Autobot on Decepticon action to keep fans happy as well, and the art design of most of the bots expands on the original toy line and cartoon without alienating them.<br/><br/>I felt that some of the actors were playing roles outside of the film. John Turturro's agent Simmons struck me as a pointless agent of comic relief in a mostly serious film. His character's lines are so far from natural that I was confused as to whether or not he himself was a robot in disguise. That's the way comedy is supplied in Transformers. It isn't funny, it is just over the top and out of place. Most characters realize that there are dire stakes on the line while others are focused on being nonsensical. This isn't limited to actors, as one Decepticon (Frenzy), is wretched with sound effects, animations, and a corky voice; making it the most annoying digital character since Jar Jar Binks.<br/><br/>This isn't the worst choice by director Bay in the picture, but it is tied with others for that honor. Rock music enters amidst action sequences which seconds earlier had a nice dramatic score. There are also several elegantly high concept shots, and some that leave something to be desired. These examples showed me a lack of consistency. This was very distracting because the tone of the film left me scratching my head. I wasn't sure if this was a comedy, auctioneer, or part drama. Transformers has an abundance of elements which are loosely tied together, and that is what makes it difficult to categorize and fully accept.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the robot effects are hard to pass up when they are done this well, and no one is going to head to this flick truly expecting anything else. I have to recommend Transformers for fans of the toy line and animated series as well as anyone seeking stellar visuals."

","The first thing I have to saw is ""WOW!"" I've never really been a fan of transformers, but my buddy begged me to go see this with him, so I finally agreed to go and let me say I was very pleasantly surprised. About 30 minutes in I turned to my buddy and said ""Allright, you win. this movie kicks a**!""I expected it to be quite kiddy but i was entirely wrong; this is a movie that people of all ages can enjoy even if they aren't a fan (like I was, although I certainly am now).<br/><br/>I haven't been very pleased with anything else I've seen by Michael Bay, but that's just another surprise, he finally figured out how to make a good movie! The CGI was amazing, and Shia Lebouef did a much better job than I expected; this might be the movie that makes his career huge! Not to mention Megan Fox's name is completely appropriate; a good looking girl who isn't a bad actor is always a welcome addition to a great movie. The movie also had a good mix of humor and romance, when the Autobots weren't fighting they seemed like a bunch of knuckleheads.<br/><br/>The movie had a very good plot indeed, with a twist or two at the ending i didn't expect (watch the credits! there's an extra scene in there that might be pretty important!). A slightly clichÃ© (but nun the less appreciated by me) theme is that the average looking funny guy gets the smokin babe in the end by saving the day. The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10/10 was that there are a few scenes at the beginning and end where Optimus Prime is talking that are just plain cheesy; the movie really could have done without them.<br/><br/>This is definitely one of the best movies of the summer, and i can't wait for the sequel. This movie never has a boring moment! So from someone who was originally a skeptic, ""JUST GO SEE THE FREAKIN' THING ALREADY! WHAT ARE YOU DOING STILL READING THIS? GO TO UR LOCAL THEATERS NOW!"""
"sanfordrm","8","0","2","2 July 2007"," Overall Grade: B
","I enjoyed this movie, but had two issues. The first is more of a warning or concern. The second is more of a personal film preference.<br/><br/>First of all, there seems to be a trend in films over the past few years to give the PG-13 rating to any big budget film that has a 99% chance of being on the ""Must Watch"" list of any group of 10-year olds, regardless if it needs it or not. With marketing targeted at pre-pubescent viewers, it can be hard to justify NOT taking your little ones to a highly anticipated film if exposure to it is everywhere. This film, however, can make the exception. For the first time in a long while, the MPAA has gotten it right. This film earns its rating as a lot of the action violence and dialogue are not appropriate for younger audiences. There is a fair amount of swearing, and brief discussion of a sexual nature. I would suggest a young couple review this film prior to taking anyone under the age of 12. Parents are the best judges as to whether or not their children are mature enough for this film.<br/><br/>The only other issue I had with this film is the way it was shot. I cannot stand action scenes that are ""intensified"" by a shaking camera. Do directors actually believe an unsteady camera makes the action scenes better? In my opinion, scenes ""enhanced"" this way become too much of a blur to follow what's going on anyway. So why continue doing it? This kind of filming is irritating and headache-inducing. HINT: USE STEADY-SHOT!! Overall, I had a good time with this film. As a fan of the original comics, toys, TV show, and movie from the 1980's, it was fun to get back into that world. This film would have been better if the camera work hadn't given me a migraine."

","Was there any need to make all the other summer blockbusters so bad and terrible when Transformers were gonna blast all of them away? Nay, for Michael Bay has won over his critics with a gritty, and heart-pounding movie that all Transformer fans would love.<br/><br/>Nostalgic fervour aside, the CGI was outta this world, the great action to boot simply complementing. Sound and visuals work in sync, nothing more to say.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf was simply fantastic in his role, in the movie that will propel him to stardom after bit part roles in movies like iRobot. Megan Fox was the flower vase, but just about as hot as BumbleBee's engine. Josh Duhamel suited the action hero role in his first major movie role, and the rest of the cast did well, with just about the right dosage of humour injected.<br/><br/>My only grouse is that there could have been a stronger plot, and the ending was a bit muted and anti-climatic. Megatron and Starscream should have been the villainous stars, but they got too little airtime.<br/><br/>Can't wait for Soundwave to come out in Transformers 2, and maybe being a bit more greedy, how about the DinoBots at that.

"chainmail311","8","0","2","2 July 2007"," VISUALLY STUNNING, but not perfect.
","First off, Micheal Bay has a way with over dramatic dialog, and many ""Oh no he didn't"" come backs. I absolutely hated Armageddon, and there were some scenes of this film that were just kind of lame. But, that was just the screenplay part. Transformers fans? This will be better than Christmas morning! I'm 23, and obviously had the toys, watched the show, etc. The animation and integration of CGI with live action is ABSOLUTELY STELLAR, MIND NUMBINGLY AMAZING, JAW DROPPING, and the over-all WOW effect was used ENTIRELY too much. I had my jaw drop on several occasions, and just couldn't believe what had been accomplished on film in this piece. The standards have been raised VERY high, and this is the absolute best CGI I've ever seen. (I'm a wanna be animator.) Rewatchability is VERY VERY high on this film. (Although some, not ALL acting was horrible. I hate the whole ""upstage"" the government mentality that Micheal Bay creates in all his films. It's a horrible staple, but he made up for it with the incredible explosions and action. I hate to give this film an 8, but it's a ""get out there immediately and see this film"" 8. If the screenplay had been a little bit less corny, I would have 9'd it."

","I just got back from a pre-showing of Transformers in my hometown, and even though I was born a little to early to ever watch the Transformers cartoons, I have to say that that movie was one of the coolest movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>At a quick glance at the actors in the movie, I was a little skeptical. Shia and Tyrese? Seriously? But thankfully after halfway through the movie I disreguarded the fact that these two have been in way to many B movies to count, and finally landed a decent roll that they filled well.<br/><br/>But let's be honest, who gives a rat's ass about the actors. It's all about the Transformers. And boy did they look frikin sweet. I don't think I've seen better CGI. The action is seriously intense and just plain mindblowing. Applause Applause.<br/><br/>The comedy is good but in my opinion there was a little to much of it, but at least it wasn't cheezy comedy. Overall the movie is definitely not just made for the Transformers geeks, its for everyone. There are some easter eggs in the movie that only Transformer fans will get, but it will not ruin the fun. Michael Bay didn't set out to make this movie to win awards, he made it for one reason, and in my opinion, the only reason that movies should be made for; entertainment. And Transformers does exactly that."
"donstuie","8","0","2","28 June 2007"," Michael Bay, I was wrong
","Yes, I was one of those guys who thought this movie was doomed when Bay's name was mentioned. How wrong I was.<br/><br/>What a ****ing spectacular movie! Forget the rest, THIS is the movie extravaganza of the year, and without a doubt redeems Michael Bay in my eyes. As one of those fanboys who's bile caught in my throat when I heard Bay was the man in charge, I now humbly admit my mistake.<br/><br/>The film begins in spectacular fashion, with a brief voice-over from Optimus Prime going over the basics to get us going, followed by the attack on the army base in the middle east that we have seen in trailers. This opening scene for me is one of the most visually spectacular openings I've witness, and had great tension, followed by incredible action. It really gets you into the headspace for what to expect from this movie.<br/><br/>We then meet Sam Witwicky (Lebouf), who is searching for his first car with his old man (again, as seen in the trailer), with a great cameo from Bernie Mac. Lebouf is actually very strong in this film, and expertly plays the uncomfortable teen who at first seems out of his depth with what is happening around him, but gradually grows as the film progresses. As for Megan Fox, well, let's just say she had very little to do other than get dirty and sweaty, and occasionally show some girl power. Considering the subject matter, performances are pretty solid throughout. Especially from Turturro who plays what can only be described as a ****ing nut-job CIA type. Yes there is some tacky dialogue, way-too-obvious product placement and stuff that has you rolling your eyes in disbelief, but at the same time there is some great humour and really poignant moments at times. I thought the acting was perfect for the type of film this is.<br/><br/>But enough about the meatbags, onto the real stars. Visually these guys look incredible. Some of the best VFX you will ever see in a movie, and the action sequences left me speechless. My only beef is that we don't see a whole lot of the decepticons after the first 1/3 of the film, and Megatron and Starscream only appear at the end. Much more time is devoted to the autobots, and perhaps a bit too much time. But I can't lie and say I didn't feel giddy seeing that blue truck entering through the smokey darkness. The climax of the film is a sight to behold, as the autobots and decepticons tear the **** out of central LA. Overall the visual effects and action are truly unbelievable, and still have me more than a little speechless. I suggest you go and see for yourself.<br/><br/>No doubt this film will have its haters, but I absolutely loved every second of it. It was most definitely Transformers in body and spirit."

","When the movie began it felt like a serious modern war movie here, not unlike Black Hawk Down or Jarhead or something of that sort. But then when that the Scorpion robot showed up, there was no mistaking this movie at all. <br/><br/>What can you expect from Michael Bay but the best action sequences. He is really a master of action movies (""The Rock"", ""Armageddon""). All very close-up with bone-crushing detail. Very impressive robot effects, whether the small Frenzy (who turned into a CD player on Air Force One) or the gigantic Optimus Prime, all are very realistic! Great looking vehicles all around. A great man's movie overall. Add to that the palpable sentiments of loyalty and heroism.<br/><br/>Interesting back story about an explorer in the Arctic Circle at the turn of the 20th century to connect to present hero Sam (Shia LaBeouf) and the very presence of the Transformers here on Earth. <br/><br/>There's also humor in a lot of scenes. Notably the scenes where Bumblebee helps Sam score with Mikaela with some well-timed cheesy 70s and 80s love songs on the radio. Also the scenes when Sam's parents barge into Sam's room while the Autobots are impatiently waiting in the garden.<br/><br/>One of the most entertaining movies overall this season.

","I can't remember the last time I felt genuinely entertained watching a movie like this. I had a lot of expectations for this film (especially with all the hype and anticipation surrounding it) and I'm very glad to say that (for me, at least) it really delivers! This is definitely one of those movies that set out to entertain you and does a wonderful job doing so. It's not perfect, but it's definitely worth your while and your money.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of the Transformers universe and mythology, but of course I still did want to see this movie for the same reason that everyone out there wants to see this movie: The Robots, The Action, The Story. The Transformers Universe is filled with all sorts of wildly interesting characters and story lines that would make a great movie, and I must say that the producers (Tom DeSanto, Don Murphy, Lorenzo di Bonaventura and Steven Spielberg), the writers (Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and John Rogers) and director Michael Bay did an incredible job in adapting Transformers for the big screen. That's it!<br/><br/>About the cast: Shia LeBeouf shines in his role as Sam Witwicky. I believe that his performance made the movie all the more funny and credible at the same time. NOW I understand why he's in the next Indiana Jones movie... <br/><br/>The storyline was also quite interesting; all the action and plot twists were properly integrated in the film though to some small degree, parts of the movie were predictable. Thankfully, there were only a couple of scenes which I thought slowed the movie down. But who cares about these things? (grin) I must particularly mention the humor and atmosphere of the movie. Even without the robots on screen, the movie manages to hold your attention with its humor and dialogue. Also, there's something for everybody! For those delving into the Transformers universe for the first time, they will find the story and characters very much interesting while fans of the cartoons, comics and toy line will definitely be blown away with the most important elements of the film: The Autobots and the Decepticons.<br/><br/>So how were the robots and the action? All I can say is that those guys at ILM must have been working day and night just to deliver the stunning visual effects of the movie... All the robots were beautifully rendered and the action scenes were topnotch! I have never seen visual effects so detailed and so seamlessly integrated into live-action environments and elements. The groundbreaking things they have done on this movie will definitely have to be admired and commended. The ending was carefully thought of All I can say is that you'll leave the theater surely wanting for more<br/><br/>So to sum it all up, Transformers will definitely be the must-see film for the summer movie season of 2007.

","I'm from the Philippines and I've seen this movie twice already. I'm going to watch this again for the third time. . .(and now) with my parents. I'm gonna bring them and surely (100%)they'll enjoy.<br/><br/>This is one heck of a movie. It's really AWESOME! Better than all Spider-man movies combined. The special effects/CGI is superb...i have to commend all the people behind this movie especially the director Michael Bay and one of the Executive producers, Steven Spielberg for making this spectacular movie. The story is simple and straight forward which the audience can follow through from start to finish. And the acting performance of the cast (especially Shia LaBeouf) is also great. Action packed and funny. Never had a dull moment.<br/><br/>It's a cinematic feat par excellence! Transformers RULES!"

","I'm not a 'hard core' fan of the old transformers. I was a little young to grasp all of it back in the 80's, though I did have my fare share of the toys. Prime, Megatron, bumblebee are names I have known.<br/><br/>So, I was a little excited when I heard they were going to make a movie and even more excited when I heard my favorite director - Micheal Bay - was helming the project.<br/><br/>But nothing I say here, or what ANY one writes or tells you, can describe what you will wittiness in that darkened room.<br/><br/>It's like nothing you have ever seen before.<br/><br/>And not only the giant robots stole the show. It may be a surprise, but all the 'human' actors were very, very good. Which, in my opinion, is a rare thing in a film like this.<br/><br/>I could go on and on about this film but I don't want to give anything away.<br/><br/>All in all: Funny, exciting, scary, thoughtful, visually stunning, well directed movie. One to watch on a big screen surrounded by other movie goers.<br/><br/>Get off your PC and go see it now.<br/><br/>And then go see it again!"
"The-Chief","10","0","6","30 June 2007"," Wow!
","Just saw the movie, and can i say, its one of the best movie i have seen. I recommend ALL see it. I also take back every bad word i have ever said about Michael bay. Its a masterpiece. People who were worried about this movie can relax. I for one was worried about how the transformers would look. I was blown away, they all looked pretty good. Especially Prime, however Bay and his team allayed my concerns. The score is also very very good, i especially liked the part when the autobots are coming. The fight scene's are pretty well constructed. My only criticism (and this is purely personal) was frenzy got on my nerves a bit by the end of the film. I can't wait for the sequel, which after this effort there most certainly will be one!"

","I just watched the movie and let me just say, SUPERB!!!! If it were like put together Xmen 1,2,3, Spiderman 1,2,3, and The Matrix 1,2,3, still cant match this Transformers and those are my favorite movies too!! Its been 2 days opening in Malaysia and yet the ticket still sold out. I have to sit in the second row from the screen and my neck and eyes hurts. But it ALL WORTH IT!!! I will definitely watch it again for a couple of time this week and next week. Cant wait for the next one coming out!<br/><br/>I totally agree with chrishayes737 that wrote :<br/><br/>I have just come back from a preview screening in Wellington New Zealand & I can tell you now that this movie raises the bar on all before it - the story , special effects , acting , pacing were all top notch but oh my god the action was non stop ! . I went to the movie not knowing much about the history of transformers & now I have been transformed "" this movie is the best so far this year by quite a margin "" , go see it you won't be disappointed "" not at all "" . One of the things I liked was the humor & it worked very well in the context of the film - there was allot of laugh out loud moments , People just wait till the end climax of the film it is the most awesome special effects action sequence ever put together on film . This movie is 10/10 no question about that ."
"Avalanche_33","9","0","6","29 June 2007"," In a word: INCREDIBLE!!
","Seeing this movie last night down here in Melbourne, I was eagerly anticipating what Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg had done in their recreation of an excellent cartoon series that I passionately followed whilst I was growing up in the '80s. I was certainly hoping that the huge queues were worth the wait!! Be you a fan of the series or not, the introduction to the movie was brilliant and really set the scene so that everyone in the audience knew the basic ""history"" of how the Autobots and Decepticons came into being, and how they've ended up on Earth. This also ties together very well with Optimus Prime's general demeanour and compassion for humans whilst allowing the audience the opportunity to understand his views concerning the difference between good and evil.<br/><br/>The first scene of battle (perhaps I should change that word to chaos) was set to perfection, showing exactly what the Decepticons were capable of, and also allowing all of the human actors' roles to come into play. Speaking of which, the casting and acting for this movie was absolutely top-notch, from the main stars all of the way through to supporting actors. Shia LaBeouf is proving himself to be quite a fine actor and carries the wit and humour effortlessly throughout the entire film - he will be a star of the future, without a doubt. You will love the depth of well-known actors in this film and can relate to each and every one of them in some way or another. Surprise performances by Bernie Mac, John ""Sneaky Sneaky"" Turturro, Amaury Nolasco (Sucre from Prison Break) and Anthony Anderson were highly welcomed by the entire audience, which was a sell-out. Every single actor played their roles well and played the role as a hero in their own way.<br/><br/>The character development in the first half of the movie tended to drag ""just a little bit"", but fortunately this was compensated by the humour - even the parents get into it quite a bit, and the scenes concerning the backyard proved a hit amongst the audience (you'll know what I mean when you see them).<br/><br/>Near the end of the first hour (I think) you really start seeing the movie hitting it's strides - I actually heard a member of the audience say ""Yep, it's just kicked up a notch"", and it certainly did. The action just doesn't stop until the final credits from that point. Whether you're a fan or not of the cartoon series, you will thoroughly enjoy the film, which has a little bit of everything: action, humour, romance and excellent special effects which will literally blow your mind. It was great to see Optimus' flaming sword make an appearance that doesn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Even the characteristics (and facial expressions!!) of the robots are brought into the film. Jazz's humour and likability, Ironhide's intolerance of humans, Ratchett's intelligence, and Starscream's wishes to be the leader of the Decepticons (whilst always acting subservient to Megatron). Fans of the series - listen for the catch phrases of ""Roll Out!!"", ""Decepticons Attack!!"" and ""You wanna piece of me?"". :-) I particularly enjoyed the use of music at various parts of the film - who would've thought that ""Baby Come Back"" could have been used so well?<br/><br/>Above all, enjoy, but I would recommend a word of caution though - this film IS NOT for young children at all. I could imagine quite a lot of youngsters ending up having nightmares for a few evenings after watching this film, with Decepticon screams going through their heads (especially when Shia LaBeouf comes face-to-face with one of the Deceptacons)."
"kenlcc","9","0","6","29 June 2007"," for you wise-arses out there who gave this movie only 1 star
","Most people who comment on this title gave average to very good ratings, so there's not much to say about this movie, everything i need to say can be found in these comments, so i wrote this comment for you wise-arses out there who gave this movie only 1 star rating.<br/><br/>IF YOU ARE SO FULL OF SHAITE AND THINKS YOU CAN DO BETTER IF GIVEN THE CHANCE TO PRODUCE THIS MOVIE AGAIN, CAN YOU ACTUALLY MAKE A BETTER ONE THAN THIS????????? i didn't go through the comments which has average to good ratings, but i read through all the most hated ones and found out most of them are complaining about bad story and no in-depth character exploration and stuff. I only need to ask you this, how long is the cartoon series and how long is this movie? there's your answer.....by making a cartoon series into a movie IS NOT POSSIBLE! it just takes too long to build up all the character development and shXt, even if you make it into 3 movies like LOTR, you won't have enough space to fit all those things in, and i'm glad they didn't. And about story line, it's the same as character build up, it's just too much to tell. The story of the movie is like a compressed version of the original cartoon series, think about it and you'll find a similarity.<br/><br/>If you complaint so much then go make your own Transformers movie and we'll see which is better, and don't be talking/complaining/comparing about budget and money and shXt like that because you guys have all the brains in the world, getting a few million bucks to make a movie won't be that hard is it???"
"rythaiguy","9","0","6","29 June 2007"," Great Movie!
","Got to see this movie on the 29th of June in Thailand. Already released here but not in the USA. This movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and is a great Action flick with some unreal special effects. It's need the length to fully detail all that is about to happen later in the movie. Really Enjoyed it! The actors involved do a pretty good job and the storyline was to me well thought out and convincing. Have not seen Fantastic 4 - Silver Surfer yet, But from what I have heard this movie definitely has a better plot line and special effects and they look dramatically real. I would suggest to anyone looking for a great Action - Sci-Fi Flick to definitely go see this movie. Too Bad in Thailand movie s are only $3.00 not the outrageous $10.00 to $12.00 as in the USA."
"stozer0202","8","0","6","29 June 2007"," Watch for Armageddon
","Transformers started here on Wed 27th June at 23:55, great movie but lots of action from standing view, so get a seat from middle of cinema and watch out for references to Armageddon, another Bay movie and a $4th July independence movie (can't wait for next years), he must have DVD shares for Armageddon as it is mentioned a couple of times and the end scene location is from Armageddon love scene ""Gazelle and Lion"" on Liv Tylers Hills of Africa. Overall , this movie is a great stepping off point for the younger generation looking towards a more watchable style of movie until they are allowed into the (MA+) and (R) slasher flicks, many hardcore fanatics are going to trash it for all its tie-ins, but bang-for-buck ($150 million) you can't make this sort of movie without corporate help, maybe #2 will quell the lashing and screams of sell-out and corporate lackey, after all it is a Hasbro product to begin with.... BRING ON VOLTRON"
"photocyn1","9","0","6","29 June 2007"," Great movie but why be crude?
","Thought the movie was very fun. It followed the cartoon well and even included many of the fun phrases used. Thought they blended the actors and the robots very well. I liked the plot and was entertained by the movie as a whole. My only objection was I wondered why they needed to include a crude scene in the movie. The one in the bedroom between the Mom and Dad and the son. I think that those subjects should be left for parents to discuss with their kids. In my mind it didn't add anything to the movie. I will have to think long and hard before I will be able to let my kids see this movie because of that scene, which it sad because I felt the movie was very entertaining and fun."

","I saw this about 12 hours ago and I'm still suffering shock - <br/><br/>This movie was AWESOME!!!!! Everything was, pure and simple, an adrenalin rush right from the get go. The acting was just great, real crisp, the story wasn't deep but enjoyable and the action... well...this movie just says MICHAEL BAY all over. PLEASE don't listen to the hard core fanboys and bay haters, they are seriously missing out on the best experience of their lives.<br/><br/>This movie will make you laugh and just stare in awe as you witness the best movie in many years.<br/><br/>If you enjoy popcorn munchers like badboys 2 and Armageddon (all bay's)and others then this will surely blow you away. Don't expect an unbelievably deep story and you will enjoy this.<br/><br/>Two thumbs up, 10/10 the works, this is AWESOME!!!!"
"joeysantos_29","9","0","6","29 June 2007"," If there is such a thing as a SUPER POPCORN MOVIE, this is it. WATCH THIS FILM.
","Transformers, the title alone gives goosebumps of years gone by when I drooled at the toys and worshiped the cartoons. Did the movie stay true to the original storyline? Short answer. NO. Do not watch this film if you're expecting to see the Transformers of our younger years. Was it bad because of lack of ""authenticity""? Again, short answer. NO. But fan-boys would probably flog me for saying that.<br/><br/>Michael Bay, and thankfully because of Steven Spielberg's involvement, made a winner here.<br/><br/>The story is simple enough, it revolves around the battle of the Autobots vs the Decepticons in finding the ALLSPARK, the source of their life. It's like their creator of sorts. Somehow, by some miracle of cosmic magnitude, the ALLSPARK gets its way to Earth and our favorite robots found out. There are a lot of exiting moments, especially during the first moments of ""transformations"". There are also dull moments, like the part when everybody was looking for a certain object to find the ALLSPARK. Not everybody will get the jokes. And some scenes were really not necessary. The rest, as they say, you need to pay to know. This ain't no spoiler review.<br/><br/>The acting was above average, but not Oscar worthy of course. Who in their right mind will expect Oscar quality acting at a Summer extravaganza that is the Transformers. Although, notable acting was done by Shia LaBeouf, who plays Sam 'Spike' Witwicky. Jon Voight and John Turturro were just doing the rounds on this one. Before I forget, Megan Fox is a, well, Fox. As if that isn't cliché enough.  You can tell they didn't even break a sweat. The rest, well, they were just there for the scenes where the robots weren't involved.<br/><br/>As far as the Transformers' ""Transformers"" acting goes, kudos goes to Optimus Prime and Bumblebee. Prime as we all know, is voiced by Peter Cullen. The original, the granddaddy, the mastah. The rest of the robots shall I say, just looked really, really cool. I  hope the sequel shows more of the other robots' personalities, because this one certainly didn't.  And believe me, there would be a sequel to this.<br/><br/>The effects, without a doubt, is the best special effects I've seen in any film. Better than all six Star Wars Episodes, better than the Spiderman franchise and better than The Lord of the Rings and Matrix trilogies. It's that good. Once you see the Autobots and Decepticons in all shades of light, you'll definitely know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>If there is such a thing as an SUPER POPCORN MOVIE, this is it. WATCH THIS FILM. In fact, I'm going to watch it again later."
"oldman007","9","0","7","28 June 2007"," Wow! What a great ""transformation"" ride!
","I just went to go and see this movie today. From the second it started it was action packed! There was over 70 minutes of nonstop action. I never really got into the TV series. Seeing it live action was much better in my opinion. Every corner had something to laugh at too. The black guy that owned the car store was hilarious. As was Anthony Anderson! Every single black person in this movie was hilarious! Except for the Military guy. He was serious. But this film had great action and great laughs. This is one of the most funnest action films i've ever been too! Don't believe the haters. It's a very fun action film! I'm definitely going to get this on DVD when it comes out! I give this movie a 9/10!"
"guerillagorilla","10","0","7","28 June 2007"," MUCH more than meets the eye...
","Somewhere, someone in the upper echelons of some toy factory is finally having their day. They had to have thought that toys that could transform from diesel trucks and sports cars to giant robots would make a good impact beyond the TV screen. They had a go at it in 1986 with the animated ""Transformers: The Movie"", but now, CG technology has caught up with the toys and has given to us a live-action ""Transformers"".<br/><br/>What we have here is an action-packed, non-stop wall-to-wall thriller. A movie so aptly named has a whole lot of transforming going on, and some of it happens so fast that the viewer is still piecing it all together through the following scenes.<br/><br/>With all due respect to other 2007 big summer hits that have been released so far, like ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"", ""Oceans Thirteen"", and ""Spiderman 3"", ""Transformers"" is the one that packs in as much of the action and comedy that's possible in a 130 minute stuff-goes-boom movie. Whenever the action would slow up enough to relax the audience and allow some funny stuff to happen, some scenes induced such hearty laughter that my sides would ache until the action revved back up.<br/><br/>This was the first PR screening I had attended in quite some time, and it reminded me of why I believe it's a better experience than the general release. It's free, obviously. More importantly, it's guaranteed that most in attendance are at least casual fans of the subject matter and most importantly...the atmosphere is electric because there is crowd reaction. Accompanied with raucous applause is the beginning, key scenes, and end of the show. Big reveals are met with theatre-wide gasps and groans of anticipation. And every time the signature sound of a transformation occurred, there were nuts in the crowd (such as me) that would gleefully cackle. With that...<br/><br/>I have to admit. I was childishly hoping to find some Solstice in the parking lot transform into an Autobot. Laugh it up, Hasbro and Michael Bay...""Transformers"" will bring out the die hard fan or inner child in just about everyone. There is much more here than meets the eye!<br/><br/>""Transformers"" gets a perfect 10 of 10 stars."
