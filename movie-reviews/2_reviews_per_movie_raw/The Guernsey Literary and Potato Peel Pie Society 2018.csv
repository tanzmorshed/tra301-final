","I was intrigued by the title so thought give it a go. disappointingly there were no special effects, explosions or alien monsters just a simple story relayed to us by actors of all things,because of all this it will not qualify for any awards other than my own lowly opinion.
I laughed I cried, became angry and gave it the accolade of the best film I have seen for a long time, whatever tosh other people may say about this tale I enjoyed it, so lets have some more films with a story to tell without the bangs and bloodbaths"

","I declare a vested interest as I am a Guernseyman who has lived here all my life. The film is very entertaining, well acted and interesting. I recommend it as a love story with a Guernsey historic background that is reasonably accurate. Sadly the film was not shot in Guernsey for various reasons and although the scenery is lovely to look at it's not as beautiful as our Island. Come and visit Guernsey and enjoy our Island."
"CineMuseFilms","8","122","135","25 April 2018"," a tale of friendship, romance, and love of literature
","There are so many levels on which one can enjoy the curiously titled The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society (2018)that describing the film is a challenge. Like many British period dramas, it has an epic quality in how it reflects on the world as it was in the 1940s. Sumptuously filmed and beautifully acted, it blends historical insight into a finely-crafted tale of mystery and romance.<br/><br/>Other than history buffs, most people would be unaware that German troops occupied the British Channel Islands of Guernsey and Jersey in 1940-45. Many Island children were evacuated to England just prior to the occupation and the invasion encountered virtually no military resistance. Under Nazi rule, many Islanders were sent to forced labour and concentration camps in Germany and all farm produce was confiscated for military use. The film opens with a group of Islanders out after curfew, having enjoyed an illicit roast pig and home-brewed gin even though strict food rationing was in place. Facing immediate arrest, they concoct an excuse about being members of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society who have been enriching their minds while feeding on potato peels, as the Fuhrer would want. From this serendipitous moment, a local tradition is born.<br/><br/>Switching to 1946, we meet Juliet Ashton (Lily James) a successful writer living comfortably in London and pondering ideas for her next book. Pursued by a wealthy American suitor, she enjoys the giddy glamour of a British high society that is rebuilding after the war. A letter from a member of the Guernsey Literary Society excites her interest and she soon travels to the Island to learn more. She becomes enchanted with its idyllic village life and rural tranquillity and how each member of the Society has their own wartime story to tell. There is also a new romance simmering where least expected, as well as guarded secrets and strong resistance to a book being written about them.<br/><br/>This simple plotline understates the multiple sub-stories that are a montage of war-time Guernsey, including dark themes of Nazi collaboration, the trauma of children separated from families, and uplifting themes about how literature can bring people together across time and space. The original novel on which the film is based was framed around letters between Juliet and Society members, so the film's timeframes shift frequently but with seamless continuity. There are several charming exchanges about writers and novels that you would expect from lovers of literature. The filming aesthetic evokes the era with authenticity, while Lily James and the ensemble cast are superb.<br/><br/>Some might say that this story is told through a soft-focus lens, mediated through the gentility of Juliet's privileged life and self-indulgent curiosity about the lives of others. That may be so, but her narrative perspective accentuates the world of difference between war-time London and Guernsey. Without such insights, the story would be just a warm-hearted melodrama. But the film offers much more than that. It is an engaging detective story, a study of survival under wartime occupation, and a tale of friendship, romance, and love of literature."

Filled with charming and lovable characters, shot in a beutiful island with beautiful scenery, heartwarming story about love, family and friendship, now i find myself tempted to read the novel just to spend more time with those characters, i feel like a mini series formula would have been better for this adoptation of the novel though, rather than a 2 hours movie which leaves you just wanting more.

","This film adaptation of a popular novel may be a mouthful of a title, yet the film is made with heart and soul and its very entertaining. It is a sweet, well-shot and well-acted nostalgic post-war drama. Lily James does well as she can with her rather unlikely character, the supporting cast are solid and the script is good as well. Fans of old-fashioned romances need look no further. The thoroughly delightful cast, the handsome period design make also a good enough movie but the film is directed by Mike Newell, who made one of the greatest romantic movies, ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" so we expected even more. The result is a film that, while perfectly enjoyable with its English charm, becomes a nostalgic and superficial as the title suggests it is going to be."

","Having read the book and loved the book I was a little hesitant to watch the film as often film adaptations aren't as good as the book. However I was totally blown away by this. Penelope Wilton in particular deserves all the awards cos she acts everyone out of the park. Lily James and Michiel Huisman also are brilliant as the leads. They have able support form Tom Courtenay and Katherine Parkinson as well as the child actors. What I loved most is that the producers, writers and director stuck to the book quite faithfully and didn't change too many plot points. Overall 9.5 stars with half a star knocked for what i felt was a little bit of a rushed ending."
"christianfietz","7","30","40","29 April 2018"," The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society
","It is not often that a beloved novel can be adapted so originally and yet so faithfully. A unique and rather wonderful experience. <br/><br/>Juliet Ashton (Lily James) struggles under the trauma and horror of Post-World-War-Two London until a letter puts her into contact with Dawsey Adams (Michiel Huisman;) a member of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. Soon enough, she finds herself visiting the island and hearing the stories of comfort, love, horror and pure resilience from Guernsey's eccentric inhabitants. <br/><br/>Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows' novel, on which this is based, brought to life one of many untold stories from the War. That story being the NAZI occupation of the English Isles. Writing in the form of letters, it is easy to see how the novel became a personal exploration of the power of storytelling. Indeed, the literary society is a group of friends using reading and friendship as a means of escaping their war-torn situation. Newell is very aware of these powerful themes and works wonders to bring them to the screen. <br/><br/>Much of the film is made up of Guernsey's characters recounting their stories to Juliet, accommodated by flashbacks. There is no minimum of truth poured into these tales to make them relevant and rather confronting. What ties them all together is the resilience of their friendship through these harsh times and what this raw bravery truly accomplished. <br/><br/>Beside these recollections is an old-fashioned love and hope story. Juliet is quick to fall for the island of Guernsey and the friends she finds there. At a time when the people of Guernsey needed new love and support, she provides it with flair. In many ways, this is a story of finding hope out of trauma and love when you have nothing else left.<br/><br/>Even the cinematography of the film resembles these morals. London is grey on the outside and artificially coloured in any delights in presents. Guernsey on the other hand, is presented with rolling mountains and mighty waves crashing against the shore. A breath of fresh air for Juliet and an opportunity for a new beginning for her as much as the society.<br/><br/>Lily James balances realism, horror and hope in her performance as Juliet and her relationships with fellow actors are a credit to her talents. So many actors give wonderous performances that it would be impossible to name them all yet Jessica Brown Findlay needs acknowledging as Elizabeth. Her character serves as an arc of hope during the actual Occupation and she delivers marvellously. <br/><br/>Perhaps the most original aspect of the film comes during the credits. Playing an audio-recording of a meeting of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society brings the film back to its core roots and ties up the rest of the film to a nice conclusion. <br/><br/>Wise, witty, confronting and yet full of heart, The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is a real and wonderful story. The only warning that must be advised to viewers: apparently potato peel pie is not as delightful as the film. Avoid consumption!"

"TheLittleSongbird","7","23","32","23 April 2018"," A nicely baked pie that isn't cooked all the way through but has enough filling to make it edible
","Saw 'The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society' as a fan of period drama, as someone who is trying to watch as many films of the year as possible and who likes a lot of the actors in the cast. It's great enough seeing such talent on their own, and even more of a delight to have so much talent together. <br/><br/>The idea for the story was also very interesting and it was nice to see a film based in a fairly under-explored period of wartime history. The title was not hugely appetising though. Seeing the film with my sister yesterday, found 'The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society' to be a pleasant and well done if falling short of great film. It is engrossing enough and should have enough to appeal to a reasonable sized audience, it may appeal more to older audiences but those who want to know more about this period of wartime history or want to gain some knowledge of it should get something out of it.<br/><br/>Not a perfect film by all means. Will admit to having a good idea of, well actually knowing, how 'The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society' was going to end well before it ended, with the love-related aspect of the story being telegraphed a little too early. <br/><br/>Didn't care for the character of Mark. Despite him serving some point to the story, with a crucial part of the plot being resolved with his involvement, he was rather one-dimensional and didn't have much personality or anything to make one endear to him (he also behaves like a jerk later on). Within the period, he seemed a little out of place. The same goes for how he is played. Matthew Goode's part was also on the underwritten side but he was much easier to like.<br/><br/>Pacing at times could have been tighter, some draggy spots here and there.<br/><br/>However, there is an awful lot to like about 'The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society'. The production values and cast are the biggest selling points. It's a beautifully shot film with very handsomely evocative production and costume design that does give one a real sense of period.<br/><br/>Even better are the cast, with Lily James a charming and very rootable lead and Michiel Huisman cutting a handsome presence. Their chemistry is warm and tender. Tom Courtenay is understated and amusing, having one of the film's best lines near the end, while Penelope Wilton as the most rounded supporting character is heart-wrenching. Jessica Brown Findley is also strong. <br/><br/>Mike Newell does solidly directing, not exceptional but he skilfully stops 'The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society' from being too frothy or too intense. The script is thought-provoking, with some tension and a lot of emotion. The end credits were a lovely touch. A good job is done showing what living in the period and before was like while not being too one-sided. There is genuine emotional power here, with a back-story and main conflict, centring around the consequences of significant loss, that provides a lot of poignancy and hope. <br/><br/>One does feel the love and friendship between the characters and there are some nice revelations along the way in solving this intriguing story where one hopes for a happy outcome to the mystery/mission dominating it. The music, when used, is neither intrusive or too low-key.<br/><br/>In summary, good, pleasant and engaging film that could have been even better. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

The friends wish to add to their library and Dawsey writes to Juliet Ashton (Lily James) a name he's found inside a book by Charles Lamb, requesting the name of a London book shop that might stock further books by that author. <br/><br/>Juliet, a successful writer with a bestseller recently published, is struggling to find inspiration for her next book.

Eben, in the film, is an amalgam of three characters in the book: the fisherman, the postmaster and the islander who thought up the recipe for the very first potato peel pie. <br/><br/>The Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Pie Society is a charming, feel-good romantic drama. There's much to admire: a good story-line, excellent acting, unobtrusive music, a mystery to unravel, touches of humour and a few emotional, teary, tissue-dabbing moments. It's also predictable, minimises the blood and gore from the aircraft attacks in the re-enactments and, at just over two hours, overstays its welcome."

The Second Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. This is a gripping story of one group of people on the Channel Island of Guernsey during the German occupation of world war 2. Sympathetically told, this story shares the horrors that this Island of people went through and how their compassion could lead to their downfall. Bringing together some wonderful actors, the film is set in 1946 with flashbacks to the war years. A writer called Juliet Ashton is drawn to the island by the chance encounter of a farmer and a book that once belonged to her. What follows is a tale of her struggle to discover their stories and the dilemma that faces her on whether to publish their very private experiences or not. It is also a story of love, and of survival. Beautifully shot with scenery well matched to the emotion, this film is a joy to watch. I haven't read the book yet but I can't wait to start."

It wasn't just your average love story wherein two people find each other. It was a love story about a community. How they loved, how they lost, how they survived and stayed strong. It was a love story about a woman finding out where she truly belonged and realizing who she wanted to be. It was a love story about finding unexpected family in people you barely knew. And of course, it was a love story of two people realizing what they meant to each other. So to save time, the writers mostly skipped to that last bit. And in doing so, they robbed ALL the female characters of their strength and confidence. They made them needy and reactive. Not just the lead; ALL of them. If you've not read the book, this movie is a cute and generic romance with all the typical elements Hollywood requires. Nothing memorable for good or ill.

"andy-69219","2","3","3","9 May 2020"," Predictable and dull
","Watching this is like eating pasta without any sauce: it needs something to liven it up. It's a ""nice"" film without any convincing drama or interest. Lily James plays the leading role but without credibility. (The scene in which she is imitating a yawn/stretch at her typewriter reminded me of my own awful rehearsal for my GCSE Drama exam). Unfortunately, there was no depth to this character. Lily James is usually a good actress but I'd guess here that the director, Mike Newell, unwittingly focused on the actress' beauty rather than her acting ability. In one scene, we watch Lily dutifully flutter her eyelids perfectly as she watches a balloon float to the ceiling. There are too many scenes like this, one in particular when one character dubiously offers a pathetic swoon, ""you're beautiful"" and Lily fakes embarrassment. I squirmed with embarrassment myself as I watched their performance in this scene, like so many others in this film. I'd have preferred to focus on the real story of the film - and the one that Lily is researching - which became somehow reduced in importance or supplementary to a cliched love story.
The love story? There's no on-screen chemistry between Lily James and Michiel Huisman, and their story felt mechanically orchestrated rather than genuine.
Overall, I felt the whole performance was quite amateur and the story lacked intrigue or humour to keep me engaged. Apparently, much of the original story was omitted to the detriment of the film and could have ensured adequacy of characters and plot to sustain interest. I did watch it to the end and immediately thought, what a waste of time. Yet the cast is pretty good; it's just that the director has not brought out the best in them or the story. The best performance by far is by Penelope Wilton, whose ice-cold reception at the start is palpable and whose character adapts well to changing circumstances."

Key characters were completely skipped over, and whole plots were added in that made the characters that were once strong and independent, flabby and frivolous.

","In the aftermath of the Second World War, a writer forms an unexpected bond with the residents of Guernsey and the Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. The group of misfit islanders who found a love for books during their occupation by the Germans. Deciding to write a book about the group's experiences during the war, she is met with hostility and mystery uncovering a more dramatic tale of events than she had anticipated.<br/><br/>As its title might imply, this film does not care for drawing in larger pools of audiences. The name alone could deter most people my age, it suggesting an archaic whimsicality that is nothing like the commercialised unusual style of Wes Anderson and instead offering something closer to Downton Abby - but then again, that is rather popular. Guernsey and Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is a cushioned cosy romance that is as commonplace as its characters, feeling old worldly and bygone.<br/><br/>In its innocuous storytelling, the film finds both its pleasures and its downfalls. It's easy to get caught up in the quaint landscape of Guernsey and the romantic atmosphere it adds to the film, even the more gooey aspects of the age-old marrying the wrong man and spurning the right man love affair. But still, in its overplaying of a wholesome attitude, the film finds itself as tasteless as the alluded Potato Peel Pie. The main plotline of the film being by far the most unremarkable aspect as we see no surprises or edges to its lukewarm romance drama between the writer, the American fiance who might as well carry around a sign that says ""she's not gonna end up with me"", and the most dashingly handsome and well-spoken pig farmer from the middle of nowhere, you will ever come across. Being the main focus of the film with the far more interesting Nazi occupation/love affair between occupied and officer taking a back seat leaves the film entirely bland and lacking absorbing substance.<br/><br/>The cast does give it their all and is fittingly excellent as per their reputations, morphing into staple characters that they have no trouble performing and we have no trouble watching. It seems Newell has forgotten all the excitement, humour and tasteful engaging romantic drama from Four Weddings and a Funeral. Instead, the film carries the same mood as a Saturday afternoon, carefree, relaxed, a little fun and some excitement but overall you're just waiting for something more compelling. It certainly has its pleasures and can certainly be a gentle film to sit back and wash over you but The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society should probably ditch its bland flavourings and get something with more grit."

","This is a great movie to watch on a cold afternoon, wrapped up warm on the couch eating cookies and drinking hot chocolate.<br/><br/>It is a WW2 ""lite"" movie. It tells the story of two women (ostensibly); one, a woman who endured the hardships of the German occupation of the Channel Island of Guernsey during WW2 and the second, a successful author of light amusing stories who comes to Guernsey to meet the titular book club of which the former woman was a member and discovers her secret.<br/><br/>However, the movie makers went the commercial route of making a chick/rom-com flick instead. The producers didn't give the heroine author much of a character, you learn very little about her other than her trauma of losing her parents in the Blitz, and that she wants to write something important. The producers then keep the Guernsey woman character almost completely absent from the movie and turn on the British charm. The movie has gorgeous scenery - but not from the titular island - and stock 'eccentric' characters, looking healthy and well fed throughout, in lovely tweed suits and stylish hats and sexy pig farmer wear. <br/><br/>The movie veers from the book in several important ways, some to its detriment, e.g. - it removed substantial supporting characters and subplots and some to its improvement e.g. - it made the fiance character of Juliet's a much more decent suitor. In the book, you wonder why the author is with such a cad. Here you understand why she's attracted to him.<br/><br/>Still, the movie kept to the book in 2 important ways which sadly, take you out of what little reality the movie provides:<br/><br/>1. It makes the Germans dumb yet well versed in the English language enough to know what a Literary Society was and to accept that as an excuse for a drunk group smelling of BBQ to be breaking curfew in the middle of the night. <br/><br/>2. That a sophisticated and well educated woman would want to leave a booming literary career in post war sophisticated London for a pig farm in the middle of nowhere, no matter how handsome the farmer and that a pig farmer would want a wife who will not be helping with the pigs, but instead will want to be indoors writing full time and thus be little help at all to him. Even Beatrix Potter stopped writing when she became a farmer and rancher of sheep. Juliet seems to take great pride in her writing and career, but yet seems willing to give it all up to slop pigs.<br/><br/>It seems to be a story of PTSD suffering Juliet wanting to wallow in the past and painful memories of the war (in a tiny scene, her fiance picks up on that) along with the denizens of an isolated island with a pig farmer, rather than pick herself up and move on into the very bright future with her glamorous American diplomat suitor.<br/><br/>The WW2 scenes are interesting, as the German occupation of the Channel Islands and their horrendous treatment of the occupants is one of the many war stories not widely known. But expect the rest to be as predictable as tea time and as glossy as a coffee table book."

Gradually, she comes to learn of the hardships, hunger and horrors that the people of Guernsey experienced during WW2. That seemed to me to be the main point of the book, but these are reduced to just a few short scenes. The film is nicely acted but dwells more on the love-life dilemma of Juliet, and is quite bland compared to the book."

However, it is a pity that they chose to portray a Bible believing Christian as a judgemental bigot. I think it is so sad that so many films have this portrayal of Christians when in reality, true wartime experiences are full of wonderful, sacrificial, loving deeds of love and mercy shown by committed Christians. As far as I can tell, this character was not portrayed as such in the book. If they wanted a judgemental character they could have done that without making reference to her religion or the Bible. It seems like it was a way of making a cheap attack on Christians and their faith."
"jchm-21143","3","7","14","22 November 2018"," Quite a ridiculous film
","Not the storyline. That seems quite acceptable if unremarkable.
But the production design.
This seems to be wholly aimed people with no knowledge of the time period or location in which the film is set. It gives an overwhelming impression of being aimed solely at American tourists.
I suppose the very fact that four of the cast appeared in ""Downton Abbey,"" (that wet dream fantasy of Daily Telegraph readers) should have rung alarm bells to start with. Just like that TV show, it presents a completely inaccurate and unbelievable picture.
Black American soldiers dancing with white girls in 1946? Come on...
And what would a Black GI be doing in London in '46 anyway?
Then there's the Male lead - who probably would have been run out of town in the rural post-war UK. Hair over his collar, designer stubble - and a wedding band?!?!!. No sorry - nobody looked like that then.
But the most laughable issue is the location. Guernsey looks absolutely nothing like the north coast of Devon where this was filmed. I'm sure it's much prettier and meets the criteria demanded to appeal to a certain ""Gee... ain't that quaint?"" type of audience. But to anyone with the slightest knowledge of reality, it comes over as absurd.
So all in all, as a film it's little more than stereotyped wallpaper. Read the book instead. I imagine it's a little more honest"

If, however, you need your entertainment to convince and engage you this half-baked presentation will cause you nothing but irritation and exasperation. Lilly James as Juliet manages to pout and flounce like a four-year old dress-up princess. Her skills in acting are in repeating learned lines and nothing else. Other, better actors, in this presentation also put in poor performances. This perhaps suggests the actors' disengagement with the script and direction. They would certainly be aware of the glaring mistakes being made in depicting war-time occupied Guernsey. Not surprising when female authored work is converted into a vapid and stupid screenplay by ignorant men. This ignorance extends to some gross visual mistakes. Have you ever seen a rack of pork? No, you haven't and, more to the point, no farm boy or country bumpkin would make the mistake of cooking the whole part of a pig carcass that is usually made into bacon as a joint of meat.

","Excessively sentimental film that really falls into the 'chickflick' category despite pretensions to something more meaningful. It totally fails to explore properly the tensions that arise in a society under military occupation, and is very simplistic in its view of good and bad.<br/><br/>Lily James is adequate as the lead and looks very well in the 1940s fashions, but some of the other characters are more caricatures than real people. The child parts are played well. Jessica Brown Findlay's talents are wasted in the small role of the saintly Elizabeth.<br/><br/>Most irritating is the way it has been filmed in terms of locations. There's nothing intrinsically wrong with filming in England a story which is set in Guernsey; but it would be better if it was at least depicted realistically. During WWII St Peter Port was a substantial town with a proper harbour, and Guernsey had an airfield (at which the occupying German forces landed); but from this film you would think that planes could only land on the beach, and that St Port was a tiny fishing village on a hill."

","Again, Diane and I disagreed with the value of this film; I thought that it was pure cinematic gold while she thought it was base tin.

This marvellous British film is about something, but it meanders around before it finally sets its various subjects.<br/><br/>
I won't bother to rewrite the nerve's of the film; those details are available better than my disjointed writing in other excellent IMDb comments. Suffice to say that the substance of the movie is tender, warm and extremely non-Hollywood with all that last comment carries with it: no guns, no cars and no violence of any kind. <br/><br/>
The viewer does not have to think about the film; just let the beauty of the environment, the building interiors and the warmth of the interaction of the characters envelope you and relish a movie experience that requires you only to go to another place, another time with an abundance of warm characters.

","It starts as a comedy, at least light-hearted, and it goes on that way for about 20 minutes. Then it descends into the gut-wrenching horror of a Nazi occupation, coming out into comedy a little later, descending into ""truth"" and horror and re-surfacing again. You can have mixed emotion in a novel, as it takes time to read. A film needs one emotional note, or at least not major ups and downs as this one has. As an example of a poorly structured film it's one for students to examine: Don't Do It Like This. The film stays - presumably - close to the book. It should have thrown away huge plot-chunks and made them filmic. Anything else has the smell of exploitation, and using people's (film) lives as plot-points. The verdict was in the box office. Â£18m sales. A happier. and still defiant film should've made much more than this."

","The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is a Romantic, Historical Fiction book set on the Isle of Guernsey within a year of the German occupation of the isle ending. The book is written in an epistolary style, letters written back and forth between characters, which would not directly transition well to cinema. The screen writers had to take the images and details from those letters and re-create the interactions described to interactions happening. It may sound straight forward enough, but they had their work cut out for them. There are multiple times in the text that the setting was not clearly, or distinctly, described and actual dialog between characters was not given. They had the bones to an enchanting movie, but they had to put in the work to flesh it out for the cinema. Ultimately, while the setting is not exactly what was described in the book, the screen writers did a good job bringing this book to cinema.
Whenever a book is adapted to a movie there is an existing fan base that is holding its breath while the film is in production. What parts will be kept? What will be missing? Will they stay true to the characters and plot? Will they twist, turn, prune, or add in so much that you barely recognize the original story once it hits the big screen? Let's face it though, anytime you take an eight-hour or more story and condense it into a film to be watched in less than two hours, you are going to lose parts of it. The best book to film adaptations keep their characters true to the way they behaved in the book, adapt the story to shorten it without loosing critical content, and can build the same emotional response for viewers that the readers also enjoyed. The movie adaptation of this book was able to do all three of these things, some better than others.
The characters from the book are represented moderately well in the movie. Juliet is an author from London who is just finishing a book tour and not sure what to write next. She is written, and portrayed on film, as an infectiously charming, kind young women who is still figuring out what she wants out of life. Mark, whom is courting Juliet, is written as wealthy and domineering, he is also portrayed as the same in the movie.
There are characters whose demeanor is mildly, or majorly, different though. Dorsey, Juliet's first contact from the Isle of Guernsey, is written as a quiet man who stutters and struggles to express himself. He is portrayed in film without the stutter and with a much more outgoing personality. Amelia, a resident of Guernsey, in the book is a sweet and guarded, but overall a welcoming and kind women. Amelia in the movie has a gruff persona and it isn't until nearly the end of the film that you see her kinder, softer side. The film sadly does these characters injustice by not staying true to their text origins.
Any time you adapt a book to a film you must cut out content. This is where The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society film truly shines. The story is based around one character, Elizabeth, whom is the thread that links all the other characters together in the story. Much of Elizabeth's story is cut out in the film; sweet and charming tales of good deeds done, or tales or daring resistance in a troubling time. The screen writers left just enough of these that the viewers become attached to Elizabeth and can still tell that she is one to stand up for the weak and do what's right even when it's hard. It's a fine line to walk and the screen writers chose which parts of her story to share very well, while saving time and cutting out what wasn't absolutely necessary.
This movie does an excellent job of still creating the emotional reaction that readers get from the book. You become attached to the characters. Even with the movie cutting out much of Elizabeth's' back story, as well as other characters, viewers are still able to grow very fond of her and become saddened when they find out she had been executed. Mark is easy to dislike; the actor, Glenn Powell, did a splendid job portraying the books arrogant aristocratic persona. Viewers can also see and feel the budding attraction between Juliet and Dorsey, and will ultimately end up rooting for Juliet to stay with Dorsey instead of returning to London with Mark.
The pickiest of book to movie adaptation critics could argue that this movie adaption is missing out on too many things. The movie cuts out meeting a character whom Elizabeth was imprisoned with at a concentration camp, and the extra character development Elizabeth is given because of that time. The movie also misses out on a variety of small characters throughout the Isle of Guernsey which help to develop the feeling of community the book creates. There are story lines which are changed to create more drama in the film as some dramatic parts of the book, that weren't key points in the story, were cut out. For example, Juliet believes that Kit might be Dorsey and Elizabeth's child in the movie, but in the book it is clearly explained from the moment Kit is introduced that her father was a German solider.
It is a fact of book to film adaptations that the story will change, and some readers will be left disappointed with the film. If you are to enter the theater expecting changes though, I believe you will more thoroughly enjoy these adaptations. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is a good example of a book to movie adaptation done right."

It looks at some wartime issues like collaboration, racism, loss and forgiveness.<br/><br/>This film has to wander along a very fine line.
It is great that this story is told and not every film shot in the 1940's should be a competition of who suffered the most, but it is hard not to make comparisons and
Guernsey under the occupation cannot compare to the blood soaked streets of Stalingrad, Warsaw, Nanjing or Berlin.<br/><br/>This is all about the characters and their experiences and their loses.
I just had trouble switching off the nagging voice in my head that prevented me sympathising with the characters' relatively quiet war.<br/><br/>A very nice, gentle watch with some great performances.

At the end of the day it is still a good film, just wish it was trimmed a bit and maybe remove about 15 minutes so it flows a bit better.

"Horst_In_Translation","2","5","12","12 August 2018"," A film as clumsy as its title
","The novel-based ""The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society"" is the most recent work by BAFTA-winning filmmaker Mike Newell, who is in charge of directing here, and the adaptation is by several writers (you know where you find them) and it is always a bit shocking to see so many coming up with such a mess to be honest. Anyway, first things first: Main character is played by Lily James and while her other big film this year (Mamma Mia 2) is a contender for 2018's finest, this one here is the exact opposite. I would not really blame her or the other cast members too much (more known names here too) as the film's biggest problem is the script. Let me add that I am writing this review as somebody who has not read the novel this is based on, so not sure where the problem lies exactly, but it feels like another Rosamunde Pilcher film most of the time.<br/><br/>The key story of her being so attracted by the book club in the title feels false and just not authentic most of time. Also there seems to be a great deal of filler material in these way too long over 2 hours in my opinion. There is not one scene that really impressed me. Even if the acting is decent, like when she breaks up with the American at the end, there are other deficits in exactly these scenes like that it really all feels just to please the audience and not to feel realistic or authentic. I hoped she would stay with him to deliver in this department finally at least one bit, but it just isn't happening. It's a massive problem. And don't even get me started on the wedding proposal eventually. There was virtually nothing between these two to be fair. Her reading was just as bad and how she is accepted by everybody all of a sudden afterwards after the initially critical reactions, especially by the older lady, and well her final comment about tearing up is hardly funny or likable at all. Same for the death of the other central female character who we only meet in flashbacks. Nothing feels right here. I literally never had the impression that I was watching actual people and not people pretending to be somebody else and yes like I said I would not blame the actors, but the weak writing, especially when it comes to dialogues. Also quite a shame to see a really talented actor like Matthew Goode wasted like this. What was with his gay-themed story line and him acting straight towards the main character anyway? Very weird.<br/><br/>Going back to the beginning and the title, it needs to be said that the way it was created felt just as bizarre as these scenes with the actual potato peel pie and how everybody finds it funny how disgusting it is. Yeah well, I could be talking about a dozen other scenes as well now, but I think you are getting my approach by now already. I think you must really like cheesy films based on English literature to see any value in this one here. If you don't, then do yourself a favor and skip the watch. I also wish I could unsee it and I was really mostly wasting my time there. Huge disappointment this movie and I am baffled by the rating and reception. No good."
"msghall","4","4","9","20 August 2018"," Insipid British version of a Hallmark/Lifetime romantic melodrama.
","All signs point to this being a stellar British film about post-WWII Guernsey. Reviews have been great, the acting is top-notch, the concept intriguing, the direction more than adequate. But under its guise as a post-wartime drama, this movie reeks of sentiment and romance at the expense of any revelations about this historical period of time. Feeling like a wasted opportunity, you never get to share the horrors and hardships endured by these people. The whole thing feels skin-deep, revealing neither the true nature of the characters nor the world in which they are desperately trying to restore amid the rubble.<br/><br/>While the writing is at times sharp and revealing, the dialog most of the time is tepid and shows little imagination when it comes to encapsulating Guernsey as it recovers from the horrors of Nazi occupation. While the acting is mostly superb, the actors are somewhat blah, making one wonder why should we care about them? If you are into romantic tales full of lust and love, and if you find the major characters to be attractive and interesting, you many find this to be just the ticket. From the glowing reviews, this show obviously hits a nerve that I don't seem to have."

","TL;DR<br/><br/><ul><li>Absolutely English and proud to be so</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Easy-going but enjoyable enough story</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A little too long and the mystery can sometimes be a little underwhelming</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Predictable plot</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Heart-warming characters and solid performances</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Ultimately unremarkable, but perfectly pleasant</li></ul><br/><br/>--------------------------<br/><br/>There's a strange genre that seems to have been around for a few decades now. Some may call them comedy, drama, romance... though usually they incorporate genre tropes from all three. Yet the most common element that runs through them all is that they are 1.) sweet, 2.) able to be enjoyed universally and 3.) unequivocally English - with the crème-de-la-crème of British thespians and, quite often, set during WWII. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society (no, the title doesn't get easier to say the more you try) absolutely fits alongside those types of films being lovely in every sense (though sometimes a bit too lovely) with a pleasant story and great cast. Still, there's nothing special or unique about the film itself that allows it go above and beyond the existing classics.<br/><br/>It's an easy-going, yet interesting story that effortlessly commands an audience. On the other hand, however, it takes a while for the story to get going, eventually exacerbating the other issue of the film being too long for what it is (ideally a film such as this would run in between 90 to 105 minutes). On top of this, the plot is fairly predictable; it's not too challenging to guess the ending before even the half-way mark. Still, it balances the stories of Juliet's relationships with the hunt for Elizabeth well, making the film part mystery - although it is admittedly a shame that most revelations concerning Elizabeth's eventual disappearance rarely seem like ground-breaking discoveries. Still, it's an enjoyable story, but this is mainly down to the characters who make it up.<br/><br/>The real joy of the characters is not only watching them open up to Juliet and slowly tell her the story of Elizabeth's disappearance piece by piece, but by getting to know them and seeing their personalities unfold before us. This is strengthened by solid performances of heart-warming, well-written characters. Even the more secondary characters aren't glossed over and make genuine contributions to the film. From Goode's the paternal publisher to the smarmy Powell's American boyfriend, able to carefully tread the line between being simultaneously charming and repulsive. The group of society members themselves are the ones at the very heart of the film itself. These characters are the highlight of the movie, each of them unique and individual, able to portray the connection between the characters in what they do and say. Lily James once again proves to be a wonderful lead, charismatic and lovely to watch. <br/><br/>It's difficult to predict a Mike Newell film when he's so diverse; from directing the likes of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire to Four Weddings and a Funeral, there isn't anything specific we can expect from him, other than he has the ability to craft entertaining and enjoyable films - though nothing quite as iconic since Four Weddings. The story and writing are enjoyable and the cast really sell it; while it may be ultimately unremarkable, it's nevertheless perfectly pleasant. An ideal film to watch with your feet up on a lazy Sunday afternoon with the whole family."

And so it transpired. Nothing wrong with that I will be the first to admit but perhaps I was looking for something with a bit more bite. Guernsey was a Nazi occupied territory during the war and there is a story to be told but here we fall back into something that is more or less a romance/mystery story which telegraphs its ending way before the end of its two hours running time (cuts could have been made).<br/><br/>There are plot holes, coincidences and events that may worry the more discerning of viewers and when one begins to wonder just how many changes of clothes the character played by Lily James can squeeze into a very small suitcase one realises that the incidentals are beginning to overtake the story.<br/><br/>Not having read the book I cannot comment on any changes that might have been made."

","If you are familiar with the occupation of the Channel Islands during WW2 and life during that period then this is just a sentimental romance story. If not, then it may be slightly educational. Could not fault the acting but was very disappointed that filming was not done in the island itself for specious reasons (another recent CI based movie Beast (2017) did bother to make the effort of filming in Jersey for external scenes to maintain authenticity). Visitors planning a trip to Guernsey based on the film will either be very disappointed or pleasantly surprised so may want to research first."

There's a lot of filler and nonsense and despite some nice performances, particularly from Penelope Wilton, and some clever flourishes like Jessica Brown Findlay's character not wearing any makeup, overall it's all terribly cliche. And some terrible instances of ham-fisted dialogue and crass, overt exposition and obvious plotting derail what is an honest affair. It looks a little cheap in terms of directing and lighting but the set design and costumes are spot on. I liked it, but only because I had just eaten a big dinner and got comfortable and couldn't be bothered to reach the remote."

The meddling protagonist is fairly insufferable, and of course lurve triumphs in the end, for she leaves a brilliant future with a dashing rich fiancee, to marry instead the incredibly well spoken and erudite pig farmer. As if.<br/><br/>Add to that that the acting is wooden and the script painfully conventional; this is the dream movie for your old auntie who votes for a populist party and thinks the world is going to the dogs.

"bbewnylorac","7","3","7","8 May 2018"," Good but not great
","This movie is a cinematographer's dream, and Zac Nicholson does a great job of capturing the beauty of an English Channel island under Nazi occupation during World War II. Director Mike Newell sets a crisp yet patient pace, and not a shot is wasted in moving the story forward. The scenery was lovely, so I was very disappointed to learn that this is the North Devon coast filling in for the island of Guernsey. The plot is interesting enough, with two heroines - the writer Juliet (Lily James) who visits in 1946 to find out more about the strange literary society, and the second heroine being Elizabeth (Jessica Brown Findlay), seen in flashback during the war on Guernsey who rebels agaiinst the Nazi invaders and helps shelter slave labourers, at the risk of her own safety. Elizabeth also has an affair with a Nazi doctor, Christian (Nicolo Pasetti) who turns out to be a nice man. The movie is much more watchable and substantial than some British period films such as Their Finest. It does have some good points to make about people in the war not being all black and white in their allegiances, about how books can be saviours to people in times of trouble, and how a motley crew of unrelated people can form strong bonds. I love the scene when the Society eats an illicit roast pig. Such a simple indulgence but they really savour it, as a shared, rare luxury, and as a simple victory against oppression. I feel that the movie focused too much on Juliet's love life, and her life in London. We don't see much about the Nazi peril to Guernsey natives. The invasion is given about 10 seconds of screen time. Yet too much time is given to filming Juliet gazing longingly at her love interest, the farmer Dawsey, or furiously scribbling research about the island. I don't think Lily James is a great actor - too many furiously wrinkled brows, and she's not a great kisser, but she tries hard. Huisman, as the farmer Dawsey, also isn't that great, but his role is a bit soppy. The film does seem to approve of very good looking people. If you are a little different looking (i.e. the actually beautiful Katherine Parkinson as Isola) you're dismissed as plain and lovelorn. 
Also the script's attitude to Chriistian, Elizabeth's Nazi lover, is confusing. In real life, you'd expect that the locals would regard Elizabeth's carousing with the enemy as a grave sin, that could endanger lives under occupation, a time when they rely on a united front against the enemy. But in the movie, the characters who disapprove of their relationship are painted as nasty. I guess the film is trying to say that love is love, and that not all Germans were bad.
Some reviewers didn't like the character of Juliet's American fiance, the wealthy officer Markham (Glen Powell), but I thought Powell did a great job, and even when he's rejected, he behaves understandably. 
Juliet's gay literary agent character, Sidney (Matthew Goode) was almost identical to Rupert Everett's hyper-supportive gay best friend character in My Best Friend's Wedding. Still, he's entertaining. 
I liked the ending, although I don't quite believe that Juliet would her give up her glamorous life in London to be a pig farmer's wife.
It is more picturesque, however."

Now it becomes clear why was she so afraid of Downton Abbey and wanted early exit. She used similar ""method"" there - took whatever little was given and turned it into something substantial on hew own. She was probably not given anything further to work with which was a red flag indeed. Now I wish someone would put her Ophelia somewhere on-line. <br/><br/>Lily James wasn't anything close to it, just a sketch of what she can, or could have done. After that horror named ""Mamma Mia"" I don't have much hope left but I hope I'm wrong and that she was terribly sick while ding that ""other thing"". But she will have to get back to top shape, both physically and mentally very fast.<br/><br/>Decent, watchable flick, albeit sinking into ridiculous ""designer romantic"" ending. Director doing much more than the lead, but showing what she can do with good guidance and decent light and photography. Unfortunately all that is gone after that other thing and no one can have the faintest idea whether that's reversible or is she going to remain the premature 50 that no one dares to do a close-up with anymore. It could also be that Lily James tends to fall for chick-lit-ish content.<br/><br/>A warning for people reading this - if you haven't seen that other thing - just don't :-) It will haunt you like an early childhood trauma for years. Keep your eyes closed, pray hard and wait the next year - might help :-))<br/><br/>Oh and another great miniature, by that redhead chick called Isola :-) I kept staring at her, sure that I saw that face before but I just couldn't place it anywhere.

"ilovesaturdays","7","0","0","16 May 2020"," Has heart but is too simplistic
","I love the novel because it's very witty & rich in character descriptions. Also, it's an epistolary novel, written as letters from various characters. This allowed the novel to carry the voices of all characters. Obviously, such a book is hard to adapt onscreen. Besides, books have an advantage of being descriptive. Sometimes what may be a single, yet important, paragraph in a book may take a few minutes on screen, so time becomes a limiting factor. The transition between the two different media is difficult and hence it's not very surprising that most (but not all) movies tend to be poorer representations of their original novels.<br/><br/>A few crucial changes were made in the script & some characters from the novel were deleted especially Sophie & Remy. I think at least Sophie should've been retained because her absence makes it difficult to understand Sidney & Juliet's close association.<br/><br/>However, putting all that aside, if I look at the movie in a more objective manner, then I'd say that the makers have done quite well. It comes off as a heart-warming tale depicting how literature & community spirit can play the role of a great buffer against the harshest conditions. The German occupation of Channel Islands made it necessary for these people to have each other to share their burdens. Lily James is good as Juliet Ashton, the sympathetic writer who wants to write their story. All the actors did a fabulous job & the cinematography was particularly beautiful.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a decent movie. Not as witty as the novel, but quite good nonetheless."
"CinemaSerf","7","0","0","9 April 2020"," Mick Newell has something to be well proud of.
","Well, it isn't a title you will ever forget, is it? Lily James (""Juliet"") had been writing to the eponymous society to find out about their island's experiences under Nazi occupation during WWII. She hits on the idea of writing a book about it so sets off from London to visit and dig deeper. The tale is delivered by way of letters and thus you are gradually drawn into a detailed, engaging and really charming story. It isn't so much about the wartime, though there are some very poignant threads to the film that are - it's about personalities; and pretty much the whole gamut of them at that. It's a bit of a love story - both between people and between ""Juliet"" and the islanders themselves; even the more curmudgeonly ones! The high quality of the production and dialogue reminded me a little of ""Quartet"" - Sir Tom Courtenay; Dame Penelope Wilton and Jessica Brown Findlay turn in excellent, but understated and delicate performances - as does Michael Huisman. Expect a few twists and turns but nothing to stem that feeling of warmth you are left with at the end."
"jrarichards","9","0","0","1 November 2019"," Develops from not much into a superbly-portrayed near-masterpiece
","First a word of warning: my experience of the start of this film from British Director Mike Newell was of it looking rather trite and simplistic, even possibly as if made for children! It was surprisingly offputting, and I never expected that I would end up viewing the piece in such glowing terms. But I indeed did, and found myself both moved and elated by the quality of the work as it progressed towards its conclusion - so please stick with this, do not write it off, as your temporary forbearance will be rewarded!<br/><br/>While the unfolding mystery plot is ultimately strong and compelling enough, my feeling would be that the movie develops as it does because of pretty-attractive filming, inspired acting giving us characters we quickly come to love; and the way it exposes a series of well-acted and meaningful relationships between people who mostly need each other because of the various traumas they have experienced and the yawning gaps that have been left in their lives as a result.<br/><br/>The linchpin to that is the beautiful Lily James's character Juliet Ashton.<br/><br/>However, the film is mainly 1946 Britain (and its recently liberated island of Guernsey just off the French coast), and a key - at times glaring - first contrast is between the Brits and a gung-ho, competent, well-off and keen-to-party American called Markham (Glen Powell), for whom the impressive WW2 victory is most tangible and least muted. The others (non-Americans) naturally have quieter celebrations, if any at all in the case of the specific Guernsey experience, but their needs and passions are greater.<br/><br/>But, when Juliet gives up on her engagement with ""Mark"" - as she clearly requires something more complex and nuanced, less free of darker issues - Powell joins his fellow cast members in acting this just right, and indeed with almost painful authenticity.<br/><br/>Writer Juliet has a superbly portrayed relationship with her gay publisher friend Sidney, and that's all credit to Matthew Goode, who is perhaps playing his ""usual role"" in some way, but who absolutely brings his warm and kindly character to life. Sidney's gay, but loves Juliet clearly and profoundly (as many of us on this side of the screen can fully understand!); and it's a touching and nuanced performance.<br/><br/>Juliet's increasingly passionate interactions by letter and then in real life with Dawsey (Dutch actor Michiel Huisman) is also done well, with tangible chemistry on offer. But James also has a fine scene in bed (though not in THAT way) with newfound friend Isola (Katherine Parkinson); and this is also a tremendously well-acted and meaningful exchange based around strong sympathy staying just the right side of pity.<br/><br/>It hardly needs saying that Tom Courtenay is great in his role - as postmaster and another member of the titular Society, while another beauty in the shape of Jessica Brown Findlay also does HER key (and tragic) character full justice.<br/><br/>While I cannot claim to be a huge Penelope Wilton fan, I think it must also be said that she acts here as powerfully well as we have ever seen her do.<br/><br/>And if all that wealth were not enough, there are also a couple of good roles for child actors, whose on-screen circumstances move us very readily indeed.<br/><br/>Overall, the story is meaningful and strong emotionally, and the skill is first to have found a way to sum up so neatly (all aspects of) the trial the Channel Islands went through; and secondly to give us a simple cathartic medium (via books and poetry) that brings together and heals strong characters whose traumas run deep.<br/><br/>A thought here would be that countries like Poland or even France would regard the stories on show as so entirely familiar (if still agoinising) that they come close to the typical. The skill with ""The Guernsey Society"" is the way we up the ante by this being that same kind of story within the British experience (not least because some Channel Islanders - children in particular - evacuated to Britain, while others did not). Our victory was a proud and moving one, our liberation of the chunk of our land that was occupied (inevitably, but in some sense to our shame) means yet more in that context.<br/><br/>Ultimately, there should not be a dry eye in the house for both reasons of British patriotism, and because of the emtional reinterpretation of what the term ""family"" may come to mean, not least in the context of timeless British literary classics that shape who we are and bring us through hard times.<br/><br/>A patriotic film them, moving, meaningful and quite beautifully portrayed."

","There's a lot to like about this film. It's beautifully filmed and the characters are mostly interesting. The romantic leading man is typical: rustic, passionate, talented, hard-working, sensitive, and damaged. But, in the end, she's changed him. I prefer my romance to come with a partnership."
"daryuschandra","9","0","0","1 September 2019"," Predictable and yet multi-layered
","I like reading books, but a cliche love story is not my cup of tea. However, based on the number of stars I give for this film, it's clear that I am willing to give an exception. I like the idea about how a love story between two bibliophiles can emerge from the letters they exchanged between them and their love for books. First, you will have guessed the ending anyway after five minutes entering the film, who would end up with whom. The film practically has all the cliches you know about a film involving a romantic love story. This includes the choice she makes at the end, which fails to follow the pragmatic logic that I try to comprehend. But, who cares? Because I enjoy the entire film thoroughly due to its multi-layered narrative and gorgeously shot scenes. The journey to unravel the whole story itself was executed admirably. Secondly, the film is all about love, although not just about romantic love, if I am allowed to make a category. It's also about family and friendship. The chemistry amongst the characters is built-up supremely. It also provides us with a glimpse of the sorrowful after-effect of the war, because war does not end simply when both sides choose to drop the guns. In conclusion, the ending is very predictable, but story-telling wise it's amazing. Now, I am planning my next trip to Guernsey. I know a lot of the scenes were not shot in Guernsey, but I am still intrigued."
"irinafiruti","7","0","0","26 August 2019"," What a surprise! Charles and Mary Lamb's book was one of my childhood's favorites
","...so I dearly related to this part of the story. People get connected by all sort of unexpected things, so why not by a good book? Marguerite Yourcenar's "" Denier du reve"" thread of narration follows the fate of a ...dime handed by various characters that get connected to each other in this way.
On the other hand, I also connected to the story of the club itself which is not so singular as it may looks: harsh times have the virtue of bringing people together and, growing up in the Romania's comunist era, I have lived among the members of a group like this, only they were rather tied one to the others through...music. Gatherings were organized ( or spontaneous) semi-clandestine to listen to classical music which was also a pretext to spread news from the free world and listen to free radio channels from the West. There was also a custom to bring somethig to eat and in those times when food was scarce and precious we have not been far from eating something as bad as a potato peel pie! But most of all the air was vibrating of this joy of togetherness and of full support between us. A refuge from the adversities which made those long decenies more endurable. So I fully recognize this experience and I can testify it's authenticity!
Back to the movie, the chemistry between the characters is obvious, you can feel the intensity of their emotions far from the screen difficultly fading away after the end. The characters are not fully developped though but as I haven't read the book so I can't say if it's the plot or the book. From this perspective I kept doubting the veridicity of the relation between a writer and a farmer - there can be some exceptions, of course, but the ""usual"" writer and the ""usual"" famer live in such different worlds that one can seriously doubt that a deep connection is to be established between the two. Or as far as I'm concerned, a film is art but has to stay true to human nature, otherwise is just someone's fantasy, which I am not interested in."

","It's longish name and presence of Michiel Huisman & the Brit actress Lily James picked my interest and I decided to have a dekho. It's a nice movie no doubt. One of those whom you think Pretty Nice after its over and feel at peace types ðŸ˜Š<br/><br/>Plot is woven around Lily who is some what an established author and is in London in 1946 which is still ravaged under post effects of WW2. For some strange reason she publishes all her books under a male pseudo identity. She is looking for a new home to buy but which ever home she visits, she gets the nightmarish flashback of her parents dying in their house which was bombed. She has a boy friend who is in Army. Most of their meetings happen only in some clubs and parties. After establishing this narrative, the camera pans over to the beautiful English country side to the Island of Guernsey and starts establishing a premise<br/><br/>The flashback starts during German occupation. That's a time when most of the farm produce and livestock and poultry etc is confiscated by the NAZIs to feed their forces. And to escape from the prying eye of NAZI soldiers, few English folk have a secret meeting in their dilapidated country home where they cook pork and have gin along with Potato Pie and generally have a nice time, away from the town & prying eyes of the German soldiers. The NAZIs get a whiff of the act and raid the place to find these Brit folks though they have switched off all the lights and lurching in a corner. Upon confrontation as to what they were doing in the dead of night so far from town, they mutter and make up a story that they have a Literary society and a book club and meet there periodically. The captain asks what's the name of their club and then one thinks for long and comes up with this unusual name - Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Pie Society ðŸ˜ƒ Then since they have made up this story, they go on to actually establish this as a book club with Name Plate and the works just in case if NAZIs come looking again and that way they can actually meet too since they have made it public to the Germans now!<br/><br/>
The flashback then comes to real time 5 years later to 1946 and now Lily is assigned to write a story on the Literary society in the London Times Literary Section. That's when she gets in touch with Michiel Huisman who is sort of unofficial spokesman to the Society and starts exchanging letters with him, enquiring about the same. They both are nuts over Late 17th century poet Charles Lamb & Jane Austen and that brings them closer. Then one fine day she sets out to Guernsey Island to meet the Literary Society Members and put in place the article post meeting all the members and interacting with them. Every member of Society welcomes her warmly and exchange many notes and treat her like a VIP and give her a tell all kind of run down but also hide few facts from her - so she thinks. To top it they don't want her to publish the article about their Society in London Times at all and refuse to tell her why they feel that way! The REFUSAL OF PERMISSION to her to publish the story and and how she goes about unravelling the reasons and the dark murky past of on goings during German occupation times, makes up the rest of the entire movie and keeps you engrossed till the end!<br/><br/>Photography is excellent and the plot is well woven, thanks to the director Mike Newell who knows his game well and has proved so already in 4 Wedding and Funeral & Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, hence needs no introduction ðŸ˜Š The British country side is made look more beautiful and quaint N charming thanks to brilliant camera work. The script is neat and editing is slick too. Over all a 7 on 10 easily !!"

","There's a children's book somewhere in this curious title, and as it was finished by the author's niece, Annie Barrows (who happend to be a writer of children's books) it makes me wonder if this was her Auntie's original title? Mary Ann Shaffer, sadly died before her book was published, and from comments made by those who have read her novel - the film adaption is disappointing. That said, it's highly likely those who read the book, after seeing the movie, may find the reverse. Books and screenplay adaptations can be, and are, a world apart. On its own merits, this is a highly enjoyable movie - offering fine performances, direction, wonderful locations, superior cinematography and a convincing recreation of a past era.<br/><br/>Lead actress Lily James, is like a dream come true - she was the perfect 'Cinderella' in '15, it's easy to understand why she won that part and the accolades. This story is an account of Germany's brutal occupation of Guernsey from 1940-45, detailing its dramatic impact on a group of families and friends. It's both a sentimental romantic tale and an examination of the tragedies experienced by all individuals living under siege. From other reviewer's comments - it might seem certain modern viewers may have perhaps lost the ability to appreciate the effect these times had on long suffering participants - so some might tend to view certain aspects of this tale with a degree of cynicism. But generally, the majority of audiences should be pleased with the time they spend being entertained by this engaging story."

I often find the movie version is never as good so it's probably a good thing I don't remember that much about the book version as this felt fresh to me. I do remember that the book centred a lot more on the actual German invasion (including the starvation and hiding of a prisoner) and the film seemed to skip that and concentrate more on the present. But that aside, I really enjoyed it. The cast was stellar, the cinematography wonderful and the costumes beautiful especially Juliet's yellow dress. <br/><br/>I am disappointed to read that it wasn't actually filmed on the island but it really didn't matter as I've never been there anyway."

","Warm, delightful, and so sweet. Maybe even be so sweet for its own good at the beginning. But no one can resist this movie's charm. Its cheerful and light-hearted tone may make you think you're watching Paddington!<br/><br/>The Guernsey Literary & Potato Peel Pie Society is also a well-made film. It has a great performances, specially from Penelope Wilton as Amelia who has some of the movie's most powerful lines. Yes, this movie is also has some very strong lines that could stick in your head. But they are even more powerful when you're invested in the characters.<br/><br/>Mike Newell used only the flashback technique to unravel the story of the titular society, and there's no doubt he could have taken a riskier and more challenging way to do so. But the result is nothing short of impressive. I always wanted to know more and more about the members and their story, and I loved how I was getting minor details piece by piece like I was collecting a jigsaw puzzle. I cared about all the side characters. Thanks to the solid script, each one of these characters was so intriguing to know about.<br/><br/>But I would that Juliet Ashton, our protagonist, is well-wrought character as much as the minor characters. Don't get me wrong, I cared about the character so much, and her romantic sub-plot and relationships in the story, but it's her background that I found unfulfilling and half-baked. We didn't get to know anything about her past, except from a very very short, and poorly-shot flashback at the beginning. But it's not just because the fact I felt it's unsatisfying that the main character lacks a well-established background, it's also because I did need that at some point in the movie. That being said, Lily James delivered a nice performance, and she was as charming as always.<br/><br/>There are also some things that I think are a bit hard to swallow. Things like ""I don't know exactly how he, or she knew about that but let's go on anyway.""<br/><br/>The movie looks gorgeous in general. It has a beautiful cinematography, a decent production design, and top-notch costume design that fits perfectly the movie's setting. Also, I loved the music, and it's also as traditional as the movie itself.<br/><br/>(7.5/10)"
"siderite","7","0","0","15 August 2018"," A rather interesting premise, but something off in the presentation
","A young Londoner writer finds an interesting set of people on the island of Guernsey who share some personal stories from the time of the German occupation. Somehow they are all linked by the pleasure of reading books, after they were inadvertently forced to create a book club to justify their meetings during the Nazi regime. But after the initial groan ""Oh, no, not another war movie"", it was clear that the action was happening right after the end of War World II. And it was interesting, in a literary way (especially since I had tried to watch Book Club just before and I gave it up) as well as a personal exploration of complex characters and it was generally well acted.<br/><br/> However, there was always something slightly off: inadvertences, forced scenes, a romantic subplot that actually made no sense or brought any value to the film. So with much regret, I have to blame the director of the movie and a little bit the script. I don't think the lead actress was very good either, but I have to be picky to blame her for the feeling of uncanny valley while watching the film. If it weren't for this, I would have rated it a lot higher."

","I read the book this was based on years ago so perhaps my fondness for it and the details have dimmed.
I watched it as soon as it hit Netflix and loved it so much, I watched it again the next day.
It certainly would be better served as a mini series for character development and to involve more of the original plot which was what made the book so entrancing.
I thought Lily James did a fine job considering how they wrote her storyline and considering who could've played the part (Kate Winslet, Rosamund Pike). Juliet was not a strong willed female lead like Jessica Brown Finlay's Elizabeth - who was not on the screen enough in my opinion. 
But the chemistry between Juliet and Dawsey is what kept me enthralled. The glances and longing looks and the moments (in the bar, his bedroom when Juliet finds the book she gave Dawsey, and right before her fiance Mark shows) are so charged with energy I found myself rooting for them and wanting to rewatch those scenes over and over. Michiel Husman brings an intoxicating presence to the screen in everything he does and I could not watch anyone else when he was on.
Matthew Goode's Sidney is hilarious and deserved more time and I really loved the rest of the cast which was SO well placed in their roles. It's a bit predictable towards the end but it's the ending I was hoping for so I was pleased.

","It was sheer joy to see Lily James, Penelope Wilton, Matthew Goode and Jessica Brown Findlay get together for a movie, although you don't get a chance to see all of them in a single scene (not giving any spoilers). Lily James is fast becoming one of my favourite actresses. Her expressions are full of life. Something that I first noticed in Downton Abbey, and then in Cinderella, the recent Mamma Mia 2 and now this. I felt that Jessica Brown Findlay's role could have been extended a bit. I had the feeling it was made shorter on the editing table. Katharine Parkinson continues to be cast in supporting roles in which she outperforms (Humans, Honorable Woman, etc.) I can't wait to see her in a leading role. <br/><br/>All in all, this is a pretty sweet film with a tragic flashback. It was nice to see a WWII themed chick flick for a change. Give it a shot, you'll surely enjoy it."

","'Earth seemed a desert I was bound to traverse, seeking to find the old familiar faces.'<br/><br/>~Charles Lamb<br/><br/>Set against the backdrop of World War II, during the aftermath of the German occupation of Guernsey , the movie traces the development of a tie between two temporally remote yet subconsciously similar worlds as the protagonist, Juliet Ashton is found reiterating,"" I belong to you ...."" as she finds solace in the fresh bond that she has formed with this family. Books lay the foundation of this relation as the pig ranch farmer,Dawsey Adams establishes his contact with the outside world by corresponding through letters with the help of the address mentioned on the copy of Lamb's The Selected Essays of Elia which he happens to salvage during the Club's desperate attempt to institute the reading group that they swore to be a part of, on the spur of the moment,to justify their violation of the curfew or in Dawsey's words as they had to keep a roast pig secret from the Germans.
Juliet, writing under the pseudonym Izzy Bickerstaff, chooses to call her book, 'a collection of faintly amusing essays', and claims to be working on English Foibles: A Miscellany of English Absurdity which takes a dig at London Society for Public Decency which advocates trousers for horses. Her popular works thrived on instances such as these which were able to tickle the audience and make them burst into laughter. The plot of the movie also brings the struggles of an aspiring writer to the fore as she is privy to certain privileges based only on her interim popularity, wherein lies the danger that is foreshadowed in the poignant image of her room literally razed to the ground in the London blitz.She frantically tried to grasp whatever she could lay her hands on, in this case, the paperweight with a bird poised to fly in a dream like sequence. As a result of this ominous flash from her past, she walks away from the irresistible comfort of a crystal clear posh flat on the pretext that she'd feel like a fraud there. To her manager's utter dismay and in spite of his staunch dissuasion, she decides to get back to her poky bedsit in Battersea with three suitcases and a typewriter, relinquishing the consolation of a proper home thereby embracing suffering over luxury.<br/><br/>Markham Reynolds,a diplomat and clairvoyant, offers her proper premises to cater to her writing needs. He holds the promise of a secure future to her. He makes such an elaborate show of his love as he throws ball in her honour and crams her apartment with rose vases as on one such occasion, Mrs Burns complains about her tenant's houses brimming with vases.These vases,however,do not find a place in Juliet's room unlike the handpicked floret that Kit or Dawsey present her with. As the plot progresses, she struggles to juggle between being a diplomat's fiancé and an aspiring independent writer. Nevertheless, it's not that difficult to conjecture which role she settles for. Indubitably, she is more drawn to the long black tunnel than the carnival.In a desperate bid to keep her close to him, Reynolds proposes her on the day she sets out for Guernsey.<br/><br/>The bucolic Guernsey, with its tranquil beaches, picturesque scenes of lush green meadows with long grasses and wild waves lashing against the lofty mountains, has been restored back to life from the German occupation which once had turned it into a fortress laid with landmines. This transformation of a besieged territory into a heavenly haven happens owing to the relentless efforts of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society to enjoy life even amidst adversities. The German soldiers had taken away Dawsey's pigs and had ordered him to grow potatoes.Food had become scarce and proper meals could be had only in memory.It is at this juncture that we are introduced to Elizabeth Mckenna,the founder of the club,who proves to be an ideal which Ashton could probably get inspired from.<br/><br/>We were all Hungry but it was Elizabeth who realised our true starvation for connection,company...<br/><br/>~Dawsey Adams<br/><br/>Eben Ramsay,a local postmaster,is a peculiar character whose unique creation Potato Peel Pie with no butter, no flour just potatoes sounds silly and absurd but it is symbolic of something earthy sans all fancy superfluities; it is as pliable as potatoes that can be teemed with anything .In addition to that, somethings as crude as potato peels which are discarded, are reminiscent of those who survived the dark phase of German occupation.<br/><br/>The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society presents a stark contrast to the book launch where Ashton,shows much faith in Izzy than herself and tries to dodge most of the questions directed to her with a certain degree of diffidence as well as skepticism. At the Guernsey's book club's gathering,she chooses to read Anne Bronte: A Life,a work for which she harbours strong opinions instead of her more popular works.As opposed to the one dimensional Q&A session at the book launch, the act of reading out to the group is more intimate with several justified attacks and equally potent defenses, ultimately, proving that books do have the power to bring people across ages or from different geographical locations together."

","Before you read on I want to say that the movie is not horrible by itself. It was a pretty average rich girl meets boy and they fall in love kind of movie. The historical aspect of the movie is good too since it gives you a sense of the area during WW2. Going forward is my personal review of film.<br/><br/>Never read the book? Well you should if you enjoyed the movie, trust me it is 100% better.<br/><br/>All of the characters are so different and so much is missing. Like really important character parts! For example: where is Sidney's sister Sophia and Isola's Parrot Zenobia?! Sophia is a great friend of Juliet. What about the mention of Oscar Wild and Isola's funny story of being a 'great' detective.<br/><br/>The only thing they got mostly right right the film is the fact that Juliet asked Dawsey to marry her!

","I know people always say the book is better, but the movie is usually along the same vein. Whoever wrote the screenplay for this movie completely eviscerated the book, and destroyed some of the best characters. The movie is Frankenstein's monster compared to the book. It makes me very sad, because when I saw how it had been cast, I thought the castings were perfect for the book characters."

She couldn't look at Mark and tell him no in the movie until the end and only after she had already said yes, and in the book, she refused him from the beginning. Elizabeth's character was glossed over in the movie, and Remy and Sophie weren't even in the movie. I was disappointed. Mainly by Juliet's character, but the movie overall didn't do the book justice."

"patriciogl10","8","1","3","7 October 2018"," Do yourself a favor and watch this gorgeous film.
","I honestly didn't know what to expect, the film's title certainly did enough to draw my attention and wonder what this movie was all about. I read its plot description and went in. I came across with a wonderful film, with amazing acting, very good dialogue and overall a compelling love story with a historical background which interested me greatly. When the first scene kicks in and we discover why the film is called The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society it all makes sense, and it's a rather funny scene, the way it develops, even though it takes place in an obscure context.<br/><br/>The setting is just marvellous, it definitely adds to the film's structure. I thought it was interesting that the events take place after the Nazi occupation, although there are some flashbacks that refer back to the war. Lily James puts on an excellent performance, so do Michael Huisman (of Game of Thrones fame) and Penelope Wilton.
Really, I can't find something about this movie that I didn't like or enjoy. It is one of those films that entice you with the title and fully grab you with its fulfilling story.<br/><br/>Another aspect that I find interesting is how they subtlety managed to blend the love interest between Juliet Ashton (James) and Dawsey Adams (Huisman) and the investigation Ashton was carrying out regarding Elizabeth McKenna's (Jessica Brown Findlay) disappearance by the hands of the Nazis, after helping someone in need in the midst of curfew. Neither one surpassed each other, and it had the added value of also be dealing with important pieces of literature, which along with tragedy, is what sustains this interesting group of people.<br/><br/>This is a fine film, be sure to check it out! I wish I could read the book it is based upon."

","Fairly painless romp confirming that there is still mileage to be extracted out of the second German war. Given the fact that they were invaded and occupied and their proximity to mainland Britain it's surprising that the Channel islands haven't featured to any great extent in war films and certainly not in dramatic storylines of world war two, in fact offhand I can think only of Appointment With Venus prior to this and that was definitely a comedy built around the eponymous Venus who happened to be a cow. Despite David Niven and Glyniis Johns it sank without trace and one wishes a better fate for the Guernsey Literacy Society."
"MartinHafer","8","1","4","2 January 2020"," Very deliberately paced and lovely to watch.
","The story begins in London in 1946. Now that the war is over, Juliet Ashton is a best-selling author and she should be happy now that she's become engaged to a rich and handsome American soldier. But she seems a bit lost despite her success. One thing that piques her interest is a letter she's received from Guernsey (one of the Channel Islands off the coast of France). It's from a man who is looking for a book and who is part of the The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society...a book club consisting of about a half dozen members. Instead of just sending the man the book, she decides to go to Guernsey and meet this book club. However, although they loved hosting her, there is some sort of secret about this group...a secret that Juliet is determined to find out for herself.<br/><br/>The biggest praise in this film probably goes to the director, as the story is simple but Mike Newell manages to make the most of it. Some lovely performances, great pacing and a lovely script all work together to tell a story that really hook you...and if you like romances, you're sure to enjoy this movie.<br/><br/>By the way, one of the best parts about story is its setting. Few Americans know anything about Guernsey and I enjoyed learning about the German occupation of the island during the war. Very interesting."

I admit you really have to pay attention as sometimes the dialogue is hard to follow and you could certainly miss something very valuable to the story being told. However when you make it through you have been on a journey that will enlighten and stimulate the senses to a high that will make you feel the ultimate exhilaration, but also some sadness that the movie is over.
The final scenes brought tears to my eyes and this very seldom happens to me with a movie. All I can say is Netflix we need more movies from you like this one.

","There is nothing wrong with this movie ""the Potato Peel Society"" you get what you expect, it is despite it's realism pretences a ghastly mush of sentimental manipulation all but devoid of real emotion. This is school boy history revisionism at it's absolute worst. The film quickly reveals it's self as the most clunky of mechanical films, so the acting is universally middle of the road, the luscious scenery at once pretty and pretty obviously romantic if fully shallow and hollow.
The best i can say about this triviality is that it's female lead is beguiling effective, and the visual history as artificial as a USAF Dakota still swimming in invasion stripes in 1946. This is Lazy film making tripe for the undemanding."

","I can't remember when I last enjoyed a new film as much as this one (probably Brooklyn). A great story, moving, funny, and original. Great performances, especially Lily James (surprising after creating little impression in Downton Abbey), Tom Courtenay and Penelope Wilton. It doesn't matter that the actual story is fictional, the real events of the Guernsey occupation gave it substance and a subject rarely used before. The supporting cast also gave excellent performances particularly the young boy and Isola.<br/><br/>I feel sorry for the critics whose reviews show an insecurity and they seemed scared to say anythng which might rock their peer group. It's not too long, the 2 hours just flew by, Michael Huisman sensibility underplayed Dawsey's attraction to Juliet because of the circumstances, Juliet was more open in her feelings and it was a voyage of discovery for her, her journey was the heart of the film. It's a heartwarming tale, yes, cliched in places but so enjoyable to watch."

Jane was Ebens daughter. I can't believe how much they got wrong. The characters were not welcoming. She didn't have to just arrive unannounced, And none of it seemed to be reasonably wrong for adaptation purposes. She didn't have to go back to London either - I wasn't expecting it to follow the story to a T - obviously a screenplay must be abridged but this is so frightfully unlike the story it does such an injustice and changes not only the events but more importantly the concepts of the characters and essence of the story. Considering how much I loved the actors previous works and what not this is very disappointing that the screenwriter and director And producers wouldn't attempt to handle a beautiful story with more care.

","When you're dealing with a story about the German occupation of the Channel Islands it's almost a sin to gloss over the effects the way this film does.<br/><br/>By way of disclosure I used to live in the Channel Island of Jersey many years ago and I saw bits and pieces of the legacy of the Occupation. There were underground hospitals, even an aborted railway system.... all built by slave labour .<br/><br/>Simply having a few troops walk through the centre of town leaves a dearth of stories to be told.
How did they implement their takeover? How did they let the administration run the island? How did they treat the islanders?<br/><br/>All of these plotline motherlodes were sacrificed for the love story
(which was quite well done, although telegraphed from the start).<br/><br/>On reflection, the morning after viewing it, I would say that it's a typical U.K. picture, well acted with the usual overdoing it with kids and twanging of the heartstrings........ but not really my cup of tea.<br/><br/>It still gets my back up after all these years, to see the way the class system was entrenched (and by all accounts it still is!)<br/><br/>I would have preferred a bit more exploration of the Island culture itself and a bit more depth in the way they dealt with the occupation but....

The beginning was a little slow. I had a feeling that I am waiting for more and that something big is going to happen. Then it gets better, interesting even, I'm still waiting for more,but I'm distracted by the beautiful scenery, beautiful people and good acting. The ending is really expected, predictable, but not unpleasant. I'm left with (at best) lukewarm feelings after watching it. Now,my strongest feelings were the sense of disappointment, how unfinished the characters were, You couldn't really get to know or like anyone. I liked the nutty gin lady the most, which is not how it suppose to be. The love story in this movie is without doubt the worst I have ever seen. This was a straight line, zero chemistry between the couple that should be in love. It was shocking, when she told him ""I'm in love with you"" or something... I have heard people trying to sell trashy products via phone that sounded 100 times more believable. So, my main problem with the movie was that it was not moving at all.

During the reconstruction period in England after WWII, an up & coming writer receives a letter asking for a copy of a tome which a book club wants. We find out the club was formed when Nazis occupied the Isle of Guernsey & the inhabitants were under curfew so when a few are caught after hours the quick thinking members said they lost track of time due to their club's meeting running late. So enthralled w/the tale, the writer (played by Lily James) embarks on a mission to find out how & why this club was formed only to discover a bigger mystery in the offing.

","The name it's usually a presentation card for anyone or anything, and the ""potato peel pie society"" definitely caught my attention. What does have to do with literature and the island of Guernsey? So far the story seems promising...pop corn, romance, an island, reading books and potato pie; however, none would expect the grounds in which this movie is based. A group of Guernsey's locals gets into literature reading during the Nazi occupation in the 40's. A few years later, a promising writer from London, also affected by Second World War, lands on this place pulled by desires and feelings yet for her to discover. An excellent story told in a very sensitive way with great actors."

","This is one of my favorite movies of all time. What can be better than a romantic story about books placed during an interesting historical period? And starring four actors who I came to love in Downton Abbey? I also loved charming Isola, adorable Kit and especially the charming young Eli, who has a wonderful smile and a great presence on camera and who we will hopefully see again soon. One minor thing I think the super talented writers missed: Eli switches between calling his grandfather ""Grandpa"" and ""Granddad."" But grandchildren don't interchange those words, because what they call their grandparent is really the same as his name. So he is either one or the other, but not both names. I was also less than enamored with the actor cast as Mark Reynolds. His eyes and his midwestern (?), gravelly accent were wearing on me. Michel Huisman was wonderful and I hope we see a lot more of him in the future as well. And I love everything Lily James does. I did think it was kind of funny in a trivial pursuit kind of way that this is the second movie/TV show where Lily James and Jessica Brown Findlay appear but never together. Like she did in Downton Abbeey, Findlay's character disappears before James enters the story. Please, Netflix, stop it with the other junk and give us more pleasant stories like this."

","There is a reason this role was given to Lily James and that's because she is probably the best young actress from England at present. She is an absolute joy to watch and plays the intricacies of such a part so very well. It's a compelling little story.<br/><br/>I must admit the movie name put me off a lot as I thought it was a blatant attempt to stand out with a ridiculous name. I soon learned the reason behind the name of the movie and put that behind me. Although I probably wouldn't have watched it without reccomendation from my Uncle who has a similar taste in movies. <br/><br/>It's a good movie that warms the heart and shouldn't disappoint too many. A very non offensive drama movie with a lot of character. <br/><br/>Again by no means a 10 out of 10 but for people who like movies set in years gone by and just the general portrayal of unease in the late 1940s after world war 2 this is a solid watch."

","GRADE: B- <br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A romanticized view of WWII and British rural life.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: The British love a good period romance story. Period.<br/><br/>The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society fills the bill for those in need of a slightly charming tale of love and a whiff of mystery. Lots of picturesque cliffside views, fields of wildflowers and stone cottages, a bucolic setting which seems like a travelogue for a simpler way of life, the kind of rural village where Miss Marple would reside, minus the murders. There's plenty of quirky town-folks minding their manners and own business and keeping their little secrets and lies well hidden.<br/><br/>The time is 1945, and author Juliet Ashton comes to hear of the literary group and begins to question their historic origins as inspiration for an upcoming article. This fascination leads her to the island of Guernsey where she meets the book club and its members including a handsome pig farmer in the group named Dawsey Adams. As Juliet investigates and researches her story which leads her to the German occupation five years earlier and its effect on the town, she discovers a direct correlation with the casualties of war and this reading circle of friends.<br/><br/>Mike Newell directs his film straightforwardly, without much flair. He tends to sanitize the proceedings. Everything is a tad too clean and polished. (The pig farm seems to be spotless and idyllic; at times, I expected the cute piglets to start speaking aloud ala Babe.) In fact, nothing in the film has any period authenticity. It is all dress-up time in 40's era clothing and set design. The mystery subplot is quite predictable and vastly underplayed. The actions of some of the characters make no real sense except to advance the plot to its inevitable romantic outcome.<br/><br/>However, he assemblies a fine cast of British actors, familiar faces from Masterpiece Theatre imports and independent British fare: Penelope Wilton (strong as always), Matthew Goode, Glen Powell, Jessica Brown Findley, Katherine Parkinson, and Tom Courtney, all good, even if the story is a trifle. Lily James and Michiel Huisman, both quite likable performers, play the misfit lovers, without much chemistry between them. (They share one of the least passionate kisses ever filmed.) Oddly, they are more convincing in their separate scenes with the other actors.<br/><br/>Still, the film entertains throughout, although its conclusion is, pardon the pun, hogwash for the realists in us all. (Yet the romantics out there just might wallow in the film's cheap sentimentality.). While The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is never (sorry!) ""unappeeling"", it left this moviegoer expecting more. In all honesty, the title is more interesting than the film itself."

","IT's rare that we think of the unthinkable fact of what would have happened if Britain had been invaded by Germany in World War 2?
Well it's a fact that Guernsey was and this story tells with humour , pathos and sadness the plight of a group of citizens who become .friends under incredibly difficult circumstances, living under curfew and the barest of food to survive occupation and having to surrender to anything the Nazi occupiers wanted or face extreme punishment.
The cast is fabulous with a knockout performance by Penelope Wilton, as much as I adore Dame Judy and Dame Maggie I'm so glad they didn't get the part of Amelia Maugery, a sad traumatised woman, who has lost more and sacrificed more than anyone should have to in that horrible war. We all know Penelope as Isobel Crawley in Downtown Abbey and this role is so far removed from that one .
I've seen her in many other fine roles going way back to Alan Ayckbourn 's Norman Conquests in 1977 but I think this film is her finest hour.
Lily James as Juliet Ashton the author who is drawn to Guernsey and the tales of these people also gives another lovely performance, for some reason she reminds me of Lyn Hathaway and I expect after her great roles in Cinderella, Darkest Hour and Guernsey that we will see her in many more movies.
Everyone is good in this movie , special mention to veteran Tom Courtney, who pays an eccentric wistful character Eben Ramsey.
No wonder this film works with a director like Mike Newell, who has directed great films like Four Weddings and a Funeral, Harry Potter Goblet of Fire and Donnie Brasco.
If you enjoy a great story beautiful scenery and terrific acting please don't miss this Film a 9 out of 10 from this amateur film buff."

Some reviews said the character development was nowhere near that of the book and I say.. obviously not. A book has the ability to show depth of character that films usually can't. If you read the book and you know these characters, you have plenty of background to fill in what a 2 hour film doesn't have time to show.

"tenyearreunion","10","0","1","24 August 2018"," Faultless.
","I write this moments after the credits have rolled on this movie, though pausing after some dust got in my eye......honest guv.<br/><br/>What a simply wonderful, delightful, well casted, acted, directed, scored piece of film making.<br/><br/>I honestly kick myself for not seeing this at the cinema so I could soak in the scenery and fully engross myself in the tale of Lilly James peeling (pardon the pun) back the layers of the GLAPPS story. Though again, this film fell victim of a very short run time at my local cinema and I missed it.<br/><br/>Every cast member is spot on with who their roles and the part they play in the story. Lily James, a favourite of mine since Cinderella, really excels in this character. Though I wish she would expand her repertoire a little, she does this type of young english lady so superbly well, why not play it again as the leading lady?<br/><br/>The film plays out like a murder mystery, only better. I was enthralled and captivated by a well scripted and edited story. I saw no padding, felt no unnecessary pause, it was perfectly paced and even the slightly predictable ending was concise. I don't fault the ending, it could only end one way!<br/><br/>I credit the Mayo and Kermode church for yet again drawing attention to this gem that more people need to seek out on streaming, blu ray or dvd. I was very tired and was going to watch a Harry Potter film for the umpteenth time but I am very glad I didn't.<br/><br/>I don't give 10/10 to any film without thought. I can't recall the last I gave on this site. However, in this instance, I sit trying to think how I would change this film to make the last 2 hours be more enjoyable and I cannot think of any. So surely that is a 10?<br/><br/>If you are after a rom com, musical, action blockbuster or comedy, forget it, don't go elsewhere, switch your brain to drama mode, make yourself a nice hot cup of tea and give this a go instead."

","""The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society"" on Netflix. Such a redeeming answer to poorly scripted movies. It was genuine and full of character love and romance. The dialogue was real and the story embraced true emotions. The accomplished actors like Penelope Wilton and Tom Courtney created real characters. Forget hype and money. This is a great movie. <br/><br/>Two days before, we went to see ""Crazy Rich Asians"" for our anniversary expecting to see an enjoyable romantic comedy. Instead we saw people who are probably good actors being abused by a movie with a bad script and insipid story (not plot). It relied on the rich glitz of Singapore as a substitute for the war and fighting that superimposes over story in superhero movies. Here the glitz was not glamorous or interesting. Bad movie. Sad."

"SnoopyStyle","8","0","1","18 August 2018"," old fashion formulaic romance
","In 1941, the British Isle of Guernsey in the English Channel is under Nazi occupation. The locals face starvation. Elizabeth McKenna, Eben Ramsey, Amelia Maugery, Dawsey Adams, and Isola Pribby are forced to fake a literary society to hide a roasted pig when they encounter German soldiers. It's 1946 and Juliet Ashton (Lily James) is uncertain about her new wealth from the success of her book. She is not very proud of the book and she is haunted by her losses in the war. She is leery of the celebratory mood and then she gets a letter from Dawsey. She is taken with the story of their literary society. Sidney Stark is her supportive publisher. Her rich American boyfriend Mark Reynolds proposes to her and she accepts out of obligation as she leaves for the island. There she finds secrets, romance, heart-break, and a story which she cannot write.<br/><br/>This is a traditional romantic mystery. It's a tear-jerker. It's a little darker than I expected from the quirky British title. It has all the elements of an old fashion romance which is about sacrifice and nobility. The title is problematic but I doubt the movie can escape it. The other issue is Stark. Matthew Goode is injected as a third romantic possibility which doesn't help. It's an awkward fake-out and unnecessary. His character would be better as an older father figure for Juliet. A young man would more likely be sent to war unless I missed something about his character. I don't think he's injured either. It would be better to have an older actor. The romance itself is not surprising. It is following a familiar old formula which is perfectly good. It's also nice that none of the lead characters are villains in the tale. It's a feel-good old style romance."

The adaptation and direction (though quite different from the book in many aspects) have been done with such sensitivity and wisdom (but what else would you expect from the director of ""Enchanted April"" and ""HP and the Goblet of Fire""?), and the acting is so exquisitely done that I consider this quiet film to be almost flawless. The pain, the tragedy, the terrors of the German occupation are there, but so is the humanity, the compassion, the courage, and the beauty of clinging to what life has to offer - connection. ""Only connect"", wrote E. M. Forster, and this film has captured it beautifully. Not to mention that it is a paean to my lifelong passion: books, reading, and sharing those words. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, RELEASE IT ON DVD IN THE U.S. - I WANT TO BUY A DOZEN COPIES TO GIVE AS PRESENTS AND TO HOLD ON TO MYSELF!<br/><br/>P.S.
