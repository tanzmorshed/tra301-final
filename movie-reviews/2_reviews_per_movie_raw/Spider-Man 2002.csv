","The world of movie superheroes began with Superman, thrived with Batman, and reached its ultimate apex with Spider-Man. 2002's biggest movie event combines the slam bang roller coaster rush of Batman with the heart, sweetness, and aw-shucks sincerity of DC's other titan, into a comic book adaptation that is as close to perfect as any will ever come. A joyous blast of post-9/11 American verve, crafted with class and a keen eye for storytelling, Sam Raimi's 2002 mega-hit is a once-in-a-lifetime, generation defining summer blockbuster, and in the eyes of this Generation Spider-Man-er, it's still the gold standard in superhero cinema.<br/><br/>Spider-Man takes most of its cues from 1978's Superman: The Movie. Peter Parker's journey from unassuming geek to high-flying hero mimics the Man of Steel's in story and tone. The colorful comic spirit of Richard Donner's gleefully exciting original is all here, just Marvel-fied. Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp approach Spider-Man's origin with reverence for Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original story. Koepp's script hits all the beats you'd expect (Spider bite, wrestling match, great power, and all that), but it also includes, unexpectedly, an intelligent, eloquent emotional foundation. Raimi and Koepp understand who Peter Parker is, and how his transformation into Spider-Man can metaphorically parallel his development as a character. In being confronted by new and strange spider powers, Peter is also confronted by the responsibilities of manhood. Koepp takes Stan Lee's best idea (That Peter Parker should grapple equally between supervillains and everyday problems), and pushes it to its logical max. Peter's infatuation with girl-next-door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is given equal importance to his struggle with Norman Osborne's manic alter ego, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The result is pretty well timeless. The quintessential Spider-Man story. A coming of age tale that gracefully weaves together every important aspect of the wall-crawler's mythos into a grand concoction of pure Spider-Man.
 
Enhancing the story is one of the great casting jobs in motion picture history. First and foremost is Tobey Maguire, who was a revelation as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. Like Christopher Reeve before him, Maguire completely defines the role. His Parker is a good kid; shy, dorky, and believably square. He radiates with innocence and later, teenage anxiety. As Spider-Man, he's delightfully charismatic. Lively, but never annoyingly brash in the way other Spideys have been. In the costume or not, every subsequent Spidey will live in his shadow. Maguire's casting was a stroke of genius, but it was no anomaly. Kirsten Dunst is a luminous MJ, and she and Peter's romance sparkles with charm. Willem Dafoe relishes his Green Goblin role, with a voice and presence that burn with comic book intensity. And the perfection doesn't stop there. The colorful supporting cast is just plain superb, with a legendary turn from J.K. Simmons as the hard-nosed newspaper man, J. Jonah Jameson, and two measured, twinkle-in-their-eyes performances by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt May.<br/><br/>But Spider-Man belongs to Sam Raimi. A Spider-Man superfan since childhood, Raimi was destined to bring the web-slinger to life. The offbeat sense of violent fun and jubilant cinematic showmanship that made Evil Dead and Darkman so entertaining is precisely what was needed to bring Spider-Man's New York to dazzling light. And what a creation Raimi's Spider-Verse is! The tone, with a precarious balance of larger-than-life action and textured character moments, never wavers once. Raimi crafts in Spider-Man, a New York where the archetypical comic book mainstays: the cackling villains, the wise-cracking heroes, and the pedestrians who shout to the skies ""Look, it's Spider-Man!"", fit just as well as the richly drawn human characters. Raimi and the creative team behind the film's production design deserve the highest of praises. There is nothing else that combines style and realism to such astonishing effect. It's as if forty years of comics have been distilled into a real world somewhere alongside our own. Spider-Man is a captivating movie to look at. The action scenes are as fast and fun as the best of Cameron or Spielberg, but Raimi adds his own comic book punch, a kind of visceral razor-sharpness that leaps off the screen. The climactic showdown alone is as brutal, shocking, and frighteningly violent a movie battle as you will ever see. And when Spider-Man swings through the Manhattan skyline, you feel the exhilaration like you're right there with him. Despite a moment or two of spotty CGI from Sony Imageworks, the special effects here are world class too. The digital Spidey moves with a grace and elegance that would have been inconceivable just ten years prior, but digital or not, every time Spider-Man was on screen, I couldn't take my eyes off of it.<br/><br/>Spider-Man showcases Sam Raimi at his exuberant best. Every frame of this movie is bursting with life. Whether it's the often gripping action scenes or the carefully crafted soap operatic drama, Spider-Man is an enthusiastic piece of crowd-pleasing entertainment, a passionate celebration of the Spider-Man mythos, and above all, a work of unparalleled quality. Blockbusters, especially superhero movies, with their all but guaranteed profits, can often breed lazy filmmaking. Sam Raimi and company fly in the face of that conceit. The filmmakers have taken the time to really craft this film. Wrapped up in all the soaring spectacle is something real; An enchanting love story, a poignant morality tale about becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life. Spider-Man recalls the kind of stand-up-and-cheer excitement that Hollywood has lost in the post Dark Knight/Avengers world of superhero movies. Raimi doesn't try to transcend the genre. Spider-Man is not ""more"" than a comic book movie, but through sheer craftsmanship, it is as perfect a comic book movie as can be made. I can't imagine that we will ever see the stars align in such a perfect way again. Spider-Man came together exactly as it should have, with exactly the right people, at exactly the right time for the country. Seeing this movie in theaters was an experience I will never forget, and the film still stands as the standard for what superhero blockbusters can be.<br/><br/>95/100"

"nickmesafilms","9","47","54","19 May 2012"," Spider-Man (2002) - With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility!
","Considered as one of the most successful superhero movies ever made, ""Spider-Man"" is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable motion picture. One of my childhood favorites, to be exact! This movie tells the origin story of Peter Parker, or Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat one of the first villains of the Spider-Man universe, the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J.K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. Behind ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers"", ""Spider-Man"" is probably my third favorite superhero movie. I can watch this movie over and over again, and it's still a fun time. I was easily impressed with this movie, and it never disappoints to entertain. Everyone will find something to enjoy for sure. ""Spider-Man"", in my review, ""a refreshing story, and exciting action""."

","""With great power comes great responsibility"".These words, spoken by Peter Parker's uncle Ben(Cliff Robertson)during their last conversation and which have become Spider-Man's motto, also perfectly represent the challenge Sam Raimi was facing when asked to bring one of America's most loved superheroes to the screen.<br/><br/>You can relax, fellas: Raimi's movie is definitely worth a look.Loosely based on the origin story and the Stan Lee/John Romita Sr. run, it's a fascinating mix of spectacular action and powerful drama, as it chronicles Peter Parker's(Tobey Maguire) transformation into a superhuman and the responsibilities deriving from said metamorphosis: while fighting crime to avenge his uncle's death, he also has to deal with his feelings for Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst) and his friendship with Harry Osborn(James Franco); add Harry's father Norman(Willem Dafoe), who's become schizophrenic psycho Green Goblin, and you've got a quite complicated situation.<br/><br/>Raimi's excellent at showing us the hero's pain, as well as the one he causes to others, and he gets terrific performances from the entire cast, particularly Maguire, Dafoe and Robertson.<br/><br/>On its own, it's a very good superhero flick, alongside the sequel, it's an absolute masterpiece.<br/><br/>Recommended even if you don't care about the comics."
"sdjones-1","Null","138","178","2 May 2002"," Amazing!
","I thoroughly enjoyed ""Spider-Man,"" which I saw in a screening. I thought the movie was very engrossing.  Director Sam Raimi kept the action quotient high, but also emphasized the human element of the story.  Tobey Maguire was very believable as the gawky teenager in the early part of the film and then, after his run-in with the radioactive, genetically engineered spider, as the athletic, acrobatic superhero of the title. His boyish glee at discovering his new superpowers was infectious and got a lot of laughs.  I also didn't mind the changes to the ""Peter Parker: The Amazing Spider-Man"" comic book story that the film's writers made, e.g., having Spider-Man's web come out of glands in his wrists rather than being an invention of Peter Parker's.  Especially good were Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson as Aunt May and Uncle Ben Parker, Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/the Green Goblin, James Franco as Harry Osborn, and Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson.  And in a small but memorable role, J.K. Simmons (""Oz,"" Law & Order"") as newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson was hilarious.  Perfect casting. I also thought the special effects were very good.  Although I could easily tell when Spidey was a computer-generated image (or a stunt double for that matter), it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the movie. However, I saw the movie with a six-year-old, who found the villainous Green Goblin -- superbly personified by Willem Dafoe -- very, very frightening, so I would advise against taking children younger than 10 years of age to this movie. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" comic book was a childhood favorite of mine, and I can honestly say that Sam Raimi has done it justice!  I'm going to go see this movie again (sans terrified six-year-old)."

","Now, there are so many spiderman movies out there but this movie holds a good place in my heart becoz i just watched it when i was a kid and i had so many memories with it. And now when i rewatched it , it is really good the acting , story and vfx ,cgi is really on point. U should watch this movie if u haven't becoz it worth it."
"joetufano719","9","21","24","19 June 2012"," ""This is my gift. My curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man."" 10 years later, it's still amazing!
","Before I saw this movie, I didn't really care for Spider-Man that much. Summer of 2002 when it came out, my Dad and I went to see it and I thought it was incredible! Even today 10 years later, I still get a thrill out of it, and it's a movie that has stayed in my imagination for a long time.<br/><br/>It's a great origin story about how Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) becomes Spider-Man after being bitten by a genetically engineered spider, and becomes a superhero after his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson, RIP) is killed by a carjacker. He later battles the Green Goblin who is really Norman Osborn, the father of Peter Parker's best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco). I still love how the movie ends. Peter is walking away from Mary Jane who has just kissed him and realized that he could be Spider-Man since she kissed Spider-Man earlier in the movie. In a voice over, Peter says, ""Whatever life holds in store for me, I will never forget these words: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' This is my gift. My curse. Who am I? I'm Spider-Man."" And it shows Spider-Man swinging through New York City.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is in my view, the best actor to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man yet, and accurately captures the awkwardness and caring personality of the character. Kirsten Dunst who plays Mary Jane is great even though I wish she didn't play damsel in distress so much in this movie. My Dad and I joke around about the famous scene where she and Spider-Man kiss each other in the rain with Spider-Man hanging upside down. As for, Willem Dafoe who plays the main antagonist Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, he is insanely good, since he always plays an excellent bad guy, and the rest of the cast such as Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson and J.K. Simmons bring their ""A"" game. Sam Raimi was an excellent choice for the director since he was a big fan of the Spider-Man comics as a kid. He definitely brought what he knew into the story, even though he made some changes in this version. Honestly, I don't have a problem with changes he made.<br/><br/>I know that because of the new Spider-Man coming out this year, fans of that film are hating this movie and the other two and embracing the new one. In all fairness, I will always love Sam Raimi's trilogy regardless of how successful the new Spider-Man films are even though I'm looking forward to the new series.<br/><br/>10 years later, I still give this movie a thumbs up."

","Having seen the trailers for this film I have to say that I didn't walk into the cinema with high hopes. The computer effects looked badly integrated, the Green Goblin's costume looked awful and comic book adaptations usually have such painful scripting and plotting. Thankfully I was wrong on most counts (The Goblin still looks rubbish).<br/><br/>As it turns out, this is probably the best super-hero film I've yet seen - certainly up there with Superman and Batman. People seem to automatically comment that the script and acting was bad because they expect it to be the case in these films; and indeed it usually is. But if you go into Spider-man without this prejudicial attitude you'll be pleasently suprised. The acting is generally great - there is never a time when anyone is not believable as their character and you think ""Hey, that's an actor, not Peter Parker"". The effects do look artificial but the pace of the movie means you don't have time to dwell on this and the script is fine! What do people want, Shakespearian soliloquies? That would sound incredibly out-of-place in modern day New York. There are few of the painful cliches or dreadful dialogue that plague films like The Phantom Menace and the catchphrases like ""friendly neighbourhood spider-man"" are fully in-keeping with the character.<br/><br/>
The comic turns from J.J. Jameson hit the mark, the snarling facial contortions of Willem Defoe were suitably evil-looking (and the conversation with his mirror-image was a great touch). My only gripe was with the Green Goblin's costume. Very monotone green and not very scary.<br/><br/>All-in-all a great film that I wouldn't hesitate for a second in recommending."
"Aaron1375","10","80","103","2 September 2005"," What I was hoping for and more.
","Usually when there is a big summer movie I am looking forward to, I wait and wait and then the movie comes out and it is a big disappointment. I really looked forward to the American Godzilla movie and by golly it was a huge disappointment. Then I really looked forward to Star Wars episode 1 and although it was not the disappointment Godzilla was, it was still a disappointment. Spider-man however was everything I was hoping it to be. In fact, it has to be considered one of the best comic book adaptations ever. It actually took parts of the comic book and incorporated it into the movie. Unlike most comic book movies where the story doesn't come from any of the comic books. Sure there are some departures such as the organic web shooters, but this is acceptable seeing as how watching Peter Parker learning he has them makes for some humorous scenes. The entire cast did a great job capturing the characters they were playing and there are some great fights as well. This is also a departure from most comic book movies where there is really no good fight at all between the heroes and villains."
"clydestuff","10","104","136","9 April 2004"," Raimi and Maguire weave a magical web in this excellent comic adaptation
","Studios lately have been known to spend almost $200 million dollars bringing a comic book super hero to life on the silver screen.  With $200 million dollars you can buy  many state of the art special effects for the director to full around with to his hearts content.  If in the process, though, he decides to fore-go an entertaining story and script, characters that we can get to know and sympathize with, and good actors to bring those characters to life, all the special effects in the world isn't going to amount to a hill of beans.  Fortunately for us, in bringing Marvel Comic's Spiderman to life, Sam Raimi did care about those little details and the audience is richly rewarded because of it.<br/><br/>One of the trickier tasks when transferring a film such as Spiderman to film is in giving us enough background story.  If a writer and director spend too much time on the origins of the character, it has a tendency to bog the rest of the film down.  Likewise, if it is given short thrift, we never have a chance to become involved emotionally with the super-hero.  In Spiderman, Raimi, aided immeasurably by Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman strikes just the right note.  Maguire is such an accomplished actor, that he immediately establishes Peter Parker as someone we will care about throughout the film.  He has a crush on the beautiful girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is constantly harassed by the school jerk, and has a best friend, Harry  (James Franco), who's relationship with his father Norman (Willem Dafoe)is far from perfect.  As for Peter, he has an exceptional home life with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) which is probably one of the reasons Harry develops an early kinship with him.  That and the fact that Harry's father seems to think more of Peter than he does of his own son at times. <br/><br/>
After having been bitten by a mutated spider, Peter awakens one morning to find himself with some exceptional super powers.  He develops muscles that he didn't have before, has reflexes Michael Jordan would be proud of, and can shoot a web like nobody's business.  It is during these early scenes of discovery by Peter that the film truly excels.  Maguire is like a child whom after taking his first steps, learns he can motor about the house quite nicely, thank you very much.  We can't help but have as much fun watching Peter Parker hone his skills as he seems to have in being able to do these magnificent feats.<br/><br/>Another fine aspect of Spiderman is the love story that develops between Parker and Mary Jane.  As Peter Parker, he is never able to quite overcome his inability to tell Mary Jane of his true feelings.  Later, as Spiderman, there is a wonderful scene between him and Mary Jane in a drenching downpour that any romantic film would envy.<br/><br/>Whereas some have not been too enamored of Dafoe's portrayal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, I found both to be right on the mark.  As Norman, we see how his continuous drive to control his company alienates and spoils the relationship he has with his son Harry.  It's not that Norman is an evil person, his quest for power has led him to more or less take his son for granted.  Later, when after a lab accident, it is the schizophrenic battle between the normal Harry and the Evil Harry that brings the Green Goblin to life.  It would have been easy for Raimi to have the lab accident just turn Harry instantly into the Green Goblin, but instead we get a richer more dramatic story that we wouldn't have had otherwise.<br/><br/>Likewise James Franco, who looks enough like Dafoe that they could be father and son, is a youth who seems tormented by the fact that no matter what success he achieves, his father never gives him his just due.  Kirsten Dunst is also beautiful and charming as Mary Jane.  Her romantic scenes with Spiderman are wonderfully played, and she has an especially moving scene with Peter Parker as the film draws to a close.<br/><br/>As for the special effects, they are indeed spectacular.  As Spiderman swoops between buildings on his web, you won't think once that it's not really him doing so.  When reading IMDB reviews of this film or any other film that depends heavily on  special effects, one must keep in mind that it has become more or less a hobby among some to downgrade the effects of any film so my advice is to just ignore the criticism in that regard.  The effects here are fine.<br/><br/>Two years ago, it was with quite a bit of eagerness that I anticipated Raimi's Spiderman film and it lived up to my hopes in every aspect.  If the impending sequel comes even close to being as good as the original, it'll be a job well done.  And if a film such as Spiderman can have me counting the days until Spiderman II, than I have no choice but to give it my grade, which for Spiderman is an A."

","Spider-Man is seriously the best movie of the summer! I couldn't believe how much fun I had watching this movie: the fights, the costumes, the charactersÂ… I'm not even a comic book nerd, no offense to those who are, just I couldn't believe how much of a nerd I felt like when I was jumping and getting excited to see this movie. I waited an hour in line to see this movie with my friends and I have to tell you that it was completely worth it. This is the crazy movie of the summer, but it's one of the best blockbusters to come out of the new millennium. I was never into Spider-Man, didn't really know about the story, but seeing this movie, I think I'm going to take a trip to the comic book store probably.<br/><br/>Peter Parker, his best friend Harry Osborn, and Peter's secret crush Mary Jane Watson visit a genetics laboratory with their high school class. While taking photos in the laboratory, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically engineered ""super spider"". Feeling unwell, he passes out shortly after arriving home. Meanwhile, scientist and owner of Oscorp Norman Osborn, Harry's father, is attempting to preserve his company's military contract, knowing that its loss will mean the end of his business. He experiments on himself with his company's new, but unstable, performance-enhancing chemical vapor which increases his speed, strength, and stamina. However, it also causes him to become insane and kills his assistant. The next morning, Peter wakes to find that his previously impaired vision has improved and that his body has changed into a more muscular physique. At school, he finds himself producing webbing and having the quick reflexes to avoid being injured in a fight with bully Flash Thompson. Peter escapes from the school and realizes that he has acquired spider-like abilities from the spider bite. He quickly learns to scale walls, long jump across building rooftops and swing via webs from his wrists. Norman being ticked off that he didn't get a muscular body he decides to destroy the world! OK, that's not exactly the reason, but I did sense tension there.<br/><br/>I had so much fun watching this movie, I can't tell you how many incredible scenes there were, I think my favorite was between Norman coming to Thanksgiving dinner and the high tension when he finds out who Spider Man is and the last fight scene between Spider Man and the Green Goblin was awesome! The ending is a cliff hanger, so I'm looking forward to seeing the next Spider Man. This was a great movie, I highly recommend it, Spider-Man has great effects, cheesy acting, fun one liners, and the upside down kiss that will be talked about for generations to come.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Breaking with usual tradition, the ""Spider-Man"" DVD was released today, a Friday. At around $15 almost everywhere, for the 2 disk set, it was too good a bargain to pass up. I hadn't seen the film in theaters so this was my first viewing. Definitely entertaining, with a good mix of action and budding romance, the film of the beginnings of Spider-Man. Although I was a bigger fan of Superman as a kid, I also have good memories of the Spider-Man comics, and this film is very faithful.<br/><br/>no SPOILERS here - The 2 disk DVD set is one of the better ones. The picture itself is extremely sharp, and very colorful, with a very clear and dynamic Dolby 5.1 sound track. Surround sound complements the picture masterfully, so that the viewer seems right in the middle of the action.  **POINT** - As I have explained in other reviews, anyone still watching movies at home on VHS needs to get rid of it now!  It is a different movie on DVD, the quality of the picture, the quality of the sound, not to mention all the extras. With a widescreen TV it is almost like being in a theater.<br/><br/>The EXTRAS - In addition to the movie, disk one has a feature that pops up a spider icon at certain spots that, when ""clicked"", jumps you to a brief ""making of"" segment for that scene, then jumps you back to the movie. Plus there are two different, selectable commentaries for anyone who likes the re-watch a movie and hear what went into its making.<br/><br/>Disk two is completely devoted to ""extras"", like screen tests, an HBO special, and other aspects of making ""Spider-Man.""  Also included is an archive of Spider-Man comics covers from the 1960s to now, grouped by decade, and written script to summarize the basic story of each issue. A ""must have"" for all Spider Man comics fans.<br/><br/>There have been a few user reviews on IMDb, usually very short, which trash this movie, and may even say something like ""avoid this movie"". Be certain those are ""bogus"" reviews, written for some deceptive purpose, I know not why. For anyone who enjoys any kind of fantasy action movie with a good message, ""Spider-Man"" is a definite ""must-see."""

","One of the most successful translations of ""comic book to screen"" has fine results in SPIDER-MAN, a handsomely produced version of the comic book classic with a sprightly score by Danny Elfman and some incredibly realistic looking CGI effects.<br/><br/>The simple plot of good vs. evil begins when Peter Parker is bitten by a spider while touring a local museum with his high school class. The plot thickens when he develops webs and the ability to soar over rooftops and vehicles with ease--as well as climbing walls. Toby Maguire plays the nerdy teen-ager with a wholesome air of innocent charm, his open-eyed expression never concealing the delight he takes in the role. As his girlfriend, Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst does a likable enough job even if the costume department decided to dress her like a teen hooker.<br/><br/>Everyone else is in fine form. William Dafoe deserves top praise for his Green Goblin--evil enough to frighten the wits out of the faint-hearted. J. Jonah Jameson is excellent as the bombastic newspaper editor who takes advantage of his most famous client. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson, in quieter roles, are warm and human. James Franco is believable as Peter's best friend.<br/><br/>Admirers of the comic book tales should have no trouble liking the movie with its amazing CGI effects. It's heart-warming and funny, with some terror thrown in for good measure. Good escapist entertainment even if the message seems a little vague. Message??"
"Sean_Thorniley","7","95","131","1 May 2002"," Poignant, fun and a faithful adaptation to the original comic book
","Poignant, fun and a  faithful adaptation to the original comic book.  I am very critical of comic book movies since I am a huge fan of the medium and was tremendously disappointed in the Superman and Batman movies (all of them, some greatly!). This film however has again demonstrated that an adaptation of a comic book story can be  fun and faithful to the story, yet be a film for all ages and those who may not have ever even read a comic book.  The Crow was the only other good comic book movie in my opinion, but it was not an all ages fun ride as this is!<br/><br/>I had the privilege of seeing the film last night, 4-30-02, in SF with the press and 300+ other folks for its ""Bay Area Premiere"".<br/><br/>The acting is the finest portion of the film with the leads giving us depth that I was unsure would be allowed by the style of story chosen.  Maguire was outstanding at being a guy who can rarely catch a break, but attract difficulty with ease and aplomb.  He is awkward with the woman he loves, but eloquent when dealing with the familiar, just as most teenagers are even today.  He gave us wonderful joy at the prospect of ""web swinging"" and kicking some much deserved ass!  Dafoe is wonderfully scary as the man who has succumbed to the power games of the corporate  world that drives a decent man mad striving for perfection in himself while trying to hard to please all the wrong people to no avail and then being consumed by guilt that has built over the years of family neglect which finally helps to push him over the edge when an opportunity to make a huge mistake presents itself.<br/><br/>The rest of cast is nearly as spectacular with the J.K. Simmons turning in the best performance in the film as J. Jonah Jamason.  When he appeared on screen things lite up even more and he was on fire making everyone in the audience laugh and myself nearly p** my pants.  Harris as Aunt May and Robertson as Uncle Ben were excellent choices and gave the film a great deal of its credibility and finesse.  Letting what happens to Ben and Peter (I am not telling) was wonderful and the best punctuation to what makes Peter do what he does and brings complete credibility to the story.   I am not a huge Dunst fan, but she was just fine as the love of Peter Parker's life and a person much like Peter only neither was conscious of the fact.  This to me is a more real version of  ""true love"".<br/><br/>The script was far stronger than I expected with some wonderful dialog; verbal exchanges, solid plot points and pacing.  Many a good parenting lesson can be found in this film as well as interesting thoughts about the choices that we make in life that we might think are no big deal when in the heat of passion, but may well come back to haunt us if we don't think before we act/speak: which is the trust of the film in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>The direction from Raimi was also much better than I anticipated coming from someone who is known (and loved) for his over the top camp and action.  Many of the fight and action sequences where more ""over done"" than I like, but they were solid and much like a comic of the Silver Age from whence the story comes so it fit the film fine.  Nice cinematography without the CGI taking over and detracting from the realism, in fact it made much of the web swinging truly believable.  A few points made things a bit hard to ""believe"", but over all I think most folks will be able to suspend their disbelief.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman.  Need I say more?  He is the man when it comes to ""super hero"" music and is the closest thing to John Willams and the late great Bernard Herman there is today.  He subtly sets the mood and most of the audience probably doesn't even realize it.  Tomorrow is my day off and I will be purchasing the score to add to my collection!"

","SPIDER-MAN is a stupendous masterpiece of the superhero cinema. It blends action, adventure, humour, emotions, thrills and science fiction in a perfect way. Tobey Maguire's whole-hearted portrayal of SPIDER-MAN is flawless. I remember watching this movie as a very young child and loved every bit of it. Just few weeks ago, I re-watched the film in high quality to recall the old good memories of the film as well to enjoy it in the best picture quality. I felt more enthralled and intrigued than earlier. <br/><br/>Each and every actor in this film has given an explosive performance. Tobey is undoubtedly very relatable as Peter Parker, with whom you won't mind sharing his tears. The way the film's mood turns to a very intense one towards the end, his act intensifies. You see him breathe the roles of Peter and Spidey. Willem Dafoe plays an easily menacing antagonist whose actions make him very entertaining. Kirsten Dunst leaves a strong impression as Mary Jane, while James Franco too impresses with his cool performance. Rosemary Harris portrays Aunt May very well, while it's Cliff Robertson, whose portrayal of Ben Parker is very emotional and instantly makes you care and cry for him. And J.K. Simmons: do I need to say how great both his acting and comic timing are?<br/><br/>The film's action is brilliantly executed and innovative in many ways. Each and every action sequence is explosive and gels perfectly with the screenplay. The film has a lot of classic moments which are still remembered as one of the best ones in a superhero film. The visual effects are phenomenal, as is the editing. Sam Raimi's direction makes it a flawless film which feels like one's own story.<br/><br/>Finally, it's the film's action packed climax and an emotionally resonant ending which proves how every superhero who has superpowers, has also many great responsibilities to handle. Seriously, a SPIDER-MAN movie couldn't have been any better than this."
"vivekchandra007","10","12","14","27 January 2017"," It still holds up really well, after about 14 years
","Saw it again, last night, after a long time and it still managed to catch my attention and I noticed such small (intrinsic) details embedded throughout the movie that it looks like Sam Raimi really spun an amazingly entertaining movie through strings of comic-web. One of the best origin stories that like an old wine, keeps getting better because it is laden with story, a soul that only gets more enlightened by CGI. Sam Raimi researched the material well and it shows, be it having some inside jokes, Easter eggs and how he got the hero got name. The first 30 minutes is simply the best ""origin of origin"", a superhero flick has shown till date. Best thing is he got so much comfortable with it that he made even amazing second part (one of the best sequels till date) (tied up with T2) but still nothing beats an origin story because it shows ""Even you can be""."
"generationofswine","10","7","8","16 November 2016"," An Honest Review
","It is clearly a Sam Raimi film. You see that right away in the sense of humor. Make it cheesy and cheap enough and the audience will laugh at it sort of humor...and it works.<br/><br/>You laugh when you see the cheap jokes, the low-budget moments in a high budget film, it all adds to the appeal, it makes it fun to watch.<br/><br/>Plus, Peter Parker is the Dork we all know him to be. He's the nerd, the dweeb, and the smart alack that has to keep cracking jokes so he doesn't have to face the life and death reality of what he's actually doing.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire excels at bringing Peter Parker to the big screen in a way that stays true to the character and the source material. He is far better than the travesty of Andrew Garfield's Spider Bully.<br/><br/>You get the sense with Maguire that Spider Man is a hero and not Garfield's excuse to mock and bully people while pretending to be a good guy.<br/><br/>Maguire is a great fit for Raimi's vision of Spider Man and between the two of them the film delivers as much in action as it does in comedy.<br/><br/>Sit back and enjoy it, no matter how old you are it's worth the ride."

","I truly don't know what to say about this movie, which got already all <br/><br/>possible praises and all possible critics ! But I will write what I can<br/><br/>from my heart, cause my post cannot match any reviews from grammatical<br/><br/>super humans and ultra intelligent movie critics ! OK lets start : <br/><br/>This movie is directed by one of my favorite film directors Sam Raimi who directed and produced so many good movies and one I love the most is TV series adaptation of Evil Dead (also directed by him) movie, Ash vs Evil Dead which also have mostly positive reviews by top critics. I think ratings go well over 90% on rotten tomatoes ! <br/><br/>Spider-Man is supremely made from beginning till end. Every scene is so fresh, playful, innocent and there is no second of boredom in this one ! I think its the best movie of all movies about Spider- Man and they surely knew why Sam Raimi would be perfect man for directing it ! Special effects are just right amount and they don't look artificial at all ! You really have feeling like being part of this world of super heroes and super villains ! So if you wanna movie to look good give it to Spielberg, Peter Jackson or Sam Raimi ! In all three cases you cannot miss ! Acting could be flawed but movie will look good ! Cause I really love movies about super heroes, with Superman first part being one of my favorite movies ever, but I love also Batman and actually all marvel produced world of super heroes, including X-men franchise (Nine movies until 2016, Deadpool is really great, as well as all others, yup I like also those three banned by critics) Why I wrote this review in 2016 if movie was made 2002 ? I always loved this movie,I guess I would like to support its ratings to go for tiny bit higher ! So for me everything is perfect in this movie - acting, effects, story, scenery for me all this is 10/10 ! On of rare movies I can say that without least doubt ! Just one more thing- 3rd part of Spider Man from 2007(also directed by Sam Raimi) was little bit over criticized by movie critics ! I know they know what to write, they are not stupid of course, but still maybe we became little to spoiled by both mega successful and genius parts before that one (2002 and 2004) cause they said ; in this 3rd part problem is there is too much of everything, but I think Sam Raimi just wanted to conclude franchise with spectacular finish, so in my eyes it was unjustly rated and my rate for all three parts is 10/10 without any doubt ! Thank You Sam for so many excellent movies and to make our life more fun !!"

"Aly200","10","7","10","21 January 2017"," An Entertaining, Superb and Well Executed Superhero Movie
","Bryan Singer's ""X-Men"" have started getting audiences excited for the modern superhero movies, but when Sam Raimi released his first ""Spider Man"" outing the expectations bar immediately shot to the stratosphere. Raimi delivered on his promise of an exciting and action-packed film about Marvel Comic's famous web-slinging superhero. <br/><br/>We are given the basic origin story of how teenage Peter Parker gains his famous powers after a radioactive spider bites him, but we are treated to an engaging narrative as the newly minted hero must contend with his most deadly adversary in the wicked Green Goblin while also contending with normal teenage drama such as an at-times contentious friendship as well as harboring feelings for his pretty neighbor. <br/><br/>Stepping into the web-slinger's famous costume is the well cast Tobey Maguire who deftly manages to play both the nerdy Peter Parker and courageous Spider Man with equal flair. Despite being nearly thirty years old at the time of filming, Maguire's youthful appearance convinces the audience that he resembles a teenager and not a mature young man. Even when inhabiting Spidey's famous suit, Maguire displays a youthful machismo mixed with some naivety as Peter is still coming into his element as a superhero but proves himself as fearless when confronted by his emerald-clad nemesis, the Green Goblin. While other more seasoned young actors were considered, the gamble to go with Maguire paid handsomely as he carries the weight of both average New York teen and crime-fighting legend in harmonious tandem.<br/><br/>On the opposite side of the board playing the villainous Green Goblin and his unstable alter ego, Norman Osbourne, is the wickedly delightful Willem Dafoe in one of his most insane roles. When the film starts and Norman is running his successful company, Dafoe portrays a fatherly wisdom for young actors Tobey Maguire as Peter and James Franco who plays Norman's son, Harry, but also shows early signs of the soon-to-be shattered psyche that will doom Norman to the corruptible power of the Goblin persona (the result of a lab accident where Norman tests a power-enhancing drug on himself and kills a fellow scientist in his mania). Once the transformation into an unstable madman begins to take effect, Dafoe fully embraces the insanity and goes as over the top as possible, utilizing his vocal talents by using a lighter vocal tone for the tormented Norman while using his trademark gravelly sounding voice and a cackling demented laugh for the wicked Goblin, without becoming a cartoonish impression of the famous super-villain but as a calculating and dangerous adversary who strikes fear into everyone around New York. Added to the excitement of watching the actor in action is that instead of having a stuntman do the brunt work of maneuvering the Goblin's glider and engaging in fisticuffs with Spider Man is that Willem Dafoe performs his own stunts (the actor himself stated the fact in numerous interviews and the filmmakers backed Dafoe's statements). <br/><br/>A talented supporting cast rounds out the compelling characters with Kirsten Dunst as Peter Parker's longtime neighbor and love interest, Mary Jane Watson, James Franco as Peter's best friend< Harry Osbourne who happens to be the son of his mortal enemy, Rosemary Harris as Peter's beloved Aunt May and cliff Robertson in the role of Uncle Ben (who sadly doesn't make it to the halfway mark of the film as comic book fans know well) and in a scene- stealing role as hot-headed and grouchy boss of the Daily Bugle, J. Jonah Jameson, is J.K. Simmons in what is one of the character actor's most iconic roles. <br/><br/>The film's action sequences are well choreographed and executed from Peter Parker's first attempts to use his enhanced spider-like abilities to the infamous introduction of the Green Goblin at an Oscorp party to the dynamic final confrontation between Spidey and his emerald nemesis where the fists fly and ass-kicking just draws the attention in and doesn't relent till a victor is declared. The filmmakers use as little CGI as possible except for Spider Man's web-slinging across the city since director Sam Raimi is known for using practical effects in his films. <br/><br/>The narrative of the film as mentioned before sets up the main action with the origin of Spider Man when Peter is bitten by the radioactive spider on a field trip with his class and we are given Green Goblin's origin as well with Norman Osbourne's ill-advised test of his company's drug on himself that causes him to become the demented villain we love to hate. The story then shifts into the main plot of how Spider Man comes to learn what he must do as a hero to protect his beloved city and loved ones.<br/><br/>A truly masterful superhero film that really ushered in the modern superhero craze."

","I had the grand opportunity to see a special private screening of this eagerly anticipated movie and I must say I was definitely impressed and I was in total awe. Not since the last superhero movie I saw was there a more and clear and complete followup to the comic book and this one was totally it which had me on the edge of my seat and hanging on for more. ""Spider-Man"" is a grand transition to what a comic book hero supposed to be and for a good reason. It sticks to detail and while it does that it keeps its audience hanging on for more and then some. The acting of the cast was very,very good and for Tobey Maguire's performance as the teen stud Peter Parker/Spider-Man was the best characterization I've seen in a long time since the days of Christopher Reeve(who was the last good actor to play a superhero and to be true to the comic book format).<br/><br/>As for the story itself,it kept its pace with the origins of the story and the comic book itself was right on precise target. As for the villain,actor William Dafoe was electrifying as Spidey's arch nemesis Green Goblin and the battle between him and our web slinger is something to behold. Even the leading lady,Kristen Dunst was not bad as Peter's girlfriend who keeps his identity a secret,but she knows who he is. As the good point of interest,the movie is worth the price of admission. Even if you're a fan of the Marvel comic book or a huge fan of Spidey's cartoon series of Saturday mornings,then this is the ticket to get. Be prepared for the ride of the summer,since this one is unbelievable. Kudos to director Sam Raimi for doing this right and finally bringing Spidey to the screen!!!!<br/><br/>NOTE: There will be two more installments to the Spider-Man trilogy in which Spidey goes up against his greatest enemies like Dr. Octopus, Venom,and Mystiquo and not to mention the deadliest of them all...... DR. DOOM."
"StevePulaski","8","5","7","2 July 2012"," One of the most ecstatic superhero events in quite some time
","Peter Parker is the awkward, neurotic, socially inept teenager, interested in photography, and crushing on the prettiest girl in school, Mary Jane Watson. During his trip to a genetics laboratory, where the class learns all about genetically altered spiders, Peter is bit on the hand by one of the arachnids that escaped and slowly begins to possess powers beyond his wildest dreams. At first, he realizes he can see without the help of his glasses, next, he notices he can leap heights and flip to great lengths, and finally, he starts to acquire the ability to stick to walls and shoot webs out of his hands.<br/><br/>He becomes the notorious and infamous, Spider-Man, where he has proved to be a burden to some, but a hero to others in his hometown of New York City, where he lives with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris). After his Uncle Ben is shot and killed during a robbery, Peter notices the city is nothing but scum and is determined to take down the cities' worst in the form of secrecy. Meanwhile, his close friend, Harry's (James Franco) father, Dr. Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) is the president of the Oscorp manufacturing corporation, where they make and supply weaponry to the United States Army. In the mix of it all, Osborn becomes, what newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) dubs, the ""Green Goblin"" who pilots a glider, and serves as the villain to Spider-Man's hero.<br/><br/>What inevitably follows is a series of unplanned and very physical battle scenes taking place with the backdrop of New York City skylines to handle it all. There's also a subplot, involving Peter, played effortlessly well by Tobey Maguire, trying to impress Mary Jane, played by the talented and attractive Kirsten Dunst, by relentlessly saving her from calamity and trouble by sweeping in at the nick-of-time while she is either being held captive by the Goblin, intimidated by muggers or even falling to her death. The catch is Mary Jane doesn't know this is Peter, but on the side, she talks to him at various points in the film. They've lived next to each other for years, but Peter has always viewed her as the unachievable girl next door and Mary Jane has probably always found Peter to be the unfortunate geek next door. How she doesn't recognize his voice when ""Spider-Man"" saves her an astronomical three times is beyond me. She should probably stick to staying in doors.<br/><br/>No bother. Sam Raimi's Spider-Man is a fascinating and entertaining work of superhero fiction, collectively doing Marvel and all of its actors justice by blessing them with good material, a straight-shooting script, and action sequences that don't fail to impress. The kinetics and craft of it all are through the roof, and the twenty-five+ years the picture spent in development clearly was for the best. The film spends the first hour or so getting us acquainted with the man behind the mask, much like the original Marvel comics. We see Parker as a human, not an action figure, occupying a mask of uniqueness and power. The film shows the geek in the beginning, sympathetically, and then goes on to showcase him powerfully, where he is a placed in a role of certainty and bravery.<br/><br/>Marvel comics were notorious for paying attention to the character behind the mask and the character in the mask. One thing Spider-Man neglects to showcase in its script and its main character is the agony and pain of it all. The second Marvel feature in 2003, Ang Lee's unfairly bashed Hulk, did a much better job at showing how a superhero's powers were more of a belligerent curse than a stroke of luck in a world of bitterness. Stan Lee infused his comics with so much life and enigma for the characters, plot progression, and the color of it all that the challenge to adapt it to film is definitely there. Raimi handles it appropriately and maturely, not becoming sidetracked with monotonous melodrama or overly-cutesy action sequences.<br/><br/>The ones he does bring to the table are kinetic and stylish, showing off some of the most impressive photography and visual work of the year 2002, and brings two charismatic actors along for the ride. Spider-Man may not have the excruciating depth of Hulk, which created more cons than pros in the job of a superhero, along with establishing a sincere yet distant father and son relationship, but in its own right, it does so much in its two hours that you may need to stop for a breather.<br/><br/>Starring: Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris, and J. K. Simmons. Directed by: Sam Raimi."
"timefreezer7","8","16","31","21 November 2003"," Well done - can't wait for the sequel
","Directed by Sam Raimi<br/><br/>Written by David Koepp<br/><br/>Starring: Tobey Maguire , Willem Dafoe , Kirsten Dunst and James Franco<br/><br/>After years of anticipation and a never ending court battle concerning the legal rights ,  a big budget cinematic adaptation of the well known comics superhero has finally made it to the movie theaters . First of all I should say I was never much of a Spider-man fan , I have never read comics but is there any person on earth who doesn't know the red clad hero who jumps from building to building ? I doubt so . My only knowledge of Spider-man was some cartoon show where he makes a dynamic trio with Iceman and Fire-Star . I am not aware of anyone of Spidey's enemies and I was not familiar with his origin and motives . Nevertheless I am keen on comics generally and I always like seeing comics characters materialize on celluloid . So I got really excited when I heard that the project FINALLY got green-lighted and that Sam Raimi eventually took it upon him to shoot the Spider-man motion picture . I will have to admit that most of the comments are 100% right . Spider-man (2002) may not be a GREAT film but it sure is a good one (and it beats the hell out of the overrated and disappointing 2000's X-Men) .<br/><br/>I don't think the plot is significant . The movie remains as faithfully to its comics origins as it could be and it satisfies both the hardcore well-knowing fans and the uninitiated like I am . Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy 17 year old student ,  not much accepted by his social environment and constantly being picked by his bullies classmates . He has a secret crush on the beautiful girl next door Mary Jane `M.J.' Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but she hardly knows he exists . When he is bitten by a mutated super spider he is bestowed with special powers like climbing on windows with his bare (albeit sticky) hands , ejecting spider nets from his arms , incredible acrobatic agility and enhanced danger-approaching instinct. While he tries to adjust to his newly obtained powers he finds himself caught in a war that a fiendish super criminal called the Green Goblin has declared against him . The Green Goblin is a maniac who wreaks havoc and kills innocent people using military equipment and weaponry . He believes that Spider-Man is the only real threat and wants to bring him down . The Green Goblin is actually the alter-ego of Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) a very wealthy businessman / scientist who has started developing a split personality and the deranged Green Goblin becomes more and more dominant driving him to madness . Norman's son is Harry (James Franco) who coincidentally is Peter's best friend and classmate . So Spider-Man will try to stop the Green Goblin before he kills more civilians and simultaneously will try to get Mary Jane's attention .<br/><br/>That's it folks . The film spends much more time on the love story between Peter and Mary Jane and less on action . I always like character development and human relationships unfolded in superhero films but a little more action wouldn't heart either . Basically we see Spider-Man beat up some random thugs on alley streets and that's it . The balloon sequence in the middle of the film is nice but awfully reminiscent of Batman (1989) . I wish there were more epic battles between Spider-man and Green Goblin with more explosions . Some other things I didn't like either were :<br/><br/>
1) Even worse CGI SFX than the robot soldiers in the Phantom Menace !!! I never thought it could happen but here it is . The shots of Spider-Man in the beginning of the film jumping from the top of a building to another is a lame cartoon that will not convince even a 3 year old viewer . I cannot describe how laughable and fake this Spider-man cartoon is : you will have to see for yourselves .<br/><br/>2) The acting is average from all the actors . None of them manages to deliver fully the dramatic depth of the characters as scripted by the writer. The worst performance belongs to Willem Dafoe . His mirror communication scene was nicely scripted but Dafoe is extremely bad and unconvincing . What exactly happened here ? I liked him in Body of Evidence and Speed II but his talents seem to have been erased in this film . I will have to admit that some of the Green Goblin's lines gave me the creeps but can anyone assure me that it was really him under the suit (or his voice for that matter) ? Maguire's  and Dunst's acting is better but still mediocre . Speaking of the duo , one other flaw is that they don't have enough chemistry together (like Christopher Reeve and Margot Kidder) . If they made a more fitting pair the screen time spent in their romance would be more worthily used . And if James Franco has the most impact screen presence is because his character requires for him to sit back and look calm and cool (and it is obvious that's the reason why they cast him) . The secondary characters like Peter's uncle and aunt act OK but that newspaper editor was too annoying to like him.<br/><br/>3) The Green Goblin is never developed and is not much of a formidable foe . Maybe it was intentional to give him little screen time in order not to pull another scene-stealer (a la Joker) and give all the focus on Spider-Man . Unfortunately a great action film always needs a powerful evil character to be the opposition AND the driving force for the hero's existence .<br/><br/>
Aside from these flaws the movie has all the features of a good blockbuster . The red suit of Spider-Man is faithful and really convinces us that the character has come to life ! There are some good scenes like the one where Peter finally beats up one the bullies in school . My favorite scene in the movie is a great surprise and that's why I cannot give it away. All I can say if you haven't watched the film , is the sequence where the Green Goblin sings `The itsy , bitsy spider.' . I also digged the final duel between Spider-Man and Green Goblin . Without being too violent it is an exciting fight , larger-than-life and worth our money . I just wish the rest of the movie reached the same adrenaline levels . Despite a lackluster performance , Tobey Maguire was perfectly cast as Peter Parker . He suits the geeky looks the character has and convinces as a 17 year old with continually growing power (physical and personal) . The film has an obvious open end as a set up for the sequel . Much like some recent blockbusters like the Matrix or X-Men the first film is clearly an introductory chapter wanting to lure the audience to a whole franchise . You wait for more action in the next film , more exploitation of the potential of the story and you have a curiosity to find out where the relationships between the protagonists will lead . Spider-Man however manages to rise above the aforementioned films . Why ? Because it is a GOOD introduction . Where X-Men made the mistake of under using  10 characters without any success , Spider-Man has ONE main character . This is what I like most about Raimi's film . We follow Peter Parker from the very beginning . We have a taste of his life before the drastic change occurs and then we have the transformation in front of our eyes full play ! There is not a single superhero film that bothered to show us the beginning of the character . Obviously they thought it would be dull for the already initiated comic book fans but they were wrong . Yes there are other films with scenes were the motives were explained like Batman and some opening establishing scenes like the first Superman . But Raimi's Spider-Man is unique : we SEE Peter Parker training with his super powers , trying to control them and we even get to see him pick his costume . Now I will keep my reservations because I have yet to see the recent batch of Marvel comic-book adaptations like Daredevil or Hulk but for now Spider-Man is the best introducing film you will find . The metaphor about the responsibility of a teenager turned into a mature adult is also explored . The realistic approach is successful here . First of all the first thing Peter does with his powers is to try earning money . Only later he decides to use them for the city 's good and safety . Secondly despite some nitpicking from fans it is quite logical that Spider-man's web-shooting is an organic power . Peter is just 17 and as much as he is supposed to be a science genius he wouldn't have the money or the technology to invent some synthetic web shooters . The Green Goblin outfit sure looks like a Power Ranger suit but it is also realistic as it is a piece of military equipment and not a Halloween costume . New York City is depicted as a shiny town and establishes a truly existing environment for the story to take place .<br/><br/>Spider-Man (2002) for all its weaknesses is a good film with some of the best narrative I have seen . The voice-overs by Maguire help us identify with him even more . The film is better than some other comic book flicks like Phantom or Spawn (not entirely their fault since these characters are less appealing and therefore less known) Dick Tracy , The Mask or the Shadow (good idea but mediocre script / execution) or over hyped blockbusters like the X-Men . It will not be a classic like Superman II or Batman but it is one of the best of the bunch of the `comic-book' genre . I rank it up there with the 3 Batman sequels , Judge Dredd and the original Superman .<br/><br/>

"ncruz-77996","8","2","2","29 June 2019"," A Classic in Every sense of the Word
","Intro:<br/><br/>Many might be baffled by the 9/10 rating I gave this film. Many call it dated, and not as good as you remember. But, I think this film is every bit as good as you originally recalled, if not even better.<br/><br/>What I Love:<br/><br/>While this film is very cheesy, it's the classic origin of our favorite wall-crawler. I absolutely adore the storytelling of this film, with Sam Raimi's charm all over this film. From the incredibly relatable character of Peter Parker, and how he transforms into a superhero. As we see both the origins of Spider-Man and the Green Goblin happen at the same in the beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>And while many might call it stupid, or over the top. These characters live in an over the top universe.<br/><br/>And the world building is perfect. I feel like New York is a person. As we see the people of the city on screen. All the extras in this film are so colorful and have so much character, even though they're on screen for meat seconds.<br/><br/>And every moment of this film is so fun to watch. The action, while dated, is very entertaining. The character interactions, are very entertaining. This was a childhood classic for me, and part of the reason I love it so much, is because it's very entertaining.<br/><br/>I also enjoy the visual style of the film. It's so energetic in it's look. Just by looking at the film, you can tell Sam Raimi made it. It is drenched in his unique style of visuals. It uses CGI very well, and while the effects don't hold up, I think it helps the visual flare of this film. The city looks like it's out of a comic book, with the bright colors and vibrant locations.<br/><br/>But, the best part of the film, are the characters. Toby MaGuire is still my favorite live action Spider-Man. And James Franco plays my favorite Harry Osborn. And Willem Dafoe plays the seriously over the top Green Goblin, and I love the performance.<br/><br/>Peter Parker, he is played by an at the time, twenty something actor. Feels like a real needy teenager. He feels relatable. And he is an interesting character. Many might say he doesn't tell enough jokes. But I'm convinced it grounds him in a way. As it makes him feel more real. If I was battling a super villain, I wouldn't be telling be jokes, I would honestly be terrified.<br/><br/>Harry Osborn, while in the other films, often over the top, Harry is still a three dimensional character. As he was often not treated well and neglected by his father. And his story over the course of this series. And this is demonstrated so we'll, in several scenes. Like when Harry introduces his father to Peter, calling him Norman Osborn, really showing the disconnect between the two. And at graduation, Norman congratulating Peter more than his own son.<br/><br/>Norman Osborn is a really fun villain. With a wonderfully over the top performance in the part of Willem Dafoe. But he's a very interesting villain, as he was a rich businessman, who from the surface, seemed like a normal person. But from beneath, was really a cold hearted monster, and once he was turned into the Green Goblin, showed his true colors.<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>Many might pick at the issues with this film, the campiness, the dated effects, the over the top nature, and other things. But that doesn't stop me from loving this film and the other two in the trilogy, even Spider-Man 3. I will always love the film. It was a great superhero film when it came out, and it's a great film even today."

","Before Spiderman, there wasn't very many superhero movies. Most of them sucked. After Spiderman's release in 2002 and its sequels in 2004 and 2007, we saw the Dark Knight movies, Thor, Captain American, Iron Man, etc. Without this movie, many people in these superhero films would not have careers.<br/><br/>Unlike the cartoons and comics, this is slightly different version of Spiderman with a different story. Why did they change? Dramatic purposes were needed. See the 2012 reboot to see why. A nerdy Peter Parker gets bitten by a spider at a high school science field trip and develops radical powers. Although still timid and soft-spoken, he gains confidence and tries to win over Mary Jane Watson: his life-long crush. Meanwhile, Norman Osborne's most recent Oscorp experiment goes drastically wrong and develops a vicious alter-ego--the Green Goblin--who Peter must stop.<br/><br/>Anybody that says the 2012 reboot beats this either thinks Andrew Garfield is hot and/or are hardcore comic fans that don't understand how movies work. Tobey's Peter Parker is kind, caring likable, hardworking and mysterious that can't seem to catch a break. Mary Jane is sweet, has high hopes, is popular, and comes from a bad home. Norman Osborne is emotionally- destructive and tortured by his other personality, Green Goblin. This Green Goblin is freaking scary, yet funny villain that hasn't yet been topped. (Well, Heath Ledger did.) The Love story is original and better than the new one. In this, Peter keeps himself a mystery from Mary Jane, yet is still her emotional comfort who is always there. The new one is just him getting the girl right away and developing ""chemistry."" The hero doesn't get the girl in this? That is originality. This movie is also very unforgettable.<br/><br/>Tobey is so much better than Garf-cat. For one, he doesn't have a stupid haircut. For another, he is smart, but the whole movie isn't just Peter doing science experiments and trying to find out about his parents. Peter is also more muscular and looks like a superhero type, while Garfield is just skin and bones. Peter is developed so well in this, we feel his exact moods. Garfield's weren't bad, but not good. Tobey wasn't disrespectful to anybody like Garfield was throughout the whole movie. Tobey was more deserving of his powers. Tobey's Spider powers being internal makes him more of a superhuman. Garfield's discovery of his powers were so stupid. Garfield wined a lot more than Tobey did. This Peter was constantly changing throughout the whole movie, Garfield stayed the same. Tobey pulled off the geek persona while Garfield failed at a geek trying to be cool. Tobey's Spiderman delivers funny one-liners while fighting villains while Garfield breaks out into extremely stupid 10 minute songs and dances. Garfield gives up hunting his uncle's killer. Garfield only saved, what, 2 people? And caused that death of Gwen's father. Tobey saved many people throughout the whole movie and causes no deaths. Sorry for so many comparisons. It's a dirty job, but somebody had to do it!<br/><br/>4/4"

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I was profoundly disappointed in this because I expected a creative combination of two warring factions in filmmaking: the framers and the swoopers.<br/><br/>Comics are rooted in the icons of preliteracy evolving into stained glass: brilliant colors and grand underlying mythology. Marvel comics (Stan Lee) adjusted the idiom slightly to make the mythology more accessible, and at the same time make each panel more active. He also popularized the overlapping of static panels on the page, so that not only was each panel composed, but each assembly of panels.<br/><br/>Pulling on those two poles, the mythology and the framing, must be done simultaneously. By focusing more and more on the framing of the art, it allowed the referenced mythical power to increase. In other words, by making the images more static, the story became more dynamic and thus stronger. What made Spidey so novel was that his superhero action is primarily one of swooping and perching on oddly perspectived surfaces.<br/><br/>So this particular comic, Spiderman, provides a much richer basis for effective film art than any other because it has a unique blend of framing and swooping. To appreciate the opportunity, you need to know one of the most lasting and interesting controversies in the film world.<br/><br/>`Moving' pictures were seen as a sibling to `still' pictures which themselves inherited much from easel art. Similar equipment and conventions applied. All early movies placed the camera at eye level on a stationary tripod. The movement was one that a normal human observer would see. A second-order movement was introduced and mastered by Eisenstein, the movement of the camera from one shot to another. The individual shots were still from a stationary camera, but there was a choreography of the eye introduced. The setup of each shot was still essentially composed like a photo, rather like a comic panel in fact. The master of that today in film is Greenaway, but successful hacks like Speilberg mine what's been done. In fact folks like Speilberg compose their films first as comics (storyboards) and then replicate the frames.<br/><br/>But there emerged a new school, led by Hitchcock that had the camera moving while the action moved. By controlling those moves, Hitch's camera had personality, curiosity. Tarkovsky and later dePalma mastered this and innovated so that some rare films have the eye as a main character. Today, essentially every filmmaker has a swooping camera because he/she can and because composing the Eisenstein/Kurosawa way requires insight beyond the skills of the current crop. So we now have a community of swoopers, mostly inept, constantly copying.<br/><br/>So you can see how I got my hopes up. The Spiderman material was rooted in clever framing like Eisenstein/Kurosawa -- it is no accident that Peter Parker is the photographer of Spiderman.<br/><br/>But it also depends on referencing and exploiting the swooping eye as with Tarkovsky/dePalma. It also makes heavy use of the odd-angled architecture of Welles, which clearly spilled more from his films into comics than into successor films.<br/><br/>But what we get is a depressingly unoriginal treatment, wholly unaware of either the grand possibilities or even the educated eye. This is not just a pedantic concern -- you cannot have an exciting movie without an exciting eye. And this film's eye is hidden behind an inanimate mask. This is the Goblin's movie, not Spidey's"
"sterlinrivera-2000","8","3","4","8 September 2019"," A Pretty Good Flick
","Spider-Man is, simply put, a basic and pretty good superhero film that holds up to this very day.<br/><br/>The plot is where a teenager, Peter Parker (played by Tobey Maguire) gets bitten by a radioactive spider during a field trip and feels incredibly nauseous. He wakes up the next day and notices he feels stronger and better than ever, and had the ability to climb walls, shoot webs and fight full power. After his uncle, Ben Parker (played by Cliff Robertson) gets gunned down, he finds his killer and sees this as a perfect opportunity to become a hero of New York. He then forms a costume, and is now known as Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a scientist, Norman Osborn (played by Willem Dafoe), does an experiment where he tests out an enhancing chemical on himself, and it gives him the power to go insane and create havoc. Soon, his company, Oscorp, gets sold out by his board members. Norman than suits up as the Green Goblin, and creates terror in New York. Peter Park / Spider- Man must save the city from the Green Goblin, and protect the love of his life, Mary Jane (played by Kirsten Dunst) from being killed.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is a pretty good, well made, and straightforward movie. The origin story of Spider-Man becoming who he is was well made and had a great pace for 2 hours. The cast all did a great job. Tobey Maguire, in my opinion, has always been my favorite Spider-Man. He knows how to act normal and tough, and had great chemistry with Kirsten Dunst.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe was also a very good and intimidating choice for the Green Goblin. He had funny and cool one-liners, and knew how to be very villanous. I even didn't mind the Goblin costume he wore, it looked pretty cool.<br/><br/>The other actors, like James Franco (as Harry Osborn), Rosemary Harris (as Aunt May), Cliff Roberson, and of course, J.K Simmons (as J. Jonah Jameson) did a phenomenal job.<br/><br/>The action in the fight scenes are also really entertaining as well and Sam Rami did a pretty good job at directing this film out.<br/><br/>Bottom line, Spider-Man was a pretty good first entry in the Spidey film series."
"eti55","10","3","4","13 January 2013"," Greatest Super Hero Movie Ever
","Spiderman took me back to when I was 11, when I read the Spidey comics. More than any other comic-based movie, this is the comic book come to life, and it's better than any super hero movie I've seen before or since.<br/><br/>I know, I know, a lot of Dark Knight enthusiasts will poo-poo this assessment. Fine (I'd rank The Dark Knight at #2). The thing is, I like movies that balance the serious stuff with a sense of humor (the Spidey comics did this), which is where the Dark Knight franchise falls short. For example, the man-on-the-street stuff leading up to Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson's initial rant had me absolutely rolling. The ill-tempered and insufferable Jameson was done to a T by J K Simmons (""We can get a picture of Julia Roberts in a thong, we can certainly get a picture of THIS weirdo!""). He actually did the comic book character one better; his performance definitely was the straw that stirred the drink mid-film. This is a good thing, as Spidey isn't quite the wise-ass in the movie that he is in the comic (my only complaint, and it's minor).<br/><br/>That said, Tobey McGuire does a fine job of balancing Peter Parker, the nerdy science whiz kid, with his genetically-mutated Spiderman alter-ego, creating a bona-fide hero that the audience can root for. It seems every super hero has something that drives them to be a crusader for justice, and in Parker's case it was the guilt over failing to use his new spider powers to stop a thief who would go on to murder his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson in one of his many reliably good performances), who was also his only real father figure. As Parker's love interest Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst is sweet and likable, with just the right amount of sex appeal tossed in. James Franco is good as Parker's spoiled best buddy Harry Osbourne. This leads us to..wait for it..Willem Dafoe, whose portrayal of Harry's father Norman, the arrogant scientist and CEO of Oscorp who puts his own personal ambition ahead of safety for himself and his test subjects, leading to his transformation (via ingesting/inhaling an experimental ""performance enhancing"" drug) into the thoroughly evil, wildly insane and megalomaniacal Green Goblin, is frighteningly convincing, so much so that you can easily look past the cheesy exo- skeleton outfit he wears. Again, I felt like I was seeing the comic book come to life.<br/><br/>As for the effects/action sequences, I know, they've been panned by some (notably Roger Ebert), but they looked good to me. I actually liked the fact that they weren't overdone. Ebert in particular criticized the CGI in this movie, but to me, ALL CGI looks phony and cartoonish. I thought the effects looked just fine as CGI goes, and the action sequences were first rate. One scene in particular where Spiderman is hanging by his web while holding onto a train car full of kids, and at the same time trying to save Mary Jane, is exceptionally gripping. It all leads up to a nice payoff at the end, with the final confrontation between Spidey and the Goblin.<br/><br/>The fact that this movie came out within a week of the disappointing Attack of the Clones served as a reminder to this former fan of the Star Wars franchise exactly why I like these kinds of movies. It's not about the special effects; it's the people and the story (pity George Lucas forgot about that. Unfortunately so had Sam Raimi by the time he made Spidey 3). What makes Spiderman such a great movie comes down to a good story (lifted from the comic but adjusted to fit the times), along with fun, likable characters you can root for, compelling villains to root against, and good peripheral characters to stir things up (aside from Simmons, Bruce Campbell makes the most of his screen time as a wrestling ring announcer (Ann: what's your name kid? Parker: The Human Spider. Ann: The Human Spider, that's it? That's the best you've got? Parker: Yeah. Ann: Aaaahh, that sucks!) <br/><br/>See this again, and don't bother with the reboot."

","The first Spider-Man film is a great one. Marvel arrived on the scene in 2000 with the solid if unspectacular ""X-Men,"" but it was kicked into higher gear in 2002 with the release of ""Spider-Man.""<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is phenomenal as Peter Parker, bringing just the right amount of nerdiness, vulnerability, and most importantly, heart. As Spider-Man, he really seemed to be having fun. He is comparable to Keaton's Batman and Reeve's Superman.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is very good. Kirsten Dunst is good as Mary Jane, and James Franco is also good as Harry. Other standouts are J.K. Simmons as Jonah Jamison and Willem Dafoe as Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin.<br/><br/>Spider-Man's origin story is told quite well, and it moved along at a good pace. The film is very action-packed, and it is filled with the sense of fun that ""X-Men"" kind of lacked. Just the right amount of emotion is added to the film, and it also has a great soundtrack.<br/><br/>There are a few cheesy scenes, but it is still overall a very entertaining and well-made superhero film.

"MinorityReporter","7","12","26","12 August 2005"," Stylish, yet somewhat disappointing!
","Being an avid fan of the comic book I really looked forward to this movie and for a long time I convinced myself that I liked the film. However, after a long time of self denial I bought the Spider-Man DVD and I saw the film for what it truly was. A disappointment. The magic from the comic books had evaporated.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is a mixed bag. Tobey Maguire is well cast but his overall acting and presence isn't very good. He does the nerd part very well but when it comes to being a super hero he falls short. Spider-Man was always a complex character with great internal struggles but the film medium doesn't convey this very well because we don't get the inner monologue that Spider-Man is so well known for. He therefore has to act with facial expressions and body language. Tobey has a pretty well defined body language but his facial expressions are somewhat lacking. Also the fact that he is wearing the Spider-Man suit in many scenes prevent us from clearly reading what is going on in his head at the moment. Kirsten Dunst is just miscast. She is a horrible actress with zero talent and no resemblance with the character she plays making her performance utterly unbelievable. Willem Dafoe is usually a brilliant actor but in Spider-Man he seems to have dumbed down quite a bit and although his schizophrenic scenes are pretty interesting they do not cover for the fact that this is Dafoe's most mediocre performance in years. James Franco who plays Harry Osborn is remarkably boring in his performance. His voice never seems to change making him a young Keanu Reeves. The most interesting and well cast actor is J.K. Simmons who plays J. Jonah Jameson and if there was ever a guy who looked like the character he is meant to play it is Simmons. This is in both looks, voice and presence.<br/><br/>The overall effects in the movie are undoubtedly very good and this makes the action sequences seem more believable. Spider-Man was nominated for an Oscar in the effects department but deservedly the Oscar went to The Fellowship of the Ring because while the effects are good they are far from brilliant. I will even go as far as to say that the only really good effects scene is the one at the very end where Spider-Man swings through the city. This scene, however, almost saves the film because it is brilliant and it is the only scene I can watch again and again.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman's score is very good and it really suiting for a super hero movie. It really shows that Elfman has done a super hero movie score before. I am of course referring to Batman which is undoubtedly one of the best scores ever and you can certainly feel that Elfman used some of the experiences from that film in Spider-Man. The score has an epic feel to it that suits the film very well. The music is beyond reproach.<br/><br/>Where the film fails is in the fact that it is too proper and it feels too much like it was adapted for kids which is in my opinion a mistake because the film had tremendous potential but it seems wasted because it never really becomes an adult film. Also the ending on the bridge is based on a well known story in the Spider-Man mythology where Spider-Man's first love Gwen Stacy dies in Spider-Man's battle with Green Goblin. I think they should have brought on Gwen Stacy for the first film and then introduced Mary Jan in the second movie. because it would have given Spider-Man a greater sense of loss and a better reason to hate Green Goblin if his first love had died at his hands but instead Raimi plays it safe and has Spider-Man save both the children in the lift and Mary Jane. It just seems too stupid.<br/><br/>All in all Spider-Man was not the movie I was hoping for. I expected the best film ever and it certainly didn't deliver. Having said that and having seen the film a couple of times on DVD now I have grown to appreciate it a bit more. My primary issue with the film is that seems that the film wasn't directed for the fans of the character who expected a better adaptation but instead the film becomes a main stream Blockbuster with a wide range which isn't necessarily a bad thing but being a hardcore Spider-Man fan I would have liked to see a more adult film. Spider-Man is a good effort though and the effects alone deserve to be watched.<br/><br/>7/10"
"philip_vanderveken","7","5","9","21 February 2005"," I liked what I saw, even though I'm not a fan of comic books
","Comic books like Spider-man, Superman, Hellboy,... have always been a part of the American popular culture, but aren't well known by the biggest part of the European public. So when a movie, based on one of these comics (we've seen several passing by in the multiplexes in recent years) is released, its main audience will be American as well. Unless they make something spectacular out of it of course, and that's exactly what the makers did with this movie. Spider-man is a movie full of spectacular computer animated graphics, plenty of action and symbolism and, much to my surprise, with a decent story (even though that's not the main reason why you should watch this movie).<br/><br/>Peter Parker is a nerdy high school student who gets bitten by a genetically modified spider. Its DNA gets mixed with Parker's DNA and gradually he finds out that he now has capabilities he could only dream of before. He's strong, he can scale walls and ceilings without any help or appliances and he has some kind of sense that allows him to avoid dangerous situations. At first he only uses his powers to make money as an amateur wrestler, but when his uncle gets killed by a criminal, he decides to use his powers only to fight crime and to help society and to win the affections of his classmate Mary Jane Watson. In the meantime Norman Osborn, a scientist and businessman is exposed to some kind of nerve gas that he was developing for the military and develops an alternative personality: the evil Green Goblin.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that the Green Goblin looked more like a bad guy from the ""Power Ranger"" and wasn't very original or impressive to me, the entire movie wasn't as bad as I feared. I actually had a good time watching this movie that, let's be honest, wouldn't get much attention if the stunning computer graphics weren't in it. So, despite the fact that I'm not a fan of comic books and the fact that the Green Goblin wasn't the most successful character, I liked what I saw. That's why I give it a 7.5/10."

","Nerdy teenager Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is bit by a radioactive spider and develops new powers and abilities. After the murder of his uncle, Peter decides to use his powers to help people and fight crime. Meanwhile, billionaire Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) undergoes an experiment that gives him superhuman abilities of his own. It also drives him crazy and sets him on a collision course with Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Maguire, James Franco, and J.K. Simmons are all great. Kirsten Dunst wasn't my ideal Mary Jane but she actually does very good. She's likable and pretty, which is about all the part is asking for here. The Green Goblin is probably the movie's biggest failing. They didn't really get his character right and Willem Dafoe's performance is too campy. Changing him into an armored goon didn't help matters.<br/><br/>The bright, mostly upbeat tone is exactly what a Spider-Man movie needs. However, it does highlight some of the fakeness of the CGI. The special effects are generally good although at times when Spider-Man is complete CGI he has that rubber-limbed thing going on. The organic web shooters bothered me more before I saw the movie than it did while watching. Although I could've done without the gross microscopic closeups of his fingertips to show us how ""spidery"" he is. Danny Elfman's score is forgettable and not in the same league as his work with Batman.<br/><br/>Not quite the defining movie for Spider-Man as '78 Superman or '89 Batman were for those characters, but good nonetheless. The part of the movie where Peter decides to become a superhero and start fighting crime seems a little rushed and not as momentous as it should have been. It's a good start, though, and the sequel would be all that and more."

","As a fan of Spiderman I was deeply let down by this stupid, gaudy, 'Hollywood' movie version. There are so many things wrong with it I could go on for ages.<br/><br/>First of all, it's HORRIBLY miscast. Tobey Maguire is NO Peter Parker, he is so completely wrong for the part. Jake Gyllenhaal could have been much better. Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane Watson seemed like a typical studio-exec choice. Instead of finding someone who could actually be a model/actress with a statuesque figure, real auburn hair with green eyes who could bring some integrity to the part we have ' the hottie from Bring It On who all the teenage guys like'. I personally do not find her attractive and her part in the movie is no more than 'the damsel in distress when necessary to the plot' kind. She's such a stronger character in the comic book and it's been totally ignored here. James Franco as Harry Osborne was useless. I've seen more charismatic performances from furniture. Willem Dafoe was okay as the Green Goblin but some of his dialogue was real bad, it felt like rejected Skeletor jibes from the original He-Man show. He did provoke some sympathy and coped well with the inner-turmoil story but I could not help but think that someone else could have done it better. JK Simmons and Bruce Campbell were the only bright spots among the whole cast.<br/><br/>27-year-old Tobey Maguire plays high school student Peter Parker. A 'boy' who is blessed with web-spinning capabilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider on a field trip. You guessed it, this is another 'origins of' story. I HATE it when comic-book superhero movies feel the need to do this. Honestly, who DOESN'T know who Spiderman is or how he got his powers? The fact that Spiderman is so popular (as a franchise) is the only reason this tawdry-looking movie was a hit. I would have had so much more respect for it if it went straight to the action and didn't waste time setting things up. No superhero movie is willing to do this and it only proves even further that Spiderman was cooked up and packaged in board room meetings.<br/><br/>
As a way of disguising the fact that the whole thing is no more than processed cheese, eccentric director Sam Raimi was hired to direct. Known for his cheap but whacky movies Raimi had never really done anything big budget before this. The result is a meretricious, mess of a movie that is all over the place. I honestly thought I had walked into some Power Rangers movie.<br/><br/>The computer effects are, quite simply, hideous. Who are they honestly trying to fool with this stuff? It boggles the mind how they ended up with an Academy Award nomination. They are really, really bad. The Styrofoam shark in Jaws: The Revenge was more convincing.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman cranks out YET ANOTHER superhero movie score for this 'un. It's flat, boring and unimpressive. Aunt May is way too old. The Green Goblin looks like a Power Ranger. The direction is uncontrolled. It's got a poor cast. The story is nothing new or daring (check out the comic books for that). It's assembled by a boardroom committee, not crafted by people who care and it's just loud, dumb entertainment when Spiderman really should be much more.<br/><br/>The only part I appreciated was the way they made Spiderman's web biological instead of manufactured. It just makes so much more sense this way. Though there are loads out there who disagree with me.<br/><br/>The DVD is in 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen (I seriously think this film would have benefited from and deserved scope-widescreen but no luck) and it looks better than average. There are some color problems and it doesn't look too crisp. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is typically loud and thumping but it's nothing particularly dynamic. There are quite a few extras if you're really that much of a fan. As I couldn't care any less for this film I can't comment."

","Overall consensus on Sam Raimi's Spider-Man franchise?<br/><br/>by you I only saw the third once, when it came out, so I don't remember it enough to actually judge it. But, rewatching the first two today I was reminded of how great they are. Raimi perfectly blends in cheese, camp, humor, drama, and action in one fantastic package. The comic book style is still in tact, and I noticed that unlike Nolan's Batman franchise, the heart is apparent here. These films give off a good-natured, mainstream vibe. The characters are all excellently written, and so it makes it so easy to relate to them. Raimi does so much with the source material in the way it's all edited together. The first two are honestly great and perhaps as great as something like this could ever be, so why why WHY reboot (remake) this after 10 years? There's simply no reason. It's not like the trailers for the new one suggested it to be darker, because these aren't dark and yet their dramatic moments hit hard. <br/><br/>I hate to say it, but I do think that Raimi did more to this franchise than Nolan ever did to the Batman one. People like to criticize Nolan's writing, but I think the reason why his films' flaws are more apparent on rewatches is because of his direction style. Technically amazing, both Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, but as much as he tries he can't make the smaller moments count. Maybe it is his screenplays, or I simply don't know. My point is, after The Dark Knight people forgot all about these films (and because the 3rd left a bad taste). People like giving TDK credit for being dark and complex, and while it's true that it's tone is different than others of the sort, I think Raimi's films have a lot more to them. I simply just don't know why a reboot happened."

","Okay, first let me say, that I have not got a problem with the changes made to the film, in fact they kinda made the film cooler.  But here's where I lost interest.  Tobey McGuire is not very good as Peter, in fact, he seems bored, which is never very good for a leading man to be.  And he has impressed me, especially in films such as the Cider House Rules, so I don't hate him. Kirsten Dunst is pretty good as Mary Jane, Uncle Ben should have been allowed appear for longer, as he is integral to Spider-man's origin, ***possible spoiler*** his death is like a key scene in a play, but it is brushed over very quickly, which seems lazy.***  The relationship between Norman and Harry, is very interesting, much more so than the main story, and is the one really developed portion of the film.  But back to Tobey. Well, in my opinion, Tobey is not able to convey the sense of responsibility which, look at the spoiler, taught him.  That speech he makes to MJ at the hospital, about what he told Spider-man, was cringe inducing, really over the top sappy.  He is also not physical at all.  Like Keaton in Batman, Tobey is rarely in the suit, and so all of Spidey's stunts are by stuntmen. These include even the basic, like where Spidey webs down before kissing MJ and the simplest fights (all classic poses are assumed by stuntmen) and so Dafoe was right about him being a wimp.  I know this might seem like nit-picking, but actors who do all or most of their stunts seem to absorb the idea of the character more, and get into the role better.  Some don't like Dafoe, or the Goblin outfit, but I think the suit works in the film and is really cool, and also Dafoe outclasses McGuire.  The only good thing for me was the the costume, which was great.  Some scenes of CGI were poor, but the last 2 minutes of it was the best part of the movie for me.  Many will say that it's only a summer blockbuster, but if they have read a comic of Spider-man, and I don't mean the issues included with the DVD (which were not the best, to be honest), then they'll be able to see where the filmmakers failed.<br/><br/>Overall, 6/10, the movie really caves halfway thru."

Stop right there. This is not that kind of review. <br/><br/>Instead, I will give you several reasons why you should watch Homer Simpson and his ""Spider-Pig"" rather than this or any other ""Spiderman"" sequel.<br/><br/>1. Spider-pig is funny. Tobey is merely sleepy and boring. <br/><br/>2. Spider-pig walks on the ceiling with grace. Tobey doesn't. He looks like an apathetic, clumsy 30 year-old moron impersonating a teenager. <br/><br/>3. Spider-pig has a great sidekick: Homer. Spiderman has none. <br/><br/>4. Homer's relationship with Spider-pig is far warmer and real than Spiderman's could ever be with Kirsten Dunst. <br/><br/>5. Spider-pig has Danny Elfman's likable tune to follow his zany adventures. Tobey/Spiderboy has only crap commercial U.S. truck-driver rock to accompany his every sleepy move.

Spiderboy just shoots unconvincing CGI strings. <br/><br/>7. Spider-pig is much more handsome than Tobey Maguire. <br/><br/>8. Spider-pig is alert and quick. Tobey is drowsy and dull. <br/><br/>9. The pig that plays Spider-pig is a much better actor than Tobey Maguire.<br/><br/>The only aspect in which Raimi's Spiderman franchise beats Spider-pig is that Tobey's girlfriend Dunst is much better-looking than Spider-pig's sow mistress.<br/><br/>The success of the ""Spiderman"" movies proves two things, first and foremost: 1) today's film-goers will watch any crap and love it, as long as it's hyped properly and sufficiently, and 2) Sam Raimi will never make another movie that comes even within light-year distance of his first two ""Evil Dead"" movies.<br/><br/>If you loved ""Spiderman"", you must be either 9 years old or a..."

","Very good superhero film that competes very well with the first two ""Superman"" films and the first ""Batman"" from 1989. High school senior Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) gets bit one day at a museum by a genetically-enhanced spider and his super powers are born. Meanwhile the very wealthy Willem Dafoe has performed a risky experiment on himself at his research lab and turns himself into a crazed maniac, with super-human strength, who only cares about world domination. Of course there is also Spider-Man's love interest (Kirsten Dunst), his elderly uncle and aunt (Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris) and his best friend who is also Dafoe's only son (James Franco in another outstanding performance for the youngster who has unlimited potential). Franco appears to become much more important in upcoming ""Spider-Man"" films. Let's start predicting how many films the franchise will produce. 4 stars out of 5."

","By default, Comic Books are the perfect Pre-Viz for movies made based on them. And as a long-time Spidey fan, I was able to see the panels of this comic book come to striking life, sometimes reproduced with magnificent exactness in comparison to the way the books have been drawn and colored.<br/><br/>As far as this initial offering goes, the choices of Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Willem Dafoe and James Franco allowed for an almost precise match to how the characters they each portray looked in the books. The casting of Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris as Uncle Ben and Aunt Mae, and J.K. Simmons as J Jonah Jameson: But it was not just the casting of actors who very closely resemble the characters of the Spider-man Universe, it was clearly Sam Raimi's direction in concert with the script by David Koepp based very closely on Stan Lee's ""Spidey"" Origin Story, which made these people come alive and pop out of the comic book frames, almost into real life.<br/><br/>Compared to some of the other Marvel universe movies, this one was done with the most amount of care and respect for the series. Just to reproduce the postures of the flying web-slinger, using some of the most famous frames from the comics, was an astounding accomplishment.<br/><br/>From his humble beginnings in ""Evil Dead"" Sam Raimi has been a clever filmmaker, especially in his ability to make splendid visual effects. Combine that with a huge budget along with Visual Effects god John Dykstra, who designed effects for Star Trek: The Motion Pic and the original Star Wars, back when it was still called that. Connect the dots with a fantastic Production Designer and Costume Designer, and it all just worked.<br/><br/>One of the tests of how well Digital Effects have been done are in the viewing of these films on lower-resolution mediums, like smart phone screens and Old Cathode-Ray Tube TV's. I've viewed this film in each of those, and when Spidey is crawling up a wall in an obvious CGI shot, it makes you wonder if it really was CGI: In films like Daredevil, it is easy to spot the transition frames; here, it is impossible to find it.<br/><br/>Comparatively, the work on Captain America showing Steve Rogers as a skinny kid is very clever. Here, the same tech is used in a smaller degree to show Parker as a wimpy, skinny nerd. This is highly effective so that when Parker sees himself buffed out with his shirt off, you believe a change has occurred.<br/><br/>Where this film excels is in the rapidity of which it gets into the Spider-Man story, which is within the first ten minutes. As much as I do like the new Marc Webb ""Amazing Spider Man"" (2012) - It takes much too long to get into it, although the character development in that film is very good.<br/><br/>In this film however, the character development continues through the film and is incorporated even into action sequences, Continuing up to the very last frame of the film.<br/><br/>Ted Raimi, Bruce Campbell and Dan Hicks (Of Dan Hicks and his Hot Licks) are all inserted as cameo properly as with any Raimi film. It is Campbell himself who ""names"" Spider-man - Saying ""The Human Spider? That Sucks!""<br/><br/>My few complaints revolve around the character of Peter Parker, who is fairly unlucky in the books, here he is a walking disaster area. He is the antithesis of ""The Competent Man"" and even when given extraordinary ability, he is still a wimp in his personality, especially in his dealing with Mary Jane Watson. Also, Peter Parker's first Love interest was Gwen Stacy, and it was she, not MJ who The Green Goblin captured and gave Spidey the choice: Save these kids in the Cable-Car, or Save Gwen. It was a choice, and one or the other only could have been saved. Here, Gwen is absent totally, and he saves MJ with a feat even impossible for the comic- book rendition of Spidey.<br/><br/>But I suppose adding Gwen to the mix would have muddied up the water too much. And even though I did not like the distortion of that original classic story, they did reproduce it visually with astounding correctness, as they did with the images of Spider-Man flying through NYC. Animating several classic Steve Ditko Spidey Postures, and at the end of the film we get to see many of these animated fantastically.<br/><br/>But the main message: 'With Great power, comes Great Responsibility"" - As told by Uncle Ben to Peter right before his death, survives, and when coupled to Danny Elfman's main Theme, makes this a powerful, meaningful film."

","Spiderman is a superhero film that is based on the fictional Marvel Comics character Spiderman. The film stars Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, a high-school student who turns to crime fighting after developing spider-like powers. Spider-Man also stars Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn, Kirsten Dunst as Peter's love interest Mary-Jane Watson, and James Franco as his best friend Harry Osborn.After incorporating elements of comic book style and design into many of his films, director Sam Raimi helms this straight-ahead, big-budget comic book adaptation, which also marks acclaimed young actor Tobey Maguire's first dip into live-action blockbuster film-making. Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris co-star to play key supporting roles.<br/><br/>Spiderman follows the template of the original Stan Lee/Steve Ditko source material, with hero Peter Parker an orphaned, intellectual teen loner living in Queens with his aunt and uncle, and dreaming of the girl next door, Mary Jane. On a field trip to a Columbia University lab, Peter is bitten by a genetically altered spider and overnight he gains superhuman strength, agility, and perception. At first, Peter uses his powers for material gain, winning a wrestling match with a purportedly lucrative prize. But when Peter apathetically fails to stop a burglar from robbing the wrestling arena, a tragedy follows that compels him to devote his powers to fighting crime as the superhero Spiderman. When he's not busy fighting crime in a spider suit, Peter moves into an apartment with his best friend, Harry, and begins work as a photographer at the Daily Bugle. Meanwhile, his do-gooder alter ego finds a nemesis in the form of the Green Goblin, a super-powered, megalomaniacal villain who happens to be the alter ego of Harry's father, weapons-manufacturing mogul Norman Osborn. <br/><br/>Spiderman provide a good dose of web-swinging fun.Also,it also has a heart.Credit that to the combined charms of director Sam Raimi and star Tobey Maguire. Added to that,it captures the high-energy, pulpy effervescence of Marvel when it was young and feisty. Whatever imperfections the film picks up along the way, they practically demand to be hand-waved aside as it effectively takes time between exhilarating digital effects to develop character and motivation. Colorful, energetic and well-cast,it is a good-quality, highly-entertaining action movie."
"Netscape_Navigator","10","2","3","3 January 2009"," what a refreshing step back to a time of innocence
","What an odd way to describe a Spider-Man movie of all things huh? Well, let me explain.<br/><br/>After I saw Spider-Man 3 in 2007, the disgusting display of incompetent film making and lazy attempts to make money and simply get by on the name alone, left me with nothing but a raging hatred in my core for everyone involved in that abomination of a movie. Watching part 1 again reminded me of how magnificent this franchise used to be. I can't believe these characters that I fell in love with- Peter Parker, Mary Jane, Aunt May, Harry, J. Jonah Jameson, are people that I actually wanted to commit felony acts of violence against in part 3 (particularly Mary Jane and Harry). It was so bad and personal, that I even said that if they continue making more Spider-Man movies in the future, that I would like nothing more than Kirsten Dunst NOT to return (a complete contrast to my views of her in parts 1 and 2, where I loved her). Seeing part 3 even made me second guess myself as to whether the first two actually deserved perfect 10s as I originally scored them. Well, seeing them again reminded me that they ABSOLUTELY deserve 10s, and that's why I'm writing this review. I'll stick to talking about part 1 here.<br/><br/>**Great job adapting the comic to the big screen. They captured the campy humor of the comics perfectly, with lovable corny one-liners done just well enough to be corny, but not excessively that it becomes a joke.<br/><br/>**At it's core, this movie is basically a love story about a nerd awkwardly trying to win over the girl he loves, with things getting a tad bit complicated having to deal with the fact that he's got superhuman powers. This is a romance story story running parallel to a superhero movie, and it's interwoven with expert craftsmanship, it completely engrosses you.<br/><br/>**I've gotta give it to Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, they did some great acting here. All of their scenes feel so genuine. Who can't relate to those little moments that they had together? Like every time they happen to meet up by chance, they would say ""Oh hey!!!"" with a genuine look of surprise as their faces light up with happiness, followed by awkward, nervous conversation masked by their smiles, with Peter consciously making sure to minimize dead air in the conversation. Again, the most authentic thing in all of this is the ""oh hey!!!"" part. Not sure about everyone else, but in my experience, this is THE default greeting between a male and a female that are moderately close, upon unexpectedly meeting each other (less close could result in a simple, less upbeat, ""hey what's up,"" and more close could be running up and giving them a hug).<br/><br/>**There's a certain *simplistic nature to this movie that you become fond of. There's a very dense, linear approach that pretty much forces you to love the characters, and want to see the nerd win the girl, and save the day.<br/><br/>**If I had to do one thing differently, I would change the Green Goblin's costume. It was too over the top and cartoonish, they should've modernized the look, make it look like something that would be issued by the military for combat. They wouldn't wear a mask that looked like that..<br/><br/>Parts 1 and 2 compared to part 3 are like day and knight. Regardless of The Dark cloud which is part 3 hanging over this franchise, these first two installments are the best superhero movies made in terms of pure enjoyment."

","I remember Spider-man from my youth. I never got into the comics, so I apologize to the true web driven literati. I know the story. And I've watches and read about a lot of superheroes. My son came back from seeing the film, angry and hurt because they took liberties with one of his real loves. I went to it to watch a movie, not to pay homage. I think it's a heck of a good film. To start with, the vertiginous special effects are wonderful. His leaps from building to building are breathtaking. The best part is that Tobey Maguire has a vulnerability that the alter ego needs to have . Like so many, he is reluctant, but forces beyond his control dump him into the middle of things over which he has not control. <br/><br/>I'm told the villain is not kosher. The they should have chosen one of his more formidable adversaries. I thought the guy was pretty spooky and set up more of the same. Peter Parker has some unburned bridges heading into the sequel, and that's always fun. There's just a niceness that connects the characters and a bitter world to fight against, including the newsman who has no respect for Peter's talents. I think this movie is thoughtful as well as really exciting."

I know that comic books adaptations are not meant to be, say, A Clockwork Orange, but do yourself a favor and go watch Batman (1989) - it's a great pleasure. Thanks to great director and of course Mr. Nicholson. And it still stands well: its dark mood, photography, and dark poetry have transcended well into 2002. In comparison this one is simply pathetic. Only special effects, and wery weak, naive screenplay. Why do you Americans take us all as fvols?!<br/><br/>Spider-Man is a deadly boring movie: I watched this at a cinema and everybody was loudly laughing anytime when ""...with great power comes great responsibility blah blah blah..."" came from the screen. Many people left before the film has ended, saying ""LAME!"", or ""Crap"". There is nothing new, we have seen many films of superheroes and this one is simply re-make of all cliches you can imagine.<br/><br/>I can't understand why this one earned so many money: I think it was because there were no good releases at the same time.

"cinephile-27690","10","1","1","6 April 2020"," The Movie That Got Me Into Superhero Movies.
","I like some superhero movies, but it's hard for me to love them. I have a few favorites(Spider Man 2 is my favorite thanks to Roger Ebert), but I have a tendency to not be thrilled by them.<br/><br/>I like Tim Burton's Batman movies and Spider Man: Homecoming for instance, but I feel that overall are rather empty. By that, I mean they are good but I don't leave ""satisfied"", if that makes sense.<br/><br/>Either the story is undermined and the action is overdone or I don't feel that the action is done right. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, for example, has many flaws and too much action in the last half hour.<br/><br/>Because of this, I have only seen a handful of superhero movies. This was actually the first PG-13 movie I ever saw(At about 7 or 8), but I left it for many years and re-visited it when I was 19, nearly 2 years ago.<br/><br/>As I got older, I could actually appreciate what Sam Raimi did with Spider Man's origin story. It takes about half the movie for Spider Man to show up, and until then we get to know Peter Parker as a human: a bullied nerd, close to his aunt and uncle, in love with his next door neighbor, etc. Even with spider powers, he is still a kid.<br/><br/>That's one thing I enjoy about this movie, and especially the 2nd one. Sam Raimi takes a cartoony character and fleshes him out to make him relate-able.<br/><br/>The action is exciting as well, since it comes in when it is necessary and it's not over-blown.<br/><br/>There's nothing about the acting I can't complain about as well. Tobey Maguire is a great Spider-Man. He's fine in Sea biscuit and The Great Gatsby, but he's great in this. Willem Defoe is fantastic as The Green Goblin, a Mr. Hyde type character that becomes Spider Man's nemesis. That's his best role since Jesus in The Last Temptation of Christ.<br/><br/>Of course there are also the actresses Rosemary Harris and Kristen Dunst, and a young James Franco as well.<br/><br/>What Spider Man therefore delivers is a fun plot, good action scenes and great acting performances, all balanced very well. The sequel is better, but this is still an excellent origin story that was very much worth telling.<br/><br/>Note: This review was originally written on 4/16/19, and has been re-edited and re-posted. I intend to review Spider Man 2 and 3 next."
"Animany94","7","1","1","3 April 2020"," Good start if not entirely perfect.
","Sam Raimi did give me a good time with my favorite web-slinger, so pointing out flaws in this first Spider-Man movie are mostly cosmetic or nit-picky.<br/><br/>The set-up for Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man was more or less a by-the-book of his iconic comicbook origin by being bitten by a genetically altered spider and after that taking it to the wrestling ring to earn cash and facing the tragedy losing a loved one.<br/><br/>That was well done and showcased how Peter Parker becomes a somebody instead of a nobody even if the romance with Mary Jane never really felt genuine to me. And that's probably my biggest gripe with the movie, because outside the standout performances from J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and Willem Defoe's dual role as Norman Osborn and Green Goblin, the acting was only servicable.<br/><br/>James Franco seemed bored most of the time as Harry Osborn and Tobey Maguire was pretty bland as Peter Parker, but actually convincing as Spider-Man.<br/><br/>And that Goblin costume! Oh boy, how not scary can you be! It would have been so much better if Defoe had some make-up or effects turning his face green, because when you see him switch between Norman and the goblin in the mirror, you see some facial expressions to make your skin crawl. With all the brilliant special effects used in the movie, don't tell me they couldn't have done that.<br/><br/>So yes, I have some problems with Spider-Man, but overall I had a good time with great action scenes and a couple of standout performances."

The visual effects were incredible when he fights and he walks in the air. There are such beautiful sound effects. The costumes are fabulous. the screenplay is very interesting : there are sad moments and there are the collet fightings. For me Spiderman is a big classic of Marvel's films because Spiderman is the super hero of our childhood. For me he is the best super hero because I love his suit and his super powers.

","I saw spiderman after watching 2 and 3. First part is my personal favourite because it very well sets the base for the characters. While 2 was the most loved spidey film, 3 was the most hated spidey film and 1 gets sandwiched between them. Director sam raimi doesn't waste much time and within 5 minutes of the film our lead peter parker gets injected by a radiogenetic spider and rest I don't need to tell. Initially, peter uses the powers for his personal gains. But uncle ben's death and his last words to him 'With great power comes great responsibility' inspires peter to use it for the people. Thus he becomes the friendly neighborhood spiderman and locks horns with green goblin aka norman osborn. Tobey maguire was best as peter parker. His innocence really wins our hearts especially the scene where he calls himself the human spider. As spiderman, he may not be witty but he was physically fit in those acrobatic moves. Kirsten dunst was the perfect eye candy and always played a pivotal role in the ending of all 3 films by getting kidnapped. William dafoe was terrific as green goblin and his voice gives us chills. Action scenes and graphics are very good. Only drawback I felt was in the end is when mj proposes to pete and they kiss but peter says her that I can only be your friend. Well if he wanted her only as a friend then why didn't he stop her from kissing? But ignoring those things I would say spiderman is my favourite spidey film and i love raimi trilogy."

","Apart from the disproportionate action by the annoying zooms, then, Spider-Man is a Film enjoyable, it is, the problem is its script half opplausado, (ie, medium incoherent), in the film is never explained in depth why Peter wants to be a Supehéroe Out of the fact about the murder of his uncle (who killed him tégnicamente by his fault) Likewise, the affection that has to MJ is re forced, the scenes seen in the movie never show the true affection that Peter has to MJ, (not counting the final scene that is Desprop Orcional first of all that was seen in the film) while, the villain is little memorable (something like the Largarto in the amazing but more mediocre) I say. If Norman Osborn wanted to escape the curse of the Green Goblin, minimum he has asked for help, (ask for help almost to his death, which makes the character a unibidimensional) or if you want to explore well his motives of remaining the Green Goblin, and his scene of death It is forced because it is not explored very well with its character, which makes it a moltiviero, (Sad scene with shoer) it was not necessary the fact to kill itself when trying to kill Spidey, the action is somewhat decent but annoying, when a character strikes makes a kind of Zoom, (This is shown in the final battle in the abandoned English).
Although on the other hand, Maguire does well to Spider-Man and knows the basics of the performance, what does not convince me are his facial expressions where they are half subrealists or make strange sounds (like one that makes in the final battle where the Green Goblin gives a blow and Spidey the M Walk away).
MJ I feel that it was wasted, I say, not explore much of the character beyond that has problems with his family and that is the love interest of our protagonist.
Norman is half unibidimensional, shows a lot, tells Little.
Cobwebs seem to be loosened by the effects that look somewhat false and are badly positioned.
However, and continuing with the character of Peter, then, is well developed seeing, of as it is questioned why it has to be a superhero, pity that this was not explored very well in depth, out of the murder of his uncle, therefore, 0 reasons to be spidey.

"huntermartin-75875","9","1","1","5 December 2018"," Spidey's first thwip onto the big screen is a spectacular wonder
","The time before the era of superheroes. Big Blockbusters were still trying to find a successful formula. Even Star Wars wasn't as successful as it used to be. Sure, movies like Blade and The Punisher came out but those were more aimed at Adults and still gained a bit at the box office but they weren't massive hits. Then in they May of 2002, Average moviegoers would finally see the worlds most amazing, spectacular superhero hit the big screen, spawning a new era of movie's to bust the box office. Directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire as the titular character, Spider-man follows the origin and first real challenge of Peter Parker and his web-slinging alter-ego as he deals with using his powers in normal life, and fighting his first super-villain: the cruel and dastardly villain of ""The Green Goblin!""
Spider-Man is one of my favorite superhero movies, mainly because it shows the right way to do an origin story. The first time we meet Peter is when he's about to get his powers, putting the viewer into the inciting action right away. After this beginning scene we see Peter's home life and eventually we understand his motivation and his decision to be a good hero when part of that home life is taken away. Despite his age at the time Tobey gives an accurate performance of Peter Parker, and a stellar one as The Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.
The best part of this movie though is that it accepts its campiness and silliness as a comic book movie and uses that too it's advantage. This is most definitely best portrayed by Willem Dafoe's performance as Norman Osborne and the Green Goblin, staying a serious, worried, sympathetic businessman and Norman and entirely transforming into a cruel campy disastrous villain as the Goblin. While the characters seem entirely different, Dafoe does a great job linking them together and even makes the Goblin seem like part of who Norman really is.
The two of these characters hit their peak at the end of this movie, where we see Norman grieve and regret everything as the Goblin but he realizes it was his fault for it happening in the first place, and Peter learns that you can't save everyone, no matter how hard you try from (of all people) his nemesis.
I still believe that while Spider-Man may not be the objective best Superhero movie out there, it is the best at showing what a comic should be in a live action scenario and has a solid lesson to learn. While sure it may not be as Great as Spider-Man 2 or as ridiculous as Spider-man 3, it finds a good balance in it's characters, truly personifies the Amazing, Ultimate, Spectacular Spider-Man, and its influence can still be seen in Superhero movies- and really lots of movies- today, 15 years later."

"bernestMak1","10","1","1","20 June 2018"," The origin of the most profitable franchise in history.
","This was the movie that I watched the most as a kid. Still holds up today with a fantastic origin story and Shakespearean drama. I'm sure that this is the best Spider-Man we will ever see because Raimi is the perfect director for this source material. <br/><br/>With his low budget background, Raimi knew how to make a great looking movie for pennies. Given millions of dollars, Raimi gave us a very modern looking move even for 2018. Sure, the fight during the parade and a couple other shots are sort of bad looking due to 2002 CGI, but you can look past it because they are few and far between. Attack of the Clones came out the same year and it's incredible how much this holds up compared to it. <br/><br/>People complain about the actors not being actual teenagers, but it's something I've never really been bothered with. Tobey is the perfect Spider-Man, portraying every side of Peter Parker to a T. Dunst is alright as a damsel in distress, but nothing to write home about. Dafoe was unhinged as the goblin, and it makes me really wish that they used the makeup that they were originally planning on doing so we could see more of his performance. I like the mask in some scenes though, like when he puts Peter to sleep and talks to him on the rooftop. Showing just his eyes, he is so menacing in that scene to the point where it's sort of disturbing. Simmons plays a perfect Jameson and Franco is forgettable but not terrible.<br/><br/>All in all, this film is a bonafide classic that's in the same vein as the first superman in the 70s and 1989s batman. To me, Spider-Man is to my generation what those movies were to previous generations. All 3 represent something extremely fun and new. This, along with X-Men a couple years before, really brought comic book movies into the limelight again after they were dying down in the late 90s. This is a movie that I will be returning to for the rest of my life and one that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good time."
"samyaksambuddha","9","1","1","23 April 2018"," Beautiful fantasy
","Spider-man is one of the most famous superheroes and this movie does very well to maintain the image of the comic character. And the innocence of Toby Maguire and his beautiful chemistry with Kirsten is wins hearts. This movie has deeper dimensions as it expresses the philosophical dimensions of power- with great power comes great responsibility. This is a great work that shows that each one of us has a superhero within us, we just need to unlock it. The fight sequences with green goblin are interesting. Overall a great watch."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","9","1","1","14 February 2018"," Big-budget blockbuster film-making with flair; a blast from start to finish.
","Sure, at times 'Spider-Man (2002)' is a little cheesy and perhaps even border-line camp, but this is big-budget blockbuster film-making with flair. Sam Raimi's distinct directing style is present and appreciated, even if it is reined in a little. It brings to life a colourful comic-book world in a believable, entertaining way and it's much better than the washed-out, generic stuff we so often see nowadays. The piece can be melodramatic on occasion but it also isn't afraid to get dark, with some sequences actually being pretty brutal (I'll refer you to the final fight between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin, who's defeat is wince-inducing to say the least) and highlighting the dangers of the occupation well, while never losing sight of the heart of the character. The flick is incredibly well-made and, for me, still holds up. It's a true highlight of the genre; a blast from start to finish. 9/10"
"Wuchakk","8","1","1","7 July 2017"," Inspired and exciting example of the modern super-hero film
","Released in 2002 and directed by Sam Raimi, ""Spider-Man"" stars Tobey Maguire as geeky teen Peter Parker, who is bit by a radioactive spider and acquires spider-like powers. Kirsten Dunst plays his wannabe girlfriend, Mary Jane, while James Franco plays his best friend and rival, Harry Osborn. Willem Dafoe is on hand as the schizophrenic Norman Osborn, who's also the Green Goblin. Cliff Robertson & Rosemary Harris play Peter's Uncle & Aunt while J.K. Simmons appears as newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson.<br/><br/>Although it was 2000's ""X-Men"" that ushered in the modern superhero film, it was ""Spider-Man"" that drove it home. The movie remains an exhilarating example of the genre and is markedly superior to the merely competent reboot ""The Amazing Spider-Man,"" which came out just 10 years later. Compare the costumes, for instance, particularly the masks; there's no contest.<br/><br/>There are some flaws: The second half isn't as compelling as the first and the apartment fire sequence is eye-rolling in that there's zero smoke in the abode. Then there are changes from the comics, some which work great (e.g. scrapping Spidey's web-shooters in favor of intrinsic web-powers) and some which are just acceptable (e.g. MJ's noticeably different disposition). But such quibbles are made up for by the movie's overall mojo. Simmons nails it as the quirky & kinetic Jameson.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man"" remains the second best Spider-Man film, second only to ""Spider-Man 3"" (2007), not including ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" (2017), which I haven't seen yet.<br/><br/>The film runs 121 minutes and was shot in New York City & Los Angeles, as well as a few other areas in New York and Southern Cal, e.g. the cemetery scene in Valhalla, NY.

"wiholke2020","8","1","1","5 July 2017"," Spider-Man is loads of fun!
","Spider-Man has gone through a lot over the years and especially in the 2000's. This film is directed by Sam Raimi and was the first movie in a very popular comic book movie trilogy that exploded in the box office. This was easily one of MARVEL's best films at the time and let me tell you. In 2017, a lot of scenes really hold up well. If you have not yet seen this movie, first of all, go watch it, and second, I am going to be talking about this movie in detail so you have been warned.<br/><br/>The movie begins and automatically I love the score. Danny Elfman did a superb job composing my favorite Spider-Man theme so far. The opening credits, while being long, really prepare you for this awesome comic book ride you are about to go on and yes a lot of scenes are very cheesy. Even the opening credits are cheesy. The dialogue begins with Peter Parker, played by Tobey McGuire, narrating. Right off the bat you feel very sorry for Peter as he is without a doubt bullied in many ways in this movie. The only people who seem to care are MJ, played by Kirsten Dust, and Harry Osborne, played by James Franco. <br/><br/>In this film, Peter has a large crush on MJ, which was handled very well. The dialogue they share together in this movie work 100%. It was very relatable. When I first saw this movie I had a massive crush on a girl and I really understood Peter's feelings and emotions which makes Peter Parker in this movie more likable. <br/><br/>The scene where he gets bitten by the spider actually holds up very well. It's very dramatic and the cinematography is very good. He comes home from his field trip after he was bitten and we meet Aunt May and Uncle Ben. In my opinion, this is perfect casting and these two are brilliant. So far they are my favorite Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Peter is feeling very sick and he looks very pale. The spider bite on his hand has swollen up and looks very disgusting but it makes his transformation that much cooler.<br/><br/>We also get introduced to Norman Osborne, played by William Dafoe. He was a good actor throughout the movie, but his voice acting sometimes suffered, not to mention his Green Goblin suit is Power Ranger-like. The costumes in the movie elsewhere are completely fine but this suit just seemed to lack. <br/><br/>When Peter becomes Spider-Man, this movie really starts to get fun. It's very funny, cheesy of course, but very good set pieces when he climbs his first wall. And yes, he has organic web shooters which I am totally fine with. He got the powers of a spider, why can't he shoot webs? It makes sense to me. And the sound mixing for the webs are iconic and very good.<br/><br/>The wrestling scene is very good and very funny, which leads to Uncle Ben's death, which was very emotional and one of the best scenes in this movie, and right away you feel for Peter and you are rooting for Peter. I love the car chase right after, and the fight in the abandoned building is brilliant film making with the lack of music and lighting.<br/><br/>From here on out Spider-Man is awesome, but also cheesy like the comic books. In fact, some of the dialogue with Spider-Man and Green Goblin are lines straight from the books. And I got to say my least favorite scene in this movie is the first action scene with Spidey and the Green Goblin. It is very cheesy, kind of clichÃ©, and the CGI doesn't hold up well in that scene.<br/><br/>However, Green Goblin gets really cool when he learns Peter is Spider-Man. He breaks into Aunt May's home and May is taken to the hospital which is a very well directed scene and one of the better scenes with the Green Goblin. And of course, the abandoned hospital scene is beautifully directed in terms of almost everything! The lack of music, lighting, costumes and stunts it's all very good! Spider- Man's suit gets so worn and ripped it's very good visual art. <br/><br/>This movie ends on a very good note and yes a lot of scenes hold up well. Yes it's cheesy. Yes, CGI is a bit dated and the Green Goblin looks like a Power Ranger we get it. But this movie is loads of fun and a must see."
"ryanskywalker-87402","8","1","1","3 July 2017"," ""We are who we choose to be. Now choose!""
","One of the first movies to pave the groundwork for modern superhero flicks, Spider-Man is an incredibly fun & endlessly entertaining action-adventure that brings its web-slinging hero to life on the silver screen in a truly fascinating manner after spending nearly a quarter of a century in development hell and, with its record- breaking box office performance, acts as a precursor to an era when superheroes would dominate the summer box-office.<br/><br/>Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, the story of Spider-Man follows Peter Parker; a high-school kid who after being bitten by a radioactive spider at a genetic laboratory begins to develop spider-like abilities and puts his new powers to good use by turning to crimefighting. Meanwhile, Norman Osborn experiments a power-enhancing drug on himself as a desperate attempt to preserve a military contract critical for his company's survival.<br/><br/>Directed by Sam Raimi, Spider-Man has all the ingredients of a summer blockbuster plus it benefits a lot from Raimi's dynamic filmmaking style that doesn't dwell on a single moment for far too long, keeps the story fresh, light-hearted & action-packed for the most part, plus never loses its initially-gained momentum. David Koepp's screenplay is no slouch either for it packs in a compelling plot & few interesting characters and the whole story is cheesy but well humoured.<br/><br/>The technical aspects are all brilliantly executed. Camera-work is excellent for the most part for the chosen angles, swift movements, slow-mo shots & warm colour palette are correctly employed. Editing provides a frenetic pace to its narrative, each moment has a role to play, and its 121 minutes of runtime simply flies by. Visual effects team makes use of both CGI & practical stuntwork and it's amazing just how well it has aged when compared to other effects-laden movies released back then.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Spider-Man packs in a very interesting cast in Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Willem Dafoe, J.K. Simmons & others, and many of them are pretty convincing in their given roles. Maguire does a terrific job under Raimi's supervision, Dafoe plays Norman Osborn with finesse but that Green Goblin suit is extremely off-putting, Simmons is a near-perfect rendition of J. Jonah Jameson from the comics while both Dunst & Franco do a fine job as Mary Jane Watson & Harry Osborn, respectively.<br/><br/>Also worthy of admiration is Danny Elfman's outstanding score that captures just the right tone & feel of your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man's universe and brims with tracks that seamlessly integrate into the story. On an overall scale, Spider-Man may not seem as impressive today as it did back when it made its debut on the silver screen but it still remains one of the best offerings of its category and delivers a roller- coasted ride that's enjoyable, entertaining & highly satisfying. Spider-Man is a summer popcorn extravaganza right on the money."
"alexanderdavies-99382","8","1","1","1 July 2017"," The best ""Spiderman"" film by far.
","This was the film that proved an adaptation of a ""Marvel Comic"" superhero could be made. This first ""Spiderman"" film was the first of its kind and set the course for all future superhero movies. There is a story that actually holds the film together and backed by some good dialogue, good directing and pretty good acting. Where better than to begin with the origins of Spiderman? As has been depicted many times, high school student Peter Parker is bitten by a spider that just happens to be radioactive during a guided tour of a New York science museum. Initially overcome by his newly acquired superpowers, Parker attempts to cash in by appearing as a wrestler and on prime time television. After all this is met with failure, disaster strikes as Parkers Uncle Ben is murdered in cold blood by a thief. Cliff Robertson was brilliantly cast as the uncle. The story doesn't just revolve around Spiderman/Peter Parker though. Elsewhere in the film, business tycoon and inventor Norman Osborn (well played by Willam Defoe), suffers from an accident in his own laboratory after an experiment goes wrong. Thus the Green Goblin is unleashed. I was a bit disappointed with the costume for the Green Goblin, it held none of the appeal or chilling factor that the comic books had. Peter Parker struggles with his growing feelings for the girl that he has liked since childhood - Mary Jane Watson. The task of expressing his feelings has been rendered even more difficult on account of his crime- fighting alter ego. Toby Maguire is pretty good in the main role but I wouldn't exactly call him a heavyweight actor. He can't project the rugged look that action men need. Even so, he fits the bill. The scenes that show Spiderman web-slinging his way around New York look great and the CGI serves its purpose without compromising the story. A great film and its box office success is well deserved."
"jjackson1-284-155747","9","1","1","22 June 2017"," Shy but great!
","Considered as one of the most successful superhero movies ever made, ""Spider-Man"" is a superhero film adaptation of one of Stan Lee's most popular Marvel comics, and becoming one of the first movies to score the highest opening weekend in the box office. There's no wonder, because this is an exciting and enjoyable motion picture. One of my childhood favorites, to be exact! This movie tells the origin story of Peter Parker, or Spider-Man, portrayed by Tobey Maguire, whom after being bit by a radioactive spider, he has gained extraordinary powers to climb walls, shoot web, and beat bad guys. But all that must be put to the test when Parker has to defeat one of the first villains of the Spider-Man universe, the Green Goblin, portrayed by Willem Dafoe. Although Maguire is somewhat bland in a few of his movies, I respected that he fit the role of Peter Parker perfectly, playing a shy kid, with no powers to either beat the bad guy or win the girl. Although given some of the corniest lines of dialouge in this movie, Kirsten Dunst makes an adorable portrayal as Mary Jane Watson, while giving a great chemistry with her co-star. But, Willem Dafoe seems a little miscast playing the deadly Green Goblin, feeling more like he's suitable for drama, instead of action. Rosemary Harris, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and J.K. Simmons, round up the supporting cast, bringing some memorable performances on-screen, especially Simmons, who steals every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, the angry editor chief of the Daily Bugle. There are few corny and goofy moments from here and there, but that doesn't stop the exciting momentum that this movie brings. Filled with impressive visual effects and a wonderful music score by Danny Elfman, director Sam Raimi perfectly stays true to the original Spider-Man concept, and delivers plenty of exciting action sequences that are both fun to watch, and stay true to the plot. Behind ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers"", ""Spider-Man"" is probably my third favorite superhero movie. I can watch this movie over and over again, and it's still a fun time. I was easily impressed with this movie, and it never disappoints to entertain. Everyone will find something to enjoy for sure. ""Spider-Man"", in my review, ""a refreshing story, and exciting action""."

"Comiccritic83","10","1","1","6 May 2003"," BEST FILM... EVER!!!
","WARNING: PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!<br/><br/>""Spider-Man"" isn't just the best comic-book based film ever... it's the best FILM ever.<br/><br/>I know it seems odd to say that about a comic book based film, but I stand by my statement. ""Spider-Man"" has the right amount of story, humor (and when it does show up, it isn't forced) and, above all else, heart.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire gives the best performance of the cast as 17-year-old high school student Peter Parker, who eventually becomes the web-spinning Spider-Man after a bite from an escaped genetically-designed super spider during a field trip to Columbia University's Science Department. His relationships with the rest of the cast work beautifully, from his heart-to-heart talks with his Aunt May (played by Rosemary Harris) or with the woman he's loved since she moved next door to him at age 6, Mary Jane Watson (the gorgeous and talented Kirsten Dunst).<br/><br/>Visually - in terms of art-direction, costumes, etc. - the film is dazzling, with great performances from the cast - especially James Franco as Peter's troubled friend Harry Osborn, J.K. Simmons as the underused publisher of the Daily Bugle newspaper, J. Jonah Jameson, Cliff Robertson as Peter's Uncle Ben, and even Willem Dafoe, who plays Norman Osborn/the evil Green Goblin, Harry's father and Peter's/Spider-Man's worst enemy.<br/><br/> The sound is great, and the musical score by Danny Elfman has some of the best themes to ever come out of his career (among such other memorable scores by Elfman like ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Batman"").<br/><br/>However, no film is perfect. Despite some editing flaws, the worst fact about ""Spider-Man"" is that it isn't for kids. The violence and language see to that. When I saw this film in the theatres 22 times (you read right -- 22!!!), I noticed kids crying during some of the fight scenes or the scene where the Goblin crashes into Aunt May's home (or even just scenes showing the Goblin in general) scared the little kiddies so bad that several parents took their young ones out of the theatres. Just because ""Spider-Man"" is based on a comic character who has been seen in various cartoon series for children, it doesn't mean the FILM version is appropriate. It IS PG-13 for a reason.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, ""Spider-Man"" delivers it all and more, with memorable performances, some of the music beautiful and heroic musical score from Danny Elfman's career, a good story, a good moral and, best of all, 2 hours of web-spinning excitement.<br/><br/>That, and an upside-down smooch between Spider-Man and Mary Jane in the pouring rain.<br/><br/> 'Nuff said, indeed."

The differences actually made the movie that much better (i.e. - shooting web straight from his wrist, as opposed to the ""web shooting"" gadget he used in the comics).<br/><br/>Overall, it is a great movie.

While Tobey MacGuire was an excellent choice, the whole movie was just lurching through the motions; there were no surprises, the whole thing felt paper-thin. Many cliches were strung together to lengthen the otherwise trivially simple plot - geek getting his own back against high-school bully, agonizing death scenes, and much puppy-dog romance which everyone else seems to have found adorable. I found it simply tedious. <br/><br/>While the movie had some nice effects, it is, as one might expect, just another entry in a sad list of superhero flicks that are more or less indistinguishable from one another. Let me give you a hint: the good guy wins."

","I am trying not to be overly negative and I would just like to point out that i am not a Spidey buff who feel hard done-by. This was one film that, along with Attack of the Clones, i had waited with baited breath to see but I found myself laughing all the way through it and not because the jokes were funny but because everything was wrong with it. Tobey Maguire has seriously impressed me in other films (Cider house rules, Wonderboys) and I've always been a fan of Kirsten Dunst but both of them disappointed me. The biggest fault I believe is Sam Raimi. As much as I love the Evil Deads he just was not suited to direct a big-budget action feature like that. Every now and then I expected to see Bruce Campbell jumping up and exclaiming ""Groovy"". In fact he should have played the Green Goblin because, as improbable as it seems, not even he could manage to be as Hammy as Willem Defoe was. The script was cheesey, the love scenes were laughable in how slushy they were and the computer graphics were probably done over a weekend in ILM because they just look rushed. The plot moves along sith break-neck speed which normaly I would not complain about but the speed with which it delivers his detail is so that you fail to empathise or create a connection with any of the characters<br/><br/>*SPOILER WARNING*<br/><br/>and because of this when Peters uncle dies I found myself saying ""Who cares?"". I could go on but I won't. I'll end by asking ""Did anyone else see a big Raging Bull rip-off in the end fight?"" I think Scorsese should sue somebody."

","Contains Spoilers<br/><br/>Having just returned from a 2nd viewing of ""Spider-Man"" (I initially saw it on its opening day of May 3), I was appalled how poorly this film holds up upon repeat visits.  The first time I found it exciting, though not spectacular.  The second time, I spent more time checking my watch and snickering at the movie's inadequacies than I did losing myself in this comic book world.<br/><br/>The truth is that ""Spider-Man"" is riddled with inconsistencies, plot holes and uninspired characters.  Those who think that the dialogue in ""Attack of the Clones"" is bad should revisit the marble-mouthed conversations here. Peter's rambling to Mary Jane in Aunt May's hospital room is absolutely atrocious, as are most of their scenes together.<br/><br/>For the sake of brevity I will not list all the inconsistencies in the plot, but here are a few:<br/><br/>Uncle Ben's ""Great Power"" Speech - Where did this come from?  What great power?  Peter is a science geek all his life, then he knocks one guy down at school and all of a sudden he's got great power?  I think not.<br/><br/>Uncle Ben's Killer - The criminal steals from two people: one is a burly middle aged wrestling promoter from whom he steals thousands of dollars, the other is a decrepit old man from whom he steals a rolling wreck of a car. So he only pistol whips the promoter, but has to shoot the old man?  Yeah, that makes sense.<br/><br/>Pumpkin Bombs - Capable of vaporizing human flesh, yet when one explodes six inches from Peter's face in the finale, it only tears up half his mask. Guess latex renders them powerless.  Right.<br/><br/>But the major failing of the film is this: TO WHOM IS THE GREEN GOBLIN A THREAT?  His paramount concern is stopping a corporate merger?  My God, how will the world ever recover?!  Where is the grandiose scheme that makes the world recoil in fear?  Lex Luthor wanted to sink California into the ocean. Magneto tried to turn every resident of New York City into a mutant.  The Joker tried to kill the residents of Gotham with poison (twice!).  But the Goblin?  He's got a board of directors as his nemesis. Pathetic.<br/><br/>Which is not to say ""Spider-Man"" is all bad.  The film is well cast with capable acting performances.  J. Jonah Jameson is hilarious and some of the action scenes are genuinely exciting.  The CGI works (for the most part) and Danny Elfman contributes a rousing score.  But I get the feeling that every time I will see this movie in the future, I'll find more things wrong with it.  What a shame.<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10"
"MissCzarChasm","9","1","1","5 May 2002"," ""My Spider Sense is Tingling"" and It's Telling Me This Is One Of The Best Comic Book Movies Ever.
","Marvel superheroes are hitting the big screen in waves. First there was blade which made a decent amount at the box office with its 70 + million dollar performance. 2000 brought us X-Men which became a box office hit when it opened with 54 million that summer. The sequel is on its way in 2003. Blade 2 was released in March and it opened with 33 million, an improvement from the 17-18 million the first one opened with. Thr Hulk is now in production with Eric Bana playing the Hulk and Oscar winner, Jennifer Connelly also starring. That film is directed by Ang Lee. After that Daredevil is set to be released and that film stars Ben Affleck, as Daredevil and Jennifer Gardner of Alias also starring. Until then however, we have Spider-Man and judging by the early weekend numbers(114 million opening weekend-highest opening of all time) it seems that people are loving this film. I can say that I more than loved it. I thought it was great.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire takes on the role as Peter Parker a.k.a. Spider-Man, a product of being bitten by a mutant spider while on a school field trip. He is in love with the girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Dunst; Bring it On) who is a kind sole but barely notices him. Peter lives with his Aunt May (Harris) and Uncle Ben (Robertson)(fans, like myself, of the comic will know why he's in this living situation). At first Parker is confused by his new skills but soon he begins to use them to his advantage.<br/><br/>Parker uses his new skills to fight in a wrestling match to get money for various things, one being a way to impress Mary Jane. After the match however tragedy strikes and Parker fully realizes that ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility"" and through this ""Spider-Man"" is born.<br/><br/>Spidey's nemesis in the round is Norman Osborne (Dafoe; Shadow of the Vampire), a somewhat mad/determined scientist who needs to prove that his experiments work. After testing them on himself, something goes wrong and the Green Goblin is born.<br/><br/>I was quite surprised how much Tobey Maguire filled into the role; he not only makes it his own but manages to give it a little character behind the mask. He has that innocent, everyday man quality about him that makes you believe in him. It's a performance that has much more depth than you would expect, especially from a comic book movie.<br/><br/>The supporting cast takes a back seat to Spider-Man, lavish sets and ultimately some nice special effects, but they get the job done. Willem Dafoe has gotten back into my good graces after the atrocious Speed 2. He does a good job as the Green Goblin and doesn't overdo it. Now, it's not as memorable or great as Nicholson's Joker, but he makes a formable foe to Spider-Man. What I liked about his performance was that he didn't over-shadow the hero, much like the Joker did in Batman. Dafoe is given the right amount of screentime to establish his character but not too much to the point where it becomes a movie about him rather than Peter/Spider-Man<br/><br/>The other two notable cast mates are Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. Franco had actually gone in to the audition for the role of Peter Parker but ended up playing Harry Osborne, the villain's son. I liked Franco as Peter Parker's roommate and best friend and love the idea of the continuity aspect of the plot.(You'll see when you view the film)<br/><br/>
Kirsten Dunst is even a good casting choice. What could've easily been an eye-candy role is taken to another level. She's very likable in the role and her chemistry with Maguire is natural and not forced.<br/><br/>
This is good transition into the screenwriting by one of my favorites, David Koepp, who was the master behind films like Stir of Echoes and Panic Room. He brings Spider-Man to life with the help of Maguire and director Sam Raimi (A Simple Plan). The plot even over-shadows the great CGI in my opinion. The storyline is slightly more developed than most movies of this nature and is driven by its characters. I liked that aspect of the film very much.<br/><br/>Spider-Man also features some funny moments like a cameo by Bruce Campbell (of Evil Dead fame) as a Vince McMahon type ring master who gave Parker the name of ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and Peter Parker having fun swinging from building to building. The J Jonah Jameson character is also very funny. He makes the transition from comic to screen very well. Dead on representation.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is the ultimate comic book movie that not only looks like it came from the comics, but adds in the sounds and some dialogue. From the opening credits to the last shot, you could see it in an issue of ""Spider-Man"". Like X-Men, the film is bright with colorful characters and big time action scenes. It reaches the level of my favorite comic book movie, Batman, and maybe after more viewings it could surpass it.<br/><br/>Overall, Spider-Man is a fun romp of comic book action. With a great story, acting, special effects, and a lot of heart Spider-Man is a perfect start to the summer season and i'm glad it's leading the pack."
"MissCzarChasm","9","1","1","4 May 2002"," Right Up There With the Original Batman
","It's Finally here folks. Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man has hit the big screen. The hysteria surrounding this movie is out of this world. I saw the last showing of it with my friends because every other showing was sold out and the showing i saw was packed and filled with Spidey fans and excited movie goers alike.*POTENTIAL SPOILER* I just read this morning that Spider-Man achieved the highest opening day of all time with 41.5 million and is set to make about 100-120 million opening weekend which would make it surpass Harry Potter as the highest opening weekend of all time. *END SPOILER*. There is no doubt in my mind that this film deserves the praise it got from critics and from the reaction in my theatre this film is headed for the record books.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is a comic book movie with heart. Yes i enjoyed Blade, another marvel adaptation, and I even enjoyed its sequel. I happened to like X-Men as well. But the one thing those movies lacked was a grounded hero which was given a firm backstory. While certain things were glanced over in those films, this picture takes time to develop its characters and by the time we reach the 45 minute mark we care about all their fates. There is a nice family storyline with Aunt May, Uncle Ben, and Peter Parker. There is romance with the Peter Parker/Mary Jane relationship, and there are also family struggles with the Norman/Harry Relationship. The story takes time to develop these stories and you can since that when this script was written it was done with a lot of heart and someone who cared about making us care about the characters and their struggles.<br/><br/>One must talk about Tobey Maguire. I was disappointed when i first heard he got the part. I didn't think he could be tough enough considering his other starring roles. I was pleasantly surprised however when i saw his performance. He brings the comic book character to life in the best way. He induces the character with enough vulnerability in the beginning when he's a nerd that we care for him, but when he discovers he has powers Maguire easily shifts into someone more confident. He balances both personna's well, without falling out of character. Considering that we can't see his face at all when the mask is on, the fact that he still can give a masked character some heart is amazing in my book<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst isn't just there for eye candy, as the trailer would suggest. Sure, there are several shots of her that plenty of males will enjoy but she also brings her character from the comic book into the real world. Her chemistry with Tobey Maguire is not forced but very natural. There are certain moments when she falls into total damsel in distress mode but over-all it's a pretty grounded performance.<br/><br/>James Franco makes for a very good Harry Osborn. He brings the character's struggles from the comic book and right onto the screen. We respect him because he's Parker's only friend but at the same time he makes you feel for him because he could end up as his father. Franco is able to this well and is very impressive in a few emotional scenes.<br/><br/>Every comic book movie needs a good villian. Batman had the joker. X-men had Magneto and the Brotherhood of Evil Muntants. Spider-Man's greatest foe in the comic was none other than the Green Goblin. He gave Spider-Man the most conflict in the comic book because of the secret that he knew about Spider-Man and the secret that Spider-Man would eventually learn about him. It was very important that they not ruin this character because he's such an important villian in the Spider-Man mythology.<br/><br/>I'm proud to say that Willem Dafoe is quite good as both Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. He makes his Norman likable yet flawed in the beginning but once he turns into the Green Goblin, that's when the fun starts. His performances is borderline over the top but since it never crosses the line he makes the villian much more threatening. You can tell he had fun with the part and while he doesn't quite reach the level of Jack Nicholson as the Joker, he's right up there as one of the better comic book movie villians. What i also enjoyed was the fact that the villian never over-shadowed the hero. This is where Batman made its mistake. Jack Nicholson stole the show, but since Dafoe doesn't get as much screentime as Tobey Maguire, he doesn't steal show. I'm glad the filmmakers chose to do this.<br/><br/>The CGI is a wonder to look at it. You will believe that a man can stick to roles and soar over the city with grace. It's like a comic book come to life. There are some shots that look pretty unrealistic but when you think about it i think they were going for that in a couple of shots. It feels more like comic book when you see certain shots like that. Besides it would be very difficult to make this believeable with the use of a lot of CGI. The characters never lose their depth when they're in costume and the voice over work done when it's obviously not a man but a special effect is quite good as well. The actors deserves major kudos for making their characters believeable, even when it's a CGI shot.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi is a gifted director. From genre films like the Evil Dead series, to compelling films such as A Simple Plan and The Gift, his work never ceases to amaze me. He handles the material well and you can tell he followed the comic book closely. He makes Spider-Man move much like he does in the comic book and he makes sure that there is more time spent on developing an actual story than giving us a lot of action. There is plenty of action, don't get me wrong but the story in my opinion is it's greatest highlight because you can almost identify with all of the characters. This credit should go to screenwriter, David Koepp, who also did well with the Panic Room script. Raimi does offer some campy touches. The wrestling match features a cameo with Bruce Campbell as the announcer, you may remember him as Ash from the Evil Dead movies, The towns reaction to Spider-Man is very campy and cheesy but is handled well. You can tell Raimi really had fun with the material. The J Jonah Jameson character is another example. Out of most of the supporting characters he looks more like his comic book character. The performance is doen pretty well and he does offer us some nice campy laughs.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is more than a summer movie. Most summer movies supply you with much action but a little of everything else. This movie has it all. Action, romance, and a little heart too. The film leaves it wide open for a sequel and by the end of it i couldn't wait to go on another adventure with THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN!"

","What director can mix the magical perfection of Spiderman with the tragic struggle of Peter Parker with such grace?  Only Sam Raimi, the man behind classics such as ""The Evil Dead"" ""The Quick and the Dead"" and ""A Simple Plan"". There are some beautiful moments in this movie that do not come from special effects, but rather from some superb acting and brilliant Cinematography.  With wonderful casting all around the table, this team of creators took no shortcuts.  They grabbed such gems as Willem Dafoe, Rosemary Harris, and Cliff Robertson (Who have all done there time at the Academy...back when it was good that is).  Once again, Tobey Maguire delivers an incredible performance(""The Ice Storm"" and ""Wonderboys"").  He ties spider-man and Peter Parker into one well developed package for the audience to enjoy.  Overall, give this team a round of applause for breathing life into this arachnid, who brings back some of that grace under pressure."

"bregund","1","7","18","4 May 2003"," Spiderman  Forever Ruined
","There are spoilers in this review.<br/><br/>First of all, the casting of Tobey Maguire for the lead role is the film's biggest mistake.  With his pointy lip, jumbo ears, big nose, and squeaky voice, he resembles Screech from Saved By The Bell (I take it Dustin Diamond wasn't available).  Much like Michael Keaton in Batman, Maguire doesn't even remotely resemble the title character.  Since we're talking about miscast superheroes, thank god they didn't make that Superman movie starring Nicholas Cage.  <br/><br/>Maguire isn't the only miscast actor in this dud.  Aunt May is annoying, Kirsten Dunst is a terrible actress and Willem Dafoe as the squeaky-voiced Green Goblinwell, let's just say that boy aint right.  They emasculated the J. Jonah Jameson character; in the comic book he's a huge, scary, angry editor who resembles a wrestling character, but in the film he's a meek, squeaky-voiced, accountant-looking guy with all the screen presence of Droopy the dog.  What is it with the squeaky voices?  About the only actor who resembles one of the characters is Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben, who doesn't die of a heart attack as he did in the comic book.  Couldn't they keep anything authentic?<br/><br/>You know all those really cool special effects showing Spiderman looping through the city between the buildings?  Well, about ninety-seven percent of the film contains scenes that are not that.  Which is to say that three percent of the film doesn't contain scenes that are boring and stretched out endlessly until you want to gouge out your eyeballs with a rusty spike.  The chemistry between Maguire and Dunst is ice-cold.  <br/><br/>There are long stretches of boring, pointless scenes that do nothing for the film, such as the wrestling scene.  Parker wants money to buy a car so he can impress MJ.  What was the point of all this?  Spiderman should be out saving people's lives and stopping crime, not worrying about getting money for a car.  <br/><br/>This film is laced with continuity and character problems.  The Green Goblin has absolutely no reservations about destroying a balcony full of people, including his own son, and yet when the people on the bridge throw trash at him how does he react?  By letting them throw trash at him.  Why didn't he just blow them away?  And just because Osborne kills the board of directors does not make their decision non-binding.  If Osborne was thrown out for being inept, it's almost assured that the new board of directors would do the same thing.  And the ending is a real problem:  Harry blames Spiderman for his father's death, but how would Harry know that?  Spiderman would have to tell Harry that he killed his father, in which case he would have to tell him that<br/><br/>a)  it was an accident<br/><br/>b)  his father was really the Green Goblin<br/><br/>This dry, pointless, barren film has singlehandedly sucked all the fun and joy out of Spiderman forever."
"Agent10","1","7","18","3 May 2002"," Maybe they should make a superhero who has the ability to make a good movie
","-contains spoilers-<br/><br/>Wow! What a waste of money, talent and film stock. Many elements have to fall into place for me to completely hate a movie to the point where I feel like setting the movie theater on fire. Where to begin.<br/><br/>Before the bashing begins, I will say Tobey Maguire was very believable as Peter Parker. Hhmm, that seems to be the only thing I can say that isn't snide or cutting. First off, Hollywood should now realize this whole ""replace-the-human-with-CGI-effects"" idea just doesn't work. It didn't work in Blade 2, and it certainly did not work in this film. Maybe imagination or blue screen acting would be more appropriate than trying to replace the human form with fake and awkward images of light and bit maps. It was like a bad video game. The dialogue also felt forced in many areas, especially when Parker tried to reveal his true feelings for Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). They did it twice, and it still didn't work! David Koepp went from writing Panic Room to this slop! I haven't seen a dive like that since a Don King promoted fight.<br/><br/>Typically, I rarely put down music, but then again, I think its time for Danny Elfman to go on some reunion tour with Kajagoogoo or whatever the heck the name of that band was he played for. Its obvious he has lost his touch. In fact, this entire movie wreaks of Batman, which was a far superior movie.<br/><br/>The music was a blatant rip-off of Batman, and the movie even tried to rehash certain elements and moments. Let's see here: a chemical turns Willem Dafoe into a maniac, Dafoe's character trying to be nice to the superhero at the end before trying to kill the hero, the scene where the editor calls all of Parker's photos ""crap"" (which was exactly the same way Batman did it), the Green Goblin killing a group of people who want to rub him out of the picture (like the Joker and the other mobsters), etc. The similarities are far too numerous to number, the only difference is that Batman actually had some flair and magistry. This was nothing but a high, gloss picture with pretty images and mind-numbing editing techniques.<br/><br/>I should have stayed away considering Sam Raimi had directed this film, but for some odd reason, I decided to follow the crowd. The lesson: be yourself and watch something else."
"H I/I H","1","7","18","5 May 2002"," Already overrated, overhyped and just plain boring.

I chuckled during Uncle Ben's big speech ""With great powers come great responsibilities"" ooo wee!<br/><br/>Why is Green Goblin wearing a Power Ranger suit? And what's up with Spider-man's voice?

Some really bad one-liners in this film. It looks like he's about to laugh when really he's trying to cry- bad acting in my opinion. Dafoe as the Green Goblin was good but the Goblin looked like a Power Ranger character. Dunst is the typical girl role. Kind of average looking but my does she have some assets. I could not believe what I saw during the rain-fight sequence. My lord, the theatre was filled with 8 year olds!! Still my favorite scene in the movie.<br/><br/>The storyline & flow is what really puts this movie in the dumpster. Basically there are none. There's no build-up, the end battle just happens. Overall, a bad script & a bland story with bland acting. The special effects are great sometimes but horribly computer generated the next. Note to Hollywood: Please stop adding Matrix style scenes to every freakin action movie. Also, please stop with the ""we love New York, we love America themes"". We get it OK.

","Money.  This is all Hollywood stands for, and all it really cares about. Spider-Man's main goals: 1. Money 2. Money. and 3. Money.  I saw this movie on it's opening weekend, and left the movie theater with a bad migraine, and several regrets.  I could not comprehend what people found so great about this movie.  Yeah it had some good action sequences, and some fancy camera angels ( which was the main cause of my migraine ), but aside from that nothing special.  The acting is simply the actors reading off of que cards, and occasionaly smiling.  Despite the fact that Kirsten and Toby did go out during this film there was no chemistry between them at all ( nor anyone else for that matter ).  The plot is just plane unoriginal, and moronic. ""Uh oh my uncle died well I better go become a superhero, and save the world.""    However it is not the movie I hate so much, but rather everything surronding the movie.  The hundreds of hours of advertising,  the thousands of stupid toys,  the fact that the companys had to slap Spider-Man's face on every coke bottle, candy bar, and happy meal.  If you have read my other reveiws you can tell I'm not too partial nor fond of Hollywood, which may or may not ""blind"" my judgement.  Perhaps I have been a little too harsh.  The movie itself is entertaining, and you can easily sit through it many times over.  William Defoe ( I know that is misspelled ) is great, as always. Only he could act his way through the Green Goblin mask.  However I do not look at movies as just things to watch when I'm bored, I think of movies as contempary paintings, and the directors artisits.  That's why I did not like this movie, it had no real objective rather then $.  Over all it merits about 5 out of 10."
"brutalpink","1","8","22","3 June 2002"," what?
","I don't understand how this movie made the top 250, although it wasn't awful, it was boring, unoriginal and appalling as far as special effects go. Far more enthralling, poignant and visually impressive films have been made on a shoe string budget. Most of the acting was respectable, especially from Dafoe who went a long way with his limited time on-screen and one-dimensional character (like most of the others) but Kirsten Dunst? I don't care if her simplicity makes her good for the character, I see no chemistry between her and Maguire. This movie was a big disappointment. What a waste of talent and vision from Maguire and the once great Raimi."

","...spending an evening de-scaling your kettle, or, dare I say, clipping the toenails of you and your entire family (including grandparents).<br/><br/>I went to see this film to see what the fuss was all about. The storyline is entirely predictable, even to those who have never read the comic books. I would put it into the ever growing category of films with a poor storyline, poor acting, but with expensive and overblown special effects whose aim is to disguise the film-maker's total lack of imagination.<br/><br/>The only reason people tend to give for liking this film is the special effects. Unfortunately, this kind of effects can be seen in pretty much all the action films that come off Hollywood's conveyor belt of uninspired, unimaginative junk these days.<br/><br/>I hate to sound like a miserable old man, even though I'm only twenty eight, but it seems that film-makers these days know they don't need to go to much effort to make a successful film. They need just need a predictable story-line with a happy ending, and a clunky, corny script. They then pay an enormous amount of money for some passé special effects, knowing that they will still make a fortune at the box-office due to over-hype and the hordes of witless westerners who are too stupid to appreciate any film which is remotely challenging.<br/><br/>I know I am not comparing like with like, but films such as It's A Wonderful Life, Casablanca, The Wicker Man, The Shawshank Redemption and Leon (off the top of my head) are superb stories with engaging characters and good acting. None of these aspects seem important anymore. Just throw in a load of special effects and you'll make a fortune. Moreover, why does every remotely successful film have a sequel these days? I'll tell you why; to make even more cash. And the sequels tend to be even worse than the first film. If It's A Wonderful Life had been made fifty years later, we would have definitely seen an It's A Wonderful Life 2 and 3. It's not about creating a great moment in cinematic history; it's all about making oodles of cash.<br/><br/>Rant over."

","First off, I want to say I'm a huge Star Wars fan and thought AOTC kicked butt.  That seems irrelevant, but with the ""war"" between Spider-man and Star Wars fans, it needed to be said.  Especially since I've never been a Spider-man fan or a fan of any other comic book hero.  The whole thing is new to me.  But I saw ""Spider-man"" and thought it was excellent.  It's not without flaws, but what movie isn't?<br/><br/>The CG effects worked out well and weren't overused.  Some of them looked super cheesy in the previews, but you hardly notice them in the movie.  I'll never understand why so many people are against CG effects, especially with this movie and Attack of the Clones.  Sorry, but stringing up a 2-inch Spider-man model with a piece of dental floss isn't gonna cut it anymore. I'm amazed at what can be done in movies today and CG is the only way to achieve certain things. <br/><br/>The characters were excellent, especially Tobey.  I had doubts about him playing such a physical character, but he really fit the role.  Kirsten did well with what she was given, but her character was the type who couldn't have saved herself from drowning in a puddle.  But this is comic book material and unfortunately, the women must be totally helpless.  Her character was the only one I didn't like.  Peter's aunt and uncle were very likeable, though.<br/><br/>The story itself was very cool.  Not knowing a thing about Spider-man, it was great that I was able to understand the entire movie.  This is where it outshines Star Wars.  Anyone can watch ""Spider-man"" and fall in love with it, whereas first-time Star Wars viewers will get almost nothing out of AOTC.  My only personal complaint of ""Spider-man"" is that it has no repeat value, at least for me.  I saw it, liked it a lot, and that's it.  I've seen it once and that's all I need.  But fans will likely see it again and again with good reason."
"bigben5","1","5","12","18 May 2002"," Seemed to easy
","WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS . For those who've already seen the movie, read on.<br/><br/>
I think there's something lacking whenever a comic book is converted into a movie, and that is the presence of smart villans AND heros.<br/><br/>Personally, I think the transformation of Peter Parker into Spiderman was too easy. One minute I'm a weak, emaciated, like hamster cowering in the corner of my cage getting picked on, and the next minute I'm kicking your ass and liking it too. The transformation from wimp to hero seems to lack character growth.<br/><br/>The producers decision to have Spidey have web shoot out of his glands instead of a gadget he makes, for the sake of saving all the smartsy stuff, also does damage to Spidey's character. In the comic books and cartoons, Spiderman is known to experiment, invent and even investigate. With him working at the Daily Bugle (or is that superman) don't you think he could - out of curiousity - do some research and find out who Green Goblin is?<br/><br/>
By the way, I think Tobey Maguire looks nerdish even after his transformation into Spiderman. And another thing, since most people know the story of Spiderman why not start in medias res and have him flash back to the time of the spider bite. That way, it would've saved a heck of a lot of time.<br/><br/>Now to move on to Mary Jane, they only meet up and chat one-one-one about 4 times in the movie and all of a sudden when the movie ends she's in love with Peter Parker. Why does love always seem like magic in movies? Figuring out he was Spiderman by a kiss was also lame. She always seems to get in trouble too. Who would want that kind of a girl?<br/><br/>
The Green Goblin was dumb. They never went into detail as to why he chooses a goblin mask. The part when Spiderman is paralyzed, why didn't he just take off Spidey's mask and kill him on the spot if he said ""no"" to his proposal. And why do all villans ask the good guys to join them? Finding out Spidey's identity by a cut was also too coincidental. Isn't the scene where the Goblin pretends to be a women screaming in the fire, painfully obvious?<br/><br/>The part where Norman Osborne is talking to the Goblin mask is hilarious!<br/><br/>""What should I do "" says Osborne<br/><br/>""A good warrior, attacks neither body or mind"".<br/><br/>""Then what should I do?""<br/><br/>""Attack the heart, Osborne ! The heart!""<br/><br/><br/><br/>The end where the Goblin gets killed by his own glider was stupid. Didn't he know that Spiderman has a spider- sense and isn't a comment like ""God's be with you"" a dead give away? Also, I can't keep getting over how Harry Osborne could not have known his dad was the Goblin, after all, hasn't he been acting weird lately?<br/><br/>In short, I didn't think there was enough action to make it an action movie. Spiderman took thugs down too easily. It would've nice to see scenes of slapstick with Spidey webing a guy and repeatedly hitting him in the face, kinda like a yo-yo effect.<br/><br/>The web slinging was great. That was the only plus."
"drosales","1","5","12","6 July 2002"," Horrible for something that should've been better
","With the expectation that the summer 2002 season was to be one of the most exciting in years for moviegoers, I was hopeful that the fierce competition would rub off in finally bringing about the better qualities often lacking in blockbusters these days. Not only did Spider Man fail in that regard, but I was quite disappointed by the fact that it actually had the potential to be a very a decent film. The liberal use of cliches which I wasn't expecting really caught me off guard. Didn't these guys learn anything from the dismal Batman 4 movie? That wasn't the worst part, however. The wooden acting by what should've been a stellar cast, at least on paper, fell flat on its back, while the continuity and lackadaisical visual effects suggested to me that this was a rush job. How the heck duffers like this and ~Batman & Robin~ were even allowed to see the light of day, and still be able to pull in as much money as they did is totally mind-boggling and disheartening. This I can only attribute to ""business as usual"" in Hollywood.... it's less a matter of quality, and one more of hype and hype and hype w/TV commercials until the masses come a flocking like sheep to a shepherd. Baa-aa-aa-ah! If somebody recommends to you that this movie is great and you should go and see it, don't believe them! If you're curious, just wait until it comes out on video and rent it for $1. You'll feel a whole lot better knowing that you could've wasted an extra $9 (but didn't) at the AMC for this bile garbage!"

"DavidSim240183","7","3","6","4 April 2006"," Here comes the Spider-Man!
","Although a huge Spider-Man fan, I must confess I've never read a single Spider-Man comic. Everything I know about the character comes from the cartoons. First the classic one with that song. Then the updated one from the 90's which took a more adult stance, and allowed us to get behind the masks and see the people inside. And now finally, Spider-Man gets the big budget treatment, given a distinctly absurdist spin by one of my favourite directors, Sam Raimi.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi is a self-professed Spidey fan, and his enthusiasm for the character shines through warm and bright. Raimi has taken care to ensure the emotional core that always drew people to Spidey in the first place is still intact.<br/><br/>The story begins on the day Peter Parker is changed into Spider-Man. Parker is a gawky teenager who lives with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May. He pines for the girl next door, Mary-Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). He's friends with super rich Harry Osborn, the son of industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe).<br/><br/>When Parker goes on a field trip to Columbia State University, he gets bitten by a radioactive spider, and is thus transformed. He can now shoot webbing from his wrists, he has superhuman strength and agility, and he can stick to walls.<br/><br/>At the same time, Norman Osborn goes through a transformation of his own. Pressured by his superiors to perfect a new type of super suit, the experiment goes wrong (the film is admittedly a bit vague on this point) and Osborn is driven insane. With the new suit and a hi-tech glider, he becomes the Green Goblin, and sets out to grab power.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Peter's new-found abilities go to his head. He beats up the school bully, and gets off on the adrenaline rush. He feels he can now win the heart of Mary-Jane, but first he needs cash. He goes into wrestling, and there's a great scene where we see Peter try out new designs for an outfit. I got a genuine feeling of exhilaration when I saw the final Spider-Man suit.<br/><br/>But Peter's odd behaviour hasn't gone unnoticed by Aunt May and Uncle Ben. In a very poignant scene, Ben tries to teach Peter about the dangers of power. Thankfully we still get the classic line ""With great power, comes great responsibility."" But Peter doesn't want to listen.<br/><br/>When Peter goes into the wrestling ring, he comes out a winner. The wrestling promoter doesn't give him the money he wants, and is then robbed. But Peter makes no effort to stop him. Just for the sake of revenge. Peter's power trip has sent him sky high.<br/><br/>And comes crashing down to Earth. Uncle Ben is killed, and in a fit of rage, Peter wants vengeance. Only to find the murderer is the same man who robbed the promoter. The man Peter let go. A man who ends up dead after going through a window. A man Peter doesn't try to save.<br/><br/>Filled with remorse, Peter takes Ben's words of wisdom to heart, and puts his powers to good use. As the amazing Spider-Man.<br/><br/>One thing that struck me about Spider-Man was how aptly cast it was. Tobey Maguire is pitch perfect as Peter Parker, finding the right amount of shy awkwardness and balancing it with teenage angst. But unfortunately, he seems a little lost in the Spidey suit. He never really comes alive.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst is a fine actress most of the time, but spends half of it screaming as Mary-Jane. When she's not though, she makes an impression, displaying a touching vulnerability when her acting career goes nowhere.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe is suitably manic, but we never really get behind the Green Goblin's mask. Sam Raimi explored this territory to far greater effect in his earlier effort Darkman. Dafoe goes rather over the top, and his performance falls into cliché. Still, there are some scenes involving the Green Goblin's psychosis I liked, such as the supremely eerie scene when Norman argues with himself in a mirror.<br/><br/>James Franco is an insipid Harry Osborn. He walks around the film with a tortured puppy dog look that is very irritating. He is definitely the most shallow character in the film, and if truth be told, contributes nothing.<br/><br/>Cliff Roberts and Rosemary Harris are great as Uncle Ben and Aunt May. There is a lot of warmth to their characters, and they're utterly believable. <br/><br/>But who could forget J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. He is 100% spot on in the part. Capturing everything. The mannerisms. Gruff voice. Temper tantrums. You perk up every time he's on the scene. It's just a pity he doesn't get more to do.<br/><br/>Honestly though, Spider-Man is a little disappointing. It doesn't quite fire on all cylinders. The components for a great film are all there, but somehow it doesn't add up to a satisfying whole.<br/><br/>The first half is effective as Peter comes to terms with what he's become, but as the special effects take over, the human element gets lost in the crowd. Some of the action scenes are unimpressive, and the latter half is not as compelling as it should be.<br/><br/>When I first saw Spider-Man, I loved it because it was gratifying to see things following the path of the cartoons. But after watching it several times, I now realise it is a rather flawed film, marred by a disappointing climax.<br/><br/>Personally, I prefer Spider-Man 2. It is a far superior film, because it is much more well rounded, and makes better use of it's characters. It also irons out the flaws the original had. Spider-Man is perfectly watchable, but it's not up there with Superman or Batman.<br/><br/>A good film, but not a great one. Although the classic song on the end credits was a nice touch!"
"showa48","7","3","6","17 July 2003"," ups and downs
","As I see it, Spiderman has some good parts to it, but unfortunately one large drawback<br/><br/>(some spoilers)<br/><br/>The good parts: 1. The viewers follow Spiderman right from the (nerdy) beginning, where he starts out being the ""wimpy and weird"" kid  in the class, and indeed in the entire high school. We see the blue-collar neighborhood where he grew up as well. This is all done very believable, and especially the uncle and aunt of Spiderman/Peter Parker are portrayed very heart-warmingly and realistically.<br/><br/>
2. Comical/self-irony reliefs: Spiderman is portrayed as far less self-righteous and self-inflated than, for example, Batman. Especially the ""wrestling scene"", where Peter, having discovered his super abilities, wants to raise money by fighting ""Bone Saw"" for three minutes.<br/><br/>..And some other scenes/aspects of the movie..<br/><br/>The Bad Part: The Green Goblin. This must be one of the worst things I have ever seen, when  it comes to ""bad guys"". After Norman/Green Goblin killed the board of the company, who fired him, he essentially seems to have no other motivation in his life as a super-baddie than bothering and bugging Spiderman. It is believable that he has some kind of subconscious grudge against Spiderman, but that his entire existence hinges on either ""turning over to the dark side"" or, alternatively, destroying Spiderman is not entirely  believable or fulfilling. This is simply too little for a full-length feature!!"

We wanted a feel good movie, and they gave us one. Next, Toby Maguire surprised me at how well he performed.  I never would've guessed this one.  Like Christopher Reeve, he came into a role no one thought he'd succeed with, and made it his own.  Overall, Spidey's an entertaining flick with SPECTACULAR special effects (CGI/ blue-screening a person in the swinging shots ain't easy, folks), but lacks a dynamic script.  It's not on par with the legends of comic-to- movie translations, Superman and Batman (the first films of each), but it'll do."

The movie is a big, loud, dumb entertainment, colorful on a certain level and lots of fun at the beginning--revealing a sneaky sense of humor--yet it becomes more staid and familiar as it progresses. Yes, Spider-Man is a super-hero and we need to see him using his powers for the good of the nation, but Raimi loses the beguiling magic inherent at the beginning while constantly pushing forward with 'bigger and better' ideas. The obligatory hammy performances are here, but Tobey Maguire is curiously low-keyed and oddly charming in the lead. **1/2 from ****"

","You probably know the story, so I'll skip a synopsis.<br/><br/>The movie was fun--it moved quickly and had great special effects. I was almost always interested...but there are two big problems with this film:<br/><br/>1) Tobey Maguire--a horrible choice for Spider-Man. He's a good actor but he's so quiet and laid-back. Peter Parker/Spider-Man should be played by somebody with a lot of energy and more of a screen presence. I didn't believe him for one second.<br/><br/>2) The final battle between Spidey and the Green Goblin--WAY too violent for a PG-13 movie. I was disturbed by it--there was no need to get so graphic.<br/><br/>However, I liked everything else. Kristen Dunst was pretty good as Mary Jane Watson and Willem Dafoe (as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin) and drop-dead handsome James Franco (as Harry Osborn) are excellent in their roles. There's a LOUD pounding score too and some excellent special effects (which work better on a big screen than on TV). <br/><br/>Basically a good summer movie--if only they had cut down the violence and replaced Maguire."

As was everyone else(hats off to Willem Defoe, perfectly portryaying the ever creepy Green Goblin). Although sometimes the graphics were a bit corny, and at a few scenes, I got a Power Rangers feeling when they weren't using graphics in a scene between G-goblin and Spiderman, just looking at them in the cheesy suits looked like something out of Power Rangers.

"SSJAniFan","1","6","16","14 August 2003"," Congratulations, Mr. Raimi and Tristar... you've made the WORST MOVIE EVER!!!!!
","Okay, to be honest, I am a big Spider-man fan.  I'd grab all of the comics, watch the cartoon on Saturdays, buy the toys..... heck, I even stuck through the clone mess, the reboot nightmare, and worst of all, Paul Jenkins's Peter Parker Spider-man #21(at least he got better at writing Spidey stories). But after the decision to cast Kirsten Dunst, an actress I detest with all my heart, as Mary Jane Watson, and seeing the stupid costume they designed for the Green Goblin(which, in the song ""Ode to A Superhero,"" Weird Al Yankovic named it the equivalent of a Power Rangers costume), I had my doubts.  A lot of doubts.  This didn't help when I saw the teaser(Let's go for the Ultimate Spin?  Kill me now).  But still, after the opening weekend, I reluctantly decided to see it, hoping that it would be good and I'd be wrong, since I did like the comic adaption(but then again, it was written by Stan Lee, a person who can actually WRITE).  And so, I went inside the movie theater.<br/><br/>Sadly, my hopeful expectations were shot as fatally as poor Uncle Ben.<br/><br/>The film, simply put, is HORRIBLE.  The acting is some of the worst I have ever seen in my life.  The opening scene at the science lab was so bad, I wanted to vomit.  By the time Peter is figuring out his powers, I actually couldn't take any more and tried to leave the movie theater, but one of my friends forced me to stay.  Spider-man's character is also downplayed.  We only have the serious wall-crawler from some of Stan Lee's more serious issues, but we never get to see the lighter side.  Spider-man doesn't even make one of his trademark wisecracks that we all know and love the entire film(something pivotal to the character.  Just read the story, ""The Best Medicine,"" in PPSM#20, and you'll see what I mean).  This humorless character pretty much just spends the entire time complaining.  Add to the fact that there is NO chemistry between Peter/Spidey and MJ in the film, and you have another reason to hate this.<br/><br/>SPOILERS IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH<br/><br/>Right after the wrestling scene, when the guy hands Peter his money, we see that Peter ISN'T wearing that shoddy face-mask from earlier.  So doesn't this guy know that he's Spider-man?  I mean, Peter shows up and beats up the wrestler with his SPIDER powers, and now some guy dressed in a red and blue costume calling himself Spider-man shows up?  This guy could find out who he is now, unless he's too stupid to make the obvious connection!  All he has to do is learn his name.... oh, but if Peter goes on and sells photos to the Daily Bugle, wouldn't it have a ""photos taken by Peter Parker,"" or something like that?  This plot hole just serves to show how little the writers were thinking when they created this nightmare.  Also, Aunt May's ""Superman,"" line is so awful it shows how low some script-writers can get when they try to inject some humor.<br/><br/>END SPOILERS<br/><br/>Danny Elfman once again creates a forgettable score, similar to Hulk,(this is the guy who once composed stuff for Simpsons, Batman, and Men In Black!?), which doesn't really affect the mood of the film.  And the CGI is just plain bad.  It is so obvious whenever you see a CGI Spider-man instead of Tobey Maguire.  Raimi really needs to work here if he wants to clean up this mess in time for the sequel.... but I doubt he will.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE:  The ultimate piece of trash.  Someone needs to boycott the sequel."
"Quinoa1984","8","7","20","25 May 2002"," it's get better as time and viewings go on
","Sam Raimi to me didn't seem like not the wrong choice to direct Spiderman but the un-needed choice- at least at first. The screenplay would've fit any director whose a fan of Spiderman since it entails most of the clichés and knowledge that goes into a comic book adaptation. But after repeat viewings, and seeing Spider-Man 2 more as well, I've grown some more respect for a picture that I thought of at first as being as nothing more than something of Raimi going 'mega Hollywood' in telling the origin of Peter Parker. In this first installment, he fights the Green Goblin played by Willem Dafoe in a dual personality type role with Norman Osborne. <br/><br/>Watching the movie, I liked the set up parts and the connection between Maguire and Dunst is there, but on the outset when I saw it early on I was not so much a fan of the action sequences, which compared to Raimi's grittier (and funnier to be sure) Evil Dead movies, are so fabricated they might as well have credited Pixar as one of the production companies. The work though shows a little better once settled further into the Parker saga, and the real skills come through better. And compared to others that have come out in more recent years, it is exciting in ways other action set pieces from other comic book movies aren't. I even dig the performances more too, especially Willem Dafoe as Osbourne/Green Goblin, who puts as much gnarly relish into his performance that it ranks up there with his best work. Maybe part of it too is accepting Maguire as Parker/Spiderman, as he has an awkwardness early on that's uncanny. But it fits, and it perhaps grows in the sequel(s), and seeing it again I appreciate what he's doing in the character. <br/><br/>In short, it's fun, and that's all we can really ask for. B+"

If he had just appeared with his sleek, tight, spider man costume than that would of been cool... but instead they stress that he cant do that and make him wear that stupid nike clothes, and like a freeking ski mask.  Then all of a sudden it shows him wearing his new costume... Please someone tell me how he made it?  iF you know please email me... Someone explain the hundreds of other ridiculous things that happened in this movie... please, I just dont get it.  I know this a franchise, money making movie, whatever... but why after the entire movie of peter whining how much he loves MJ, does he just say ""i cant?""  Man that is a complete waste of the movie... it defeats the entire purpose... there is absolutely no closure... god why was the movie so bad?<br/><br/>-the very best part is when he jumps on the car... and at the very end when he's swinging around. And oh yeah, there is 2 fight scenes IN THE ENTIRE MOVIE.  Both of which were not even choreographed well.  At best this movie gets a 6/10, only because of that car scene."
"bradgodhra","1","5","13","1 May 2002"," Yep, it's a COMIC book movie alright.
","I must say, after seeing Spider-Man at a preview show tonight, I was really excited; the thought of having X-Men, Batman, and even Jason coming back from comics to movies was exciting, but my favorite of all time has and always will be, Spider-Man.<br/><br/>However, I WAS DISAPPOINTED!  Sure, it had great effects and great dialogue, I especially like the Superman comment Aunt May made, but the story and plot line is very very dull, especially if you already know the Green Goblin storyline from the comic books and the cartoons.<br/><br/>Also, where are the other villains?  Where's Venom, Dr. Octopus, Hobgoblin, The Jackyl, and Electro?  Hell, bring in Mystero, they have better storylines then The Green Goblin.<br/><br/>Another thing that I have noticed, Kristen Dunst does NOT play a good Mary Jane-Watson; I'm sorry, she sucked in Bring it on, she sucks in Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire plays a good early edition of Spider-Man, but I think they should pass the torch on to someone less dorky; I mean sure, Spider-Man was a dork in the comics for the early years of spider-man, but if you're a fan of Spider-Man you will know he becomes way cooler in the later years.<br/><br/>And why did they bring Macho Man Randy Savage in the picture?  An old washed up wrestler in a high anticipated movie?  Oh wait, I forgot about The Scorpion King coming out too.<br/><br/>
*SPOILERS* I just really hate this movie, this is a disgrace to the Spider-Man name, comics, and the fans; any fan of Spider-Man is going to get cheated if they watch it.  There is a part in the movie where Mary Jane is falling from the George Washington Bridge.<br/><br/>Hmm, if anyone has read Spider-Man, they will know that Staci, Spider-Man's old girlfriend, was killed by being thrown from the same bridge by, who else, THE GREEN GOBLIN!  It's the same as the comic book, damn, at least X-Men tried to bring in an original story to its movie, why can't Spider-Man do the same?<br/><br/>2/10 *'s"
"chucknorrisfacts","1","4","10","26 September 2009"," Amazingly mediocre!
","All right, I am going to try to give a fair and balanced view of this film as best I can. Although, I must say it won't be easy. You see, I grew up on comic books, and although I realize anytime a work is adapted to another medium it may retain certain characteristics while losing others, I know this. However, I think this film took too many liberties with the source material, which in my opinion only ending up hurting the final product.<br/><br/>Where to begin? Hmm, that's a tough one. I guess I'll start with casting. It's not that I dislike Tobey Maguire, but I don't consider myself to be a fan of his necessarily either. I have seen other movies he's appeared in and have liked some of them, but he was not right for the lead in this picture. Who do I think would have been better suited for the part? Almost anyone.<br/><br/>Then there's Kirsten Dunst, who I also found unsatisfactory in her role as Mary Jane Watson. Before I critique her performance, let me just start by saying I'm not sure why they included Mary Jane in the first film anyway. I think it would have made a lot more sense for the love interest to have been Gwen Stacy, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Kirsten Dunst just didn't capture the feisty, wily attitude of her comic book counterpart. Maybe this wasn't entirely her fault, as she did not write the script which would ultimately determine what lines she'd say, but her lack of ""punch"" to lines she did have was her fault alone.<br/><br/>James Franco was one actor whose performance I actually enjoyed in the movie. I think he was terrific as Harry Osborn and was quite likable, despite being positioned as Peter's rival of sorts for the affection of Mary Jane. He didn't play a large part in the movie, but he steals all the scenes he's in. I just wish they would have utilized him better in the film's sequels, but I'll save that for my reviews of ""Spider-Man 2"" and ""3"" yet to come.<br/><br/>I think the choice to give Peter Parker organic webbing was a sacrilege. It was a cop out is what it was, a way to eliminate a few extra minutes of screen time by not having to show Peter create his trusty web-shooters, but for all the time spent mentioning how smart Peter is, they never show him make anything! No web-shooters, no tracers, nothing! Why no gadgets? Come on! <br/><br/>I think the scene in which Peter discovers his newly improved body was OK, except for the thinly veiled penis joke they threw in. Why do this? Do we really need to know that the spider bite made Peter's dick bigger? No, we do not. For those of you who don't remember the scene in which I'm referring toI suggest you take another look at the film. Peter glances downward at his body and speaks of his ""big"" changes.<br/><br/>Although in the comics, Peter had been romantically involved with Betty Brant before Gwen or Mary Jane, I still feel that since the film took liberties with the source material anyway, why not go ahead and leave out Betty Brant, include Gwen Stacy, and introduce Mary Jane either later in the first film or in the second? The whole ""Gwen Stacy/Mary Jane dilemma"" shows itself to be its most problematic toward the climax of the film, during a fight between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin (who looked absolutely ridiculous, by the way). In the battle that ensues, Green Goblin throws Mary Jane off the Queensboro Bridge and Spider-Man comes to the rescue and saves her before she can meet her demise. So what's the problem? Well, this echoes a critical turning point in the Spider-Man mythos, the death of Gwen Stacy.<br/><br/>Gwen Stacy's untimely death serves as a reminder to young Peter Parker that despite all his amazing abilities, he can't save everyone. However, in the film this doesn't happen. Why? Because they decided to swap out Gwen Stacy for Mary Jane, and instead of having Spider-Man learn an important lesson, they (the filmmakers) forgo this catharsis and give us a ""Hollywood happy ending"" in its place.<br/><br/>One final note before I start to wrap this review up, there was entirely too much CGI in the movie. I never felt as though I connected to Spider-Man because it was all too easy to tell it wasn't even a man I was looking at, only a computer generated image. I much prefer the classic 1970s live-action television series, ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" starring the perfectly cast Nicholas Hammond. At least you had a real guy in a real costume performing real stunts. I could connect with that, but not with this movie. Shame on you, Sam Raimi for failing to utilize such a iconic comic book character properly.<br/><br/>Anyway, I figure that's good enough. If you've made it through this far, good for you! I'm too tired now to continue on, but I think I've made my point. ""Spider-Man"" is a disappointment that goes from bad to worse. Its sequels, unfortunately, are not any better. I blame Sam Raimi. I can't wait until the franchise gets rebooted, and maybe they'll get it right the next time around. I love Spider-Man, I love Stan Lee, I love Marvel Comics, and I mean absolutely no offense or disrespect by my review, but it's because I'm such a big fan that I hold such high expectations for a movie about this character."
"chuck-244","1","4","10","10 May 2002"," Is Tobey Maguire dead?
","Aside from the total lack of a believable plot, I wonder how Tobey Maguire managed to get through the entire movie while actually deceased. To expect us to believe that he would just accept a spider bite from a ""super-spider"" and not tell anyone is just asking way too much from anyone who has an IQ of at least 75. Also, Tobey's lack of enthusiasm is very contagious even to the audience. I wished that I were dead myself as he relayed to the fake redhead what he had told Spiderman about her. By the time he was done with his monologue I was ready to go ask the theater management for my money back. As the credits began rolling many began to clap and cheer for the movie. At this point I was helpless to hold back any longer as I yelled to the crowd: ""Did you people actually SEE the same movie I just did?!"""
"cd_spring","1","4","10","6 May 2002"," Incredibly disappointing.
","As a huge Sam Rami fan I wanted to like this movie, but I found it to be tediously predictable and poorly written.  The characters were portrayed with such lack luster performances that I hope the franchise switches leading men and love interests as much as the Batman series.  Even the visual effects failed to wow me (and were quite poor in many places).  This movie might be a big bang right now, but I suspect that is more caused by the horrible movies that have preceded it this year.<br/><br/>My wife summed this movie up when she called it ""Gumby versus the Evil Power Ranger"".  The CG Spiderman was more like Rubberman and the Green Goblin (both CG and Willem Dafoe) looked like he really belonged in an episode of the Power Rangers.  The writing also took its cues from these two shows. One half corny jokes and silly gags and the other half being chessy cornball stuff that 5 years olds find funny but adults simply find inane.<br/><br/>The acting was atrocious.  While I wish this film would mark the end of the careers of the untalented duo of Toby Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, I suspect I will be tortured by these two hacks for many years to come.  Willem Dafoe should stop acting all together.  He had one great role and simply diminishes it every time he appears in another role.  I knew that this movie was going to be devoid of good acting when Sam actually hired Cliff Robertson.  The only performance I enjoyed was the five minutes of Rami veteran, Bruce Campbell.  His screen time was the only thing I liked in this whole movie.<br/><br/>The visual effects looked like Batman and Robin (which is not a compliment). John Dykstra needs to go back to flying spaceships and blowing up minatures.  He has no talent for character animation.  I was immensely disappointed with the whole look of the CG elements.  The lighting was horrible and the composites rarely worked.  In general, I am tired of the whole over exposed grainy look that so many of the recent visual effects heavy films are employing.  I marvel at how rich and vibrant the colors are in all of the Star Wars and Indiana Jones films and how rarely we see that same look in films of that same genre.<br/><br/>This film is aimed at kids under the age of 10 (and adults who wish to harken back to a time when they were incapable of smelling a rotten egg). I would take my kids to see it because it does have a strong moral sense (sort of) and lacks the violence of usual action films, but then I would duck out to see Star Wars instead.  I weep for the future of this industry if this is the kind of drivel that appeals to the public right now.  Clearly the age of the popular and ""good"" movie may be coming to an end.<br/><br/>If I wasn't excited about Attack of the Clones, I can't wait now.  I need something to clear the nasty taste that ""Spider-man"" has left in my mouth."

","Peter Parker is a high-school kid about to graduate when he is bitten by a genetically-enhanced super-spider. He develops extraordinary powers; great strength, heightened awareness, lightning reflexes and spiderlike abilities to climb and spin webs. At a crossroads in his life, he resolves to become Spiderman, a crime-fighting superhero ...<br/><br/>This is a great action blockbuster version of one of the most famous and beloved comic-books of all time - Stan Lee's Spiderman. It had been done before in the seventies as an animated TV show and a pretty good TV-movie, but this is the treatment it really deserves - a big-budget extravaganza with a first-rate cast, terrific sets and special effects and a brilliant visual stylist at the helm. David Koepp's script wisely invests lots of time in the characters - despite the title, this is really a movie about who Peter Parker is, what happens to him, and why he does what he does. Maguire gives an assured but atypical superhero performance, quiet and affable and completely lacking in pretension. Dunst is a great all-American girl, Dafoe is terrific as the schizophrenic villain, alternating between ambitious-but-cowardly scientist Norman Osborn and his depraved alterego, the Green Goblin, and don't miss a funny cameo by Raimi's old pal Campbell as a wrestling emcee. The one duff note is Franco, whose performance is okay but has too much screen-time and whose role seems a bit unnecessary. There are some terrific gags and set-pieces, like the spider-sense sequence in the school and the big parade the Green Goblin attacks, all accompanied by a great Danny Elfman score. This movie was a richly-deserved success both critically and commercially, for one of American's most original and talented directors, but whilst it is very good I'm afraid I have to say that not only is it not Raimi's best movie, it's not even his best comic-book movie (for that, check out Darkman, which is much wilder visually). It's hard to find any fault in such a fabulous fun flick though, which entertains throughout with laughs, scares, romance and thrills."
"TheEtherWalk","4","3","7","18 November 2002"," Good, but not THAT good
","I liked this movie. It is extremely accurate with respect to the comics and tv shows. But there is something about it that I just can't put my finger on. Perhaps it is Tobey Maguire, who was good as Spiderman but awful as Peter Parker. He needed to show more emotion. Or maybe it is the suits which looked WAY too cgi for some reason. Green Goblin's suit was messed up looking. Or perhaps it was Spiderman's webshooters that just appeared on his arms instead of him having to build them. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie. I just think it is a little bit overrated. It needs some tweaking, so I'll give it 7/10."

","I enjoyed watching this on DVD a lot more than seeing it at the theater. I also enjoyed the sequel a lot more than this movie, although this has its moments if you can get past the stupid teen romance. The latter is especially unneeded and overdone at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe is an interesting villain and a decent choice for the role since his resume is dotted with strange characters over the years. One wonders if he - like Johnny Depp - ever plays a ""normal"" person.<br/><br/>This film is very good in the sound effects department if you have a surround system. That was one reason I enjoyed it more at home. Big screens make you lose sharpness in a film, too. <br/><br/>Tobey Maguire plays a likable ""Peter Potter"" (Spiderman) while Kristen Dunst is annoying as girlfriend ""Mary Jane Watson."" It was kind of interesting to see '60s movie-TV star Cliff Robertson again, as Peter's ""Uncle Ben."" <br/><br/>This is not up to Superman or Batman standards, but it will do for a diversionary two hours of super-hero fun. It still entertains, which is the whole idea of it in the first place."
"mymtproject","9","2","4","10 November 2016"," My favorite comic book character brought to life
","2002's SPIDER-MAN is a marvelous telling of my favorite comic book character. When I first heard that Spidey was getting his own movie back in the early 2000's, I was skeptical that the feat could be pulled off. Thanks to the wonders of CGI, strong character casting and good directing from Sam Rami (a guy familiar with the source material), SPIDER-MAN was everything I dreamed it could be! Tobey MaGuire and William Dafoe feel perfect in their roles of Spider-man and his arch-enemy, Green Goblin. JK Simmons as J.J. Jameson is one of the more entertaining characters from comic book movies this past decade. He captures the cigar-chomping, sarcastic Daily Bugle editor in grand fashion! Other supporting casts are good as well, with James Franco as Harry Osborne, Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson and Cliff Roberson as Uncle Ben. You feel like you're swinging between buildings and dodging pumpkin bombs lobbed at you from Goblin's glider in the action sequences. The story line is easy to follow, has heart and is just plain fun! This one is in my DVD collection. It's not perfect but certainly close; a definite 9 out of 10 stars!"
"nmholland","9","2","4","30 March 2016"," One of the Best Superhero Origin Stories Put To Film
","Spiderman is directed by Sam Raimi and stars Tobey Maguire as the awkward high school nerd Peter Parker. On a field trip to a science lab, Peter was bitten by a radioactive spider, and gained superhuman abilities of strength, reflexes, and heightened senses. He also now has the ability to stick to walls, and to shoot spider webs out of his wrists. When a new villain comes to town, a guy that calls himself the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), Peter must handle his nerdy high school life, all while trying to save the city and the girl he loves, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).<br/><br/>Spiderman was one of the first Marvel films ever made, right behind X-Men (2000), and it literally made my childhood. I had Spiderman posters, bed sheets, window curtains, you name it. Spiderman was a very influential movie, and still holds up to day. People still love the original Raimi trilogy (or, the first two), and most like Tobey Maguire better than Andrew Garfield (no offense Garfield fans). This film is pretty close to perfect, and I'm here to tell you why.<br/><br/>One of the best things this film can offer is the close to perfect casting. Although Maguire might not make the best Spiderman, he definitely fits the role of Peter Parker, the high school loser that can't get anything besides his grades right. James Franco as Harry Osborn was a great choice, and was much better than Dane DeHaan with a face full of acne. Kirsten Dunst was a pretty good choice for Mary Jane, although I could've seen some other actress dye her hair red and then scream for two hours. Willem Dafoe was an amazing choice for Norman Osborn, or Green Goblin, and handled that role with a lot of confidence and pulled it off nicely. However, the best casting choice was J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. I truly believe that this was one of the best casting choices made in a film, ever. Simmons played Jameson perfectly, and was a highlight in every film, even the third one, but we don't talk about that.<br/><br/>Another great thing this movie pulls off is the direction and special effects. Sam Raimi is a great director, we all know that, but he does even better in these films than in the Evil Dead franchise. His work with the camera brings a feel to Spiderman that nobody else, including Marc Webb, could handle correctly. Now, the special effects in a couple parts look somewhat dated, but overall, they are really good. Most of them still hold up today, except for a couple shots here and there.<br/><br/>The score is also an extreme highlight of the film, done masterfully by Danny Elfman. Not even the great James Horner could replicate what Elfman did, when it came time to make The Amazing Spiderman (2012). The score adds an epic sense of liveliness to the film, especially in the action scenes (more on that later). The score sounds good with the film, or by itself, which really makes for a good soundtrack.<br/><br/>Now, the action scenes were directed beautifully, and were very clean without an over abundance of cuts, especially the end fight between Spiderman and the Green Goblin. All of the impossible jumps that Spiderman makes, or when he swings from structure to structure look amazing, and this is all thanks to Raimi and his abilities with the camera. He can make a talking scene look nice, or he can make an action scene look nice, which is a great quality for a director to have.<br/><br/>The best thing about this film is easily the vulnerability of our hero, Spiderman. Throughout the entire movie, Spiderman gets the crap beaten out of him, both physically and mentally. His thoughts are attacked, his body is attacked, his loved ones are attacked, and this is what makes the Green Goblin a great villain. He knows all of Spiderman's weaknesses, and he strikes them right where he should. This is where the film shines most, when the hero gets his butt kicked. This is because when the hero finally rises up to overcome the seemingly impossible hurdle, it makes the audience feel all that much better about his victory. This is common in all great films that contain a ""hero"", such as every film in the Dark Knight trilogy, Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), and even movies such as Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981).<br/><br/>Now, the only complaint I had, and this is very nitpicky, is the suit of the Green Goblin. There's no way to let it down easily, he looks like a Power Ranger. Although the suit doesn't look bad, they should've gone with something a bit more realistic, and not just completely comical. If they would've done this, he wouldn't have looked like a Power Ranger, and he possibly would've looked as cool as he actually was.<br/><br/>Overall, Spiderman is an amazing superhero movie, and an amazing movie, and one of the best origin stories put to film. I recommend Spiderman to anyone and everyone; it's worth your time."

"general-melchett","10","2","4","8 November 2006"," Spiffing film.
","Spiderman is a really good comic book adaptation - it is well-written, powerful and intelligent. Instead of just being action and no substance, this film is made great by the fact that it focuses on adolescent problems - girlfriends, exams, that banter, and also builds on the character of Peter Parker - there are times when you really feel sorry from him. The opening scene on the bus is a good one - it captures the humiliation and shyness of being the last one on the bus, and also makes you think about Peter Parker, ""God, he's not a popular kid, I feel sorry for him."" Uncle Ben's death was hugely powerful and effective - nearly as moving as things in Schindler's List and other tear-jerkers. I have to admit, that bit did upset me a bit. (But I shed no tears.) So you feel glad when Spiderman murders his killer. The bit when Peter Parker and Aunt May arrived home from Peter's graduation celebration made me feel slightly strange - it felt pretty empty and solemn without Uncle Ben. This only makes Spiderman better - it also has a soul, rather than being just plain action with no emotional side (like the sort of rubbish we get in cinemas nowadays). And that is what makes Spiderman a spiffing film.<br/><br/>There is no denying that Spiderman delivers on the action front - it does have a slight terrorist theme, which is pretty daring so close after the 9/11 atrocities. But Spiderman is mostly a tale of revenge, and this is brought to the screen in huge epic battle sequences that you enjoy watching - after all, it is what this film was made for. Comic book adaptations should all aspire to this. My only criticism of this movie was that there should have been a bit more action in it, but apart from that, it was absolutely flawless - there were many stories going on during the film, and we cared about all of them. Well, I did for sure.<br/><br/>This film should be in the Top 250 - it should have beat out that awful trash V For Vendetta easily. Many films these days are trying to mix adolescence into their stories - this is one in which it is done successfully. Whenever there was a death in this film, I felt really moved - they couldn't have been done better. On the whole, Spiderman is an absolutely spiffing comic-book adaptation - one that tackles many areas, and one that sticks in the mind for ages after. A stunning job - I solemnly believe that this was better than the sequel. A film that must be watched multiple times before it really hammers itself home. 10/10"
"aliceboy","7","2","4","29 October 2006"," No 'X-Men,' but still entertaining
","I should preface anything I'm about to say by saying I don't like superheroes. These men (and women) in tights are holdovers from when comics were aimed strictly at kids, but now are being read by adults. They cast the world in tones of black and white (or, in the case of this movie, red-and-blue and green...) and oversimplify morality in a way only the real-life comic logic of organised religion does better. This said, I have to admit that I liked this movie. I worked in a comic shop for 10 years, and during that time witnessed the beginning of the recent boom in comic-book movies. Customers would get completely worked up over the latest spandex thriller to hit the big screen, but I'm only catching these movies years later on the small screen. Originally, I hadn't planned to give any synopsis on this story, thinking that if you were going to see this and didn't already know the story behind the spider I had no sympathy for you. However, I then found my own wife had no idea how Peter Parker got his superpowers, so here goes... Mild-mannered ubergeek Peter Parker lives with his elderly Aunt May and uncle Ben, next door to his longtime crush Mary-Jane Watson(who doesn't have any interest in him, of course). On a field trip, he's bitten by a scientifically altered spider, and finds himself endowed with special spidery powers...and a buff new physique! Naturally, being a much-downtrodden teenager, his first instinct is to use these powers to impress girls. Or, more specifically, one girl: Mary-Jane. However, through a series of events, his own actions lead to his beloved uncle's death, and he realises what his late uncle said was true: 'With great power comes great responsibility.' He thereafter commits himself to fighting crime with his newfound abilities. Wackiness ensues...I mean, ADVENTURE ENSUES! The story, at its roots, is pretty true to the source material, for better or worse. On the plus side, the movie maintains the childish charm of a comic book; on the minus, the movie doesn't really surpass the childish charm of a comic book. My only real beef with this movie was probably just a technical limitation of the time (only a few short years ago) when digital effects were STILL not up to bringing this particular character to the screen. While Tobey Maguire pulls some great physical acting out of his performance, it becomes all too clear when the switch is made to a computer-generated 'person' clumsily climbing the side of a building or swinging through the city. I can only imagine such effects looking much, much worse twenty feet high on the big screen. Sam Raimi, who brought us the much-beloved 'Evil Dead' trilogy (and countless other truly crappy movies), is a good choice to helm this flick. His work in 'Army of Darkness,' 'Darkman' and others show he has both an understanding of what makes these stories appealing as well as an appreciation for faithful adaptation of the superhero ethos. The downside of this, is that Parker, arch-nemesis Norman Osborn, Aunt May and the others end up consigned to the otherworldly realm of comics. They never at all approach believable real-life characters, and this removes the viewer from the 'reality' of their world (both the viewer's AND the characters' worlds). Compare this to Bryan Singer's work on 'X-Men.' He managed to take the equally ridiculous other Marvel/Stan Lee icons and mold them into acceptable members of the world we live in. Sure, they have superpowers/mutations, but they also have believable personalities and interactions with reality. I suppose the difference lies in what you want from your superhero: for a reasonable adaptation of the superhero into our world, see the 'X-Men' movies; for pure escapist fantasy, see 'Spider-Man.' Either way, you're not liable to be disappointed as both pack thrills and visual excitement into their brightly coloured packages."
"charchuk","6","2","4","21 August 2006"," Entertaining, but cartoony and shallow
","While spectacular when first seen, this movie does not age well at all. Even now, only four years after its opening, the special effects look dated and cartoony, and the story seems shallow and underdeveloped. It could be because of the release of much superior comic book films in that time span, or simply because the film dazzles at first and then begins to fade. Still, this is a very entertaining movie, albeit a bit cheezy and campy, which works at times, but not for the whole movie.<br/><br/>Though the origin story is done very well - one of the best of its kind - the main plot of the movie is weak and pales in comparison. Part of this is the poorly done villain - not nearly developed enough, with a horrible costume to boot. Had the Jekyll-and-Hyde aspect been done better, the Goblin would have been much scarier, but now it just seems laughable. Speaking of laughable, the romance in this film is terrible - some of the lines are cringe-worthy, and it doesn't help that the actors are mostly wooden. Maguire is decent, but better and more believable as the nerdy Peter Parker than the amazing Spider-Man. Dunst is terrible, and unfortunately began the tradition of younger female leads in superhero movies. Dafoe is way over-the-top, but still enjoyable, and Franco is moody and unremarkable. Only J.K Simmons as the newspaper boss Jameson stands out, as he is both funny and true to his character.<br/><br/>That's not to say this is a terrible movie. As mentioned previously, the origin story is very strong, from the original spider bite all the way until his superhero status. Though some of the drama is poorly developed, the comedic aspect of it is perfect, and suits the story perfectly. The action scenes are spectacular, and the poor CGI is only really noticeable during the close-ups. And the film is never boring, and tells its (somewhat weak) story well. So, overall, an entertaining superhero flick, but nowhere near the best comic book flick ever."

","Spiderman was a fun movie. It had some good action scenes, and good performances by both Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire, but I think it could've been better for a couple reasons.<br/><br/>One reason is the special effects. I mean Spiderman looks like a bouncing ball as he jumps around and soars through the sky on his web. It just looked corny to me, and you could tell it was all CGI, except for one scene at night where he protects Mary Jane.<br/><br/>The other part was the Green Goblin character. William Dafoe is a good actor, and he has a couple scenes here that were all right, but there were also some scenes where he appeared just as corny as the special effects.<br/><br/>Also what about Aunt May and J Jonah Jameson. They appeared in the movie but had very little to do. That of course was improved in the second film, which is much better than this one.<br/><br/>I'm not trashing the movie. I liked it enough to give it a 7 out of 10, but so much more could've been done to make it better. With the second one it was."
"patrick_dunne","6","2","4","20 December 2005"," A very enjoyable, yet flawed movie
","Yes, another one. Spider-man stars Tobey McGuire as Peter Parker and is based on the comic book. Now, we have seen many comic book movies, but spider-man may be among more of the ""fun"" comic book movies.<br/><br/>Of course, we all know what happens in the beginning. Peter, a nerd in school who is in love with the popular girl, Mary Jane, transforms into a crime-fighting superhero. Despite the clichéd beginning, the movie gets better. After the introduction of the hero, a villain arises. The Green Goblin becomes the bad guy after a science experiment goes wrong. Yes, another cliché.<br/><br/>Okay, so the story isn't perfect. It is full of clichés. But, it does have its high points. Despite the fact that it is a comic book movie, it manages to add a few dramatic moments. Obviously Sam Raimi didn't mind adding some heart. (Spoilers) The final fight between Spider-man and the Green Goblin is also very satisfying, and ""cool."" (End of Spoilers) But, to counter the positive side, the special effects are pretty bad and corny, and therefore the action isn't as good as we would like it to be. It's pretty hard to hide bad special effects like Jaws did, (even if it was a malfunction) when Spider-man doesn't have any water or anything to cover him.<br/><br/>Another corny part was when Peter was trying to get Mary Jane to fall in love with him. He doesn't give a very good speech.<br/><br/>Spider-man is a pretty bad flick, but if you turn your brain off, it's quite enjoyable. I mean, it's a whole lot better than all of those darn chick flicks where the un-poplar girls get the guy and triumph of the popular girls. <br/><br/>I, and many more people, prefer the sequel. I will get a lot of disagreements on this, but the sequel hasn't totally ridden itself of clichés, but it has upped the special effects, drama and lowered the cheese factor.<br/><br/>6/10 <br/><br/>Good: Action, and many good scenes <br/><br/>Bad: Corny special effects, speeches and clichéd story"
"Strangeworth","4","2","4","3 October 2005"," Maybe if this movie were bitten by a radioactive spider, it wouldn't suck so bad.
","Sure, it IS Spiderman. The thing is, it is very slow and many of the film's versions of the events and characters are a let down. Let's start with the most obvious, the Green Goblin. I was waiting for him to jump at someone and say ""Arrgh!!!! My face doesn't move!"" The multiple personality thing is cute, but in the comic he was rarely aware of his ""Goblin"" side's presence. At least not to the point of being able to talk to himself. Next, why did they not even bother putting Gwen Stacy in? I loved the Gwen Stacy concept. She died, proving he can't save everyone, not even the woman he loves. Spiderman himself was also a disappointment. He wasn't as sarcastic as his comic book counterpart. He complains too much about the price of being a super hero while this price is hardly ever shown. If you really want to see the price of a super hero, go check out this movie's sequel. Leave this one alone."
"perfectbond","9","2","4","11 June 2005"," Superb adaptation; has a lot of parallels with Smallville
","Sam Raimi's Spider-man has a lot of parallels with Alfred Gough's and Miles Millar's Smallville television series which chronicles the adventures of a young Clark Kent. Both Peter and Clark are high school students struggling to fit in. Both have a love interest that seems out of reach; Mary Jane for Peter and Lana Lang for Clark. Both budding superheroes come from modest households and yet also have warm and caring adoptive families. Both of them have rich best friends who flirt with the darker side of human nature; Harry Osborn and Lex Luthor. Eventually both their best friends will become their nemeses. And the fathers of their best friends, Norman Osborn and Lionel Luthor, both extend genuine fatherly admiration for Peter and Clark respectively.<br/><br/>As for the movie itself, Spider-man is an excellent translation of comic book to silver screen. Along the way there were some liberties taken, like the fact that Peter's ability to shoot webs is another result of the genetically modified spider's bite rather than his manufacturing of web shooters as was shown in the comics, but all in all the spirit of the source material is maintained. The action sequences and CGI were thrilling upon first viewing in the cinema and they hold up fairly well today although it has to be remembered that technology pushes ever forward. But the action scenes are only a secondary pleasure of the film. The primary pleasure is in watching the relationship between the characters unfurl. At the risk of sounding like a sap, I thought Tobey and Kirsten did a marvelous job in showing how young Shakesperean romantic love develops. I truly felt the euphoria that such an emotion generates. To use a cliché, the two had great chemistry. The warmth and caring of the Parker household was also very touching and the tragedy of Ben Parker's demise, frankly, gets to me every time. To me, however, the most intriguing relationships are the ones between Harry and Norman and Harry and Peter. The viewer can empathize with Harry's yearning for love and recognition from the senior Osborn and the jealousy he must feel at his father's interest in Peter. The scene where Harry concedes that his father was 'right about M.J., right about everything' and Norman admits that he 'hasn't always been there' for his son was played to great effect by James Franco and Willem Dafoe. The relationship between Peter and Harry is also a marvel (no pun intended) to watch unfold. We see their almost brotherly camaraderie at the field trip turn into understated awkwardness and tension over Harry's interest in Peter's girl. The mutual empathy over the parallel losses of their fathers briefly brings them together again until Harry swears a vendetta against Peter's alter ego meaning they are now enemies. Great stuff! I can't wait to see how this develops in further installments of the franchise. All the secondary characters are well cast also. Special mention must be made of Bonesaw (played by real life wrestler Randy 'Macho Man' Savage) and J. Jonah Jameson (played by J.K. Simmons who to a degree reprises his role as Sheriff Pearl Johnson in The Gift which not coincidentally was also directed by Raimi). If I have one minor quibble it would be that I wish that the Peter's first love from the comics, Gwen Stacy, could somehow have been written in. She is such a great character. Then again, to do so would probably dilute the Pete-M.J. story arc. The two-disc editions have a wealth of info and special features, more than enough to satisfy the most ravenous curiosity over the film."
"koliokolev","4","2","4","2 May 2004"," Disappointing
","**Spoilers mainly** The disappointing thing for me was that actually I'd read several comments comparing Spiderman to X-men. Spiderman is not even near X-men, in anything. The cast is terrible, the acting is missing, there is no plot at all, the special effects are obsolete. I thought I was watching a 70s movie. Star Wars had much better special effects, and was made 30 years ago. No character development (how can missing characters have character developnment anyway), the behavior of the heroes is unpredictable and not based on reason, not interesting, not exciting....<br/><br/>If you have two hours to kill, it's better than just staring at the ceiling though. 4/10"

"Leo13","6","2","4","21 July 2003"," Disappointment for fans
","I used to read the comic of this super-hero and I can say that I was a great fan. When I heard that the movie was out on cinemas I urged to watch it. The movie for someone who has not ever read the comic, might seem an excellent work, but for those fans who grew up reading it propably might regard it as average. The director, Raimi, created just a good action movie with a super-hero who impresses the viewer with his skills. The story is good but I think the complaint of most of the real fans is that the director failed to represent Spider-man as he really was in the comics. The character played by Tobie Maguire was disappointing and the fact that he had never read a single issue of the comic prior to the movie, speaks for its self. Let's hope the sequel will be better..."
"jamurphy84","Null","2","4","5 July 2003"," Disappointing, poorly acted, typical action movie
","How could this film get a 7.6 and make the top 250??? This is certainly NOT one of the best films of all time surely not. There are obviously some wackos that vote on this site or not enough people with taste... It was poorly acted, the special effects were all done with computers and even then it just seemed as though spider-man was travelling past far too many buildings for it to be realistic. A poor adaptation of the comic book. Rather like the sequels to batman, even the original batman was better than this...<br/><br/>I say again how can this be a 7.6?!?!?!?!?!"
"The Spectacular Spider-Man","7","2","4","13 January 2003"," If only...
","The whole point of Spider-Man is what would happen if a real person was a superhero? What if a superhero really existed? In real life? What if there was a superhero, not a Kryptonian in fictional Metropolis, but a real kid in New York?<br/><br/>
The suit used in the movie just emphasised the fact that the film was a typical superhero movie. It's a given that superheroes in films have cool costumes; Batman, Spawn, the X-Men, etc. So Spidey followed this, as the audience expected. But the whole point is that Peter can't make a cool, high-tech costume because he doesn't have the resources or the means. He's just a kid, doing what he can. <br/><br/>
If Spider-Man actually existed, he would look like the Nicolas Hammond 1970's TV version. A cheap, garish and silly costume (in the comics, Spidey's costume was often criticised) is exactly what Spidey originally wore in the comics and so wore in the TV show, and would wear in real life.<br/><br/>
The cheap costume is endearing. It shows this average guy is doing his best to be a superhero, trying his hardest with the little he has. We can all relate to it, as it's about as good as the average person could do, no better. <br/><br/>I feel if the director Sam Raimi and co had been brave enough to make a film of the Spidey concept (a superhero in real life, cheap costume and all) and not try and animate comicbook panels, then we'd really be onto something."

There was no story, no interesting characters, very bad effects and loads of them(the whole film might as well have been CG) and what makes things worse is that it was directed by ""Cult"", ""Independent"" director Sam Raimi to whom money obviously means more than quality. Lets pray that there is no sequel and the ""SpiderMan inspired"" revolution of big-screen comic-book adaptations stops here. Do yourself a favour and steer clear of the latest Hollywood blockbusters and go see a real film."

"dee.reid","10","2","4","4 May 2002"," On the level of epic storytelling
","Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) is lonely, insecure, and is in love with Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst), a girl he has had a crush on since he was six. One day, while on a field trip to a laboratory where they are studying arachnids, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically altered spider that had accidentally gotten out of its cage. Peter goes home in a daze over what has just happened. The next day, he finds himself mysteriously buffed up and no longer needs to wear glasses. So off he goes to school to endure another day of torment by his peers. Just as he is about to start eating lunch, a weird feeling comes to Peter, just as Mary Jane is about to slip in a puddle. Peter catches Mary Jane and her lunch just in the nick of time. After he continues eating, Peter accidentally shoots a string of web from his wrist. While trying to hide the webbing, he accidentally pulls a lunch tray and it hits one of his tormentors in the back. Peter then hauls a** out of the cafeteria. The guy he hit in the back follows Peter, looking for a fight. Peter is able to miraculously overcome his opponent with the use of his new found ""spider-sense"". On the way home, he begins running and running and finally leaping from building to building and then spinning and spinning. Peter decides to keep his new abilities secret, but when a thief that he could have stopped kills his beloved Uncle Ben, he then decides that he is going to use his abilities to fight crime. It seems that his abilities could not have come at a better time, as he now has to square off against the mysterious and deadly Green Goblin/Norman Osborn(Willem Dafoe).<br/><br/>""Spider-Man"" definitely is the movie to see this year. The hype surrounding this movie is unbelievable. When I went to see this movie yesterday, the theater was packed. Everybody cheered when Peter beat up that one guy and when he tracked down the man who killed his uncle. It seems to me that this movie affected everyone in the theater the same way. There is a very wide range of emotions to be experienced when watching this movie. Some of the emotions I'm talking about like happiness, loss, grief, and good triumphing over evil to name a few. Sam Raimi of ""The Evil Dead"" fame is the perfect director for this film. Some of the comic elements that he uses in some of his earlier films are highly present in this film. You should also be on the lookout for Raimi favorite Bruce Campbell in a small cameo as a ring announcer. <br/><br/>This movie succeeds because of two key things: smart casting choices and epic storytelling. First off, Tobey Maguire IS Spider-Man! I must admit, that I followed some of my friends when they said that Tobey Maguire could not play Peter Parker. I found out yesterday that is not true. He is Peter Parker, he is Spider-Man. He owns that role. Much as Christopher Reeve played the part of Superman and Michael Keaton was Batman before him, Tobey Maguire will take his place in superhero history as Spider-Man. He is a very good actor in this movie. The scene where he visits Aunt May in the hospital or the ending scene in the cemetery where he talks to Mary Jane about their relationship all go to show how good he can act. Although I have not payed that much attention to Kirsten Dunst, I must admit that she was perfectly cast as Mary Jane Watson. She really has that girl-next-door kind of charisma that is required for a role like hers. Willem Dafoe easily plays one of the best comic book villains of all time as Green Goblin. He's basically torn by grief from loosing his company and from pursuing a life of crime as Green Goblin. The scene where he talks to the Green Goblin mask is one of his best scenes.<br/><br/>The costumes for Spider-Man and Green Goblin are some of the most fantastic costume designs and make up effects I've seen since ""Dick Tracy"". This movie deserves to get an Oscar nomination for Best Costume Design and Best Make Up.<br/><br/>The action sequences are some of the best I've ever seen for a superhero movie. The web-slinging scenes, whilst being computer animated, are extremely convincing, largely because they look so real. The scene at the party where Spider-Man and Green Goblin meet for the first time is probably the best action scene in the movie.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man"" deserves all the praise that it is going to receive, no doubt. I love this movie. I really want to go see it again, but I know that I probably won't be able to. This movie will blow you away, it'll make you want to cheer and it'll make you want to cry. <br/><br/>I give ""Spider-Man"" a big 10."

","Based on the Marvel comic series, this film follows the successful film adaptations of ""Superman"" and ""Batman"". But whereas Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne assume their superhero mantles in adulthood, protagonist Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a teenager in high school at the inception of his superhero saga, so his alter ego likewise is a young man, and his is a coming of age story.<br/><br/>Peter is the narrator and he tells us up front that his story is ""all about a girl"", so romance is integral to this film. We are introduced to the angelic-but-socially-needy Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). And the film launches into the origin story immediately, detailing the fateful day when our meek-mannered Peter's life intersects, improbably, with a unique arachnid specimen.<br/><br/>Peter is given a competitor (James Franco) and an enemy/villain (Willem Dafoe). The story borrows heavily from traditional superhero/comic book lore, as well as traditional monster themes (see ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde"" and ""Frankenstein""). And stylistically the film is grounded in comic book graphics and composition, which serves to lighten the drama and inject an element of camp.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man"" is set in New York City, and it often showcases known architectural landmarks to great effect, like the Chrysler Building and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This is something that couldn't be done in Superman's Metropolis or Batman's Gotham.<br/><br/>After a screen kiss that is now iconic, I was disappointed by the last twenty minutes of the film, which are steeped in melodrama, undercutting the dramatic action.<br/><br/>The ending is a setup for the next installment. A twist redefines Peter's love for Mary Jane in an unexpected way.<br/><br/>Because of its comic book roots, the film does not require extraordinary acting, but the cast is solid anyway. Though we never feel the fate of the world is in jeopardy, there are real emotions at play and the actors deliver believable portrayals. Kirsten Dunst is especially good in her role as Mary Jane, which is necessary to anchor the entire film. J. K. Simmons, as newsman J. Jonah Jameson, gets to chew the scenery in a delightful way.<br/><br/>This is certainly a strong first act for encouraging viewers to watch sequels."

"filipemanuelneto","7","0","0","6 October 2019"," Good, but not extraordinary.
","This movie basically shows the emergence of Spiderman: the way Peter Parker, a teenager, changes his life after being bitten by a genetically modified spider. He becomes a hero, able to do justice and protect the weak. But on the other side of the barricade comes the Green Goblin, a villain that only he can stop.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of comics-based movies, but I must admit that this movie has its quality. It shows a hero who, after all, is still a teenager with doubts and learning. The script seems to me well done, presenting a story reasonably capable of capturing the interest of those who do not even like this genre of movies very much.<br/><br/>The actors seem to me to have made a positive effort. I liked Tobey Maguire, he was quite human in a character who risked being just a red suit that jumps from building to building. Willem Dafoe was a pretty good villain, and even before turning, he knew how to give his character an amoral touch. Kirsten Dunst, an actress I don't even appreciate widely, did a job well done. James Franco didn't surprise me, but there's no room for much more than he did either. J.K. Simmons was a surprise to bring us a profoundly annoying character, but it brings great touches of humor to the movie.<br/><br/>Technically, the movie is not surprising, nor is it even brilliant. You bet heavily on CGI, as you'd expect, but it doesn't bring us anything that truly impresses us. Photography is regular, with many action scenes designed to capture the public but become tiring over time. The soundtrack is good, but not particularly good either.<br/><br/>In short, it is a summer movie, designed to attract large masses of crowds and crowded box offices, with a foreseeable sequel soon ahead. It's good, it's certainly better than other cartoon movies, but it's not extraordinary."

"rstarzecmoviecritic","8","0","0","11 July 2019"," Great Balance of Humor and Drama
","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man is full of iconic moments that have been referenced in other movies. The scene in which a single drop of Parker's blood alerts Norman Osborn to his presence is quickly alluded to in the animated film Hoodwinked, although I suppose the argument could be made that was actually inspired by Mission: Impossible. The famous upside-down kiss between Spider-Man and Mary Jane Watson, however, is certainly unique and it is clearly this moment that is referenced in a montage at the beginning of Shrek 2. Spider-Man definitely raised the bar for action movies and superhero movies alike when it was released, but has the film aged well? Let's dive in.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a voiceover monologue by Peter Parker (played by Tobey Maguire in this universe) in which it is apparent he is talking to the audience, asking if we want to know who he is. Starting a movie with the use of voiceover can be risky since it might indicate heavy use of voiceover later in the film, which is not ideal for a visual medium; most would choose the ""show don't tell method."" Luckily, voiceover is only used to project Parker's thoughts a few times in the film, and since it is used sparingly, it proves to be effective and not a nuisance at all.<br/><br/>While this is obviously an action movie and a superhero movie, the writing gives the film a pace that lets it unfold like a slow drama. Unlike the current Marvel Studios Spider-Man movies, this movie is smart at picking where and how to be funny rather than trying to force humor down the audience's throat every minute. Guess what? This doesn't make Spider-Man any less entertaining than Homecoming or Far From Home. The way this movie was written, it knows which scenes demand humor and which demand drama.<br/><br/>While the humor and drama in Raimi's movie balance each other out, the drama is handled especially well. As Parker states at the movie's opening, this story is all about a girl: Mary Jane Watson (not unlike Homecoming). The way Maguire plays the role, it is interesting to see this shy and awkward high school boy gradually build up his nerve to talk to and express himself to the girl he has liked since he was a child. We root for Maguire's Peter Parker as he slowly comes out of his shell as we simultaneously laugh with Spider-Man as he discovers and tests out his powers. As far as the relationships go in this movie they are generally well-handled, but Mary Jane Watson starting to date Harry Osborn is glossed over, and their relationship is underdeveloped as well.<br/><br/>Spider-Man may play out like a slow drama, but that does not mean it is not exciting. As stated above, the sequences in which Parker discovers his new powers and tests them for himself prove to be particularly entertaining, although some skills seem to be mastered way too quickly (his fast reflexes saving MJ and her food is almost corny). It is also very interesting how the movie employs a montage to combine action sequences with an explanation of how Parker is able to get such good photographs of himself fighting crime. The action sequences between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin are fine overall, but the Goblin is honestly an underwhelming villain in this movie. Early in the movie the writer quickly throws in a reason for his insanity (one side effect of the performance enhancers is literally ""insanity"" according to one of Osborn's employees) and his plan to join with Spider-Man to - uh, wreak havoc? - is very poorly explained.<br/><br/>Raimi's Spider-Man proves to be an entertaining drama that does not overplay its use of comedy. There is a great balance between the drama, humor, and action in this movie, making it a great experience for all ages and a visually remarkable movie.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Spider-Man is directed by Sam Raimi and is the origin story to the character of Peter Parker. Tobey Maguire who was casted for the lead role delivers such an authentic performance. Peter is everything from intelligent to painfully awkward, and at times can be the most relatable marvel hero. The great cast portray characters who are perfectly established due to the impressive script. Particularly Willem Dafoe who is phenomenal. He truly embodies the Green Goblin, delivering such a complex and horrifying villain, who contains personal ties to Peter Parker. Sam Raimi's creative voice comes through beautifully, as he focuses on vibrant visuals as well as a real emphasis on the human nature behind Spider-Man. At times this film can be incredibly emotional, where you find yourself caring so deeply for these comic book characters. But above all that Spider-Man contains such exciting action sequences and climatic finale which greatly impacts our hero on both sides of his identity. 16 years later and I still feel completely satisfied by Raimi's portrayal of this iconic Marval hero. Spider-Man set the benchmark for all superhero origin stories, delivering an experience of high quality and undeniable enjoyment. Its a strong start to the trilogy so therefore I give it a 9."
"educallejero","6","0","0","22 March 2019"," Great when not just remaking 1978 Superman!
","So.
The first act looks and feels like a normal late 90's movie from the time. There is nothing special. It's ok. The score isn't good. The acting goes from good to bad at random, and the dialogue is kind of weak.
Then we get the core of the movie (Uncle Ben scene) and that's perfect. Few comic-book movies justifiy so perfectly the guilt and heroic responsability for the main character. It's awesome.
After he gets to be Spiderman, the movie improves a lot and is motly pretty good with some exceptions. MJ ""love"" relationship with Spiderman is weak and unjustified. Why are Peter and Harry friends? Why is MJ Harry's girlfriend? The movie asks you to believe they all love each other, but we don't see it onscreen in my opinion.
Willem Dafoe's Goblin is... ok. Him trying to get to team up with Spiderman isn't though. Why would Spiderman join him? He's on a personal vendetta, even if Spiderman is a criminal, there is no reason for him to join in.
Whatever. The movie is fine, and the action sequences pretty great. The movie is funny, just not that great.<br/><br/>Good movie overall, with great action, a great hero origin story, but weak and stilted dialogue, ok at best villain, and not always great acting. I liked it more at the time, but it may have been because Kirsten Dunst was, understandably, a super crush for me."

","I never had the Chance to watch the whole movie. Just bits of it, now Netflix gave me the Chance and I sat it out.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the Film although I knew the whole Plot.
Of course there were gaping holes in the plot, the acting was shallow the conversation predictable and the graphics made me feel like I watch cut Scenes from a Videogame.<br/><br/>Still I liked the Idea and the first half was very good and promising. Until MJ got in Trouble the umpteenthed time and we had to endure Kirstens vocal skills. The time she was on Screen was more a Screamtime than a Screentime. As a role MJ portrayed such a dependent, weak and stupid women it made me angry.
Her Friendship and so called ""love"" also made me doubt her character. First she was with this High School Bully an inlove. Clearly showing she doesn't want to be with him but seemed to weak to end it all. Then Harry Ossborne had a go with her. Meanwhile she falls in love with Spidermann, kisses him even!
Peter Parkers love for her was so dramatically all over the film, an how he could never reach her, she would be to perfect for him, got friendzoned like five times and still worships her. Having said that, the end pained me so much a brainfreeze kicked in although I haven't eaten Ice Cream for months.
On Norman Ossbornes Funeral MJ confesses her love and he turned her down? What utter nonsense.<br/><br/>I liked William Dafoe in his role as the Green Goblin. His Gollumlike Split Action was really well done, he has some really amazing skills for portraying mad People. Sure his Mask and the suit looked out of Fashion... but I rather have real People and real suits instead of all the CGI when superheroes are animated from toe to head. Lets stay with the suits: how come the goblin fires his pumpkin bombs everyones reduced to ashes but Spidy, getting thrown one full in the face, he only gets a scratch?<br/><br/>All in all, Spider-Man is a classic. Also with stonefaced Tobey Meguire, it shouldn't be missed out. Most classic of all that this movies has so many up to date memes in it, please give it go!"

The pacing is superb, the acting is great, the characters are fun and entertaining, the score is excellent,it's beautifully shot, really entertaining and creative, and has such a fascinating style by making fun of how stupid and over the top this movie while at the same time using that over the top ness to its advantage to be funny and have meaning. It's more charmingly cartoonish in that sense. Really the best part about the movie is Willem Dafoe's amazing performance and the character of Peter Parker, Willem Dafoe plays a really good villain how has an interesting motivation and intimidating which is something every good villain should be, and Peter Parker is by far the best character in the movie who really brings Spider-Man to life by being a really likable, dorky and fun character who always did the right thing and who is an incredibly flawed and relatable which is everything a hero should be. Essentially it feels like a really over the top story told with masterful presentation and changed the game for superhero movies, and i believe it's a great movie for what it is."

","One of the most decent electrifying essential superhero's, the best origin story about a superhero Spider-Man - my personal favorite comic book superhero action movie. Spider-Man (2002) become a blockbuster hit in 2002 when it come out. Spider-Man is my favorite superhero. I known Spider-Man character superhero from animated TV series of the 90's. As a teeneger I saw music video Hero by Chad Kroeger featuring Josey Scott and I rushed to see this movie right away. A neighbor friend got me the movie on his comp and it was an adrenaline rush. This movie become my favorite superhero film of all time it still is. It defines my childhood. I watch this movie the first time as a teenager in a high school, it is a teenager dream.<br/><br/>Spider-Man takes cues from Superman: The Movie (1978) which deals about superhero Clark Kent how he become Superman. Here is the origin story of how Peter Parker become from a shy nerdy teenager later photographer to a ultimate superhero of all time his alter ego Spider-Man. Just like Richard Donner directed the first Superman the excitement is here from MARVEL screenplay David Koepp created by Stan Lee R.I.P and Steve Ditko. I used to had VHS tape my mom bought me a present this movie, when I was a teen for my gradation day. I used too had the poster, but I don't know where that poster went too. I love this film to death my number 1 favorite Spider-Man film is Spider-Man: Homecoming but this Spider-Man the first in the trilogy is my second personal favorite Spidey film. I enjoy beautiful music score for Spider-Man from Danny Elfman, who also worked on a 1989 Batman music score. I love that music score to death.<br/><br/>Directed was by Sam Raimi from ""The Evil Dead"" trilogy and stars: Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco.<br/><br/>The first film has humor, fast pacing, a lot of action, good sci-fi effects beautiful cast, good likable leads and good FX special effects. I love the CGI effects and custom for Spider-Man and Green Goblin. I heard that thieves stole Spider-Man suits on the production set that the crew make them for this movie. Mostly I understand the character Peter Parker it has deep sense meaning to the character. The first half deals more about how Peter is learning about his super ability when he gets bit by a genetically engineered ""super spider"". First he wants to impressed his neighbor Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) the eternity love of his life by buying a car and he goes in to wrestling match to earn money. First half he was more selfish, shy and geek and he lost by a car jacking his uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and when he didn't safe that carjacker who killed his uncle he was selfish. But he got redemption later in the movie and he learns that is not what he does. Spider-Man saved more kids than The Amazing Spider-Man Andrew Garfield did. Spider-Man saves Marry Jane. He saves a baby from a burning building. Spider-Man saves a trolley car on the Roosevelt Bridge witch are kids in it. On a parade in which Green Goblin starts attacking Spider-Man saves a kid when a balloon is falling at him, almost crushing him.<br/><br/>You have action sequences in which Green Goblin on jet glider fires on Spider-Man rockets, and bullets, slugs at him but misses. He throws pumpkin bombs on the Board of Directors killing them, he throws razor bats on Spider-Man and cuts him. I love the fight sequence between Spider-Man and Green Goblin I love that on the end.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker / Spider-Man did a good excellent job playing his character. I like the actor he was excellent I really love his performance. Spider-Man was really the first film in the trilogy I saw. Kirsten Dunst was the best of the film as Mary Jane Watson. I love Kirsten she was my teen crush I loved her in Bring It On, The Crow: Salvation, Get Over It and The Virgin Suicides. I really, really miss the actress I grew up watching in Jumanji the actress, she was part of me growing up. James Franco as Harry Osborn was good I like the actor in a comedy Whatever It Takes he was good as Harry Osburn and a friend of Peter Parker. Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn is a kick-ass actor he plays so many good roles that I enjoy. I love him in Platoon as Sergeant Elias, White Sands and John Wick he played John Wick's friend Marcus. So I love the guy I love his portrayal.<br/><br/>Some Spider-Man fanboy told me that Spider-Man was stalking Mary Jane, it wasn't true. He saw Mary Jane running on the dark streets alone and he saw a muggers following her, so he went after her to help her out and rescuing her, he wasn't stalking her. She was his crush but he wasn't stalking her.<br/><br/>In my opinion it is a decent electrifying essential action film of one of the best origin story's of a superhero becoming a Spider-Man. But I am hug fan of Tom Holland's Spider-Man: Homecoming so this Spider-Man is my second personal favorite film in the ""Spider-Man"" franchise that come out of all five films."

"qli-54365","8","0","0","13 October 2018"," An Untypical Typical Hero Story
","Hero stories are enjoyed by people of all ages. It is common to see a child dressing up and playing as a superhero, or even someone talking about a heroic act done by a neighbor. The superhero genre has been explored inside out, and has become one of the most common type of story. However, Marvel's 2002 Spider-Man rendition of a superhero story twists traditional storytelling clichÃ©s to illustrate the hardships and responsibilities that come with power. With likeable and relatable characters played by Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco, Spider-Man is a superhero journey no one should miss.<br/><br/>The backstory for Spider-Man is rather common. Peter Parker, a typical high school student, went on a field trip to a science museum and found himself bitten by a spider, which mutated his genes and gave him spider-like abilities such as shooting webs, supernatural senses and reflexes, and enhanced vision. One key scene in displaying his powers was the fight against Flash, the school bully. Peter faces his school bully after accidently spilling a lunch tray on him. With his extraordinary senses, he feels a fly behind him, a spitball released, and Flash's fist coming towards him. He reacted by bending ninety degrees backward and stopping Flash's fist with one hand. The camera angles show Peter's inner monologue, his thought about the slowness of the fist and his own reactions dodging the punches. I like how the movie shows a disbelief even on Peter's face, which lets the audience know that even Peter has just realized his own powers. Unlike other movies where heroes can immediately utilize their abilities after knowing it, Spider-Man shows a transition stage where Peter, just like any other human being, needs time to adjust to the changes. <br/><br/>The main character, Peter Parker, is also a likeable character whom the audience can sympathize with easily. In the first scene, the audience sees how average or even weak Peter is, because he first shows up in the movie chasing the bus. We see the insults and mockery thrown at him, and even the bus driver sneers at Peter. When he got on the bus, no one offered him a seat, and in fact, everyone rejects him. To all in the audience who feels insecure or unconfident in themselves, Peter is a character the audience can relate to easily.<br/><br/>The characters in Spider-Man are alive. What Spider-Man do better than other typical hero movies is that it portrays its characters as very human and can make wrong decisions. In the Flash fight scene, what really made Peter as a character alive is that he didn't just gloriously beat down Flash, and thought it was the most natural thing in the world, he was surprised himself. In addition, not all people praised Peter one sidedly for taking down the school bully, there are mixed reactions of disbelief, surprise, and fear, one notably from Mary Jane Watson, Peter's crush. Peter's romantic interests add to the humanness of his character. The villains too, show not only their evil intentions, but also their human hearts, like Harry's concern for his son, Norman, or Norman's vow to take revenge on something his father's death. Although the audience know the villains are wrong, it's hard to hate them.<br/><br/>Peter makes wrong decisions, ones that are irreversible and would make him regret forever. There is no 'hero saves the day' trope because to Peter, no matter what he does, there was always someone he couldn't save. Peter's mistake originated from his lack of responsibility for his powers. To chase a girl, Peter decided to make money by participating in an underground fighting arena. When the people in charge cheated Peter out of his enemies, Peter decided to let a thief escape. This indirectly caused Uncle Ben, who raised Peter, to be killed when he met the thief. Having the power but not acting to save others and protect others around him made Peter feel guilty. He has a revelation about how heavy his responsibilities are by having his powers. Like Uncle Ben said, ""with power comes responsibility"", Peter learns to shoulder his new responsibilities through a very sad lesson. <br/><br/>I think the lesson of responsibility applies to all who has a position of power or is in a position to change something, like the president, the governor, or policy makers, because even without superpowers, they have powers. They have powers to change people's lives and their habits, so it is necessary to not abuse those powers. With the recent Kavanaugh hearings, I think we all have a grasp about how important people appointed Supreme Court have on deciding our ways of life. Spider-Man conveys that message with an intention to remind us all of our responsibilities and what we can do even without spider powers."

","In 2002, Spider-Man came swinging to life as one of the best movies Hollywood ever made. Easily one of the top 10 origins stories ever written, and Tobey Maguire dons the costume with pure-adrenaline excitement. <br/><br/>The movie gradually builds his story arc, from him being an ordinary, shy teenager - to the webslinger that New York City knows him by. It then revolutionises the birth of his first ever nemesis: Norman Osborn a.k.a. The Green Goblin, played by the talented Willem Dafoe with a fantastic entrance a villain can ever provide. The love interest Mary Jane Watson, played by Kirsten Dunst, delivers a sensational relationship with the ""vigilante"", and James Franco plays his best friend, the son of the Goblin: Harry Osborn. <br/><br/>The movie exceptionally shifts in tone, with personal losses with his Uncle Ben's death played by Cliff Robertson, and his relationship with his Aunt May, played by Rosemary Harris, all played in a mother/father figure. <br/><br/>The movie definitely takes you on a ""spin"", and is congratulated by reviews: Rotten Tomatoes - 89% rating. It would be a crime to miss this movie, watch out for the city skyscraper's for Your Friendly Neighbourhood Spider-Man!"

","Spider-Man is just what a superhero origin story should be. Sam Raimi does a fantastic job of showing us the vulnerability of Peter Parker while displaying the awesome power of Spider-Man.

","Decided to reappraise Sam Raimi's 2002 initial version of ""Spider-Man"". My fear was that, given the current sophistication of the MCU and superhero films in general, this vision would might feel juvenile in comparison. I'm happy to report that generally, that wasn't the case. <br/><br/>You don't need a synopsis. It's an origin story; bitten by spider, learns powers, Uncle dies (spoiler) and learns to become a hero. His villain in this one is The Green Goblin, played with joyous unrestrained mania by Willem Defoe. Kirsten Dunst is Mary Jane Watson and James Franco is Harry Osborn. There are a few smaller roles filled by actors that went on to greater things. Joe Manganiello plays Flash Thompson and Octavia Spencer plays the wrestling company secretary. <br/><br/>It all holds up pretty well, after all this time. There is a lot of Sam Raimi in the movie with trademark tracking shots and overlaying images - as well as more explicit references like the classic Oldsmobile car from the Evil Dead films. The CGI is largely pretty impressive, though there are some moments when the transition to a digital stuntman are obvious - a lot of the film was done practically though and most of that still looks pretty good. The story is strong and the performances are pretty solid too - there are occasional moments that drag you out of it though. The Goblins attack on Aunt May for example, forcing her to complete the ""Deliver us from Evil"" line is so over the top it's jarring. <br/><br/>This portrayal of Spiderman is, if I am honest, probably my least favourite of the most recent three. Nothing against Maguire's choices specifically, but he just feels a little too old and not quite as witty as the two that followed. Defoe leaves no scenery unchewed, but it works as his character is truly psychotic, a fact he acknowledges at one point. <br/><br/>It's an excellent, fun adaptation that helped to pave the way for the MCU and some of the great films we have now."
"Spike-Washington","8","0","0","23 May 2018"," The first superhero movie I actually liked
","When this came out that particular summer, I thought to myself, ""Big deal. It's just another superhero movie."" Most of the superhero movies, including the Batman films by Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher, weren't doing it for me and I don't know if I even had a favorite superhero film back then. After Spider-Man ended its run in theaters and came out that fall on video, I watched it and was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't bad at all. Another superhero origin film with all the right elements. A high school youngster, a loving older couple, newly-discovered abilities, and a reason to help the less fortunate. Still, I've heard some say that Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin was a little lame and that he looked like something out of the Power Rangers, but it worked as a realistic villain. At least the suit wasn't too CGI; just a man-in-suit creation. I'd never even heard of Spider-Man's origin story before this movie but later read about it and discovered some minor differences. Those didn't bother me in the slightest though not everyone would and will agree with me. But whatever. Even if you're not the biggest fan of superheroes, try this one for starters. It got me on the path to Marvel, as did Iron Man and the Avengers. And hopefully I'll get to watch the later Spider-Man films (Amazing Spider-Man 1 and 2 don't count). But just give this a chance.

","Spiderman is a movie based on the homonymous comic book created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. It follows the story of Peter Parker (played by Tobey Maquire) a science nerd, high school boy, who's been love with Mary Jane (M.J.) since 6th grade. Peter's parents have died in a plane crash accident and Peter has been living with his uncle Ben and aunt May since he was very young. One day he goes on a school tour to this government/university laboratory and gets bitten by a genetically engineered spider. Spider instills fluids into his organism that later give Peter supernatural abilities, Spider-sense (sensing danger before it occurs), superhuman strength & reflexes, web generation like a spider etc. Peter's life changes drastically from then onward. He becomes powerful but he's reminded by his uncle (who's his father figure). After a fatal accident that occured on his uncle Ben he's fueled by anger and revenge to stop the ones responsible and fight to stop crime. His friend's father Norman Ozborn, an influential, rich genius with a huge corporation ""Ozcorp"", becomes evil as Government defense agency pulls funding from him. Norman's double personality (with Green Goblin) won't stop at anything to get what he wants but he must first kill Spiderman, then nothing will stand on its way. <br/><br/>Spiderman has long been one of my favorite comic book stories, because it is so down to earth. The audience can really relate to Peter, because what happened to him could really happen to anyone. Sam Raimi's excellent direction does justice to Spiderman's story in the best way possible. It presents it on screen in a surprisingly mature way, realistically, with only a few spicy details thrown every now and then to remind the audience of the comic book fashion of the story. The plot is driven by the excellent pacing in a timely manner. Energetic, fluid, everything flows naturally. Also the fights are well choreographed but nothing too amazing. The movie is very entertaining and enjoyable to watch and re-watch. <br/><br/>The cast of characters is truly impeccable. One cannot simply forget the role of J. Jonah Jameson (played by J. K. Simmons) as the chief news editor of ""The Daily Bugle"" a news company, who employs Peter to take Spiderman's pictures. His cast could only be compared to Gandalf's in LOTR. The acting is great, except one or two scenes that in my opinion are a bit exaggerated. The dialogue is fantastic. As an example, the ending talk by M.J. talking to Peter is played perfectly (i was amazed by the level of emotion in this scene. I was convinced Kirsten Dunst was pefect in her role). The film contains some of the wittiest quotes you'll ever hear. Lets not forget the dialogue scene between Peter and his uncle Ben, ""with great power comes great responsibility"" speech, which for me is one of the greatest dialogue scenes ever depicted on film. The antagonist ""The Green Goblin"" is utterly ruthless and a worthy menace to our hero. <br/><br/>Cinematography encompasses some spectacular visuals in here, especially when Spiderman webs around the city's SkyScrapers, it is something you've never seen before. It's a delight to watch this movie. CGI aren't great though, they could benefit from a digital remaster. And let's not forget the fantastic work by Danny Elfman on the Soundtrack. It is a pure joy to hear, it enhances the dramatic moments of the film and fits so well throughout. <br/><br/>Spiderman is an amazing movie. I loved this film when i watched it when i was young. I rewatched it again yesterday and saw that it hasn't aged a bit. This is a refreshing story, released at an important time for comic book movies that were rising at the time with Blade and X-Men. There are only a few dramatically exagerated scenes, that although serve the story, could have been streamlined a bit for realism, but i understand the director's intentions. <br/><br/>

","When I was a kid, Spiderman was always a character that I was aware of, but never much cared for apart from the 90s animated show, so when I went to see the movie in the summer of '02, I was pretty excited to see it and it didn't let me down. From it's superb direction and themes to it's acting and effects, Spiderman is a revolutionary movie in the superhero genre. <br/><br/>The movie follows a high schooler named Peter Parker who is an outsider and can't bring himself to open up to his childhood crush, Mary Jane, but after being bitten by a genetically enhanced spider, Peter discovers that he has gained new abilities, but after his uncle is murdered, Peter decades to use his powers for good and learn what it means to have power and responsibility.<br/><br/>One of the more difficult tasks with bringing a character like Spiderman to the big screen is to give the audience plenty of background information on the lead character in order for us to care about him because if there is too much focus on the heroes origin then it tends to slow the movie down but if the viewer is given too little then they won't connect with the hero. This is something Sam Raimi is able to hit the right notes with by setting up our hero in the few minutes of the movie as we see Peter as a nerdy outsider, allowing the viewer to get to know him better, while another part of the movie's charm is the grand and beautiful style added to it thanks to the bouncy and attentive directing from Sam and writer David Koepp's engaging dialog which allows the story to unfold and allows each character to develop as the movie progresses and while Koepp's script might have an out-of-date touch to it, it feels like Burton's Batman when it comes to format and dialog and can come across as a bit off-putting, it still adds to the movie's charms and makes it a lot more timeless. <br/><br/>While Spiderman's origin is incredibly simple, it feels akin to Donner's Superman, telling the whole story of how the hero comes to be while Rami and Koepp approach the movie with a great deal of respect for the original 60s comic book by maintaining all the major elements of the story like the spider bite and Uncle Ben's murder but don't try to put their own spin on it, rather they adjust certain facts to apply to modern day and the end product is an enduring and touchingly inspiring origin perfectly suiting the character and Sam is able to get the tone of the movie just perfectly by letting the movie have a sense of fun, but never forgets the core message of the story and gives ample devotion to the serious stuff too.<br/><br/>As for the look and feel of the film, Raimi takes great care to be as faithful to the world of Spiderman as possible and New York looks amazing, not even Batman's Gotham City bears a flawless harmony of elegance and reality that Raimi has made. Sam's trademark dynamic camera works fits this kind of movie perfectly and every single shot in the movie is full of momentum and a wonder to be hold. Sam's concept for Spiderman is also supported convincingly by some top-notch visual effects and action with Spidy swings though the Manhattan streets with agility and elegance and while some of the CGI is a bit wonky at times, the visual effects in the movie are flawless for the most part while Raimi provides us with plenty of entertaining battle scenes throughout the film, climaxing in a ferocious and grand face-off that's more extreme and primeval than most other action scenes in superhero movies. <br/><br/>As with most comic book movies, Spiderman would be nothing without a stellar cast and it certainly delivers that in spades. Toby Maguire is an eye-opener as Spiderman/Peter Parker. Much like Robert Downey Jr. or Hugh Jackman, Maguire absolutely encompasses almost everything needed for Spiderman. He brings a good-heart-ed, timid, compassion to his performance but also skillfully portrays both the geeky side and heroic side of the character with remarkable ease while his enthusiastic looks assure the viewer that he looks like a teen, but even wearing the suit, Maguire exhibits a boyish boldness as well as a bit of innocence but nevertheless is fearless when he battles his foes, clearly Rami and Sony took a risk with Maguire and it pays off wonderfully. Kirsten Dunst is a believable Mary Jane and gives a wonderful performance plus the chemistry between her and Toby seems to ooze off the screen whenever they are together. James Franco is wonderful as Harry Osborn, bringing the character's conflicts with his father and his relationship with Peter to life in a wonderful way. Rosemary Harris is wonderful as Aunt May as is Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben and J.K. Simmons steals every scene he's in as the fiery and grumpy J. Jonah Jameson while on the other side of the coin is Willem Dafoe as the evil Green Goblin/ Norman Osborn. When he is Norman, Dafoe portrays a more fatherly figure to Peter while displaying sighs of what he will later become, but when he becomes insane, Willem fully grasps his madness and goes as over-the-top as one can go and uses a richer voice tone for Norman while using a hoarser voice and psychotic laugh for the Goblin without going too cartoonish but still maintaining a conniving and threatening persona that invokes dread throughout New York, truly one of the finest villains in all of comic book filmdom. <br/><br/>If I did have an issue with the film, it would the Green Goblin suit as it does look like something out of Power Rangers, but apart from that, Spiderman is a truly fantastic comic book movie. Definitely one to watch."
"nickscheetz","8","0","0","20 October 2017"," A good example for how to make a good comic book movie
","I was 2 years old when it was being announced that Spider-Man was going to be on the big screen, I didn't know who Spider-Man was, until I watched the movie when it came out on DVD. So what was the result of me watching it? I loved it. Sam Raimi himself is actually a comic book fan so he already knew what he had to do when he first directed this, he knew how to develop the characters and to match the original tone Spider-Man is supposed to be. First I will discuss what I like about the movie: I genuinely love the cast. Tobey Maguire is without a doubt one of the absolute best actors to play Peter Parker we've ever had, he has the soft nerdiness the character is supposed to have and it's very easy to care and sympathize with him in what he's going through, while I do agree he's not as good at being Spider-Man as he is with being Peter I still believe he does a fantastic job, he has funny one- liners and he was able to get ripped in order to look like how the character is supposed to look in the comics. I have absolutely no complaints with Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, she's lovable, tough, sympathetic, and beautiful, what more could you ask for? I would've been shocked if James Franco said no to playing Harry Osborn, being that he's known for his work when it comes to comedy it must've been an interesting twist for him to play a more serious role, loyal, dedicated, intelligent, and sometimes delusional, Dane DeHaal should've learned from this before he agreed to star in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson as Aunt May and Uncle Ben were perfect choices, they portrayed the characters the exact same way they were supposed to be portrayed in the comics and I have no problems whatsoever. Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin is perfect, Dafoe himself actually wanted the part and you can see how passionate he was when Raimi hired him, his overthetop expressive behavior in the movie is just how the Goblin is supposed to be in the comics and all the other relevant adaptations of him. If there were any cast members that I didn't know were in this and I ended up being surprised by what I discovered it would be Elizabeth Banks as Betty Brandt, there's not much to say about her other than she's kind, beautiful, and can't be replaced. Last but not least is none other than J.K Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, he's an over-bearing, obnoxious, loud mouth cartoon character in a live-action movie and there's never a boring scene that he's in, every single word that comes out of his loud, obnoxious, non-stop rambling, mouth of his is music to my ears! The camera work in this movie, while not spectacular by today's standards is still very cool to watch, whether it's any scene with spider-sense tingling, an intense action scene, or Spider- Man web slinging through the city. Spider-Man's suit is a very cool design and it stands out as being one of the most memorable Spider-Man costumes. The score composed by Danny Elfman is an absolute masterpiece, it's the overall best Spider-Man movie theme of all time, there is nothing that can top it. The change where Peter has organic web shooters instead of mechanical web shooters like in the comics is so much better because if you're bitten by a spider that gives you spider powers, why would you not be able to shoot webs from your wrists organically? Now for what I don't like about the movie: 1.Some of the c.g effects definitely haven't aged well, especially in the scene where Peter is testing his agility when jumping across a few rooftops. 2. The dialogue stinks, a lot of what the characters say comes out as being either shlocky, awkward, or just plain dumb, 2 examples include ""it's you who's out Goblin, out of your mind"" and ""I think I have a superhero stalker."" 3. The acting is extremely goofy, primarily with Willem Dafoe, his over the top behavior is very silly at times especially in the scene where he's talking to himself in the mirror and the scene where he talks to his Green Goblin mask when wondering how to kill Spider-Man. 4. Speaking of the Green Goblin's mask, his suit in this is just flat out ridiculous, the Green Goblin is one of the most expressive characters in comic book history, and they had the best actor to play him, but that's really hard to represent when you have him wearing a plastic mask with a frozen expression, thus he looks more like a Power Rangers character than he does as the Green Goblin. 5. This is the last complaint I have but unfortunately it's also the biggest problem I have with not just this movie but the entire series, the romance in this movie is HORRIBLE!!! The relationship between Peter and Mary Jane is so complicated that you'll be demanding the movie to just bring them together and let things stay that way so that you don't have to sit through how cringe worthy it is. In conclusion while the movie is definitely goofy by today's standards and is nowhere near perfect it's still a very clever and enjoyable adaptation of our favorite web-head. I may not love it as much as I used to when I was younger but it still makes me feel good every time I watch it. Because that's our gift, our curse, who are we? We're Spider-Man fans."

","I thought it was actually pretty good. The story was told well and the effects were actually pretty good (and for the time probably even better). I thought the Green Goblin was probably one of the best villains I seen for a superhero film. Because it showed his insanity, but it wasn't over the top. I thought the actor for Peter Parker wasn't that great for the first 30 minutes or so, but got pretty good after the death of Uncle Ben. I have no problem believing that when it was released, it was the best superhero movie made. he one thing I will admit I do prefer in the newer films was I actually thought the actor for Uncle Ben did a better job in that one. Not saying this one was bad, but I just was more attached to that one. Maybe I will have to see that one again just to be sure. Since it's been over a year. Overall, a 8.5/10"

","Spiderman resurrected the superhero movie genre that was in a perpetual flunk since Batman & Robin sucked the life out of it; thanks to Spidey and the X-Men MARVEL's superheroes reanimated the supposedly doomed genre from beyond the grave and it's now back in full-swing. And thankfully Batman and Spiderman now live a peaceful and successful co-existence in the form of movies like The Dark Knight Trilogy, The LEGO Batman Movie, Justice League, Spiderman: Homecoming and Avengers Infinity War. So how does this movie from 2002 hold up? Very well I dare say.<br/><br/>I remember seeing Spiderman at the cinema like it was yesterday; okay maybe not quite as literal as that but I remember the WOW of it like it just happened. Seeing my equal favourite superhero of all time in a movie at long last was a once-in-a-lifetime event! The suit was amazing, the music was amazing and so was the action; though the visual CG-effects haven't aged very well. However the fighting was visceral just like the choreography in the sequences, and all these extremes actually respected Spiderman's character. The film was funny, exciting and emotional at times. It's pretty much a satisfying full-package of a superhero movie.<br/><br/>Spiderman is still my favourite Marvel superhero and this film compliments everything that makes the character memorable and distinct from the rest of the 'super-crowd'."

","A nerdy high-school student Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) gets bitten by a genetically modified spider and wakes up the next morning with a completely new lease of life; he has perfect vision, is stronger and faster than he was before and can also swing through New York City due to his ability of firing webs from his wrist. However, Spider-man isn't the only person in New York with superpowers and he finds himself fighting against the Green Goblin (the alter ego of brilliant scientist Norman Osborn - Willem Dafoe) who will stop at nothing to destroy both Spiderman and everyone around him that he cares about.<br/><br/>Perhaps it is the sweet nature of this origin story that makes it such a winner; we have Peter Parker who is perhaps one of the most unassuming comic book anti-heroes to grace the screen. As Parker, he has a nerdy-goofy charm about him that endears us towards him and as Spider-man he is cool and a great action hero. In the same vein as The Fantastic Four, Peter Parker struggles getting to grips with his super powers and it takes a bit of time for him to adjust to what he has become. This transition is fun to watch and the scene where he kicks that bully's ass was brilliant.<br/><br/>The real story here kicks in when Spider-man isn't paid properly for defeating a fearsome wrestler; he is only paid $100 dollars rather than $3,000 dollars. I won't say anymore than that, but this incident sets off a chain reaction which makes Spider-man the beloved anti-hero. The only minor negative with this story set-up is that you do feel that he becomes who he is out of a sense of guilt more than a sense of duty, but this is minor and is something that I was prepared to overlook in this film.<br/><br/>I normally hate love stories in film, but the blossoming love between Parker and Mary Jane Watson was quite endearing; Watson is a little misguided and can't really see what is right under her nose, but she is never unlikeable and the blossoming relationship between Watson and Parker did feel quite natural.<br/><br/>There are some minor flaws with this film such as there being no investigation into the death of Osborn's colleague after he performs the experiment on himself; they say he was murdered and that someone stole Osborn's prototype, but then that thread is conveniently dropped - we learn the truth later, but it still makes no sense that no-one would follow-up this crime with an investigation. It's also terribly convenient that Spider-man happens to be around to save the day with every crime committed in New York (which is incredible), but again I can suspend disbelief for these things due to how involved I was in the main story.<br/><br/>The acting is also of the highest calibre; Maguire is very good as both the nerdy-geek and as everyone favourite anti-hero. Dunst is good as the female heroine; she has a nice naïve charm about her, but is also good at playing the damsel-in-distress. The likes of Dafoe and Simmons both have fun chewing the scenery, but the latter comes off as the best putting in a brief, but memorable performance. Franco is perhaps the only weak link in the film, but that's mainly because he is given so little to do.<br/><br/>Spider-man is one of the best superhero films out there and contains a great origin story, a believable romance, an impressive villain and good anti-hero. Despite its two hour running time, it moves at a lightning fast-pace, is never dull and boasts some pretty good special effects.<br/><br/>Brilliant stuff"

","A live action Spider-Man had been in the works for some time before comic-book fan and cult favourite Sam Raimi's film hit the big screen. The most notable was James Cameron's scriptment, whilst the likes of David Fincher and Tony Scott were considered for the job. Raimi got the gig, directing a film that works as both an origin story and as a fun action flick. It's clear that he has a love for the source material and that he understands the larger than life aspects of the comic world. What we get is good fun with some big limitations. The films heart is in the right place and it's full of emotion, yet the writing is frequently sloppy and it does descend into campiness a little too much.<br/><br/>Story: Nerdy teenager Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider and develops spider-like abilities. He decides to use these powers to fight crime as Spider-Man once his uncle is killed. He is forced to confront businessman Norman Osborn whose evil alter ego is taking revenge on those who turned on him. The origin story is fairly simplistic, but I enjoy the messages it gets across. The 'great responsibility' stuff might be corny but it really works because the connection between Peter and his family feels genuine, whilst Peter developing and testing his new power is handled with care. Even though Peter's relationship with Mary Jane leads to some convolution I think it is handled well here. The Goblin plot is only where things go astray and that is mostly down to unclear writing.<br/><br/>Hero: Tobey Maguire puts in a strong performance as Peter. What impresses is that he manages to capture the characters awkwardness whilst retaining an honest likability. His actions and motivations seem very natural. His Spider-Man isn't as witty or wisecracking as many want him to be, but I don't think that's much of an issue here. <br/><br/>Villain: Willem Dafoe as Osborn proves to be extremely hit-and-miss. When Dafoe concentrates on the characters unease and the conflict within he is excellent, carrying a real sense of menace. The Goblin is just a hammy mess for the most part. Partly because the characters feelings and motivations are completely unfocused, partly because of some absolutely horrid dialogue and delivery. <br/><br/>Support: Kirsten Dunst is good as M.J. She does have the girl next door vibe, while her motivations are clear and her relationship with Peter is built up with authenticity. I just don't like the way she is always a damsel and effectively becomes a plot device for Spider- Man to save. James Franco does a solid job as Peter's best friend and Norman's son Harry. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson bring a welcomed sincerity to May and Ben. A real standout is J. K. Simmons as Jameson in what is some of the best casting ever seen. He nails the role by being a wonderful mixture of deadpan, sardonic and arrogant.<br/><br/>Action: The action is certainly a mixed bag. While sequences like the wrestling match and the montage of Spider-Man's activity are great fun, the main pieces are a bit of a let-down. The parade fight is harmed by some woeful CGI which makes the city look like cardboard. The climax is a cool set-up, but lacks any real heft and it ends up being a bland punching match. That said, the scene in the flaming building is brilliant and features some really impressive effects.<br/><br/>Music: Danny Elfman provides a surprisingly effective score. It's much bouncier and more bombastic than his usual work, fitting the film extremely well and giving a real sense of excitement to the images of Spider-Man swinging through the city. His main theme is also very memorable.<br/><br/>Production: I find Sam Raimi's direction to be a lot of fun. He always appears to know what a scene needs to give it an extra spark and the camera follows suit in that respect. In a number of areas the CGI holds up well, but in many areas they are badly dated with some of the action scenes are affected by this. Even though Spider- Man swinging through New York looks great, there is a lack of weight to his movements that makes it obvious that CG was used. As far as the writing is concerned, all feel that the more humane aspects are expertly handled, but the superhero material suffers. There is a lot of emotion to be found in Peter's guilt and his connection with Mary Jane, yet his heroic antics do come across as clichéd and don't fit what the film appears to going for at all. The Green Goblin falls foul to a number of especially bad moments, the finish it scene and the ''Sleep..'' line are just cringe-worthy in the worst possible way.<br/><br/>Conclusion: So while it is probable that Spider-Man was the first big modern superhero film and did start a tremendously successful trilogy, I simply think that it is a decent film, nothing more or less. It does offer a lot of entertainment and a heart which many superhero films lack, but it's susceptible to falling down when it looks like it will soar. In Sam Raimi you have an appealing director and yet I don't think he is fully able to do what he wished. What we get is a script that becomes too cluttered and a villain that is way too campy when the majority of the film isn't. With Maguire we have an easy to like lead adding to a very solid supporting cast and I do enjoy the relationships the characters have. In a way I wish there was more of that emotion. Instead we get a film that just about manages to balance heart over silliness."

","Spider-Man is a superhero that was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko and was published by Marvel Comics making his first appearance in Amazing Fantasy #15 in 1962. Since the character gripped most people's attention, he had his own comic book series which was named ""Amazing Spider-Man"" and from that point on, Spider-Man became one of the most popular superheroes around to this day.<br/><br/>When this film came out, people were stoked! The action, the cast, it was just a phenomenal flick! It sounds like Sam Raimi nailed it right? All is good in the land of Spider-Man. Unfortunately, no...I wanted to come out here and say that. While I don't think that it's bad per say, I don't it's the strongest out of Marvel's works either. I'm a big fan of Spider-Man comics and I've been reading them ever since I was about 5 years old and as a result, I wasn't allowed to see this film due to the fact it was rated 12 back in those times. But I'll tell you why that this film is not the best comic book adaptation ever made.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around the main character Peter Parker. He goes to a genetics laboratory where he gets bitten by a genetically enhanced spider and gains spider-like abilities. He goes to a wrestling to get money to buy a car to impress the love of his life Mary Jane Watson. The promoter cheated him off but got robbed, Peter lets the robber go but doing so caused his Uncle Ben's life; he catches him and learn what Uncle Ben told him. Meanwhile, the owner of Oscorp Norman Osborn tries to preserve his military contract for his company because losing it will mean the end of his business. He goes to desperate measures as he experiments on himself with his company's new but unstable performing enhancing chemical paper that increases his speed, strength and stamina. Doing so allows him to go insane and he kills his board members at the world unity fair. Spider-Man and the Green Goblin encounter each other a few times and it's your simple good vs. evil story.<br/><br/>First, I'll start with the casting. I'm so sorry but I don't like Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker. He was terrible in that role. Peter Parker is suppose to be this shy nerd and while he is a nerd, he does not act like a wimp in the comics. Peter is suppose to be smart, clever, witty and sarcastic and Tobey Maguire to be honest doesn't get across those apropriate aspects. He's also not good at doing emotional scenes like when he cries over Uncle Ben let's be honest. Also, when he gets bitten by the spider, he's suppose to have the ability to run fast and jump higher, then he builds his own web shooters. In this film however, they are natural, it just comes out of his wrist for some reason. Very odd...<br/><br/>Instead of having Gwen Stacy as the love interest, we have Mary Jane Watson. I know that Peter and Mary Jane get together in the comics considering that I read them but Gwen Stacy was suppose to be his first love. Not only that, Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane makes me want to face palm, especially the dialogue that was written for her. Not to mention Gwen Stacy was suppose to be in that big climax where the Green Goblin let her go to fall to her death as it was done in the comics.<br/><br/>Now onto Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn. He's not a bad choice to play Norman Osborn, he really looks like the part. But with his over the top performance as the Goblin, it gets really annoying. Plus, the costume is ridiculous and is not like the original comic book design. Are we suppose to take him seriously like that? Just by making him look like he's from the Power Rangers?<br/><br/>Another thing that I would like to talk about is James Franco as Harry Osborn. I think he was underused throughout most of the film. When we get down to the end of the film, he now has a purpose to be in the trilogy. <br/><br/>The script was written by David Koepp. He wrote both the story and the dialogue for this film, he's more of storyteller than a dialogue writer. I think he was trying to go for the comic books but it's suppose to be a comic book adaptation that takes it seriously. <br/><br/>Now onto the good points. The action sequences were fun to look at. Granted, the special effects were terrible like they were cutscenes straight from an early PS2 Game but they were good for their time. Sure, Spider-Man looked like a cartoon while web-swinging but it was 2002 so I'll give it a pass.<br/><br/>I liked the performances by Rosemary Harris as May Parker even though her dialogue was pretty bad. I just loved J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson! He was just SPOT...ON! He played the character perfectly like the J. Jonah Jameson in the Amazing Spider-Man comic book series!<br/><br/>I also really liked the music composed by Danny Elfman. The theme really sticks to my head even to this day! Plus, we have a brief but good cameo from Spider-Man co-creater Stan The Man Lee. <br/><br/>Aside from the flaws I mentioned, I think the story was OK, simple and straightforward. Overall, I say Spider-Man was OK. It's not that great, it's just overrated. Just because I liked it doesn't everything in this film was good. I like the action sequences, I like the soundtracks and the cast that really stand out the most for me was James Franco, Rosemary Harris and J.K Simmons. General audience who never read The Amazing Spider-Man comics will be totally amused by this film but Spider-Man and comic book fans will be disappointed. 6/10"

It lacked the entertaining, wittiness of the comics, cartoons that even the dated 70's films captured.<br/><br/>Strangely, Fantastic Four (2005) and Iron Man (2008) successfully managed to capture the tone, feel and essence of Marvel and it's characters.

The special effects are impressive for the most part and the music score is powerful with a hero feel to it. however, every effect moves at such a fast pace you never really get to see spidey he's a blur for the most part.<br/><br/>After all is said and done Spider-Man and it's sequels are simply too much drama and not enough Spidey fun."

","Sam Raimi brings Marvel's flagship character to the screen after years of development hell and legal wrangles over film rights.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire stars as nerdy high school student Peter Parker who is bitten by a genetically altered spider and develops the proportionate abilities of a spider. After misusing his newly-given powers which indirectly causes the death of his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), he becomes the heroic Spider-Man and learns that ""with great power comes great responsibility"".<br/><br/>Raimi's smash hit blockbuster starts off brilliantly with its introductions to our characters with the cast ably filling out their roles, Maguire does a great job of conveying the right amount of awkwardness as Peter, Robertson and Rosemary Harris are a joy to watch as Uncle Ben and Aunt May and Willem Dafoe is well cast as industrialist Norman Osborn, the soon to be Green Goblin. Kirsten Dunst does an OK job in the role of Mary Jane Watson but the character, as written in the film, is a far cry from the cocky confident party goer from the comics and suffers because of that.<br/><br/>There's a deftness of touch to the opening hour with just the right amount of faithfulness to the comic book whilst updating certain aspects from the comic that would come across as awkward on screen (radioactive spiders and organic webshooters for example) In fact the film very much follows the first Superman film in its tone and pace with the origins of Spider-Man making up the majority of that first hour (as they did with Superman The Movie) Unfortunately once Spider-Man makes his debut in the film it all starts to fall apart and the film suddenly runs out of steam. And the main fault lies with the protagonist, the Green Goblin, whose storyline grinds to a halt once the subplot regarding the battle for control of his company is concluded. There's little reason for the Goblin to do what he does in the film bar the fact that he's angry that Spider-Man tried to stop his attack at Times Square (a very flat action sequence that is the one of the big set pieces of the film) His so-called offer to join forces with Spider-Man makes little sense and is one of the worst scenes in the film as you have two masked figures having a conversation on an obvious studio set that comes across as a scene from a toy commercial.<br/><br/>And that scene highlights the problem with the Green Goblin in this film. You don't hire an actor as good and as expressive as Willem Dafoe only to then cover him up completely in, what can only be described as, a Power Ranger suit so you can't see the performance. Just compare any scene where he's dressed as the Goblin to the scene where he talks to his alter ego in the mirror and you can see that prosthetic make up was the way to go with the design of the character. It's a huge mistake that robs most of the second half of the film of its drama as there's little plot bar the Goblin then going on a rampage against Spider-Man and his friends and family. The final battle amongst the ruins of an old building also has to be one of the most violent sequences I've seen in a family oriented film and is another huge shift of tone that just feels wrong when the first half of the film was so much fun.<br/><br/>The film only regains any sense of wonder in its closing moments when we follow Spider-Man swinging through the New York skyline and it's a real shame that just as the film begins to soar again, it ends.<br/><br/>A definite film of two halves and a great, missed opportunity to be a fantastic start to Spidey's cinematic adventures. You know you're in trouble when one of the best parts of the film is hearing the 60's Spider-Man Cartoon theme tune at the end of the closing credits 6/10"

","Not as good as the best ""Superman"" and ""Batman"" movies, but better than the worst. ""Spider-Man"" has one of the best origin stories in comics; and, much of it hits the big screen intact. What makes the story of downtrodden young Peter Parker's transformation into the extraordinary ""Spider-Man"" so memorable it's the fateful decision he makes NOT to use his new powers to stop a criminal, early in his career. Later, he learns ""with great power comes great responsibility."" The impact of this powerful lesson in heroism is a little diluted by the addition of the ""Green Goblin"", and other alterations, into the preliminaries. It's still a powerful story.<br/><br/>The film's main weakness is it's descent into near cartoon state for much of the ""Spider-Man"" and ""Green Goblin"" action. After Tobey Maguire (as Peter Parker aka Spider-Man) and Willem Dafoe (as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin) successfully bring their characters to life, they are ""re-animated""; however exciting, the special effects dehumanize the characters. The ""Green Goblin"" story is not as effectively told as in the comics; but, the arch enemy father (Mr. Dafoe) and best friend son James Franco (as Harry Osborn) are well cast.<br/><br/>Director Sam Raimi works some marvels. Nice to hear Spider-Man say the magic word, ""Shazam!"" and hear Rosemary Harris (as Aunt May) tell him, ""You're not Superman, you know."" Nice to see Cliff Robertson (as Uncle Ben).

","Don't get me wrong. I love Spiderman. I love the comic books, I love the TV show(s), and I like the plot they chose for the film. Still, this is not a masterpiece. it's a good movie that is revealed to be just a good movie when you compare it to its sequel.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi and the actors obviously had fun with this film. The camp level is pretty high at parts, and the intensity never seems to be turned on. The CGI is easy to look at, but pales in comparison with either of the film's sequels. There are a lot of things to like about this movie. For instance, Tobey Maguire, Jmaes Franco, and Kirsten Dunst are all very good in their roles. In addition, the location shots are gorgeous, and the whole movie flows in a fun, relaxing manner. This is where we come to the film's major problems.<br/><br/>1. It's relaxing. The action never elevates to a level where you actually need to worry about any of the likable characters. The supposedly intense and scary scenes are not very scary or intense at all. Also, the film is too in love with its location to worry about anything else.<br/><br/>2. The green Goblin was a terrible villain. The costume was about as cheesy as it possibly could have been, and the voice-overs from the helmet seemed like something out of ""Power Rangers."" Wllem Dafoe is not to blame for this, of course. The scenes with Norman Osborne and no mask are expertly crafted. There simply aren't enough of them.<br/><br/>3. The film is boring at parts, and has low replay quality. If I had to watch it more than once in a day, I would probably fall asleep five minutes into it the second time. there's simply not enough action, and the romance isn't developed enough to make it interesting.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Spiderman"" is a flawed film with a good heart. It's worth a rental, but perhaps not a buy."

I remembered seeing re-runs of the Nicholas Hammond TV Series in the late eighties when I was a teenager and thought them OK but a bit lame. I am not a fan of any of the Stars in Spiderman either (although I think Willem Dafoe is a good actor). <br/><br/>I found myself thoroughly entertained from beginning to end, however that is all this movie is ENTERTAINMENT. The fact that Peter Parker is bitten by the Spider in the beginning and no-one else is, is a little hard to swallow, why does it not bite other people then we could have loads of Spidermen!(in reality spiders mostly keep away from people). But if you don't think about the what if's etc. and go along for the ride it thoroughly entertaining fast paced fun. <br/><br/>There are the usual clichés, the mad scientist who must test his work on himself resulting in changes of mood and eventually becoming the villain (see The Fly & Hollow Man for other examples of this), the fight with the School Bully, and the ending is predictable.<br/><br/>I found the romantic Scenes between Tobey Maguire & Kirsten Dunst to be surprisingly the best parts of the film, and also the scenes where Willem Dafoe's personality is being taken over by his alter ego The Green Goblin.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire's performance as Peter Parker was completely believable and having now seen him in the role I couldn't imagine anyone else playing it better, Kirsten Dunst was good as Mary Jane, I also though James Franco was good as Parker's friend and unbeknown to him the son of the principal villain Willem Dafoe, whose performance was as usual very good although a little over the top as the Goblin but this is the norm I guess with this type of film.

","When I first saw Spider-Man I had a good time and walked away happy. But now after seeing it again last night on TV I'm a bit disappointed. Spider-Man is the story based of a comic book about Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), a nerd living in New York, being bitten by a genetically altered spider and receiving special, spider powers from it. While Parker deals with his new found powers he must deal with the growing menace of the Green Goblin who may very-well turn out to be closer to him then he could ever imagine.<br/><br/>The film is visually stunning with Spider-Man swinging through New York and some special-effects. But as the visuals and effects triumph some weak story-telling and little character developments hit the film hard. The whole film I felt that Mary Jane Watson(Kristen Dunst) was a complete waste and just ridiculous when all of a sudden a complete stranger is helping her and the very next scene she's making out with him. <br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is pretty tough and pretty cool. He brought out the real dorky side needed to make Peter Parker a successful character. Above all Willem Dafoe (Norman Osborn/Green Goblin)and J.K. Simmons (J. Johan Jameson)was excellent. All the actors acted pretty well and brought a sense of feeling to there characters. I don't blame Dunst entirely for the weak job as Watson, I just always imagined her being just a bit smarter (ex: she begins to walk down a back alley in the pouring rain at midnight not expecting to encounter any trouble) and having more of a role then just being the love connection to Parker.<br/><br/>Another problem was why they made the Green Goblin out to be the villain. With all of the great villains in Spider-Man comics (ex: Venom and Electro) they choose the Green Goblin. they did follow what the Green Goblin did in the comics but it would have been a lot cooler if Venom had been the villain. Venom was just awesome and truly frightened me as a kid.<br/><br/>But Spider-Man brought back the genre of super hero films and Spider-Man 2 turned out to be one of the best super hero films made. Spider-Man isn't a bad film but it does get pretty corny at some scenes including the fight scene along the bridge.

The screenplays for Batman and Superman were written by very, very, very talented people (Mario Puzo, Frank Miller, Sam Hamm, Warren Skaaren) therefore the final product was both entertaining and interesting. David Koepp's screenplay was good and acceptable but far from great, far from captivating: no character development, no deep dialogue, no interesting human dynamics, it was simply pure summer blockbuster ""trash food"". Spider-Man 2 on the other hand, was better written.

Essentially, on an individual scale, Spiderman is fighting for a better world. However, he is targeting crime on a small scale: individual robberies and violence. Spiderman lacks any kind of systematic analysis of the causes of evil that he is fighting. As one man running around New York City putting out fires, he cannot really expect to make any progress towards ending all the violence that he is trying to prevent. His time would be better spent fighting the causes of crime and fighting the biggest murderers and thieves in the world.<br/><br/>However, the deepest impression that the movie gives me are the words, ""with great power come great responsibility"". It's spoken by Peter's uncle, and gets deep into both Peter's and my minds. Spiderman learns how to use his power from it.

However with some small episodes the entire story is both easy and fun to follow. Now this is no philosophical movie, or reality based in any way. But it is a entertaining ride in special effects and superhuman abilities spiced up with a little love story. I will not remember it for actor performances, still there are very competent actors in it, especially Dafoe and Dunst. It's their characters that are given most room to develop. Yes, Maguire has the lead and his character does develop much, but most in the way of coping with his new abilities and adjusting to his new role. He does it well, but cannot be measured by the same means as the other characters. But most entertaining, as mentioned, the special effects and the possibilities they allow...<br/><br/>7/10"

","Spider-Man finally moved it to the movie screen and it was about time. The computer effects lived up to its end of the bargain and the actors did the best they could to make the movie a further success, but the action was left wanting. Not to mention the costuming of the Green Goblin was a joke and a half. For a movie that demands drama in its characters, where's that fair share in the action when we're sitting for two hours?<br/><br/>Nerdy, anti-social teenager Peter Parker gets bitten by a radioactive spider. His world never becomes the same.<br/><br/>Spider-Man's ""origin"" story stays true to its roots and everything is perfect on the comic side. Mess with Stan Lee's, ""With Great Power comes Great Responsibility"" moral and you're in big trouble. But the ferocity of the fights between Spider-Man and Green Goblin were terribly anti-climactic until the end when, even then, they were beating each other up instead of showing a good dramatic fight. In the end, it was good to see Spidey on the movie screen, even when dull at some moments."

That title goes to the original Superman Movie starring Mr Reeve as the man of steel.  What you can say about this movie is it is a damn fine second place and suprisingly is a movie with a message.  <br/><br/>The movie is a strong character piece and the story flows like a river, the action sequences are slick and stylish.  DeFoe gives a performance second only to Hackman's Lex Luthor and the other cast follow his lead and do some of their finest ever work. <br/><br/>There was an out cry at its release as some claimed it to be the most violant movie ever aimed at children, this may or may not be true but people don't realise that this is a movie for 21st century children and the time they are being bought up in is, I believe, one of the most violant times in our history.  This movie gives the kids everything they want, it tells the story of a misunderstood boy from a 'broken' home who wakes up as the strongest, most powerful man in the world.  He gets to punch the bad guy and save the girl who falls in love with him...perfect.  Under the surface Raimi has also added the message that this 'power' means he has to be responsable. One of his characters even says ""just because you can beat someone up, doesn't mean you have to"" bravo Sam, if only all kids films taught them this, the world might be a better place"

","This review is 2 years late, but I'm glad I'm writing it now because I got the chance to see Spider-man 2. As a marvel fan, Spider-man is one of my favorites. So, when they came out with this movie I was excited. The movie was good, but it has some flaws.<br/><br/>Flaw 1:  Spider-man made his webbing mechanism. He didn't get webbing     powers from the radioactive spider.<br/><br/>Flaw 2:  Peter Parker and Mary Jane didn't meet until his first year at E.S.U. (Empire State University). He dated Betty Brant first!!<br/><br/>Flaw 3:  Flash Thompson didn't date Mary Jane!! Mary Jane didn't even go to the same high school as Peter!!<br/><br/>Flaw 4:  Where's Gwen Stacy (Parker's 2nd Love)!!<br/><br/>I could go on, but why bother? I can't believe Stan Lee let the screen writers switch the story around!!<br/><br/>Besides the flaws, the movie still showed out. The acting wasn't great and sometimes the dialogue seemed kind of boring, but the movie wasn't supposed to be like that, right? Willem Dafoe made his presence known and stood apart from the rest of the cast. The casting director couldn't have chosen a better villain. Tobey Maguire played Peter's personality very well and is very believable. James Franco is okay, while Kristen Dunst proves annoying. Her character could've been filled by another female lead, but it wasn't supposed to be like that, right? Oh well, the movie had to be made. Different strokes for different folks!!<br/><br/>Even though it was limited, the action was good. The final showdown between the Goblin and Spidey was satisfying. The Goblin's costume could've been made better, but I wasn't complaining too much. More time could've been put towards the action sequences, but these screenwriters, UGHH!! I'm really impressed at the fact Willem Dafoe did all his stunts. He really outdid himself and deserves praise. I also commend Tobey Maguire on his training getting fit for the role. Not everybody can be  Spider-man!!<br/><br/>Overall, this was a good movie. People have to understand that this was an introduction movie. Sometimes there is not as much action, but a certain goal must be fulfilled to build up a story and its characters. There certainly were flaws, but what's done is done.<br/><br/>Final Judgement: ***/****"

","I really enjoyed this movie but it could have been a lot better. I liked the emphasis on human emotions and storytelling over special effects. I liked Toby M. as Spider-Man too. It was so refreshing to see a decent, nice young man as a hero for a change. Enough with the cynical, vengeful killers that pass for ""heroes"" in movies these days. <br/><br/>What I didn't care for was the sometimes sloppy CGI that looked toooooo unrealistic. At times it felt like I was watching a very realistic cartoon instead of a live-action movie. Couldn't Raimi see that?<br/><br/>I also didn't like the way they handled the Green Goblin. I understand he had to act crazy and the costume was challenging, but frankly, as soon as he filled up the screen, it felt just like I was watching the Power Rangers, goofy fight scenes and all. Anytime Spider-Man and the Goblin started punching each other the movie just went straight to h*ll for me. Too goofy.<br/><br/>And the Goblin's lines were so stupid and poorly delivered. It's like there were two movies: the human, emotional story and the costumed action for kiddies. <br/><br/>But minus the goofy Power Ranger fight scenes/dialogues and occasional CGI lapses, it was a fun movie to watch."

","Having seen Sam Raimi's 2002 box-office smash 'Spider-Man' for the umpteenth time (re-watching it just in time for its apparently better sequel's release), the film's value has not diminished since I saw it during its theatrical release. <br/><br/>I'm not a Spider-Man fan, as I didn't know that much about it before I saw the movie. But with the recent wave of comic book movies I've gotten interested in US comic book culture and from the very first frame it's clear Raimi knows what he's doing. He gets Peter Parker and does a very good job of fleshing out the characters, allowing them to have quiet, tender moments amidst the carnage caused by the mad Green Goblin (played by a scene-chewing Willem Dafoe, great as always). Maguire looks the part and displays an impressive amount of vulnerability, fish-out-of-water clueless-ness and childlike enthusiasm. He also holds his own when the movie enters darker territory and proves himself to be able to handle comedy, as seen in the very Raimi-esque, hilarious wrestle scene (""Bone Saw is reeeeeaaaaadyyyyyy!""). Kirsten Dunst also delivers, breaking through the confinements of what could easily have been just another damsel in distress part. James Franco gets little to do but proves himself worthy of bigger and better things to come for his character. I won't forget to mention J.K. Simmons' portrayal of Jameson. He's over-the-top and crazy as hell and plows through his scenes like some unstoppable force of nature.<br/><br/>The movie is at his best when Raimi cuts loose, allowing his quirky camera-movements and Evil Dead-isms to creep in. But Raimi is not as confident as he should have been (a problem that - I've read - has been solved in the sequel) and somehow fails to deliver unforgettable action scenes. Those that are here are decent enough - even though the CGI gets obvious at times - but Raimi never seems to have these completely under control and they feel generic and thrown together, so we can get back to a character moment (mind you, the burning house scene - how short it may be - is nicely done). <br/><br/>Nonetheless, Spider-Man proves himself to be a keeper, a truly successful comic book movie, right up there with Burtons Batman and Singers X2.<br/><br/>As an origin movie, it's the best of the bunch. As a big budget action flick, it could use a bit more work. But that's what the sequel's for. I'll see you in theaters!<br/><br/>K"

","This could have been a better film, but because it's meant to be a goodish influence on kids, the producers had to stuff it full of morals, and 'good over evil' stuff. I know some people will think it helps the story, and it does in a way, but for me it's far too predictable.<br/><br/>If it wasn't a film for kids, it could have had an element of black comedy of some darker twists, and that would have improved it greatly. But for me, it was merely an average film that i wouldn't bother seeing again.<br/><br/>Overall I would give the film 6 out of 10. I also wouldn't let younger children watch it without parents, as some of the best bits (the violent fight scenes) definitely aren't suitable for young kids."
"DarthBill","Null","0","0","9 June 2004"," Tobey VS Willem
","Big screen adaptation of the much beloved comic book character finds shy, lonely teen misfit outcast Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) getting bitten by a radioactive spider that gives him super strength, super stamina, the ability to climb walls, a danger sense and even the ability to shoot web out of his wrists (in the original comic book he had to make the webbing himself, though why his body didn't inherit the ability to make the webbing is a mystery). After his uncle is murdered by a criminal he ignored stopping, Parker dedicates himself to being Spider-Man, a high swinging super hero. The only problem is that he still pines for Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and is drifting away from his troubled pal Harry Osborne (James Franco; who originally tested for the lead role). To make things worse, Harry's dad, businessman/inventor Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe) turns himself into an unstable lunatic villain known as the Green Goblin. How long before Spidey and the Goblin clash? Not too long at all it seems...<br/><br/>Many have criticized Maguire for being stiff as Peter Parker. Maybe he is and maybe the flatness of his voice is annoying, but in a way that's kind of the idea: Peter Parker is not a bad ass like Wolverine. Peter Parker is a downtrodden underdog who never seems to come out on top. Once he pulls on the Spider-Man mask though he's actually quite engaging. Maguire, however, along with the capable Franco and Dunst, are all easily outshone by Willem Dafoe as the film's villain, despite the stupidity of his costume (the energy in his voice manages to overcome the lack of his unique face hidden behind that goofy mask). Willem steals the movie in a manner similar to how Jack Nicholson stole the show in 1989's ""Batman"". Special effects are wildly uneven though. The guy who plays Parker's boss is also quite funny and dead on in capturing that character's likeness. <br/><br/>One of my favorite moments is when Maguire tries to voice activate his wrist webbing.<br/><br/>""Think of what we could create... or we could destroy. Maim. Kill. And battle each other selfishly again and again and again and again until we're both dead!"" - Green Goblin/Norman Osborne"
"farfromperfection","Null","0","0","4 June 2004"," My Opinion
","I went to see this movie on the back of a somewhat biased attitude to actor playing Peter Parker, aka Tobey Maguire. In fact, I was more than shocked to discover in the fall of 2000 that this usually unconventional, low-budget actor had decided to sign onto what was rightly expected to be the blockbuster of 2002. <br/><br/>In turn, I was reluctant to see the movie, thinking it would signal the end of Maguire's charm as an emotional, empathetic character that he had displayed either intentionally or not in his other films (Wonderboys, Cider House Rules etc). <br/><br/>I need not have worried. In spite of the fact Peter Parker is cast as a vulnerable, retiring character at the start of the movie, and although he always maintains this sense of selflessness throughout, Tobey, in my humble opinion gave the role something that perhaps another couldn't. I felt he took the fiction of Peter Parker and his characteristics and made them into reality - Tobey adopting the actual personality he would have considered Peter to have if he were a real life person. I feel Tobey didn't just ""act"" the role, but he ""became"" it. I felt his on screen performance was totally believable and coming from someone who has seen his previous movies on several occasions, this is no small feat. I thought Spiderman would be the demise of Maguire as an actor, and although the hype since has somewhat clouded many judgements, he has proved he is still in tune with his emotional connection to characters he plays (Red Pollard in Seabiscuit, for example) in roles since. <br/><br/>My bone of contention with the movie is the slightly unorthodox Green Goblin. Spiderman was, although not realistic to the point of true life (after all it is a comic book adaptation), plausible. Although Da Foe was cast well, I felt the overall attitude of the Goblin was somewhat embarrassing. True, he was set to become Spiderman's rival, and I suppose one could argue this had to be set at an overall age (therefore, in spite of the age certificate, teenagers had to be able to relate in some way) but I felt some of the ""comical"" moments made the movie seem too tongue in cheek. In some ways it is hard to ""connect"" with a movie if the plot line is removed from real life (i.e., somehow I don't think we will get a teenage boy strip down to a spandex suit and save the world) but the script behind the action scenes (Parkers ongoing conflict with his feelings for Mary Jane, his initial shock at realising the potential of his power, Norman's duel personality and helpless denial against evil) was well done if slightly cliché. However, although the ending was somewhat predictable (Mary Jane confessing her love for Peter) I liked the fact Peter was able to distance himself knowing the feats and responsibility upon him, and able to quash the potential relationship. Had they fallen into bed and gone on from there the movie would have certainly been ruined under contradiction and it has set things up well for the sequel. <br/><br/>I also liked Mary Jane's reaction to her kiss with Peter. Many of my peers who watched the film at the same time as me didn't understand the relevance to what she had done, other than she had just kissed the man she loved. But to me, I feel Mary Jane knew that kiss somewhere, and although she doesn't recognise the deja vu to the point of pinning that person down, there is a very interesting realism to take into Spiderman 2. <br/><br/>So, overall, I enjoyed the film mainly for its casting. You might not get a deep sense of life from it, but as far as action movies go, I think it's pretty decent."

","I admit, when I heard everyone, and I mean everyone, raving about this movie, I was like, who cares, it's just based on a comic book.  And the trailer looked so cliche.  I was so wrong.  It's interesting, funny, exciting.  Tobie Maguire is perfect as the dork-with-a-heart-of-gold who becomes a superhero.  James Franco and Kirsten Dunst are great as his supporting buddies, and Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris are wonderful as his Uncle Ben and Aunt May.  The only one I had a problem with was the villain, the Green Goblin, played by Willem Dafoe.  I like the actor ok, okay, I don't, but I wasn't happy with Mr Osbourne being so torn about being a bad guy.  Just go with it!  It would've been more interesting if he was bad to begin with, and then realized his full power when he became the Green Goblin.  But I believe the standout and total scene-stealer in this movie has to be Mr. Jameson, played by J.K. Simmons.  I've seen the actor in various ""Law and Order"" episodes and other shows, but this role has to be what he was born for.  I got giddy everytime I saw him in a scene, and couldn't wait to hear what he had to say.  Mr. Jameson rocked.  To sum, I loved this movie.  And I hate comic books."
"JKT-2","Null","0","0","29 April 2004"," FWIW I really enjoyed the movie
","***WARNING! Contains spoilers***<br/><br/>I've been a Spider-man comic fan for years and I was not at all disappointed with the movie, despite all the (dare I say ""necessary"") changes from the original.<br/><br/>It was certainly a vast improvement of the 1978 travesty ""The Amazing Spider-man"" with Nicolas Hammond (I mean, he's supposed to have the *proportionate* strength of a spider and nearly rips an arm out of its socket falling four floors - oh, pu-leeese!  And he nearly got wasted by wholly *human* adversaries!)<br/><br/>Our modern spidey is more at home in the air - later in the movie when he's had a bit of practice.  It's more like the comics - the leaping and bounding, diving off high buildings *secure* in the knowledge he has the ability to catch himself.  And he can take the rigors of his unique modes of transport without straining himself.<br/><br/>He also had a worthy villain, a real menace with strength and speed fit to challenge Spidey's own.<br/><br/>To me, that's how Spiderman should be: strong, agile, confident, fast and totally in his element - and battling supervillains.<br/><br/>Raimi did a great job with this movie.  He captured the essence of Spiderman.<br/><br/>Parker/Spiderman progresses well from the gawky, geeky nerd to the budding hero intent on catching his Uncle's killer - excellent *ungainly* web-slinging as he's rapidly trying to learn how to swing through the streets whilst in hot pursuit - to the polished acrobatic leaps, swings and fighting of the fully-fledged and airborne hero.<br/><br/>I loved the casting.  Maguire was excellent as both Peter Parker and Spiderman, both pre- and post-transformation;  Dafoe was a good strong villain (vitally important in any movie, c.f. the Penguin in Batman 2 who was so weak I felt Batman was mean to pick on him - no slur on DeVito's acting ability, I think the way the Penguin was written was inadequate for a major villain), and he was delightfully tragic when he learned Spidey's true identity; Dunst was great as MJ, she even looked like some of the artists portrayed her in the comics; Simmons was a world-class choice for J. Jonah Jamieson, right down to the hair-style (JJJ was reputedly voted as having the worst hairstyle in comicdom - hard to believe considering the original Doc Ock's ""bowl-cut""), loved the ""I trust my barber"" line; Harris made a delightful and believable Aunt May and Franco was an excellent Harry Osborn - he even *looked* like he could be Dafoe's son.<br/><br/>Now to the changes: The original Spiderman was bitten by a radioactive spider.  I recall an interview with Stan Lee in which he said he chose radioactivity as it was the big fear in the 60's when Spiderman was created.  GE is the bugbear of the 90's/00's and the modern Parker is bitten by a GE spider - a nice bit of modernising to make the ""threat"" more appropriate to this era and it better explains the mixed spider abilities than radioactivity can - three very different spiders had a part in Spiderman's creation.<br/><br/>The web glands in the wrist, a la ""Spiderman 2099"" (for those who read the comics), are more believable than the manufactured web shooters of the original comics - I always wondered how those tiny wristlets could hold enough fluid for Spidey to do all that web-slinging.  Spiders manufacture their silk from the proteins they consume; in the movie, so does Spiderman. It also helps explain the variable properties of the web strands - he can make and deploy to order.<br/><br/>Gobby's outfit:  Not as flexible in the face as the original but easily explained - the armoured suit goes with the prototype military glider and it's established by Norman's decor that he collects masks - the suit looks like something he put together out of what he had.<br/><br/>Spidey's updated outfit looks cool.  I also loved the way he at first made do with a hastily constructed outfit and only made the proper suit when he decided to embark on his crime-fighting career.<br/><br/>I was worried that they would go too ""comicky"" and animate the eyes of the mask but they didn't (the one thing that bugs me in comics is that the artists tend to ""morph"" the costume to display emotion)<br/><br/>The scene with the robber:  In the comics, Spiderman was raking in the dough on TV in wrestling bouts and then acts like a pompous tosser (sorry, Stan) when the crook robs the place.<br/><br/>In the movie, we have Parker getting stiffed by the fight's organiser and so he has scant sympathy when the robber takes the dough - his motives in letting the robber go are more understandable.  Hell, I'd let the crook get away!<br/><br/>Big Ticks: The way they got most of the classic Spiderman poses - there are shots straight out of a comic panel.<br/><br/>The way they set up Harry to be the Goblin in a later movie - he now has the requisite hatred of Spiderman; all set to take up the mantle of the Goblin. I hope they bring Franco back for it.  Good to see he's in Spider-man 2.<br/><br/>Gobby's delightfully honest self-assessment on the bridge - ""You never know when some lunatic's going to come along and present you with a sadistic choice...""<br/><br/>Minuses: The CGI bits were a bit obvious, but so it goes with current technology - they will improve no doubt.  They are certainly an improvement over earlier special effects.  Perhaps more use could have been made of acrobats and wire-work but you can't have everything.<br/><br/>All those who thought the CGI bits sucked should track down the 1978 movie and watch it - they'd soon appreciate the progress that has been made.<br/><br/>Some of the comments criticise the characterisations - ""MJ was too weak, screaming alla time, not assertive enough"", ""Parker wasn't angry enough at Uncle Ben's killer and the Goblin"" etc.<br/><br/>FYI (as clearly shown in the movie) MJ lives in an abusive household from which she wishes to escape (become a star of the stage) or be rescued. Suddenly she is atop a tall bridge being abused yet again by a powerful and terrifying adversary.  You can't expect her to suddenly become ""Ms Rambo"" or ""Arlene Schwarznegger"" against the Goblin when she's terrified of her own father.<br/><br/>Parker's a ""bottler"".  He's been abused by his peers for years and now blames himself, not the robber/car-jacker, for his Uncle's death.  His anger and blame are bottled up inside him.  I suspect he fears to release his anger - especially now he has all those powers.<br/><br/>Aunt May says ""You're not Superman.""  And he's not Batman, either. Spiderman is an insecure teen suddenly invested with immense power that he dares not abuse.  Batman is a psychotic, anger-driven, vengeful man who trained himself over the years to make criminals pay for what happened to his parents.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the portrayals of the characters - they weren't 100% faithful to the comics, but no movie adaptation of another medium is ever 100% faithful. Raimi's respect for the subject matter ensured that the spirit was there and that the subject was treated as faithfully as possible within the constraints of the medium of motion picture.<br/><br/>On the whole, I give the movie full marks and look forward to Spiderman 2 (I note they've improved Doc Ock's hairstyle - but then, even a JJJ-style flat-top would do that).<br/><br/>I was entertained and it was more than I thought it would be (I did have reservations, especially after the '78 movie, about how it would be treated.)  I wanted a powerful Spiderman facing a powerful foe, and I got it - along with the bonus of believable characterisations, some great in-jokes and some great classic Spidey stuff straight out of the comic books.<br/><br/>Allowing for the requisite amount of ""willing suspension of disbelief"" that accompanies any movie, especially those with fantasy or superhero elements, there was a ""realism"" about the movie I particularly enjoyed."

And what lame running in the balloon scene.  Peppy.<br/><br/>Oh and the villain. Uncle Ben would have played a better villain than the masked marauder. In the comics the villain becomes a monster but in the movie he just remains the same ! Oh but in this movie I am happy that they chose to make him that way because with this type of stupid CGI he would have made another of those Hulk thingies.<br/><br/>But the worst part of the film are the fights. Booorrriiinnnngg. Not one fight did I like and everytime a fight begins the audience with which I was in the theatre started booing after the second half.<br/><br/>How could they just do so ? So injust. And they totally changed the beginning from the original comic. Peter actually meets Doc Ock in the first part .But where was he . O yeah in the second one. Now where will they incorporate HIM ?<br/><br/>Everytime I watched the movie I hoped that its sequel would alter Spidey's future. But low. After watching the trailer I realised one thing. 99% will be boring stupid and filthy CGI .And for those who are able to recognise it will be another one in the basket, the waste basket.<br/><br/>Well we'll just hope for the best, and pray they follow atleast some part of the original comics, shall we ?"

","**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>First off, lets get something out of the way.  Where has Tobey Maguire been hiding?  He's very cute indeed . . . and a brilliant Peter Parker.  The opening scenes before he got bitten really highlighted his vulnerability as a science geek, bullied by the 'in crowd' kids.  His transformation into Spiderman was sensitively done as well, balancing his joy at having something that he could be good at, with the isolation of being so dramatically different to his peers.  The romance between Peter and MJ was nicely handled as well, although I really think that she makes him jump through hoops for it.  MJ knows that Peter loves her and she treats him like a security blanket.  In a way, I was quite glad when he told her he didn't love her at the end of the film.<br/><br/>OK, those were the good things.  Now the bad.  Willem Defoe.  I think he may have been channelling Raul Julia throughout filming.  If anyone ever saw the truly abysmal StreetFighter film, they'll know what I'm talking about.  A ridiculous caricature.  And what was with that costume?  Defoe is a fine actor, but there's little that even Olivier could have done with a costume that reveals only one's eyes through yellow plastic.  I agree with many others in that there was far too much CGI in the film, and it didn't always look good.  Hopefully, they'll rectify that for the next one.  And as for the 'you mess with Spidey, you mess with all of us' stuff -  I'm not even going to say anything.  Mainly because I don't want to get flamed by all the fundamentalist gung-ho Yanks out there.  Is that clear enough?<br/><br/>Overall, a great couple of hours entertainment, romance, action, teen angst, almost everything you could want.  A great start to a franchise.  But if you want to see a comic book to movie adaptation done brilliantly, go and see the first two batman films."

","Although I am not terribly fond of spiders (or arachnids, for that matter), I am a big fan of the ""Ultimate Spider-Man"" comic books from Marvel as well as some of the issues from even before ""Ultimate Spider-Man"" came out. I heard a lot about the big-screen version of Spidey, and finally, when the movie came out on video some time ago, my mother bought it for me and I watched it immediately, and I was surprised at how well this film turned out.<br/><br/>Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a high-school nerd who lives with his aunt and uncle (Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris) in New York, is best friends with rich boy Harry Osborn (James Franco), and is head-over-heels in love with the beautiful Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), who happens to be his next-door neighbor. One day during a field trip to Columbia University where scientists have created fifteen genetically-enhanced spiders, one of the spiders escapes and bites Peter on the hand. Soon, Peter gains the proportionate strength, speed, and agility of a spider, and decides to use his powers to win some money at a wrestling match. When his uncle is murdered by a thug he failed to stop earlier, Peter learns the hard way the true meaning of his uncle's earlier advice to him (""with great power comes great responsibility""), and utilizes his powers to protect the people of New York as Spider-Man. At the same time, Harry's industrialist father Norman (Willem Dafoe) experiments with a human performance enhancer on himself and becomes the homicidal Green Goblin, who then challenges Spidey's vow to fight crime and the good of all.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film, and there has been nothing like it since maybe either ""Superman"" or ""Batman"". Tobey Maguire does an excellent job as Spider-Man and his alter-ego Peter Parker, who, to me, is Clark Kent blended with Jimmy Olsen. Willem Dafoe steals the show as the psychotic, glider-flying Green Goblin with an air of psychotic wittiness that is matched only by Christopher Walken (it should be interesting to note that Dafoe starred with Walken in the film ""New Rose Hotel""; maybe Dafoe picked up a few pointers from Walken. Hmmm...). Kirsten Dunst is fine as Peter's true love who fights for herself in one scene, then becomes the standard ""damsel-in-distress"" (no offense meant to her, though). The rest of the cast does fine in their roles, but it is the excellent musical score (courtesy of Danny Elfman) and the story itself that make this film worth a look (or as many looks as you want). ""Spider-Man"" is a great film, and one of the best films ever made.<br/><br/>In my humble opinion, I give ""Spider-Man"" a 10 out of 10 on a scale of 1-10."

"Fenrir-5","Null","0","0","29 December 2003"," Spider Dork
","After watching Spiderman, I guess I can see why a lot of people liked it. It has most of the ingredients: an intriguing fiction, likeable characters, and over-the-top villains. But the problem is that all of this stuff comes right from the comic book, and the movie doesn't add anything to the mix.<br/><br/>I guess in the end I just can't believe Tobey Maguire can do a backflip.<br/><br/>Even before I knew the guy had back trouble - a fact revealed during headline negotiations for the sequel - I just didn't think him athletic. I felt kind of bad for Tobey when he took off his shirt to show his new, spider-enhanced physique. Still so very, very puny. If you were in grave danger would you want this morose, wiry individual showing up to rescue you?<br/><br/>I imagine this is how I would have felt had another casting atrocity, the purported selection of Nicolas Cage to star as Superman in an attempted revival of that serial, had somehow burrowed its way into the light of day. I was already sufficiently outraged by musing my way through Michael Keaton as Batman. Michael Keaton? Nicolas Cage? Tobey Maguire? Why must superheroes now be short, bent men with jowls and hangover beards?<br/><br/>The superhero genre has been crying for a new star since Christopher Reeve had that horrible accident. Yep, Superman IV. The whole paralyzation thing didn't help matters either. Since then it's nothing but self-proclaimed auteurs slumming. The meek demeanor, the muttered punchline, the complete lack of any form of physical authority - that may work just fine when you're looking for some character-acting Oscar in some costume drama about dancing orphans. But it doesn't make a good superhero. Who wants to root for such dorks?<br/><br/>Everyone says to me that this is something we should applaud, that Peter Parker was a dork in the comic series and thus should be in the movie. But in the comics, which I read quite frequently for free in the Long Beach K&B, did not play up Parker's geekiness. It wasn't a badge he wore. The reason he seemed so uncool was because we knew what he was capable of. And the important point was that if you looked closely enough at this guy you would see that he was a hero.<br/><br/>I think that's where Christopher Reeve really nailed his role. When I was a kid and I saw SuperMan, I thought he was a cool guy. He's 6'4', he's strong, and the chicks loved him. Who doesn't want to be like that? In contrast, what fun is it to watch some dork like Maguire whine about his posture?<br/><br/>The rest of the cast isn't much better. I am no big fan of Kirsten Dunst. I have never understood the attraction. She's just a plump, plain-looking blonde with bad teeth. I don't think those are horrible qualities, but is it really worth applauding? She sleepwalks through her scenes with incredibly fake looking red hair, a dim smile on her face as if she didn't keep her eye on her drink at a frat party.<br/><br/>Willem Defoe, an actor whom I used to like, just creeps me out as the Goblin. There's something lizardlike about him. I think he'd make the perfect Gollum. We are forced to endure another shirtless wimp scene from Defoe. He does this in a lot of movies. It always looks like he's flexing really, really hard; like he's trying to _act_ muscle onto his chest. Poor guy. He's just so stringy, like a free-range chicken. And he has gotten really campy in his old age. I remember how much he stunk up `Boondock Saints', and from sheer good will I was willing to blame it on the director. Guess I was wrong.<br/><br/>Despite bad casting, there are other factors to keep the movie from being a success. All of the scenes seem to share the exact same lighting. This is particularly apparent on SpiderMan who is the bumpiest, shiniest 3D model I have ever seen. The whole thing looks very stagey - there is no feel of grit or reality to it. It's like watching a bunch of comic geeks re-enact some fan fiction they wrote and taped with their mom's camera. The direction just isn't exciting, and I don't feel like I'm watching a story as much as I am watching a re-enactment of a story. I am a big fan of Sam Raimi, but somehow he doesn't get it right this time.<br/><br/>The effects are uniformly horrible. When the CGI takes over it is blatant. Even the concepts for the effects are lame. When Peter caught all of Mary Jane's food on her plate a part of me died. It's so mundane and cutesy and looked so fake. All of the Green Goblin scenes felt like watching an episode of the Power Rangers. It's just cheap to have _two_ stars who fight only when they have completely obscured their faces. I guess I can just sense an outsourced fight. I picture Defoe eating a hot dog and Maguire getting a chiropractic house call in his trailer while these two stuntmen duke it out in Taiwan. So who should we root for: Quong, the sweaty stuntman in the Power Ranger suit, or Yubang in the Spiderman pajamas?<br/><br/>But the formula is well in stride so now we will have to endure a sequel to this travesty written by none other than `I'm gay, so give me an award' Michael Chabon. Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse."

","This was by far the greater financial success of the two. However, if you want satisfying action scenes, a truer emotional impact, and by far a more interesting take on a comic book hero then Hulk is the one to watch. Raimi directs well, and the first half is amusing and uplifting. However the action scenes are disappointing, the poor CGI sticks out like a sore thumb, and the climax is woeful. This ranks well behind the first two Superman films, Batman Returns, Batman itself and possibly Superman III when it comes down to just the fun of it. The first main trailer was good though."

","** 1/2 out of ****<br/><br/>Not too long ago, I was a rather avid fan of the Spider-Man comics, always anxiously awaiting each month to see what new catastrophe our webbed hero would have to face. I stopped keeping track of the stories after the ""clone saga"" mess, which is simply one of the worst cases of ""overblown"" I've ever read. Then I heard news about a Spider-Man movie, which quickly became reality. It was an event I was neither looking forward to nor dreading. Unsurprisingly, it's a movie that I felt neither unbridled enthusiasm for nor utter disdain. It's about as middling as a decent movie can be.<br/><br/>High school student Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy amateur photographer who's bitten by a radioactive spider, consquently being endowed with arachnid-like powers. He has super-strength, can jump great distances, and maybe best of all, he's got a spider-sense that warns him of danger. With these new abilities, his first acts are only thinking of himself, generally trying to make as much money as possible with his strength and agility.<br/><br/>But when Peter's uncle is killed by a robber, he realizes that ""with great power comes great responsibility."" Haunted by his uncle's death, he goes about as a crimefighter, dressed in a red and blue costume, calling himself Spider-Man. A new, even more powerful foe called the Green Goblin arrives on the NYC scene, causing a lot of destruction in hopes of...well, that's not really clear. Meanwhile, Peter has to balance out his crimefighting with his personal lives, particularly with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), a redhead he's got a crush on.<br/><br/>The very core of Spider-Man's biggest problem is its casting. While Willem Dafoe is terrific as Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin and J.K. Simmons is a wonderful J. Jonah Jameson, almost every major character is miscast. Tobey Maguire is a mixed bag as Peter Parker. When he concentrates on the dilemma of the mixed lives he has to juggle on-screen alone (or with Dafoe), he's very good, but comes across totally flat when he actually interacts with his co-stars, particularly James Franco and Kirsten Dunst.<br/><br/>Speaking of Franco and Dunst, how can these two be so charmless and without emotion? Franco does little more than brood, making one wonder why the more chipper Parker would even hang out with such a guy in the first place (Harry Osbourne was different personality-wise in the comics). Kirsten Dunst is the worst bit of comic book-to-film miscasting since George Clooney as Batman. Mary Jane Watson, arguably the most important character in Parker's life, is now little more than a grating redhead who lacks a discernible personality beyond constant superhero doting.<br/><br/>For all that's wrong with the portrayal of those major characters, the origin story is really rather well done. Truth be told, I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit until Parker suited up as Spider-Man. The character's first CGI appearance is just a total distraction. Perhaps it was unavoidable, but the action scenes look more like cartoons than physical, death-defying showdowns. Unconvincing CGI was probably inevitble, but that doesn't mean I have to accept it.<br/><br/>The movie also blows it in regards to the Green Goblin's motives. True, he initially wanted revenge against the board members that voted against him, but what about after that? Maybe the Goblin aspect of Osbourne's personality is power-hungry, but then again, all the Goblin ever does is blow stuff up. Maybe he just likes to see stuff blow up. If so, that's one of the laziest and lousiest villainous motives I've heard to date.<br/><br/>Truthfully, not every aspect of the movie's central story or the action is as bad as I make it out to be. (moderate spoiler in this sentence) The dichotomy of the hero and villain is fairly interesting and their final mano-a-mano to the death is rather rousing, even if it ends on an idiotic note (was the Goblin trying to intentionally kill himself in the process of killing Spider-Man?)(he didn't have to get up like he did). But damn, those goofy CGI stuntmen and half-bad acting really put a downer on what should have been an exciting and touching summer blockbuster."

","...and does Raimi live up to that responsibility? Oh yeah. God, it took me an age of jumping through hoops to see this film, but it was worth it. I'm pleasantly surprised by Raimi (i didn't like those Evil Dead films at all) but here i find that he's more than capable of handling small-scale character drama in an empathic and deeply compassionate way. In fact, he seems very much more comfortable dealing with the film as a straightforward character drama than an out-and-out superhero flick, and the first hour of the film, before anybody gets superpowers or becomes world-conquering megalomaniacs, is inargueably the strongest segment of the film. It's spellbinding.<br/><br/>The drawback, of course, is that the action sequences, though technically flawless, never seem to engage as much as the quieter moments. The Green Goblin basically accomplishes his goals halfway through, and the film lacks any urgency after that. While that could be forgivable in the context of a simple character piece, in an action film it's undeniably a flaw. Adding insult to this injury is the fact that Maguire and Defoe light up the screen when they act together as Peter and Norman, but never quite reach those heights when beating the tar out of each other as Green Goblin and Spider-man.<br/><br/>It's all forgivable, though, in the context of such an absorbing piece of fantasy cinema. There's too many wonderful pros to this film to spend time worrying about the cons. See Peter's heartwarming relationship with his Aunt, and how they cope with the loss of his Uncle together. See the almost sibling rivalry that intrudes on Peter's relationship with his best friend, Harry, as his relationship with Harry's Father grows stronger. And special mention must be made of Maguire's chemistry with Dunst. Kudos to all concerned for not shying away from MJ's (how to put this politely?)... outgoing, extra-friendly nature. She's no Madonna, but she's no whore either. Nice to see.<br/><br/>You might think this is an action-packed hollywood blockbuster, but really, it's not. It's something older, less cynical and more beautiful. Something steeped in garishly-tinted ink and cheap, pulpy paper. There's something in this film that lets you spend two hours believing that there's something in every ordinary person that's bigger than they know. That every second, we're asked to live up to our own responsibilities, and that if we just did, everything would finally be all right. This isn't a film about violent, angry, wisecracking men killing bad guys. It's a film that believes in heroes. Heroes all around us. Give it a chance, and it'll make you believe, too."

","I liked watching this movie because it had something that many other actions movies lack. I can't name it but there is definitely something. I think it was great that they chose Tobey Maguire to play Spiderman/Peter Parker. He looks so innocent and sweet yet he can take out the bad guys. Tobey Maguire was awesome as Spiderman and I can't picture anyone else playing Spiderman. I like Willem Dafoe (I can't spell his name too well) as the Green Gobler. He was the absolute perfect villain.       I have always been somewhat of a fan of Kirsten Dunst. She was great in Bring It On as well as Small Soldiers. She's a very talented actress and she was great in this movie. I heard that they were considering Tara Reid and Kate Hudson for the role of Mary Jane. Nah. Kirsten's the perfect Mary Jane. Aside from the awesome performances in the movie, one thing caught my eyes when I watched it again and again and that were th many goofs in the movie. I saw an abundance while I was watching but tell me something, who goes to the movies to spot goofs when there's a mystical web slinger sailing through the air. Nobody. This movie was definitely the best action movie of 2002. I admire all the people who worked hard to make this movie what it is. A lot of other movies could follow the example of magnificent film making like Spiderman (stupid movies in particular like Mission Impossible II and XXX). Spiderman gets your adrenaline pumping as you wait in anticipation for some other spectacular action sequence that is about to come. The movie was perfect in every sense I'd say. This movie was released in Trinidad about a month after it was released in the US. There was a big rush but I got in and I was glad because Spiderman did not disappoint me. I was thoroughly with this movie. It left me wanting to see it again and again and again and again. I loved the special effects. That's one of the things that attracts me about movies, the special effects. I liked the shots where it looked like you were getting a view from Spiderman's eyes of how he swung down from the buildings through the traffic and back up again.

It started out as a pretty humble plot, like something we could all relate to. A teenage kid with only one friend trying to fit in with the world, but the only conversations he can start are ones about science which not many people care about. Then he got superpowers in the simple way of a radioactive spider biting him. I especially like this movie because of how it knew where it was going, and all of the things in it were there for a reason. I especially think of this when Peter/Spider-Man realizes if he would have stopped that criminal, he would have saved his uncle.<br/><br/>He sure did mean it when it kept saying, ""This is my gift. This is my curse"" contrasting on his battle with the Green Goblin killed his best friend's father, and now he wants revenge on Spider-Man. It was also funny especially with the newspaper guys that wanted to get pictures of SM. The battle sequences with the Green Goblin were good, especially when SM stopped him by ripping the engine out of his flying thing (clever). TGG was a colorful villian, who fought with his human counterpart, making us wonder if he really was a seperate being or not.

","I saw Spider-Man on May 5, 2002 and I got to say that I was surprised that director Sam Raimi did a good job transiting a popular comic book to the big screen. Not since Batman or Superman has there been a movie about a great comic book hero. Spider-Man tells the story of Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), a timid and shy student who is picked on and has feelings for Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but doesn't have the confidence to tell her how much he loves her; until one day when Peter and his classmates go to the New York laboratory. That is where Peter is bitten by a radio-active spider which weakens him for a while and all of a sudden he has super-strength within himself. How our hero starts out as Spider-Man is from the comics with his Uncle Ben(Cliff Robertson) droping off Peter at the library, but instead he decides to go behind his uncle's back and goes to fight at the wrestling for money. After a robbery, Peter has no choice but to go after the suspect and that is where he starts out as Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Just like every movie there is a villain, and the bad guy is Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin(Willem Defoe) after an accident in the laboratory. Now Green Goblin wants to go after Spider-Man and hurt those along the way.<br/><br/>Here are the pros and cons.<br/><br/>Pros: Finally, Spider-Man gets to come to the big screen where Tobey Maguire does a wonderful job of playing the timid Peter Parker with those boyish looks. Kirsten Dunst is a marvel as the lady in distress where her chemistry with Maguire works as if they were meant to be together. Willem Dafoe is still creepy off his ""Shadow of the Vampire"" persona as the Goblin where he manages to ham up more scenes than Nicholson's Joker.<br/><br/>Cons: The first hour works fine with the human effects until the second hour where the special effects dominates of not caring for a plot or any of the other characters. Most of the action sequences from a far away shot looks fake as if there's no weight or dimension. Not even the supporting characters have much screen time where it just leaves Maguire and Dafoe.<br/><br/>Overall, a pretty decent film. Spider-Man proves to be a worthy comic book movie for fans of the books or the hero.<br/><br/>The film also stars James Franco as Harry Osborn, Rosemary Harris as Aunt May, and J.K. Simmons as J.J. Jameson."

","I'm always wary of movies based on comic books. There have been good ones  Ghost World, Batman, Blade  but the track record is not good. Spiderman is one of the good ones, maybe even one of the great ones. Director Sam Raimi hit the right balance between action and story, between reality and fantasy. Raimi has a steady hand with story  just rent A Simple Plan if you're not convinced  and knows about action and special effects from his Evil Dead days. He has crafted an old fashioned super-hero movie that made me nostalgic for the days of Christopher Reeves as Superman. I would quibble with the decision to put a Green Goblin mask on Willem Dafoe. Why cover up his expressive face with a cheesy looking mask? Dafoe could have been more effective and twice as scary had we been able to actually see his face. Tobey McGuire is nails the socially inept Peter Parker, putting a human face on the superhero that is very charming."

","Spider-Man is not a very good movie. I expected much more. It's written by David Koepp, who has made some brilliant work in his career (Jurassic Park, Stir of Echoes, Panic Room), but although the dramatic tones in the story are good and the movie moves along nicely, it's the over-acting by Dafoe, that at times makes me gringe in my seat. When he's Osborne, it's done with style, but when he becomes The Green Goblin, that's when we start to go way over board. Sadly, Raimi's direction is not also all it could be. Plus, it irritates me how this film is forcefully trying to restore confidence in New Yorkers (and I guess in Americans in general), by the bridge scene, for example. When you hear someone scream ""You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us!"", it really sounds overly melodramatic. And Poor. Just like Harrison Ford in Air Force One. The bad communists have attacked on America, but don't worry, our fair president will kick the living s**t out of them. USA! USA! Well, ""when in Rome.."" i guess. I must hand it to Raimi, that it was a masterstroke to cast Maguire in the role of Parker. He's the most promising new talent to hit Hollywood. Knowing that, it makes me sick to think that such coverboy as Freddie Prince Jr. was actually considered at one time. Oh well, in the end, Spider-man is good for viewing or two.

I remember seeing it in the theater thinking that looked great and loved the Green Goblin, but the script is so powerful and well written that every time I watch this movie it helps me see past the beautiful effects and awesome action, and actually listen to every line of the movie. This is the first movie in years that I have seen (action or not) that has been released that every line of the movie is very important to the movie, not just there as a filler or due to bad writing or directing.<br/><br/>The relationship between all of the characters is amazing, the closeness and the distance is so powerful that it alone makes the movie awesome. Watching Norman slowly but steadily turn insane thru the movie, his hatred for Spiderman but respect for Peter over his own son, Harry loving Mary Jane but Mary Jane loving Peter, every line from Peter's aunt and uncle, just a movie that that you have to see several times to really appreciate. How often do you see a movie that you can say this about. Also I loved how you see green every time you see Norman or the Goblin.<br/><br/>Lastly I will not say who my favorite character was but I will finish with this quote from the movie; The itsy Bitsy Spider went up the water spout, Down came the goblin and took the spider out!

"Old Joe","Null","0","0","18 May 2003"," Did this comic book hero come to life? I am not so convinced!
","In my 24 years on this planet, I have seen many comic book heroes that have come to life', within the realms of a movie. I felt that Superman' was brought well to the bigscreen. Then the fuss that was made about the 1989 release of Batman' was needed, as the film deserved its high rating in my view. Then in 2002 we have the big blockbuster of Spiderman. This is one of the most popular comic book heroes. Now he has crawled onto our screens and spun his web, to win over millions of fans around the world.<br/><br/>Young New York teenager Peter Parker is a geek. He isn't popular at school, he likes science, and doesn't have many friends. Nothing seems to be going his way until one fateful trip to Osborn technologies changes everything. When Peter is bitten by a radioactive spider, he gains super strength, a spider sense', the ability to stick to walls, and organic webspinners. With his newfound powers, he becomes Spider-man, and through a great tragedy learns an important life lesson: With great power, comes great responsibility!<br/><br/>To say that Spiderman' the movie was a little disappointing, for me is an understatement. I first of all want to say how much of a let down the script of this movie was. While I will admit that it tried, some of the language used did have the desired effect on me. Then take the love story' that was presented here. Instead of making it a great part of this film, I felt I halted the progress of it, as it made the story jump all over the place. I hope the script of the next Spider-man movie is much better than what the first movie's was.<br/><br/>Then take the stars of this show. Tobey McGuire was a good choice as Peter Parker / Spider-man. I found him to be the perfect klutz', as the nerdy Peter Parker, then as he becomes our superhero', the transformation he puts on is excellent. Tobey McGuire is a Spider-man fan, so being the movie lead in this film was great for him. Yet his archenemy, the Green Goblin', was a character that was not human enough for me. He was played by veteran actor William Defoe. This was the crazy character of this film, and while it was trying to be scary in parts, for me it did not have the right effect. Instead, I feel it was taken straight from a comic book. That is not what I feel makes a great baddie'. The people in conjunction with this film should have looked at how well the Batman movie made the Joker' come to life way back in 1989. That is how I like to see the bad guys come to life in comic book movies.<br/><br/>Other members of this cast include the stunning Kirsten Dunst. She portrayed the likable Mary Jane Watson. She was a great choice as this character, as I found her to be a bubbly and a very attractive girl. Unfortunately the script did not allow her to be the character that I thought she would be. Perhaps this is a good thing, but I would have liked her to be not jumping from one guy to another, which I can tell you does happen. Add in the good choice of Ben Parker and Aunty May, who were played by Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris, who I thought were very good. So was the role of Harry Osborn, acted by James Franco. Harry was another character trying to win over Mary Jane. I hope all these actors return for the next movie. <br/><br/>There were certain parts to this film that I did and did not like. For instance I found the costume of our superhero to be such an attractive' outfit. This was adopted well from the comic books. I also enjoyed how our hero spins his web. This is one of the good special effects. Yet I did not like most of spideys' climbing sequences. They seem to be almost comic like', which for me did not satisfy what I hoped they would be. It was as if they were taken straight out of a comic book. This is one area that this movie definitely fell down in. This is where I believe the director of spider-man should have jumped in and made this film a lot more human, as this was his job in my view. Sam Raimi did a fairly good job, but I wished he changed certain aspects of this film, because Spider-man then might have been a great blockbuster'.<br/><br/>Look I am sure if I was a young kid presented with watching this movie in the cinema, I would, pardon the pun, jump at the chance. Yet as an adult, I am a lot more critical of movies and need more satisfaction in different cinematic areas. Spider-man was a classic comic book hero, yet for me this movie did nothing to make his legend even greater. Then again this movie works because it gets bums on seats in the cinema, the merchandise to buy is huge, and is a childhood favourite. Yet for me, this film, while it is a blockbuster, I am one critic who would debate whether it deserved that status or not. Get caught in the web of your friendly neighbourhood, Spider-man'. <br/><br/>CMRS gives Spiderman': 2 (Okay Film)"

","This was a great first movie.  With all due respect to Superman, this was probably the best of the 'modern' superhero movies.  And it will probably stay that way.  I really don't see the Hulk as quite the draw that Spider-Man is.  And the Spider-Man sequels can't live up to the original. No matter how good they are, they can't.  You just can't beat the story of the origin of the superhero.  This is where Batman got it so wrong. Granted, it wasn't completely the fault of Batman's writers.  His origin is not as good a story in terms of making a movie around it since he didn't really become Batman until many years after the incident that led to it.<br/><br/>Spider-Man has always been my favorite superhero for many reasons.  One was that it has the guts to be set in New York City.  Not Metropolis.  Not Gotham.  So we have no worries about why the Statue of Liberty or Grand Central Station has been moved from New York to this other city.  Another reason is that Peter Parker is a reluctant superhero.  He basically is only helping people out of guilt.  That brings a definite human character/weakness to him, which makes it more real.  Like many people with this gift, his first thought was not ""How can I help mankind.""  It was ""How can I use this to make money.""  My other main reason for preferring Spider-Man was changed for this movie.  I was a little mad at first, but I got over it.  Spider-Man got by with his brains.  I still don't see why he couldn't have invented his web shooter as he does in every other incarnation.  I'm just not accepting that it would be far fetched for a teenager to do it.  No more far fetched than anything else in the movie. And they could have simply worked it into the plot that the spider powers HELPED him invent the web formula.  Possibly having the formula come to him in a dream.<br/><br/>But that was really the only problem I had with the movie.  I didn't mind the DNA-enhanced spider rather than a radioactive one.  The original idea was definitely born in a different era where the effects radioactivity were obviously unknown.  It seems comical now, but 60 years ago it wasn't totally unbelievable that a side effect to exposure to radiation could be to ENHANCE the body rather than harm it.  Plus, the whole genetic engineering brings Spider-Man into the 21st Century.<br/><br/>I look forward to the sequels, but do not expect it to live up to the original."

The emotional climax hinges on this pseudo father-son relationship, yet the film doesn't develop it well. There are moments, glimpses of it, but not enough. The first time, it didn't dawn on me that Peter's real choice was between Ben Parker and Norman. I mean, what had we been shown to indicate that he even admired Norman, aside from having read his work?<br/><br/>Anyway, I've always found the Green Goblin overrated, and I'm looking more forward to other villains.<br/><br/>That said, it's a great movie, great effects, killer first half, good second half."

While on a field trip, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is bitten by a genetically modified spider and soon finds himself having unexplainable powers.  After his grandfather is killed, he decides to use his super natural powers to save New York City from evil. The citizens praise him, while the press and police try to uncover him.   Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), a high school pupil, is often the object of intent, for she is always in trouble.  Peter Parker is infatuated with Mary Jane Watson, but too shy to admit it. He uses Spiderman to try and win her over, yet the plan back fires when she falls in love with Spiderman--not Peter Parker.   Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), or otherwise known as the `Green Goblin,' is Spiderman's opponent working against him to destroy the world. The public soon turns against Spiderman and blames him for evil.   Spiderman continues to fight for peace and justice, and the citizens of New York City soon recognize him as a hero. The graphics were well done, and the characters were satisfactory. However, an all time favorite super hero has been brought back into the pictures. The American beloved cartoon hero, originally from the nineteenth century, has touched the hearts and dreams of children all over again.  This movie is for children of all ages and most adults will enjoy it also.  I believe with the story line that we will be seeing a sequel in the future or possible the cartoons to be aired again.

This movie stayed true to the story with only a few minor changes here and there. The acting was very solid, the scenery was great and the Spider-Man costume wasnt really altered from the comic....unfortunately the Green Goblin's was. I was hoping there wouldnt be a cheesy approach to this movie like the last few Batman's, but this was one of the better comic movies. To me the best were the original Tim Burton Batman and X-Men. The effects were okay...it seemed like they got better at the end. They didnt seem as fake as in other points in the movie. Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin is the definite winner in this movie. He is so dead on and sadistic that he stole the show. After the success of X-Men and Spider-Man you can see that all the comic books will have movies soon. Daredevil is out, Hulk is coming soon, X2, which so far has looked great, is out next month, The Punisher will begin shooting soon, Ghost Rider and a bunch of others.

In my opinion, this movie with the role of introducing Spider-Man to the big production silver screen could not have been done much better. Tobey Maguire is a talented actor, but I really didn't think I would like him in this role. Well, he pulled it off. Well done Tobey.

The film is not without its faults; Willem Dafoe is miscast as the Green Goblin (you do get the feeling that no-one else was available for the part), and the plot certainley is not Oscar worthy, although it does work very, very well in the movie. And the final climax is a little dissapointing. But these are minor hindrances on a film which really has set the benchmark for forthcoming superhero/adventure movies.<br/><br/>The visual attractions of the film are immense, the elaborate scenes of Spiderman swinging through New York are groundbreaking, and Spiderman himself looks amazing, in all the web slinging scences through skyscrapers and bridges he looks very real.<br/><br/>So although it is by no means perfect, when a movie looks this damn cool with a lead performance of Maguire's quality, it leaves the audience in awe and with an immense amount of satisfaction.

Almost abused by special computer effects, the acting and story (at times) are what save this movie. It was pretty good, but it's the effects that weakens and strengthens this movie.

But I refused to let that bother me, as the movie is supposed to be fun, not thought provoking.<br/><br/>I didn't mind the hokey humor, because it captured the flavor of the comic book.  I thought all the dialogue, pacing and romance had a very comic book feel to it, which is what the movie was striving for.  So why did I not like it very much?<br/><br/>The sole reason lies in the special effects.  I'm not the biggest fan of CGI in general, but if it's done well (as in the astonishing STARSHIP TROOPERS, or even ATTACK OF THE CLONES) it can be very effective.  But the effects in SPIDER-MAN are so cartoonish and synthetic looking, it takes away from the fun for me, as opposed to adding to it.<br/><br/>The effects techinicians boast that almost all footage of Manhattan is computer generated, and that all the footage of Spider-Man leaping from building to building and swinging between them is computer generated. And therein lies the problem for me.  It just isn't exciting.  Because I'm all too aware that it's fake, and therefore cannot get lost in it.  It looks cool, and is fun to watch, but I was never at the edge of my seat with excitement, as I was watching SUPERMAN or BATMAN.  Their mixture of special effects and live action was balanced enough to constantly view the heroes as characters, even if they were filmed against a blue screen or shot with miniatures.  But when Spider-Man is swinging around, while the ""camera"" swoops through the city, it always looks like a cartoon, and the thrill is gone for me.<br/><br/>After THE MATRIX and STARSHIP TROOPERS, CGI no longer appeals much to me. I've seen it done before, and better, and more imaginatively.  Seeing animated figures doing acrobatics in midair just isn't ""amazing"" anymore. Watching SPIDER-MAN, I was reminded of an earlier Sam Raimi movie, DARKMAN. There is a scene in DARKMAN in which Liam Neeson (or at least his stunt double) is hanging from a cable underneath a helicoptor and soaring above the city.  The moment was so thrilling it gave me chills to watch.  Why? Because there was a real guy really hanging onto a real helicopter that was really flying a thousand feet over the city.  You cannot beat realism when it comes to action in movies.  Special effects usually don't cut it.  I long for the days when movies like SHARKY'S MACHINE, BULLITT, FOR YOUR EYES ONLY and  HOOPER marvelled me with real-life, death defying stunt work. SPIDER-MAN and other CGI-heavy movies like it, are out to put yet another aspect of the industry out of business.  If you can replace make-up effects, production design and stunt work with CGI effects, who the hell needs people?"

Although these scenes had great emotion and depth and really defined the characters, I think they should have put equal amount of time and effort towards the action. Some of the action is laughable.

I thought that when you put together such a high budget and expectations on a movie you should be obliged to, at least, do something really great. Sam Raimi didn't achieve what he should have achieved. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad movie, it just isn't likely to make you believe that Spider-Man could be real. X-Men makes us believe that, Batman (the first two, that is) makes us believe that. Spider-Man doesn't. The CG character is only average quality for nowaday's standards and the acting is pretty basic. The plot seems to take a leap sometimes with no understandable reason and they have altered the comic-books so much that it hurts. If you want to make a comic-book movie you MUST obey the comic-book's rules. They made Peter Parker a wimp. They made him Clark Kent. I am a fan of the Spider-Man comic books and I am disappointed with this movie. It could have been so much better.

","What a relief the ""Superman"" movies didn't start off like this.  They manage a decent first half hour here with some good jokes and a fair set-up, but then things run drastically off course.  First off, the film is totally plotless.  For some twenty minutes McGuire just zips all over the city shouting with glee as he finds out what his new body can do.  The tone is much too goofy for what happens next, the carjack-death of his uncle.  The killer is quickly dispatched, paving the way for one of the more truly dumb villians in movie history.  It's a rich guy, who while testing a product, has things go wrong with it unleashing an evil alter ego of himself.  Big screw-up, creating an UNWILLING villian.  This guy has no passion for destruction or dominance like Lex Luthor or Jack Napier.  He's a man posessed by a being FORCING him to be bad.  Watching a villian not really want to pull of the stunts he's doing makes it hard to hate him.  To top it off, his side of the visual effects are extremely cheesy.  I absolutely DETEST CGI as it just looks totally false, which much of the film does. The Spidey stuff is fairly convincing, but the Goblin on his air thingy look completely phoney.  His zips around much too quickly like he's on fast forward, with bad backgrounds for his victims as they're dangled off balconies or buildings.  Throw in horribly outdated lines like ""We'll meet again, Spider-Man!"" and you've got a pretty lousy flick.  McGuire at least carries it nicely, though I feel he's way too young (more like Spider-BOY as his character is barely 18).  Dunst really breaks out in a very sexy role as I could look at her forever.  Everyone else is kind of bland and doesn't really stand out.  My biggest beef comes early on after McGuire discovers the powers.  Now imagine this: that in the original ""Superman"", when Clark discovers his powers, he enters a wrestling contest to make money to buy a car so he can impress a girl.  It would've totally ruined the film.  Well, that's what they did here!  They even dug up Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage and put him a steel cage with McGuire, killing any chance at an emotional dynamic in the film, and playing a lot of scenes for dumb jokes. THANKFULLY ""Superman 1 and 2"" did not take this route and gave us lots of drama to chew on.  This?  Lots of bubblegum nonsense to chew on."

They refused to go see this movie in the theaters with me, because they thought it would be too scary & they refused to watch it when I finally rented it & brought it home. I was a bit mystified, seeing as I thought Spider-man was a children's comic strip character.<br/><br/>Turns out the kids were right.  I need to learn to listen to them.  This movie is very scary.  The violence is graphic, disgusting, and bloody.  The characters, even some of the good guys, are mean and unfair to the point that I couldn't see why Spider-man didn't just collapse with despair.<br/><br/>Still, the acting is top notch.  Tobey Maguire shows incredible depth and versatility in this role.  Willem Dafoe & Kirsten Dunst are excellent as well. They all show a great deal of psychological complexity -- not at all cartoonish.  Of course, the psychological complexity makes it even more a movie for adults, rather than for kids.  <br/><br/>Unfortunately, despite being a great actor, Tobey Maguire is not particularly sexy, which was a bit disappointing for me.  I was kind of hoping to do some drooling.  <br/><br/>Overall, despite the fantastic acting, I can't say this was really a fun movie.  Possible spoiler:  it doesn't really have a happy ending, just a foreshadowing of all sorts of terrible, hopeless things to come.  I thought a comic strip movie ought to have a happy ending.

","1st watched  1/12/2003 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Sam Raimi): Well put together  playing of the Marvel comic book character and his beginnings by Director Raimi.  He made some very good choices in casting including the humble Tobey McGuire as soft-spoken Peter Parker(aka. Spider-man) , and Willem Dafoe as the nemesis Green Goblin.  As someone who was familiar with the original story it was good to see them not overdo it for the screen and pretty much followed the line of the original comic book. The special effects throughout the film was great with almost a video game feel when spider-man flies through the city.  The decision to make the Goblin almost like a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger-like villain is probably the weakest element of the film but this doesn't detract from the appeal of the film overall.  There is also a very well-done on-again off-again romantic element added with Parker, his best friend, Spider-man and the Kirsten Dunst character(kind of a 3 on 1 thing).  There is some very good dialogue spotted throughout the movie which also keeps you grinning and an obvious lead-in to a sequel is thrown in at the end(which is good for us fans.). And of course who can forget the TV theme song to end the film which was a nice added touch tying in another media and it's rendition of the source."

Peter Parker's first enemy was the green goblin but he didnt hunt mary jane, what he hunted was Gwen Stacy, spiderman's first love. Gwen died because of that as well. Spiderman never went into wrestling he went into tv in a show called ""The Amazing Spider Man"" his uncle ben though was killed at his house and parker saw the killer running away and didnt stop him because he felt he didnt need to. the other thing is that he was bitten by the spider not on a class field trip but at a public radiation experiment. i am sorry but as so-so as this plot is......it ruined the comic, and i cant wait to disect ""The Hulk"" and ""Daredevil"""

","This movie had a lot of fun and laughs in the beginning when Peter Parker, being the adolescent nerd tries to fit in with the rest of the kids in school.  Along with the discovery of his power and the not so direct path in learning how to use it, physically and mentally.   Including some immature attempt to make some money in order to buy a car so he could please Mary Jane.<br/><br/> The Development of the characters, including Peter Parker, from an innocent kid to this superhero was very well done.  As for the Green Goblin, he was portrayed well as this troubled scientist who had an alter-ego.  Too bad his costume masked his whole face, since pretty much all of his devious characterizations were portrayed through a mask that didn't animate.  We did get to see a little of the eyes later on though when he keep the mirrored googles in its opened position.  Jamson's character was the most colorful, it is as he is lifted straight out of the comic book.<br/><br/> The swinging sequences were quite unique, giving us a perspective from spidey himself.  The only scenery that has a grand portrayal is on the Queensborough Bridge.  I guess this movie didn't really aim for that.<br/><br/> Much of the scenes seemed way too dark, where it looks like it was filmed in a dark place, with dim lighting so the central action is not high lighted.  And if that was not enough, most were fast paced action.  What one ends up seeing is a whole bunch of dark blotches and blurs, making us have to guess what those scenes were about.<br/><br/> A scene I found too sappy is the one where Spider Man takes Mary Jane for a ride down the city via his spider webs.  Seems to be straight out of Superman during Loise Lane's first flight with superman.<br/><br/> To sum it up, an enjoyable superhero movie."

","I've been waiting for this movie since 1977 when I saw the 'Superman' film. My patience (as if I had any choice in the matter) was mostly worth the wait. 'Spider-Man' was fun, colorful and faithful to a great (and MY favorite) superhero.  When I heard that Tobey Maguire would play Peter Parker/Spiderman, I was skeptical.  However, I think he did a pretty good job.  My reaction to hearing that Kirsten Dunst would play Mary Jane was more optimistic, as in ""Wow!"" and ""Hoo-ahh!""  She was excellent.  A good action film MUST have a great villian and Willem Dafoe made for a magnificently, maniacal and menacing Green Goblin. Was I somewhat distracted that when Green Goblin talked his mask's mouth didn't move?  Yes.  I also had a few other comic fanboy quibbles.  For example: how long does it take for Spiderman's webbing to dissolve?  In some scenes in the movie, you're led to believe it lasts for hours, while at other times webbing would dissolve seconds after Spiderman shot it.  And what was with that scene at the cemetery?  I saw 'Spider-Man' on its opening weekend in a jam-packed theater.  When Peter told Mary Jane---the woman he says he's loved since they both were 6 years old---that he could only be her friend, some people in the audience actually booed and hissed!  I don't blame them.  That scene was lame.  As for Mary Jane's delayed reaction of softly touching her hand to her mouth: Puh-leez!  Did kissing Peter while he was STANDING next to her on a windy day feel the same as kissing Spiderman while he was HANGING upside-down on a rainy night?  Those points aside, I really did enjoy 'Spider-Man', as did my wife and my 13-year-old daughter. [WARNING: this movie is NOT for little children.  A few kids---about 4 to 6 years old---inside the aforementioned jam-packed theater started crying because they were so scared by the apartment fire scene and the final, bloody confrontation between the Green Goblin and Spiderman.  The children's parents had to escort them out of the theater.]  I waited 25 years for 'Spider-Man'.

Also Tobey Maguire might be the best casting decision since Ewan Macgregor as Obi-Wan.  This combination was setting the stage for an incredible experience.  Although I'm not much of a comic book fan, Spider-Man is my favorite comic book character.  So take all of this and what do you get?  A blockbuster with heart.  Not only is it a great movie, its a good movie.  It hit the large scale production but did not lose the personal touch of a small art house film.  I would not go so far as to compare this to an art house film, but the surprising heart this movie displays makes it seem that way. I cannot think of any weak points in this film.  Even the overwhelming campiness of the conversation between the Green Goblin and Spider-man is lost in the fun of the moment.  You can tell Raimi isn't used to filming a grand scale fight scene, but he pulls it off rather admirably.  I cannot say enough about how wonderful this film is, to the very basic elements, to the complicated ones.  Raimi thought this film through from beginning to end, and Macguire cemented himself as the ultimate troubled young adult actor. You can even take your girlfriend to go see this.

Wait, they prefer to call themselves the ""true"" fans.  You know the ones who regardless of how they make the film--these people will not be happy.  Even when the guy who made the thing is heavily involved and approves all creative decisions.<br/><br/> On the other side you have the people who know nothing about comic books, go into films like this and ask too many ""why"" questions and take it way too seriously.  And if the film is 'made' for fans, these people are lost because they drown in all their questions.  This is the person you want to slap and yell, ""The name of the movie is Spiderman for crying out loud--does it sound like a walk down realist lane?!""<br/><br/> Then there's the whole spectrum inbetween.  That's where I fall; I don't like comic books.  I've read less than 50 in my whole life, and not one of those was a Spiderman comic book.  Even without having read the original source, I still have a very solid idea of who Spidey is without knowing the whole backstory of every issue.  And I liked this treatment of the Spiderman formula.<br/><br/> Transferring from one medium to another translates to changes for effectiveness and story telling reasons. There's no such thing as a 'true to the book' film entirely; some are more liberal than others, but changes are inevitable.  Get over it or don't bother.  I'm a fan of Sam Raimi, Danny Elfman, and Willem Defoe.<br/><br/> Sam Raimi delivers the right tone and a unique, colorful, visual style to the film.  Appropriately placed since Spidey is more upbeat than most comic book heroes; like Burton did for Batman, Raimi delivers for Spiderman.  Well shot, well narrated, and pretty good editing as well.<br/><br/> Danny Elfman was born to do films like this.  No stranger to comic book film scores with Batman 1 & 2 and Darkman under his belt, Elfman's score has an evermoving reluctantly heroic score which bounces from one side of the spectrum to the other with its depths in darkness and bounciness in the more lighthearted moments.<br/><br/> Then there's Willem Defoe as the Green Goblin, probably one of my least favorite villains that I'm aware of, but Defoe gives the Goblin a menace that rivals what Jack Nicholson did with the role of the Joker in Batman. Defoe portrays insanity like very few can . . . maybe Kevin Spacey took pointers from him or vice versa?  Who knows.<br/><br/> The typical Raimi trademarks are greatly appreciated too--it just gives the film an extra touch having the Ted, Bruce, and the Classic pop up in the film."
"ironbutterfly","10","0","0","11 December 2002"," Great comic book film, but a little bit on the corny side.
","I believe that Spider-Man is the best comic book movie there is, but that is half compliment and half insult.  Superman, Batman, and X-Men all suffered from the same thing; they all had a weak plot.  Superman's ending was an utter cop out.  Batman really didn't have a plot if you think about it, it was just moody. X-Men was completely rushed and Magnito's plan for mutant acceptance or whatever he wanted was stupid.  Spider-Man had a much better plot (Still don't know what Green Goblin whole plan was. He already murdered his enemies, then what)but the dialog was corny.  That whole hospital scene where Peter talks to MJ needs to go. Plus, Harry and J Jonah Jamerson should had been in it more.  I don't know why Harry and Peter were hanging out together because in the movie I could clearly see that they really didn't like each other too much, but in the comic they were two peas in a pod. Peter's character should had been more like MTV's Daria/Chandler on Friends.  He wasn't funny at all in this movie and that made Peter stand out as a character other than he being the only normal/down to earth superhero in comicbook land (Standing Ovation to Stan Lee).  Also I did not like Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane.  I would have chosen Eliza Cuthbert from 24 or Sarah Michelle Gellar, but they seemed more of Gwen Stacy candidates than Mary Jane.  I had read the book version of the Spider-Man movie, and it is 10 times better than the actual movie, and it is based off of it. <br/><br/>
  The 9/11 stuff had to go as well.  I know it happened.  America knows it happened, so I don't need to be reminded of it in a super hero movie.  That was an extremely BAD mistake and it brought down the whole movie.<br/><br/>
   The music on further note was awful.  I have bad expectations for the Daredevil movie, but geez I heard some of the music to the soundtrack and it is 10 times better than Spider-Man's.  Danny Elfman totally failed me.  This is the person who brought us the theme to Batman and The Simpsons.  The trailer music by E.S. Posthumus should had been the theme song.   Next time get the composer from the Disney animated series ""Gargoyles"" because he composed a great theme.  Theme songs are one of the best parts in a superhero movie, that is another thing why X-Men gone wrong.<br/><br/>    Last and most is the action scenes.  I really didn't care about the CGI. People thought it look fake, but I thought it looked fine, along with the Green Goblin costume, but that, along with my review is my opinion.  They should have gotten Yuen Woo Ping and mimic ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon's,"" fighting moves or have ""Cirque de Soleil"" choreograph the movie. It's SPIDER-MAN, the master of strings.  Who cares if people say, ""How can a teen-ager know how to do all those fighting moves.""  Just leave that question with the, ""How can a teen-ager make a foam latex superhero outfit to fight crime, he just can.""  <br/><br/>    Like I said before, this movie is the best comic book adaption, but that isn't saying much.  There were many flaws in this movie and I expected more from the person who wrote the brilliant script ""Panic Room.""  Tobey Maguire was the perfect choice to play Peter Parker.  Wes Bentley would just had made Peter look like the American Beauty role he played. The movie deserved all the money it racked in and I hope it still stays at number 1 of the highest billed movies to bring in the most money in the first weekend. Daredevil would probably suck like Tomb Raider. The movie is mostly hyped by the commercials, but when you watch it, it is awful because Mark Steven Johnson is cramming in 20 years of Daredevil comics into one movie by having so many characters in the first movie, while he could easily put half of them in the sequel that we all know is coming in 2005 of 06.  I applaud the screenwriter for not cramming all the comics into Spider-Man, but I hope he corrects some of the mistakes he did in the first one for the sequel."

","I thought Spiderman was an amazing film. Right from the opening scene of the young Peter Parker chasing the school bus I knew it was going to be something special. Spiderman has always been one of the most endearing comic-book heroes of our time and after twenty years of effort and legal entanglements he has finally made his way on to the big screen. Some have commented on the obviousness of the special effects, but in a way they add to the comic book feeling of the piece and hark back to the classic animated series if the 1960's. The plot also remains faithful to the comic with only slight alterations to modernise the story. The movie is a feast for the eyes, with more dangerous action sequences than you can shake a stick at, but unlike most movies of this ilk it has an emotional core that offers much more to the viewer than just a CGI extravaganza. The romantic interest between Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst really works as these actors have great on-screen chemistry, and the complex relationship between Spiderman and the Green Goblin makes for great viewing."

","Spider-man is a very entertaining movie. The special effect were great. Also, the major characters and acting for them was very good.<br/><br/>
Their are a few points that would have made it an even better film. The story plot was good, but the writing was only so-so. My guess is it was written by many part-time or temporary writers, using the recently more often used Hollywood pass-the-script add-or-change-a-little-more writing method that is to blame. Most of the secondary characters and some scenes were very two dimentional. For example when Peter caught his lady love AND all of the things she dropped, none of the students even noticed. None of the students made any big deal of him doing a somersault from a stand-still and then punch a quy twice his size clear across the room (except: ""Wow"", or ""Freak"").<br/><br/>Also, when Osbone is given his walking papers at the board meeting, the whole scene and all ot the people there seemed artificially two dimensional and emotionless.<br/><br/>Only other comment is that Spider-man's girlfriend could have been dressed a bit more modestly.<br/><br/>Anyway, overall a very good, and fun movie. If the writing for spiderman II improves it will be an even bigger hit."

","Yes at the end of this film I have to admit that this one is without many suspense and the story is very predictable. This movie is perhaps the best of all Marvels. Sometimes I had the sensation that the movie has been adapted for teenagers. Well it is in fact a story based on a comic book for children and comic fans. But anyway from director Sam Riami I expected more. The most of the integrated action scenes seemed to be like a video game or an animated film for kids. Okay the actors did her job at partly well and the film has some good plots. There were some unexplained situations like how Mr.Osborne turned in a bad guy but finally you have to accept that it is a comic story and that`s really all. It is too overrated. 6/10."
"JohnKGraham","Null","0","0","5 December 2002"," Here's my 2 cents worth...
","Okay.  I finally saw the Spider-Man movie tonight.   After months of hearing the hype and hyperbole about this movie, I was ready to soak it in and give my opinion.<br/><br/>Mind you, I have been a faithful comics collector for going on 30 years now, and Spidey has always been one of if not THE most favorite of my heroes as related by Mr. Stan Lee.<br/><br/>Spidey is after all, an ordinary teenager beset by extraordinary circumstances in his life, therefore we can relate to him moreso than say, Superman, who is an alien, or Batman, who is a multi-millionaire.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie was, in my humble opinion, very good. It stuck to the heart of the comic, and was realistic to me, anyway.  I loved the idea of the bio-organic webshooters, and the almost painful way Peter discovers his newly gained powers.  Of course, all of us familiar with the Spider-Man canon will remember most all of the movie actually coming from the comic.<br/><br/>Now to the casting.  Tobey Maguire was excellent as Spidey. His transformation from bookwormish Peter to super hero Spider-Man was just electric.  That look of determination at the end fight when the Goblin was taunting him with killing MJ was worth the price of the movie itself. Kirsten Dunst...beautiful.  She captures the very essence of MJ.  Wiilem Dafoe was just ok, given his split time as a man hidden behind a mask.  I also must give 4 stars to J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson...BEAUTIFUL. I hope we can see a lot more of him in future sequels.  He is a perfect cast, unlike Pat Hingle as Gordon in Batman, or Jackie Cooper as Perry White in Superman.<br/><br/>All in all, I would recommend Spider-Man to all viewers.  If you aren't a comics freak as me, you may not like it as much as I do.  Just sit back and relax for 2 hours and soak in some fantasy, as I like to do.<br/><br/>Peace..."

","""Spiderman"" was an enjoyable movie overall.  I wasn't all that familiar with the character before seeing the movie but I think it did a good job at telling the story and introducing the character.  Tobey Maguire was good as the lead but Willem Dafoe and Kirsten Dunst were somewhat wasted in their roles.  Some of the effects seemed cartoonish and some of the violent scenes weren't cartoonish enough.  The fight sequences, especially the punches to Spiderman's face, seemed too personal or intimate given the tone of the movie.  There were these cold CGI sequences followed by a bloody punch to the mouth of Spiderman in slow motion.  Was that really necessary?  I think it ruined the tone of the movie.  The Green Goblin was goofy.  It did not seem real at all and that ridiculous mask hid the actor.  Was that the point?  Why have a famous name as the villain if he is hid by the costume. Save the expense by hiring an unknown and hiding him in a fancy costume. Kirsten Dunst was wasted except for the wet dress scene.  Overall the cartoon tone and effects were enjoyable as escapist fare."

Tobey is just perfect for the rol of Peter Parker because he is not that Leonardo kind-of-guy! He has proved to be a very good actor to my opinion, for example the rol he played in ""The Cider House Rules"" was excellent. And then there's the owh so beautiful Kirsten... yesterday I saw ""The Virgin Suicides"" (go rent it immediately if you havn't seen it yet!) and now I know even more why she was chosen to play the rol of the gorgeous Mary Jane. To choose the actor of the Green Goblin must have been an easy one, you can tell just by looking at the face of Willem Dafoe that... secretly he is the Green Goblin! I mean, look at his face expressions!<br/><br/>The length of the movie, about two hours, is enough to tell the story without leaving important details referring to the comic book. In my opinion director Sam (Xena) Raimi, did a fantastic job and he can put his ""Spiderman"" right next to Tim Burton's ""Batman"". Both movies have that special superhero thing...<br/><br/>Because this movie is so amazing, I can't wait to see the next two movies. I heard  that for the second movie they want Dr. Otto Octavius & The Green Lizard to play the bad guys and for the third movie rumours are that Carnage & Venom will show their fighting skills to Spidey!

My first reaction upon hearing the Tobey Maguire was going to be playing Peter Parker was one of shock...I didn't expect him to be the kind of actor who could play a superhero, but after seeing it I am positive that he was the PERFECT person to play Peter Parker. Anyone could relate to the way that Parker was picked on in high school by the bullies. His transformation into Spiderman was portrayed very well (I can't believe those were his real muscles!). Kirsten Dunst,James Franco and Willem Dafoe were also stunning in this movie, and the musical score by Danny Elfman was very engaging.

","If you fancy watching a no-brainer, with very little subplot or substance, then this movie is for you. Good quality action sequences and impressive CGI belies the fact that there is nothing else too it really.<br/><br/>
When combined with the inherent jingoistic aspect, which unfortunately mars a lot of Hollywood flicks, I was a little disappointed with this effort. It is painfully obvious that sequels are going to be forthcoming and many, and that part on the bridge something like ***SPOILER*** ""If you hurt one of us New Yorkers, you hurt us all""...<br/><br/>O.H.

Just 3 things ticked me off, watching the green goblin talk and not have his mouth move (it annoyed me for some reason), Kirsten Dunst just reminds me of a ditsy blonde from Bring It On, not a Red Head like MJ, and the fact that MJ said 'Tiger' like once, maybe twice... which is practically MJ's catch phrase.

","I realize I am going against the majority here but this film didn't quite do it for me. I have always been an avid fan of Spider-Man and I collected this comic when I was a kid but this film just seemed like it was missing something.  Some of the special effects were very distracting and I felt like I was watching a cartoon at times. It's obvious we have come along was since the days of the Spider-Man television series but it just still seemed a little fakey. The main problem I had ,however, was that many of the characters in the film just seemed very bland to me and I really didn't care about them. Although, I think Tobey Macguire is a competent actor and that his understated performances works well in most films I don't feel this was one of them. I would just like to see a little more of the inside of Peter Parker. Overall I would recommend seeing this film because it is neat to see a more realistic Spidey but this doesn't quite rise to the level of Christopher Reeve's first outing as Superman or Michael keaton's outing as Batman. I am hoping that Daredevil and The Incredible Hulk will offer a little bit more and maybe Tobey will kick it up a notch for Spidey 2. 6 out of 10 stars."

","Having no interest in Spider Man and finding Tobey Maguire to be irritating to say the least, I avoided seeing this film when it was released.  Then one night, friends brough it over as a rental and rather than twiddle my thumbs in another room being anti-social, I figured I'd grit my way through it. Boy, was I surprised.  First off, without being a Spider Man expert, I still found Tobey MaGuire to be a total fit for the film and the character and secondly, Spider Man turned out to be a pretty good guy, not to mention the makings of a pretty good film.  No cheesiness, no going over the top and the director totally created the alternate world necessary for a Super Hero perfectly.  By the time the movie was really getting going, I, the anti MaGuire chick was totally rooting for his character and had really sunken into the world being portrayed.  No wonder this film made so much money at the box office.  Funnily enough, if I could play God and decide which movie deserved to do better at the box office, I would pick Spider-Man over Titanic any day of the week.  Complete entertainment, great effects (I love when he's chasing a car down town from building to building, a loveable geeky, understated main character and Kirsten Dunst as a sweetie that still manages to be a spitfire.  If I had children, I would have no hesitation in buying them this DVD as the content is entertaining enough for an adult but imaginative and suitable for a child.  I don't know who directed it (so flog me), but whoever did, did a hell of a good job.<br/><br/>Give me this over SuperMan anyday.  A real recommend for a holiday movie, a family movie and a movie to just sit back and be entertained by.  And to Tobey, my apologies for not having seen the other side of you."

","After years of watching superheroes like Superman and Batman make their way to the big screen, Spiderman fans have finally got their turn with Director Sam Raimi's 'Spider-man', a big budget adventure with all the makings of a successful superhero film that captivates the viewer with state of the art digital wizardry, excellent acrobatic stunt work and fine acting. BUT, like most films of the superhero genre, this film falls prey to some of the more common 'pitfalls'.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILERS-<br/><br/>I realize finding an actor who matches the characteristics of these comic book characters must be a daunting task for the film-makers since fans expect the actor to look and talk in a certain way. I am still two minded about the casting of Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman. On the one hand, he shows a very deep, emotional side to the character of Peter Parker through his inability to blend in with his fellow students at school, the emotional turmoil and guilt he feels over his uncles death and his secret love for his neighbor, Mary Jane. On the other hand, as Spiderman, he lacks the physical prowess necessary to intimidate his enemies and stand as a figure of strength and justice. He appears to simply enjoy swinging from building to building, laughing and spitting out witty one - liners, occasionally preventing a few minor crimes and trying hard to impress the girl of his dreams. All in all, his portrayal of the masked web slinger is somewhat adolescent, as he seems more like a child with a new toy than a man who's coming to terms with a powerful gift and his obligation to use it responsibly.  Another negative aspect of this film is the running time. Although it is necessary to give the audience enough time to relate to and understand the characters and plot, there were many scenes here which the film could have simply done without (or edited versions of ), such as the drawn out hospital scenes with Peter and Mary Jane / Aunt May as well as the numerous scenes at the Osborne house in which Norman SLOWLY realizes what is happening to him.<br/><br/>Overall though, this was a great movie, which shows just how far the movie industry has come in way of visual effects and imagery. No doubt, the film - makers will ride on the wave of this films success by churning out a few sequels in the near future, and hopefully they will pay attention to what is really important and not be completely blinded by high profits and movie executives. The acting and direction is good, with Sam Raimi's vision doing justice to the long awaited journey of Spiderman from the comic books to the big screen.<br/><br/>A rating of 7 / 10."

","Ok, I know you all have probably rushed out to the 100mil dollar 3 day opening Spiderman, so, here are my thoughts.<br/><br/>First, I'd like to say I did enjoy it as a comicbook film, it was fun, even if cliched, and well casted. Tobey McGuire is just perfect as Peter Parker, there's an innocence to him, an unassuming quality that he brings to the role, much like his roles in Wonder Boys and Cider House Rules, both movies of which I love.<br/><br/>Then there's Kirsten Dunst, as the attractive red-headed Mary Jane. I thought she did an adequite job of the part, providing the 'heroine in distress' number for Spiderman to rescue, and an 'unreachable' number for Peter to gawk at and fawn over.<br/><br/>Oh, and then there's William Dafoe, good ol' Dafoe... I can't say I have any reservations about him in much else except the cool what if making of story, Shadow of the Vampire. But here, in Spideyworld, I felt he plays the part well.<br/><br/>Ok, now, what I liked about the film was it did manage a pure comicbook fantasy and for that, it remains an entertaining piece of the new marvel crop of their comicbook revolution that began with Blade and X-Men, but, there's also some problems with the direction they chose. Namely, I've seen this story before, not just in the comicbooks, no, but in the last animated series of Spiderman of the 90s. This means very little was actually new, just a retelling, or a remake, if you will. It's not just that, but how closely it comes to it, it just feels like I've already been here before, with a few variances. I mean, it can be, in a sense, good or bad. The Green Goblin's story is much the same as it was in the animated series as well, though more spread out over the season. This is a live action version, which I enjoyed, but I would have personally rather had something more original and maybe dealt with the origin in a short flashback sequence.<br/><br/>Now, my other minor problems came with the design for the Goblin's mask, which is fine when he's flying around, but up close, was hard at first to get used to. Course, once I did, then everything was fine. On the other side of the coin, however, the Spidey suit was excellent in every regard; perfect, for lack of a better word. It doesn't look ridiculously like a man in tights, it actually looks like a cool suit of a comicbook hero and the way it blends in with the CGI varient was pretty nice.<br/><br/>Everything is well laid out for the most part, but another issue I'd like to mention is Green Goblin's lack of direction in the 2nd half. After he got what he wanted, his motivations didn't seem as thought out. I think another minor plotline inbred within the story that could have lasted the whole of the movie and giving him more of a purpose at the end besides just making Parker miserable, would have helped the movie as a whole feel more complete.<br/><br/>Now, to wrap up... I can't wait to see the sequel, now that the ground work has been laid out, let's see something really cool in the next one. Lots of potential here. I liked the film, and I will definitely pick it up on DVD eventually and enjoy it at home, but I still feel X-Men is a better marvel superhero comicbook flick, in my opinion."

JK Simmons from tv's Law and Order and Oz is hilarious in his few scenes at the crotchedty editor from the Daily Bugle and offers the best moments of comedy.

He fails: the film has a lot of the `Darkman' look--especially the climax, which primarily takes place at night on top of a New York borough bridge--but little of the passion because, unlike the reverence with which Raimi regards the Universal horror films of the thirties and infused into `Darkman', he treats the Marvel Comic source material with an air of condescension, as if it were mere kitsch. And he doesn't stop there, borrowing indiscriminately from the obvious pop icons, the DC Comic-inspired `Superman' and `Batman' films--he doesn't seem to have the slightest desire to bring anything original to the project. The film is awash in computer effects and perhaps it's Raimi's intention to stylize the movement of the action but it seems a bit of a cover-up; there are so many unconvincing moments that you have to spend too much time telling yourself it's done that way on purpose. The script is another lazy hack job by David Koepp (`Panic Room', `Mission: Impossible') who not only hews it close to the Hollywood-101 bone by bringing in all the bullied teenager and father/son pathos he can, but also by stroking the citizenry of New York, elevating them, in the film's most shameless twist, to hero status. Perhaps the real culprit is Sony Pictures: the whole thing reeks of trying to keep the dying comic book film genre alive by aligning it with post-9/11 bloodlust. With Tobey Maguire, competent in the title role, Kirsten Dunst (so-so) as his would-be love interest and Willem Dafoe, pretty good as The Green Goblin."

","""Spider-Man"" is a very entertaining and well produced movie. The special effects are very realistic and seamless with the live action. But as I watched it, I had the feeling of deja vu.<br/><br/> The story is simple. Nerdy teenager Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is bitten by a genetically altered spider and begins to take on the characteristics of the insect. He then begins to battle the forces of evil in the city and faces off against another genetically altered being called The Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe).<br/><br/> The similarities between this film and the first two Superman movies is more than coincidental. For example, Parker is orphaned and cared for by an aunt (Rosemary Harris) and uncle (Cliff Robertson) who dies tragically as was the case with Clark Kent. Spider-Man battles the super human Green Goblin. Superman battled three super villains. Spider-man's rescue of the heroine Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst)from the top of a collapsing building is almost identical to Superman's rescue of Lois Lane in the first Superman movie. J.K. Simmons plays a Perry white like character called J. Jonah Jameson and so on.<br/><br/> The boyish looking Maguire is surprisingly good in the lead role and Dunst is suitably fresh and innocent as the girl who loves Spider-Man but the one that Peter Parker can't have (shades of Lois Lane?)and veterans Robertson and Harris are good as the aunt and uncle. Dafoe on the other hand, is way over the top as the villain but then how else could he have played him. Simmons equally hams it up as the newspaper editor.<br/><br/> Even though ""Spider-Man borrows heavily from Superman it is nonetheless a very exciting and entertaining two hours thanks mainly to Tobey Maguire."

","If you would all be so kind as to lower your pitchforks and pointy sticks I'll just need a few moments to bend Sam Raimi over my knee and give him a proper spanking. <br/><br/>Let me begin by saying I was a huge fan of Spiderman growing up. I used to steal balls of yarn from my grandmother's sewing basket and run around the room giggling maniacally while wrapping everything in yarn to such a degree that it took the jaws of life to me out. I was neither the Spiderman nazi who thought that the only way a decent Spiderman movie would be made was if I made it myself, nor was I waiting in line a week before opening weekend dressed like Mary Jane. I went in with an open mind. Unfortunately I came out with a bad taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>One of the biggest mistakes made with this movie was that they tuckered themselves out trying to rationalize Spiderman mythology. MILITARY FUNDING FOR A BAT-GLIDER?! WHY THE NAME OF F. MURRAY ABRAHAM DOES THE MILITARY NEED A BAT GLIDER?! Why couldn't they just leave that out until he gets all crazy like and makes all his cute little goblin cache of wacky weapons? A bat glider that you have to dress up like a mighty morphing power ranger to control nonetheless. I would have no problem with William Dafoe as Green Goblin if he had a simple costume that complimented his already goblin like features. SIMPLIFY PEOPLE!<br/><br/>While some of the computer generated effects were convincing enough, most of them were completely absurd. When Pete Parker is jumping from rooftop to rooftop he looks as real as Stan Lee's hairpiece. Real people have weight and presence. I accept the fact that replacing the actors with computer generated characters for some of the scenes were necessary, for the web swinging scenes for example. But the fight scenes could have been done with some good old-fashioned wirework. With great power comes great responsibility, did someone bother to tell that to their CG department?<br/><br/>I thought that the cast was strong, especially Kirsten Dunst's blouse bunnies in the alleyway scene. And J.K. Simmons was most certainly the bomb as J. Jonah Jameson. The origin story is told well enough, it's in the action sequences where things go down the waterspout.<br/><br/>I have little time left for soon a cadre of federal agents will undoubtedly be breaking down my door and beating me with my own limbs for speaking ill of this summer's box office cash cow. If you really need to see comics move I suggest renting Batman. TALK HARD!!!"

","I rarely see movies in the theater, but went to see this one because it looked like it had a lot of potential. I was very disappointed, but I thought it might have been because my expectations were so high. I just watched it again on DVD and it didn't get any better the second time.<br/><br/>Note: spoiler upcoming.<br/><br/>The story didn't quite make the delicate balance between reality and fantasy. It was either not real enough or not comic-booky enough. It was a bad mix of both.<br/><br/>But the worst part for me was when he told her that being a friend was all he could give her, and then he walked away, leaving her crying. I mean, what kind of a schmuck would do that, even if he couldn't have a relationship with her? How about something more like: ""I'm so sorry. I have always loved you, and I will always love you. But I can't be in a relationship with you or anyone right now, and maybe not ever. It hurts me deeply to say that, and I'm sorry I can't explain why.

","As you can see from my title of the subject I thought this movie was very very korny. I just rented the dvd and all through it I counted the minutes to when it would end. Yes the special effects were well done( i.e. the flying through the city), and the action packed fighting scenes I actually didn't yawn at. Although the Goblin did have a very bad costume, he did have the only one good line. That's it the line and the beginning credits were the only things enjoyable. Some major faults in this movie is when Peter discovers he actually can climb walls. Question wouldn't he panic and go totally insane? I would for sure, but no this is not taken into consideration in the movie. Then when Peter fights the bully. Wouldn't the kids afterwards scream out MUTANT, and then call the cops? No they just say ""Peter I knew you were a freak"". This emphasizes the korniness that I am talking about. What about all those times that Peter a.k.a SPIDER MAN is saving the city of crime, and in the rememberance of the death of his uncle? Well...the saving he does is like a human saving a cat out of a tree. They don't come up with natural crime-saving. I mean what kinda of fireman trusts a man in a paperthin spandex suit? COME ON.....the plot lacked. Was rushed, and made all the extra actors point to the sky to say look there is spider man. HELLO That is superman's cue NOT SPIDERMAN! I didn't like Kirsten Dunst at all she sucks at playing the damseld in distress. She's not good enough for that role, and Tobey Mcguire is cuter with the glasses. It was all korny and I can't remember any other pointers, because I'm trying to block out the 108 minutes I wasted of my life.<br/><br/>Fare thee Well Ruby"

","I have to admit that I wasn't exactly looking forward to Spiderman, in fact, I was even loathing it, so much so that I'm only now seeing it for the first time on DVD. While I do like Spiderman, lets just say that the execution in super hero movies is very much hit and miss. Luckily, Sam Raimi, himself a fan of everyone's favorite ""Non-Mutant Superhero,"" has a hit on his hands.<br/><br/>Visually speaking, Spiderman offers plenty of eye-candy, and while it's not altogether convincing at times, overall, it's quite impressive. The CGI is well-done, and aside from a couple of stiff animations, manages to convince you that you're seeing Spiderman on your screen. While the Green Goblin persona is a bit different visually from the comic's antagonist, it's for the better, and offers me a bit of hope on the level that Marvel will be able to dish out when it gets around to the Iron Man movie.<br/><br/>Acting is a mixed back, with some very flat performances by some of the cast, the Dafoe is excellent as the maniacal Green Goblin (wouldn't you love to see him as the Joker in Batman?). Maguire seems wooden at times, but is generally good, and is able to convey a lot of the emotion needed through his facial expressions. The only other notable among the cast would be J.K. Simmons, who nails J. Jonah Jameson to a ""T."" Once again, Kirsten Dunst is nice to look at, but just doesn't feel right for this role.<br/><br/>Overall, though not the best super hero movie to date, it's an entertaining flick that fans of the comic series will love. There have been some changes made from the comic (the ""web glands"" being one of the more noticeable), but actually work in this case, probably due again to the fact that Raimi is a fan of the material."

","Firstly, my only major complaint is James Franco as Harry Osborn. He is a total Dawson's Creek reject who's terrible at acting. He talked in one tone the entire movie: ""Whatever."". Hate him.<br/><br/>Otherwise, a great movie this is. James Franco mercifully has a minor role. Tobey Maguire was an excellent choice for Peter Parker, and if you don't like him as Spider-Man, too bad, because he really pulled back the troubled yet determined Spider-Man we all knew and loved, and he's coming back.<br/><br/>As you may expect from a super-hero movie, this film had a big budget, special effects, known, if not major, actors and actresses, and great sets.<br/><br/>But Spider-Man has been known to push the envelope a lot in the comics, and the same is said here. The special effects, though mostly good, lacked in realism when it was replacing a human figure. It immediately changed colour, speed, and stuck out when it went to CGI. Other than some web-swinging, the special effects lacked when they were really 100% necessary, and the screen tests on the DVD show that they were not really improved as the movie was made. It seemed like as they darkened the scene it was all supposed to look better, and it did, but only to a limited extent.<br/><br/>The acting is the core of this movie. Tobey Maguire was an excellent if surprising choice, really bringing back the days of the new, teenage Spider-Man compared to the expected major action of today, yet modernized it effectively, one of their goals, so we believed the movie happened in present day, not the swinging sixties. Kirsten Dunst was another surprising yet excellent choice as Mary Jane, improving on the damsel in distress character with a new flair to make the relationship with Parker more believable. I'll just skip the paragraph or two on James Franco.<br/><br/>I unfortunately had never heard of Willem Dafoe before this movie, which is a shame, because he's an excellent actor, especially his voice difference. Uncle Ben was strangely modernized to the 21st century, apparently with a great sports interest. Aunt May was perfectly played, except for the shocking introductory scene when she calmly tells Ben not to fall on his a**. J. Jonah Jameson, slightly taller but with the exact same personality that made him such a joy to hate, is greatly played, and half of you wanted more footage of him, and half of you were glad his jerk character was short. Unfortunately, I forget all these wonderful actors' names.<br/><br/>The sets were grand, big and detailed, and Times Square(also apparently a set!) really brought the webbed wonder to 2002. I didn't like the eventually annoying marketing gimmicks, with everything from Dr. Pepper to Cingular Wireless network.<br/><br/>The action scenes were well choreographed, always in the right mood or atmosphere and never repetitive or boring. But it could've been a little better. It still suited Spidey well. The wardrobe was one of the best of a movie I've ever seen, and thank God they rejected the clothes from the screen tests. The main costumes focused on, Spidey and the Green Goblin, don't disappoint.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi should be really proud. A grand movie worth whatever you paid to see it. Please, though, keep it safe and don't make any risks for ""The Amazing Spider-Man""(the second movie). We don't want this to be another Batman. The 4 decades of risk-taking, moral-teaching, twist-and-turn-stories of the Spider-Man era should not be let down. No pressure, though!"

","Move over Batman because there is a new hero in town and he is taking over. Finally after years of legal problems fans have been graced with a Spider-Man film and it was worth every minute of the wait. Peter Parker is blessed with the strength and sense of a spider after he is bitten by one on a school science trip. After discovering his powers he turns to professional wrestling for money but decides to use his powers to rid the city of crime after his uncle is killed by a car jacker who he could have stopped but instead let his ignorance get the best of him and let the thug get away. Sam Raimi has always been known for taking his films one step above everything else out there, not only making him perfect for this film but also making him on of the more talented directors these days. Raimi makes everything so big and beyond belief that the film is overwhelming from start to finish, never once loosing the attention of the audience even thought it runs over two hours long. You would also think that a film which uses mostly animated characters would be awkward and hard to take seriously, like in Blade 2, but it is done so well here that I had a hard time determining what was real and what was animated. The action sequences are huge and terribly enjoyable, Raimi's direction is so good that you will actually feel like you are soaring high above the city right behind Spider-Man and even thought these sequences move at a extremely fast pace, Raimi never lets the audience get lost in the excitement, unlike the terrible Rollerball everything is very easy to follow, making the end result dazzling to watch. The script is also very good in that it keeps everything you know and love about your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man but also can poke fun at itself, it almost raises itself to a point of satire when everyone is saying what they feel about Spider-Man and even includes that old rescue the baby from a burning building cliche, but is used with such style that you don't say ""how cliche"" you say ""welcome back Spider-Man."" Now I have never been a fan of Toby Maguire but it almost seems like he was born to play Peter Parker and Kirsten Dunst is at the top of her game as Marry-Jane, the sexual chemistry between the two just pours from the screen making this not only an exciting action flick, a great comic book remake, a suspenseful adventure but also a heart tugging romance as well. Let's not forget William Dafoe who is delightfully over-the-top as the Green Goblin. You can also look for cameos from pro wrestler Macho Man Randie Savage, Macey Grey. Raimi regular Bruce Campbell and if you look close enough you may just catch a glimpse of Spider-Man creator Stan Lee outside of Oscorp after it is attacked by Green Goblin. Ten years ago when Tim Burton (who draws many influences from Raimi) created Batman for the big screen he relied mainly on atmosphere and character rather and action making it great for fans of the Batman comics but being totally inappropriate for the younger audience who watched the Batman cartoons. Raimi also uses atmosphere (the entire film feels just like you are looking at a comic book and try not to picture Evil Dead while watching some of the more intense scenes) but he also kept in mind the younger audience who grew up watching the cartoons (myself included) and although it is probably to violent for the younger children, older kids and grown-ups alike can take a trip down memory lane while being thrust to the edge of your seat and marvel as the magical special effects unfold before your eyes. Sam Raimi has always been a honest filmmaker and even thought this film became a huge summer blockbuster, Raimi never set out to make a film just to rake in big bucks, he made a film for the fans that the fans will love, you can feel it in his direction, you can see it on the faces and hear it in the voices of all the actors involved. I can't wait until the next Spider-Man film comes out because if it is anything like this one it will be well worth my time."

","I just finished watching Spider-Man and I was satisfied.  I would have to say this is a good movie for many reasons.  For the people (like myself) who have heard the Spider-man origin time after time can enjoy the blockbuster portrayal before their eyes.  The people (like youngsters) whose knowledge of the Spider-man history is bleak, it is a nice introduction to get them caught up.  I believe it was action packed and kept the viewer glued and interested to the storyline.  I have the whole ""Batman"" scenario running through my head.  I am sure all of you see it.  That's good.  I just hope the makers of Spider-man can do it better.  I was a fan of the first two ""Batman"" movies, but then I feel it started getting bad.  I hope this time its different.  Marvel has finally taken the reigns in a blockbuster movie. We have seen DC comics with much success with both ""Superman"" & ""Batman"" and now Marvel with ""Spider-man.""  I hear soon we will also have ""Dare-Devil"" and ""The Hulk.""  I am a huge Hulk fan and cannot wait for that to unleash itself on the world.  I just hope it's as good as ""Spider-man.""  Oh the one thing that kind of stood out from the comics (to me anyway) was the webshooters.  If my memory serves me correctly Peter Parker never had webshooters automatically when he started his transformation.  In the comics, he actually created the webshooters and it wasn't part of the mutation.  Oh well, I had to get a little bickering in.  Other than that (which there could be more things) I would have to say this was a very nice watch and I would recommend it to comic and non-comic fans. Enjoy!"

","First off, I just have to say that nobody should tell you what a movie is supposed to be or meant to be. A corollary to that however, is that we all come into each movie with different expectations. <br/><br/>Personally, I expected a huge blockbuster (which it was), while sticking to the quality I feel that Batman (1989) had. Unfortunately, I think the quality was lacking in several areas. First off, the acting was sub-par to me. My expectations, like all of you, get me into trouble here. I have always admired Dafoe's work, but he didn't seem at all comfortable in this role (and no, I really don't think I was typecasting him in my own mind). Toby was fine, but that's it. Dunst seemed to be overacting or something...I couldn't really tell. The script (dialogue) was bad period. Yeah, comic books usually are comprised of elementary dialogue but this was an insult even so. Obviously, you can't give the movie any credit for plot, twists, or cool self-referential themes since it's based on a prior work. The CGI was bad, see Attack of the Clones or LoTR for what they SHOULD have done with the computer graphics. The mood and tone throughout was decent, but Batman was better (credit Burton). The pace of the movie and the action, which is what I was so excited about, really didn't do it for me. Again, Attack of the Clones blew this movie out for pace and action. Okay, it's not fair to compare the two on that note, but I was expecting something more towards what I eventually saw in Attack of the Clones.<br/><br/>It was worth seeing, but I won't be buying it and won't be seeing it again.

The whole film (and the advertising campaign) promised some huge, edge-of-your-seat type movie, and as the movie progressed it seemed inevitable that the climax was going to be huge. But there was none. I left thinking to myself 'was that some sort of joke? That was nothing like the ads and entertainment shows promised.'

"railmc23","Null","0","0","22 October 2002"," Falls short in analysis, but gives important political message
","Overall, the latest Spiderman movie falls short for entertainment value; it is far from action packed, with a plot and dialog that are best described as trite. But the saving grace of the movie is the political message at the end (which this review will be giving away).<br/><br/>Spiderman is the story of an ordinary boy, Peter Parker, who was bit by a spider on a high school class trip. In narrating the beginning of the movie, he says that his life story revolves around a beautiful woman. That is an unfortunate characterization of the life of someone who ends up devoting himself to fighting evil. But in the end the best political message is wrapped up in this romantic subplot.<br/><br/>Of course, the spectacular evil Spiderman fights is the super-villain kind, but most of his time is spent fighting the ordinary evil of people hurting other people. Essentially, on an individual scale, Spiderman is fighting for a better world. But he is targeting crime on a small scale: individual robberies and violence. Spiderman lacks any kind of systematic analysis of the causes of evil that he is fighting, and as one man running around New York City putting out fires (sometimes literally), he can't really expect to make any progress towards ending all the violence that he is trying to prevent. His time would be better spent fighting the causes of crime (for instance poverty) and fighting the biggest murderers and thieves in the world: the imperialists.<br/><br/>MIM appreciates the message that ordinary people can become heroes because of their circumstances (though we're not waiting for our heroes to develop superpowers). Rather than looking to individuals we take a more scientific analysis of the world and argue that it is the people who make history. Extraordinary leaders come from ordinary people who rise to the occasion of their material conditions. <br/><br/>Ironically, it was the romantic plot that provided the most important political message in the movie. When the woman Peter Parker was in love with finally declared her love for him, he decided he could not be more than friends with her. In order to devote his life to fighting evil in the world he walked away from romance. This is the asexuality that MIM praises as a superior romantic practice. It reflects a devotion to the people and an understanding of responsibility to the people that supercedes romantic cultural influence.<br/><br/>Peter Parker said, ""With great power comes great responsibility."" This is what MIM refers to as the ""leadership principle."" The great power Parker refers to is his spider-power; the power we refer to is state power (or proto-state power when referring to leadership positions in our party). Leaders in the bourgeois government and economy are not held responsible for the 14 million children every year who die of malnutrition worldwide  they are not even held accountable for the few score middle-class Amerikans who died because of the shoddy workmanship on their SUVs and tires. Bourgeois leaders need not be particularly intelligent, courageous or devoted to the common good -- they simply need daddy's money and a few friends in the right places.  On the contrary, MIM would restrict leadership positions in the dictatorship of the proletariat to the most dedicated, with a proven track record of struggle and results. Furthermore, these leaders would understand that if they made a mistake that cost other people their lives, they could be held accountable with their own life."

I also found that Kirsten Dunst was rather good as Mary Jane which I did not expect, when I heard that Spiderman was being made I couldn't think of a decent actor who was rather pretty and had/looked realisticely natural with red hair, who looked around 16-24. And just decided they'd pick a pretty red head who was absolute sh** at acting. But this was perfect!!<br/><br/>As I try to see fault, sadley there was, Mary Jane's pathetic way of not noticing it was Peter Parker who was Spiderman. PG-13 was a rather harsh decision for a film that was made from the idea of a child's comic and cartoon, although parents might object to slight violence and a wet t-shirt rescue which ends up with an upside down snog which looked like spider unfolding it's fangs!<br/><br/>As I wait with great anticipation for the DVD release, I would advice anyone to do so too, my rating 8.6/10, the best superhero film in 25 years!"

","There are three great superhero movies made so far: Superman, Batman, and this one.  What makes these three work so well?  The humanity.  I have found that far too many superhero films dive straight into the action with no build up, no characterization, nothing.  But these three films all spend time to develope the human side of the superhero.  In Spider-Man, Peter Parker is a high school student given the proportional strength of a spider and, after his uncle is killed, becomes the ultimate vigilante for good. Some of the CGI effects are a little less than state of the art, but that is acceptable in a movie in which the story, the acting, and the direction all work together to make a most entertaining action/adventure movie.  Who's it for?  Fans of the comic will get more out of it than others, but just about anyone who enjoys action/adventure films should get a kick out of it.  Just sit back for two hours and turn your brain off.  On a scale of 1-10, I give this movie a 7.5."

Unfortunately, Ms. Dunst *really* needs to follow through on getting her acting lessons, as her M.J. character suggests.  Her delivery is so wooden, so flat, it's inappropriately hilarious.  How could Spidey be in love with a stacked piece of redheaded cardboard?  There's no chemistry there whatsoever and it's to Tobey's credit he faked it for her the whole time.  PlayStation-like animation detracts from some of the scenes, but the sweeping cinematography thrills at every angle (despite the twin towers' removal)."

","As a young kid you got out early of bed just to watch those marvelous marvel comic book hero's on television like the 'amazing' Spiderman. This one almost got me wishing I'd stayed in bed that day...<br/><br/>
I have to say that Spiderman the movie isn't that bad, but something about it just said to me that it was a just above average kind of film. Peter Parker a real full time freaky nerd in the beginning of the movie? They could have portrayed him much better then that, he didn't look like the science wiz to me either. The movie was more focused of him being Spiderman, maybe even too much, instead of Peter Parker himself. But to know more about Spiderman, you have to learn more about the person behind Spidey. And what about Flash Thompson? He looked more like some blink 182 fan rather than a college football star without the brains. The best character in the entire movie was without a doubt J. Jonah Jamison, superbly acted by J.K. Simmons. He blew me away with that performance!<br/><br/>The scene on the Brooklyn Bridge was truly pathetic, Mary Jane Watson looked like Xena when the Green Goblin took a poke at Spidey and had the cable swinging heavily, she still could hang on to it instead of dislocating her shoulders. Seconds later she drops like 50 feet and grabs hold on to the bar like she was Xena again, didn't she Sam? Then comes the part of ""When you mess with one of us you mess with all of us"", wich was America at it's 'best', but to me sounded so lame like a bad dialogue of some Hercules episode.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is a nice movie, but could have been much greater, Sam Raimi did use some elements from other movies which I thought was great because it blended in perfectly (Balloons =""Batman""), but next time he needs to keep those Xena and Hercules stuff out. Peter Parker did some flips with his fight with Flash that reminded me of Xena. The only real thing that was great about the film were the visuals. They were really mind boggling, and that's why I give this movie a 7 out of 10, but this movie doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the top 250 movies of all time."

After I found out I thought this had to be a joke.<br/><br/>When he appeared in the movie I just shook my head. This Goblin looked more like a robot.( Or The Jackal for all of you that know who I'm talking about )What happened to his purple costume ? And his jet glider. The head on it looked like a bird. That could of been better. The glider itself was ok.<br/><br/>I liked the battle he fought with Spider - Man after he kid-napped Mary Jane and how it came to an end. <br/><br/>In my opinion I think it would of been better if the Goblin called Spider - Man Parker instead of wall crawler etc. during their battles since he knew who he was. <br/><br/>Kristen Dunst did her part well and I'll give credit for the special<br/><br/>effects also."
"SwingBatta","Null","0","0","21 September 2002"," Middle-of-the-pack ""Spider-Man"" doesn't live up to expectations
","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), a nerdy high school photojournalist, is regularly harassed by his classmates, and has a crush on beautiful Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). He is bitten by a genetically altered spider during a science field trip, and soon develops spider-powers such as climbing walls and shooting webs from his wrist. He evolves into Spider-Man in an interesting yet ridiculous way: he poses as ""The Human Spider""  complete with a cheap prototype of his familiar costume  for a wrestling match. (A sad sight is watching the washed-up Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage play his in-ring opponent.) This leads to the evolution of the crime-fighting Spider-Man we've grown to love, and it's the baffled Parker's discoveries of his newfound abilities that provide the film's funniest moments. The acting is decent  Cliff Robertson plays Peter's Uncle Ben, and Willem Dafoe hams it up as Norman Osborn (better known as The Green Goblin, Spidey's nemesis), but J.K. Simmons nearly steals the show as blowhard newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson. They're enough to momentarily make us forget about Dunst's bland damsel-in-distress performance, which consists mainly of screaming her head off quite often. The script, unfortunately, gets stuck in the hell of movie limbo: the content is too violent for younger viewers and too juvenile for older ones (the kissing-in-the-rain sequence seems little more than an excuse to have Dunst in a wet T-shirt). Though a serviceable film, ""Spider-Man"" falls far short of its blockbuster hype. Even before setting foot in the theater, I knew it wouldn't knock me out. It's also somewhat deflating to watch the early obligatory montage of various crooks being caught in Spidey's web; it's fun to watch, yet upon leaving the theater it becomes a depressing reminder of all the nonsense going on in the world that a web-slinging superhero wearing a blue and red mask and tights would be hard-pressed to resolve.  7/10"

"Victor Field","9","0","0","15 September 2002"," Action is his reward. Yours is the best superhero movie since ""Batman"" (the Tim Burton one - sorry, but the 1966 one sucked).
","Warning: This features the odd spoiler.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man,"" as Peter Parker tells us at the start of the movie (and can I just say that, technically accurate though it may be, I hate the hyphen?), is basically a story about a girl. But that's not a reason to put people off (apart from the many people who think they're the only people in the world not to like this movie... and you aren't, okay? You aren't) - the Wall-Crawler was always more approachable than most of his breed, and the human element is one of the many reasons why Sam Raimi's movie is up there with the better examples of the genre (""X-Men,"" the first Tim Burton ""Batman"" movie, the first two ""Superman"" movies); it hits the ground running and keeps going throughout the two hours, with such a fine mixture of love story, origins tale and action that I've now forgiven David Koepp for writing ""The Shadow"" and ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park.""<br/><br/>How-it-all-began movies can play like pilots, but this one never feels like television, which is a blessing given how Spiderman (hang the hyphen, this is MY review) hasn't come off too well on the small screen, especially in the live-action attempts (anyone remember ""The Electric Company""?). As played by the engaging Tobey Maguire, we're on Peter Parker's side from the moment we see the nerdy student getting mocked by his fellows; we feel his joy on discovering his superpowers (note that he never refers to his Spider-sense tingling); and we feel his sorrow when his uncle dies, a death he could have prevented.<br/><br/>Though a chestnut-haired Kirsten Dunst doesn't look too much like Mary Jane Watson, she's charming and appealing even if she really doesn't have that much to do apart from be rescued and act as the love interest - much like Frances McDormand in Raimi's last (and also good) take on hero flicks, ""Darkman.""<br/><br/>WHICH BRINGS US TO OUR SPOILERS...<br/><br/>The resemblance doesn't end there; ""Spider-Man"" and ""Darkman"" both end with the hero knowing his beloved can return his love but choosing to live the life that fate ordained for him, over what his heart feels. Granted, ""Spider-Man""'s ending isn't as all-out sad as ""Darkman""'s (Frances McDormand frantically searching the streets of New York for Liam Neeson, who now has the face of Bruce Campbell), but it does leave the possibility of a reunion, and there's also a touch of ambiguity in that it leaves open the question of whether or not she knows his secret identity... in the climax Spidey calls her ""MJ,"" even though she's never told him her name whenever they met while he was in webslinging mode. Very well acted, and very touching. (And I didn't mind the American flag either.)<br/><br/>WE NOW RETURN TO OUR SPOILER-FREE SECTION, STILL IN PROGRESS.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man"" has flaws, of course, mainly its villain the Green Goblin and his altar ego (and father of Peter's best friend) Norman Osborn. He's not developed quite as well as his opponent, and as good as most of Willem Dafoe's performance is, some of his attempts at being a tortured soul are uncomfortably reminiscent of Jack Lord getting all emotional on ""Hawaii Five-O."" Then again, we've had the villain be infinitely more exciting than the hero far, far too many times. The effects from Sony Pictures Imageworks, Digiscope et al are uneven and sometimes unconvincing, and I'm not entirely sure about the Green Goblin's costume, but the human stuff always works (humorous and moving by turns), and since the webbing here looks like webbing and not rope (see the 1970s show), why gripe?<br/><br/>The final faceoff between hero and villain is a bit underpowered, with the real action climax on a bridge coming just before the two go one-on-one - and it's certainly less striking than the movie's final scenes, but the cards have been laid out clearly by then; it's less about a superhero than about a man, and though it has plenty of action, escapes, rescues etc., that's how it should be. Your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man's finally made a successful leap out of the comics.<br/><br/>Bonus points for J.K. Simmons (wonderful but underused as J. Jonah Jameson - never mind, there's always the sequel) and the cameos from Lucy Lawless, Ted Raimi, Bruce Campbell and Kirsten Dunst's rain-soaked breasts (extra treat #1); I wish that Columbia had taken a page from ""X-Men""'s book and devoted the end credits to Danny Elfman's score instead of forgettable nu-metal, however. (Even there, they redeem themselves with the theme from the cartoon at the very end of the credits - the ORIGINAL one (extra treat #2), not the version from Aerosmith on the song album! All together now - ""Spiderman, Spiderman/Does whatever a spider can/Spins a web, any size/Catches thieves, just like flies/Look out, here comes the Spiderman..."")"

","While no movie can match the hype it generates, this movie is still pretty good. The movie follows the beginnings of Spider-Man ( I hate the hyphen ) and his ultimate battle with The Goblin, played very well by Willem Defoe. Of course, the special effects take center stage and basically make the movie and we see some of the best special effects ever done in a movie to date. The movie, overall, measures up to the best of the comic book super hero movies and, if nothing else, a very entertaining way to spend a couple hours. If you enjoy these type of movies, you won't be disappointed. I only had a couple of problems with the movie. One, the action sequences were often so quick you couldn't really get a good look at Spider-Man. Two, as Peter Parker, Tobey Maquire was near perfectly cast, but as Spider-Man, he left something to be desired. It was the voice. That squeeky voice works fine as Peter Parker, but, as in the classic cartoon, with the mask on, his voice should have sounded deeper and more manly like. This would have been very easy to do by using a voice over with another actor with a similar but deeper sounding voice. Many die hard Spider-Man fans were disappointed, also, with the web shooter, which in the movie was the result of a mutation from the radioactive spider. I had no problem with that and thought it was, actually, a good idea. Anyway, if you see it with the right expectation, a live action version of a cartoon, and have enjoyed those types of movies in the past, you'll like this one quite a lot."

The Green Goblins costume was terrible and looked to clunky and metallic.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire does well as Spiderman although I still think Ben Affleck would have done a good job. Kirsten Dunst gives an imperceptible performance as Mary Jane. She goes un-noticed and her only asset is her hair that had been covered in lip-stick. Willem Dafoe, overall is OK as the Green Goblin, but anyone else could have done the part just as well.<br/><br/>
The films cinematography is excellent. The movie aims at more popularity than X-Men, Generation X etc., which proves successful.<br/><br/>But enough of that, this is a spectacular movie the may not be as good as the 1989 Batman(in my opinion) but is still an excellent movie."

","People were saying that the Spiderman movie was great but it was not as great as people said it was. What I was disappointed at the movie was the changes they did to the characters. I say the characters were changed WAY TOO MUCH. 1) Spiderman had hair growing out of his fingers like if he was a warewolf. What's that suppose to mean. You never got that in not even 1 comic book issue. In realife if a person had hair growing out of his fingers people would hate him every time he walked around. 2) The Mary-Jane character sucked totally. She looked like she was 55 years old than 20 years old. She looked more like a grandmother for crying out loud. In the comics or the show she looked like the proper age and had better charisma. If I was in charge of the cast I would replace Kirsten with Paula Gerces( the actress from the movie Clockstoppers). Paula Gerces would play a hell of lot better Mary-Jane character. 3) I say the Green Goblin was changed too much. His mask in the movie didn't move when he spoke and they waste money on a heavy armour suit which made him look more like a robot and he moved his arms in slow motion like if he was the Freakin TERMINATOR. The exploding grenades looked more like oranges which made it more suited for a child. In the comics they were exploding jack-0-lanterns. The green Goblin in the comics and the TV show had greenn and purple and his soft mask moved when he spoke. In the movie like The GREEN GOBLIN looked like a stiff character that had been plaigerized from the GREEN HORNET. 4) It had too much love in that movie and it is supposed to have ACTION in that movie.<br/><br/>I liked the X-men movie better because at least the characters where only changed just a little. The only changes the X-men characters had was there clothing which is what you get in comic books too.

"Raiderofthelastfries","Null","0","0","31 August 2002"," Garbage
","I will not ask reviewers to 'hear me out' on this implying I owe the mob an explanation for refusing to conform to 'the Norm' (which society appears to uphold as the highest and most noble of all virtues). From an artistic point of view this movie is garbage having no merits. The gravest of all sins committed, even above that atrocious rethinking of the classic Green Goblin costume, is that the studios saw fit to assign David Keopp scripting chores on such a major motion picture. He is an unoriginal man likely to have a boring life since he sees fit NOT to imbue his work with any noticeable personal touch, rather he seems content merely to regurgitate what he's seen in other movies ( and not doubt the tenets of screenwriting as preached in Robert Mckee, and Syd Field books). The screenplay is crassly, so stupidly, so utterly banal, and shameless one wonders if in fact the writer (writers I should say...) were fully conscious of their actions , intending to pass this off as a malicious joke on the American public. You will find, thinkers, that there is NOT ONE single original idea in the whole of this expensive Xerox. One need not reach far back into the annals of film history to see from which works it pilfered thus I will not name them, having full confidence in your film memory. The direction is boring, as is Tobey Maguire in the lead. Kirsten Dunst registers, but only as a non-entity. Her character was sorely underwritten.<br/><br/>The cacophony of sound that Danny Elfman passes off as a score shows how poor the material is, since even the man who wrote the great score to Batman cannot work wonders without first being inspired. One more grave failing is perhaps the cornerstone of its appeal to the masses. Spiderman is an 'accessible' hero( unlike Superman who is perfect for ex.). The 'accessible' superhero is an awful concept since it DESTROYS all that is worthy in the hero by giving him flaws, the underlying message being one of reassurance to the average that they may continue about their way, complacent, unmotivated to strive for greatness, since even those men we laud as our champions share our same basic failings, and may be prone to caving into temptation at any given time. This is the anathema of nobility. Sadly, it's popularity has spread in our culture not like AIDS to which there have risen many pleas for a cure, but like a disease much liked in its giving both the great, and the small a common bond. To provide a balanced review, I will write that on the plus side, William Dafoe is quite good as Norman Osborn, and is the only one in the cast who plays his role, however lousy, with something approximating true conviction. It is he alone that raises this movie 'several rungs in hell' for me; it is the only thing about this movie in which I do not find much fault. At this point you may wonder, ""What did you expect? Shakespeare""? Yes. We all should, as a collective body demand only the very best in order to receive it. Telling ourselves that we should settle for what we're given in order to not offend others, or simply shrugging our shoulders will lead only to our film industry's downward spiral( or rather continued downward spiral) allowing for mediocrities like this to arise like so many weeds, in place of say American Beauties, or Magnolias ( which are at the very at least have a view point dictated by their authors and not everyone else, a concept rendered beautiful by our society's protestations to even a single man declaring himself separate and of an unlike mind)..."

He seemed to truly care what happended to his character in the film. Of course the movie is nothing without Mary Jane Watson (played by Kirsten Dunst). And it does take more than red hair to play the part. But Dunst gives a wonderful preformance just like her co-star Maguire. As if that wern't enough. The support cast of James Franco and Willem Dafoe are also great as Harry and father Norman Osborn. They made the comic jokes when needed, they had the drama, and they had the action.

This movie had little originality, few funny moments, and a villain that has no intrigue or menace.

","If I had known it was going to be like this I would of stayed home. To start off with , Peter's first girlfriend wasn't Mary Jane - it was a blonde by the name of Gwen Stacy and it would of been better off if she was in it. However Mary Jane was a tomboy and was always waiting to make a move for Peter. Also when he got bitten by this spider , it happened when he was in college - not high school. And was this how he would actually spin his web - just touch his palm and it came out of his wrists as if it were blood ? I don't think so. <br/><br/>As for the Goblin's costume , he looked like some kind of robot. His mouth didn't even move when he talked. And most of the time when he would fight Spider - Man when they were alone , since he knew who he was he would call him Parker. If they did this in the movie that would of made it better.<br/><br/>There was one scene when his spider - sense warned him of danger when it shouldn't have. I believe Flash Thompson tried to hit Peter from behind and he moved. His senses are only supposed to warn him from his enemies - not his friends. <br/><br/>The only part I liked was when the Goblin captured Mary Jane and took her to the bridge and how he died. At least this part was correct with a certain comic story. Except it wasn't Mary Jane.<br/><br/>I believe I've said enough. For all you true fans that plan on going to see the second one , good luck."

The story goes by the comic book head-on and captures the comic atmosphere. Along with that, the Fx were above and beyond belief. Some people seem to dislike the film because of the bright look of the film, which wasn't as dark as the 1989 Batman flick. Spider-Man isn't supposed to be that way, and if you read any Spider-Man comics, you would understand why. Some people also disliked it because of the Green Goblin's costume. ""it looked goofy and looked like it came out of a Power Rangers episode""...the costume was perfect people. If you took the actual look from the comic book, it would look way too goofy, it's the new millenium.<br/><br/>The score was awesome.

"alainenglish","Null","0","0","19 August 2002"," Good but far from perfect superhero picture
","Following in the wake of ""X-Men"", ""Spider-Man"" sees the live action interpretation of another Marvel Comic book superhero to the silver screen. The results are far from from perfect but nevertheless interesting, and the very character-focused plot makes way for some fascinating possibilities for the inevitable sequel.<br/><br/>The story is simple and gets down to action almost instantly: bookish, bullied schoolboy Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) is bitten by a radioactive spider whilst on a school visit to a science laboratory.  After a while he develops some unusual abilities such super-strength and the power to shoot web-strings from his wrists that can allow him to swing between tall buildings.  Thus, Spider-Man is born.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, misguided scientist Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe) is working on a serum that will give him super-strength.  Working against the wishes of the military, for whom he created the serum in the first place, he tries the stuff out on himself.  He becomes demented power mad villain the Green Goblin and provides a fittingly insane opponent for Spider-Man.<br/><br/>The script and story-line are actually very good and set up relationships that can be developed over the course of several films.  A curious love triangle is created between Parker, his best friend Harry Osborne(James Franco), Norman Osborne's son, and the love of both their lives Mary-Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  It is this that will very likely be the basis for the follow-up.<br/><br/>This triangle is very well acted by the younger players in the film. Maguire makes for a tragic Spider-Man who, even as he accumulates and uses his superpowers, never quite loses his nebbish streak and is unable to tell Mary-Jane how much he really loves her.  Dunst is as beautiful as ever and creates a complex, well-rounded Mary-Jane.  Franco has little to do in this movie but gets a good last scene at the end of the film that smacks of promise for what is to follow.<br/><br/>The film gets a chilling villain in Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin.  From the moment of his transformation, Dafoe captures the nuances and ticks of an increasingly desperate and imbalanced man.  This is notable in scenes where Dafoe literally talks to himself in a mirror.  This loses its edge only when he is in full super-villain get-up.  His lively and scary features obscured by a goofy, unconvincing mask, it takes away some of the relish inherent in his performance.<br/><br/>With the exception of Dafoe, none of the older players are anywhere near as good as their younger counterparts and this detracts from some of the comic as well as dramatic moments in the plot.  J.Jonah Jameson is simply not funny enough as fast-talking news editor J.K Simmons.  After being attacked by the Green Goblin, Rosemary Harris descends into pitiably unconvincing screaming as May Parker while Cliff Robertson, as her husband, fudges the delivery of the film's most important line: ""With great power comes great responsibility.""  The three of them are no doubt very experienced and accomplished actors but it is just a shame their performances were less than adequate here.<br/><br/>Action scenes are well choreographed, with enough punch-ups, explosions and people-in-peril to create plenty of thrills and tension.  The CGi used occasionally looks a little bit too cartoony but this doesn't detract as its a comic-book film anyway.<br/><br/>As with the best films of its kind, this is accompanied by an excellent theme tune.  Chad Kroeger and Josey Scott's eclectic rock song ""Hero"" perfectly complements the drama and cynicism in the film's plot.<br/><br/>Not too bad a first outing for Spider-Man but, a la Superman, one suspects the sequel will be a huge improvement."

They're due out around the same time as the next albums from Brittney Spears, N Sync, Backstreet Boys, O-Town, 98 Degrees, Five, BBMak, Jessica Simpson, A-teens, Nick Carter, and Spice Girls: The Reunion.<br/><br/>To call Spider-man a ""great"" movie with ""superb"" acting is to dive head-first into the shallow end. I enjoyed Toby McGuire's performance, but I would never utter his name in the same sentence as Jimmy Stewart or Marlon Brando (or Robert DeNiro or Tom Hanks, for that matter). I was delighted as anyone to see Kirsten Dunst in the rain, but none of the characters gave an outstanding performance, which is to be expected from a movie that is not made to be outstanding, so please, for the sake of those of us who want to believe that art still exists in movies, don't call it outstanding!<br/><br/>To put this on a list of top movies is a disgrace to top movies.<br/><br/>Please save your praise for movies that deserve it, and put Spider-man to rest on your shelf next to Brittney Spears' latest album."

The part on the bridge is from the comic too, except it's Gwen Stacy instead of M.J. I didn't really like Spider-Man before, but this movie changed my ways.

","I'm not a big fan of comic adaptation, so my expectations weren't that high. Anyhow I must admit that the film was appealing, fast moving, well directed and with amazing SFX. Certainly it was miles above the dull adaptation of Batman or the phoney storylines of Superman. Overall acting was much of muchness: apart from Willem Dafoe's outstanding performance, living up to our usual expectation, the choice of Tobey Maguire as main character was preposterous. Gloomy and wooden in his acting, Maguire is the weakest point of the film. On the schmaltzy side was Kirsten Dunst, but we can forgive her, she's the only note of genuine feminility in the film. I can recommend the film to everybody likes enjoying zany plots full of sensational SFX, but if you want to watch a ""film""...that is another thing! I think it deserves a score of 6 out of 10."

","Superman was camp.  Batman was very close to the original intent behind the World's Greatest Detective.  But Spider-Man hits all marks.  What the director understood is that this wasn't a story about Spider-Man; it was and continues to be a story about Peter Parker.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst barely holds on as Mary Jane, but she pulls it out in the end. Willem Dafoe is great as the Green Goblin, but his costume disappoints. (Why have that rigid mask?  Dafoe's unmasked facial contortions were terrific--makeup would have been a better choice.)  Aunt May was believable (as was Uncle Henry), but not quite as frantic as she needed to be.<br/><br/>
The movie handles the origin story pretty well.  It skips Gwen, but needed to in order to tell a 15-year story in 90-or-so minutes.  Also, the webs shooting from his wrists (instead of from a wrist device) was new, but actually an improvement.  (How did a high school kid invent those things, anyway?)<br/><br/>Watch, and cheer.

So my expectations for Spider-Man were very low (I'm a die-hard batmanian!!). But, sometimes it happens again, the movie was better than I thought. In particular the first half, in my opinion the part that really interested Raimi: the developing of the mutation as a metaphor of Peter Parker's hormonal developing. Or a brilliant idea like the wrestling one to explain the use of a costume, necessary for a superhero but unusual in real life. The second half is more directed with the auto pilot, with the usual topics of comics movie (kidnapping of the girl, hero versus his nemesis, ecc.), but it doesn't diminish the good impression left by the first one. A last positive mention for Tobey Maguire and a negative one for Willem Dafoe (he is really overacting!) and the special effects, sometimes too evident.

"tenn-noodlehead","8","0","0","8 August 2002"," Has someone finally gotten it right?
","The history of trying to transfer elements of Marvel's Universe to the screen, either little or big, is at best rocky and usually leaves a mess. Probably the first reasonably successful attempt was the first Blade movie. You could nitpick it some, but you really didn't have to be a fan of the comic to enjoy the movie.  The next big success would have to be the X-Men. While it might not have always stayed true to the source material, it was a good movie and it did justice to the tone and theme of the comics. <br/><br/>
Spiderman, however is something of a cultural icon.  More teenaged comic readers probably identified with him on such a level, that the mere thoughts of moving him to the big screen is terrifying.  Spiderman was a teenaged superhero.  He was strong and fast and agile.  He could do things most people couldn't, but he was also a teenager.  He had girl trouble, family problems, school problems, as well as a secret identity.  He was never the strongest or fastest.  He was usually weaker or slower than the opponent he faced, but he always outsmarted them in the end.  Heady stuff for the readers.  How to capture that in the movie? And how to bring in the cast of characters so neccessary to the story?  Well they did it.  They picked an excellent cast, a good script and turned it into a fast-paced movie that stayed very true to the storyline and themes of the source material.  It isn't a perfect movie, the CGI didn't blend that well, the goblin costume left something to be desired and Mary Jane wasn't quite like I remember, but I still can't wait for the next movie."

","It's not a bad thing that a comicbook has become a big Hollywood film but there's something about the movie that says, I shouldn't like this but I do.<br/><br/>There are ideas that aren't great and action scenes that have been seen everywhere, but the film provides an entertaining look on geeky teen Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire in good form)becoming a superhero with superpowers that he has inherited from a radioactive spider. The film also tries to stress the fact that,""With great power comes great responsibility"". This quote is said to much and soon you find yourself saying, ""We know"". With that the film also gives action scenes that are good, some actors that shouldn't be there and a pretty unoriginal ending that we've seen time and time again. ***"

It was better than expected, and a lot better than other films in the genre, like batman and X-men.<br/><br/>If you expect the plot to follow the comic books page by page you will probably feel a bit cheated.

"lawrence-14","Null","0","0","27 July 2002"," An instant classic
","For once a film that lives up to the wait and hype surrounding it. Sam Raini's Spider-Man is an instant classic; a comic-strip screen adventure supreme that surpasses many of the recent blockbusters of recent years and ranks comfortably with the original Superman and Batman installments, as well as being a stunning film in its own right.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is perfect as the young, nerdy student Peter Parker transformed by a spider-bite into the web-spinning, wall-climbing, wise-cracking superhero, whilst multi-millonare William Dafoe (in a splendidy villanous performance) risks loses his massive corporation, leaving him to adopt the evil persona of the Green Goblin.<br/><br/>
This is fantastic stuff; good characters, spectacular action, strong themes, tounge-in-cheek humor, in-jokes - its all in there and used to the full. In terms of plot, the main focus is on Parker's complicated love for the girl-next-door (Kristen Dunst), which whilst somewhat unconventional for such an action film, brings a fresh, watchable and human touch to the proceedings.  Super fun - lets hope the inevitable sequel is just as good."
"Spider-Dan","9","0","0","25 July 2002"," The best comic book adaptation...probably
","Ah yes...the old superhero movies, we've seen the good, Superman, Batman and then have come the bad, the respective sequels to these movies with the exception of Batman Returns, but none hold any love from me like The Amazing Spider-man does. Maybe it's the fact he's your regular Joe till he gets bit, the fact that unlike the previous two hero's his origin doesn't seem unidentifiable (yes, ok he's bitten by at radioactive/GM spider which none of us will be, without dying). It was these points that made him the greatest superhero ever created (thank you Mr Lee) and none finally he has the film to do his greatest justice.<br/><br/>Before I saw this film I had heard many complaints about it, the effects don't look upto scratch, he should have mechanical webshooters etc,etc but my excitement and loyalty remained undeterred and I was dually repaid Raimi and co. did a fantastic job. Firstly, Tobey Maguire, who of which I can't imagine anyone else in his place, was absolutely fantastic in this role he brought the warmth, awkwardness and charm needed to carry the role of Parker/Spider-man off and clearly enjoyed himself. Whoever said he couldn't do it because he has no 'star appeal' were wrong and those who suggested the walking irritation that is Freddie Prinze Jr for the role need shooting. His love interest MJ the gorgeous Kirsten Dunst did very well in her role with what little material she was given to deal with outside her position of screaming victim, she is a great talent and should have been used more. But the two that really caught their roles inch perfectly were J.K. Simmons as the hilarious J.Jonah Jameson and Willem Dafoe as the very menacing (despite the awkward costume) Green Goblin who made his role increasingly creepy as the film went on and shining in the mirror scene. I also want to take a moment to thank David Koepp for providing a near flawless script, something ususally missing from the event movie and give the film something different.<br/><br/>The man though, who deserves all the credit must be the one, the only Mr Sam Raimi for providing us with this. He judged everything perfectly, the fight scenes where brutal over glamorous, the scenes with Spider-man swinging through the streets of New York, breathtaking, as he looked like a man that was barely in control yet knowing his every move to precision, as he fell only to fling himself back up again. Every cinematographic moment was typically Raimi as the camera couldn't contain itself twisting, turning, struggling to follow Spidey's every movement. With the odd shot aside the effects, for me, were upto scratch. The love affair between Peter Parker and Mary Jane was well comtained and the final scene between the two was a heartfelt, beautiful scene and a credit to all those involved. Raimi did the right thing fighting for Maguire (as I heard) and it paid off, this just didn't end up being a movie about a superhero it finished being a movie about a boy struggling to come to terms with his power, his destiny, his curse and in my eyes surpassed the other super hero films and becoming a franchise I actually might not end up hating. and another thing if they must bring The Lizard in for the sequel give it to Bruce Campbell the guy deserves it."

","I love this film because the main character of this film isn't Spider-man but is really Peter Parker. It's thankfully the origin story which is considered one of the best comic story of all time. Even though having Peter a complete nerd isn't particularlly a favourite idea of mine, Raimi never lets this stray away too much that Peter has a scene where he gets bullied for five bucks. Even if the green goblins looks terrible without the glider Defoe pulls of Osborn beauitfully. There are a couple of lines such as ""we'll meet again"" by the goblin after he is beaten by Spidy in quite camp style which I didn't like and I swear sometimes when Spidy is swinging they reused the same footage. However you can't deny that this film has a solid script.<br/><br/>My favourite scene would have to be the explanation of Uncle Bens death. A car jacking is a great explanation towards his death then anything ever explained in the comics. Such who remembers how one story stated that some criminal had left treasure in the Parker household.

"bburns","8","0","0","27 July 2002"," Great acting & direction save dull script & bad fx
","Let me get this out of the way first:  yes, the script was a by-the-numbers comic book adaptation; and yes, the computer-animated sequences look fake. That being said, ""Spider-Man"" is the best big-budget superhero film I've seen since ""Batman"", and the best superhero film of any kind since ""Darkman"".  The credit for this clearly falls into the hands of director Sam Raimi and the talented cast of actors he assembled for this film.<br/><br/>Since pretty much everyone under the age of 50 knows the story of the origin of Spider-Man (especially Internet-savvy computer users), I won't bore you with details of the plot, since it's mostly a re-hash of that story.  And for those who have seen ""Darkman"", you can pretty much fill in the details.<br/><br/>What I will say is that Sam Raimi--after spending the last ten years restraining his trademark visual style--now embraces it with full gusto. The same eye-popping visual acrobatics he used in the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy and ""Darkman"" to enliven cheap, sub-par visual effects are now used to enliven expensive, sub-par visual effects.  The opening titles alone are super-cool.  Who would've thought going back to his cult-filmmaker roots would give Raimi his greatest mainstream success?  And unlike so many other blockbuster summer flicks, the pacing doesn't feel particularly slow in the first half, or rushed towards the end. There are no extraneous scenes put in just to show off the special effects, and the action sequences with bad dialogue are mercifully short and are not the movie's focus.  The emphasis is more on character development. Especially Peter Parker's unrequited love for Mary Jane.<br/><br/>And the acting is uniformly superb.  Especially Willem Dafoe as scientist-industrialist Norman Osborn and his crazed alter-ego, the Green Goblin.  Whereas most great actors camp it up in super-villain roles (think Jack Nicholson in ""Batman"" or Gene Hackman in ""Superman""), Dafoe plays it straight and comes off as very believable both as a sociopathic monster, and as a man grappling with a sudden attack of schizophrenia *and* multiple-personality disorder that makes him do things he finds morally reprehensible.  The mirror scene is the best thing in the film.  Also worthy of mention is James Franco who plays Osborn's son Harry who is ironically Peter Parker's roommate.  He mimics Dafoe so well, you wonder if he really is Dafoe's son.  And of course the two leads are great, but anyone who saw ""Little Women"" or ""The Ice Storm"" shouldn't be surprised.  Even the insignificant roles were great.  In a perfect world, there would be an Oscar category for best cameo, and both Bruce Campbell and Cliff Robertson would be nominated.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man"" is not one of those films that will make anyone's ten-best list at the end of the year, nor will it be singled out for any awards come Oscar-season.  But it is solid entertainment with enough visual panache and brilliant acting to make you forget about the cliched script and the sub-""Titanic"" computer animation.  8 out of 10."

They believe they need to add this to get women/girls interested, when we are just as or even more interested in the action stuff as the men. My husband feels the same way.

I wont go on about the movies plot since everyone on here has already. Just go see the movie. One of the beg points of the movie is that the greatest actor of all time, The king himself, Bruce Campbell, has a role as the ring announcer. The characters themselves are believable and well acted. I cant stand Kristin Dunst, but even she was very good. Toby McGuire played the nerdy guy perfect and was the perfect casting for Peter Parker. Bravo Sam Raimi. You are the dirtector of the fastest money grossing movie ever made. Im proud of you my Evil Dead friend.<br/><br/>I will comment on the fools [especially the fool in the UK] who talk about the presence of American Patriotism in Spiderman. If you dont like it, too bad. Spiderman is a American made movie, Sam Raimi is an American, and he wanted to put in something patriotic. The end credits when Spiderman hangs from a flag pole with the american flag flying still sends shivers up my spine. Spiderman the movie is basedin New York, If you all recall the Twin Towers trailer that was later taken off TV. Spiderman even wears red, white & Blue. The movie itself is a symbol of America and what we are. So if you have a problem with the USA and great New Yorkers, then tough! Go see the film and quit being babbling."

","Spider Man is the best ever Marvel comic movie adaptation -  perhaps the best ever comic superhero adaptation. Tobey Maguire gives heart the movie to an incredible degree - hey, I am male and found him even ""touching"". What a great coup to have cast him as Peter Parker! Another big plus: the Green Goblin, except for his face mask, and, considering everything, not as bad as it could have been. He flew and threw his gadgets just like the comics character. J. Jonah James was magnificent, even if appearing all too briefly. And the general care taken to portray so many great little details of the comic shows a production made with love. I love George Lucas and the Star Wars saga, but ""Spider Man"" beats the new ""Clones"" movie hands down. It will never happen, of course, but, dare I say that Tobey Maguire deserves some Oscar best actor nomination mention?

","Date: 31 May 2002 Summary: Too young?<br/><br/>I thought that Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst were a little too young to be in these roles but I guess since 40% of the movie market audience is people between 18 and 24, this was a recommendation of the focus group hired to decide the outcome of the film's release. Overall, though, it was impressive. This film has been tossed around Hollywood for over a decade by people such as James Cameron and the struggle with Marvel comics to get the film rights was no easy task. Willem Dafoe was a great villain given his past in such films as 'Shadow of the Vampire', 'Speed 2' and 'Streets of Fire'. The special effects are impressive and we are continuing to see things in today's films that we have never seen before and this is one of those films. Director Sam Raimi who has been involved with 'The Evil Dead' movies and the first 'Darkman' movie, injects a venom of serious menace into this film and it's one that is done with motives by its characters for what their choices are and it is well written and not too long, like some action films are!

","Anxiously awaited by both comic and cartoon fans alike, Sam Raimi brings the extremely popular 'Spider-man' to life on the big screen which is true-to-form and a very rewarding rendition of this much adored action hero. Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast and admirably pulls off the dual role of shy newsboy by day, crime-fighter extraordinaire by night with style and grace. Kirsten Dunst is equally endearing as Spidey's gal pal as there are more than one Kodak moments shared between the two which no doubt will be archived in cinematic annals if romance fans have their vote. Yet it is the title character's battle with the arch-enemy Green Goblin, effectively played by veteran actor Willem Dafoe, which provides the many suspenseful twists and turns evidenced in their high-flying acrobatic dealings courtesy of STA CGI. While the much welcomed side plot involving Spider-man's subdued alter-ego (the mild mannered newsboy Peter Parker) adds additional intrigue as he entangles with envious friend and rival Robert Franco for the affection of sweetheart Dunst, it is the humorous (borderline silly but still funny) antics provided by J.K. Simmons as Peter Parker's Daily Bugle boss that contributes a huge amount of laughs in this enjoyable adventure that certainly sets the standard for first rate comic book to big screen transitions."

A two-year-old kept walking up and down my aisle and I actually found him more entertaining! And kids really bug me at movies. The script was terrible.

I'm sorry to all those of you who hold any film over 10 years old religiously in their hearts, but get over it!<br/><br/>I always thought Tobey would make a good Peter Park, but Spider-Man? Well I was pleasantly surprised! Where does Tobey work out? How do I get a membership?<br/><br/>I remember reading pre-film interviews where Tobey claimed how hard it was to get the charactor's emotions across when behind a mask, through body language. Ultimately I think this was a dismal failure as I never had a clue whether Peter was happy, sad of whatever when he wore the mask.<br/><br/>The only hint at his emotions, was through his voice - but because he wasn't asked (nor thought of it himself) to stress this a bit more, this too only gave you a vague image.<br/><br/>It's hard not to draw comparison to the recent Radioactive Spiderman cartoon. Somehow, from what I've seen on the series they got it spot on. It was through Peter's voice, and voice overs (i.e. when thinking to himself) that it captured his true feelings. It's a shame that Tobey's voice-overs of his thought were limited to the beginning and end of the film and weren't constant through out.<br/><br/>Incidentally, Spider-Man Unlimited (cartoon) sucks!... though maybe I'm just getting old.<br/><br/>The choreography and SFX were excellent.

","SPOILER ALERT...You have been warned. Contrary to the seeming opinions of countless movie-going Americans, Spiderman is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen.  After viewing the film this weekend, it is unfathomable that it has been elevated to the status of the top 10 grossing films of all time. The plot is positively adolescent and the script has about as much substance as one of the thin comic books from which the film received its inspiration.  The casting is questionable at best, although it might have been successful were it not for the woeful inadequacies of the script.  The film (and its dialogue) were horrendously predictable, to the point that one simply had to imagine the worst possible line and they would have predicted what phrase was coming. (""When I was up there, it wasn't him I was thinking about...it was you, Peter!"") Gag me.  When the film wasn?t drooling with sap, it was busy violently stumbling its way through cheesy action sequences.  The few such sequences that there were, were hardly enough to entertain let alone complete a film of such supposed scale.   Perhaps the worst aspect of the film (besides its clunky and mishandled beginning and middle parts) was its ending.  The film easily set up (from the very FIRST line!) that Pete had been pining away for Mary Jane since he first knew how to pine.  Pete does an excellent job of perpetuating (and developing) this relationship until the film's final scene when Mary Jane FINALLY confesses his love for him and HE TURNS HER DOWN FLAT!!!  I understand the whole ""I'm a superhero, I'm supposed to live this life of lonely desolation"" thing, but one does not spend 2 hours setting up a scenario only to turn around on a dime and abandon it for no apparent reason in the last 5 minutes of the film. That?s not good storytelling, folks.  Furthermore, Spiderman's core value, to help those in need seems to fly out the window when it comes to the person he cares for the most.  Not only does M.J. have no real family, but she has virtually no job, and she has just dumped her wealthy boyfriend.  The ONLY thing she has of any value at this point in the film is Peter.  And what was his response?  To abandon her!  Some superhero.  Far from being an admirable comic book-comes-to-life story, this is instead a nauseating teenage sap-ridden piece of filth that doesn't deserve the respect of the movie going public, let alone $300 million if its money."

","I was never a big fan of Kirsten Dunst, but I did love her performance in Interview With The Vampire. That catapulted her from nobody to somebody, She was MTV's Best Breakthrough Performance, why couldn't she have done the same job here, acting wise?<br/><br/>I loved this movie, and everyone I watched it with also loved it, my bro who read the comics as a kid loved it. He couldn't stop talking about how awesome it was.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman's score could have been better, but it could have been worse too. It should have been something like a cross between Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands and Batman. Oh well, it's still a pretty good one.<br/><br/>Some trivia for the reviewers. Spiderman was completed BEFORE 9/11. BUT the ending had to be reshot, because it ended with the bad guy getting caught in a web BETWEEN THE WORLD TRADE CENTER TOWERS. I found the Goblin's attack on NYC chilling, and realistic, as it should have been I suppose. After all, what makes a good villain? Evil plan, evil deeds, evil laughter evil voice. A villain has a commanding presence on the screen, or wherever you encounter one. He/she makes you hate him/her, fear him/her, wish he/she were dead in a terrible way.<br/><br/>Being an aspiring writer, I can say that it could have been better written, I found for example Tobey's ranting about how great Kirsten was when her eyes, blah blah blah, very dull, partially because he wasn't acting very well, and partly because writing-wise it was ranting.<br/><br/>Overall though, it is the best comic book movie I've ever seen, some of the shots did make it look like it was indeed from the comic. Loved it, can't wait for the sequel(s).<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>drawbacks: Kirsten should take lessons from Brad again. Elfman should go back to what he really did best, the writers should take some classes. Also, some may find (understandably) that the attacks by the Goblin a little too close to home, though my brother was fairly close to the crash in Somerset and he didn't seem bothered by that part in the movie.<br/><br/>pros: awesome special effects, great acting from Dafoe and Maguire, wonderful direction and cinematography, little swearing (when taking a kid to see a movie, or even an old person, this is important to me, to be able to tell a great story with as little cursing as possible), and a great moral."

I mean it was ludicrous. I might as well be watching Superman over again. Thank God, they didn't have him changing in a phone booth!<br/><br/>Besides that, there were numerous ridiculous events - such as when he got the holy crap beat out of him and yet he showed up at the funeral a couple days later without a scratch.

The script was great, too. But I wouldn't take young kids to see it.  The Green Goblin and the part where Peter gets the hair on his fingers had some kids screaming that they didn't like the movie and wanted to go home.

","Well sadly I've seen this movie about three times in the past two weeks (partly to blame is my comic-obsessed friend but only partly) and yet, as much as it may make me sound like a total loser, i would gladly go see it again...and again...and probably again...i absolutely adored this movie because it had great action but wasnt totally superficial.  i would like to say that in the comics (for all you people who think Maguire is too geeky to be spiderman) peter parker was the nerdiest comic book character ive ever seen so be thankful for what you have: a perfectly talented, very buff guy who seems to grasp his part extremely well and conveys that effectively to the audience. Tobey Maguire came across perfectly as the insecure teen without stereotyping it in any way, James Franco did very well, and i definitely have to hand it to Willem dafoe for taking a part that could easily have been the most stupid character to hit the comic-based big screen since Poison Ivy (gag), and turning it into a somewhat believable chilling villain.  Kirsten dunst did what she could but her role is definitely the weakest of the movie (the abrupt falling for Peter thing and the long string of boyfriends kinda damage her character's depth) but i have no doubt that the sequel will give a bit more heart.  The effects are beyond belief and the story of spiderman will appeal to everyone, even if they have no comic book background.  i love danny elfman! his music adds so much to every movie he has done.  the only criticism i have for this movie besides MJ's character is that the green goblin could have easliy discovered who spiderman was when he was unconscious (and where was the spider sense in that incident?).  but action films are not for nit-picking, they are for enjoyment and entertainment and that is definitely what SpiderMan delivers. i eagerly await the sequel and in the meantime im boning up on my comic books (borrowed from aforementioned spiderman obsessed friend).  see you at the theaters! a very enthusiastic 10 out of 10"

Spider-Man has broken practically every box-office record, and unlike the reprehensible Titanic and the recently released Attack of the Clones, it has done so not because of media hype but because it is a genuinely great film in every respect.<br/><br/>I'm not going to bore you with long descriptions of what I thought were the strengths and weakness of this movie. Instead, I'm going to provide you with some practical advice that will help you decide whether or not you should see this movie.<br/><br/>In general, I have noticed that there are three types of people who REALLY did not like this film and regret paying money to see it:<br/><br/>
1) People who believe movies like Batman, Superman and Lord of the Rings (movies that require imagination) are childish nonsense, and cannot take such movies seriously. My parent's were born in India and they pretty much fall into this category. All they are interested in seeing are Indian movies, which are basically poorly acted soap operas. Don't bother taking very young children (7 or younger) to see this film. I've already watched it three times, and each time I noticed that most of the younger kids in the audience did not have the patience to sit through the film, let alone appreciate it.<br/><br/>2) People who are so cynical and jaded that any movie that does not feature sex or drugs, and that actually tries to promote moral values like loyalty, self-sacrifice and responsibility, are automatically thrown into the ""simplistic crap"" category.<br/><br/>3) People who cannot stand traditional romance and prefer the usual ""We've just met, let's sleep with each other"" relationships featured in more ""complicated"" movies.<br/><br/>If you don't think you belong to any three of these categories - enjoy!"

Along with millions of other children. I have waited 30 years for Spidey to make it to the big screen and it was well worth the wait. I had the great fortune to win four tickets to the premiere of this movie and took my three sons ages 11,8,and 6. They are all avid Spiderman fans. The movie was exactly what all of the Spidey fans wanted. One that was true to the original and was pure escapist entertainment for a few hours. Just like a comic book.  The acting was not Academy award winning but good enough. Tobey Macguire played the confused Angst-ridden Peter Parker well and Willem Defoe's Green Goblin was well done. One thing that I was glad to see kept from the comic was the humor. The script has many memorable oneliners for both Spidey and the green goblin. As for how my children reacted to the violence the 11 and 8 year old no problems. The six year old did ask me several times if the green goblin was just a man in a mask?.

Toby Mcguire was an astounding Peter Parker. His looks and mannerism were just comical. I'm not a big fan of cg in films of this caliber but I got passed it because Spider-man is a different kind of super hero. His is fast, agile, and always on the move when he's swinging from building to building. Kirstin Dunst is a great Mary Jane and the dialouge between her and Peter Parker/Spider-man is pretty good. The Green Goblin was a good villian, it was like watching the first Batman with the Joker (the only good Batman) when he and Spider-man got together. The film was cursed to stay in the dark for years because of legal problems. I was really hoping to see James Cameron's vision on the film since he is a great writer and director; which is why i had my reservations when Sam Raimi got the go ahead to make the movie.

Im a huge Spider-man fan, big time into Sam Raimi's movies, love Kirsten Dunst, Tobey Mcguire and Willam Defoe, but this movie was sub-par at best. I couldnt wait for this film to come out. And when i finally saw it i couldnt wait for it to be over.<br/><br/>Ive been waiting for a Spider-man film ever since watching the made for TV films as a kid and when i heard that James Cameron was working on the character a few years ago i was really excited. Ive been following the making of the film since then and finally got to see it about a week ago. Maybe i came into the theater with expectations that were far too high cause this film totally bored me about half way threw. The story is ok, the acting isnt horrible but the film suffers in all the worst places. The pacing is completely off, which makes the film very hard to follow (too much jumping around in time, drawn out moments followed by years zooming past) The acting is good but the script blows, Its completely cheesed up, even for a comic book script. The scripting ""feels"" forced, there's no natural flow. The romance is mushy and generic and it seems like in a lot of places their should have been some editing done to flesh out key character acting moments (like Defoe's inner conflict scenes). You can tell Sony musta put some money into this film but the whole thing has a sort of, i dont know, cheap quality to it. The scenery and costumes are bland and plastic looking (I did like spidey's costume though). And after this film ive officially decided i cant stand CGI special effects. After seeing the artificialness that CGI has caused in films like Star Wars, The Mummy Returns, Blade 2 and finally Spiderman i commend any director who takes the tried and true route using technically difficult but more substantial looking older effects like claymation, puppets, robots and painted backdrops.<br/><br/>What i really cant get though is why everyone online and in reviews on TV and the general media seem to have so much praise for this film. Most of my own friends came out shaking their heads muttering how horrible the film was, one buddy of mine actually fell asleep in the theater with his girlfriend. I think maybe it's a film you want to like and because of that i think some folks just arent plain honest about how good this film really is.

Tobey Maguire is good as Spider-Man, i truly believe his nerd character, i suspect he was like this when he was younger i don't know i feel it.<br/><br/>The first part for me is the best, that is the part that gives my 8 rating, the second part wasn't very entertaining and was very predictable.<br/><br/>Rating: 7 of 10"

","I can't begin to tell you how amazing this movie is. I personally am not a fan of superhero comics, but seeing this movie really made me feel like I was watching Spiderman fly through the city, the graphics were astonishing. Also, I couldn't help but feel for Tobey Maguire's character because his portrayal of Peter Parker was so humanly real. I would seriously recomend everybody to go see this movie, even if you don't like Spiderman, this movie is more skin deep than a comic book hero."

","After the first viewing, I thought it was a 10/10.  Second time, 9.5/10. Third time, 8.5/10.  A list of the good and the bad:<br/><br/>The good: 1.  The acting.  I love Willem Dafoe.  He is the most versatile actor I've ever seen.  Tobey Maguire was decent and cute.  Kirsten Dunst is pretty enough and has enough charm and spunk to pull off the MJ character.  And J.K. Simmons was excellent!  (Call the patent office.  I want a quarter every time someone says Green Goblin!  that was really funny) 2.  The script.  It was good (not Oscar worthy) but entertaining with only a few holes.  Although some of Maguire's monologues to Dunst were mediocre. Someone was actually laughing at the scene in the hospital when Maguire tells Dunst that he told Spiderman she was beautiful, etc, etc. 3.  Director.  Raimi does a great job of getting his characters to work together.  He really brings Spiderman to life.  The webslinging scenes were especially good. 4.  Music.  Danny Elfman was really good.  His music was on cue, unlike Williams, who had good music, but it wasn't on cue at all. 5.  Willem Dafoe! 'Itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout, down came the goblin and wiped the spider out. 6.  Cool CGI, even if SW: the Clones had better CGI, Spiderman's was more believable and less rowdy and crowded.<br/><br/>The bad:  SPOILERS 1.  Plot holes become more and more visible each time you watch it.  Such as, if Parker had to sign a consent form at the wrestling match and show his face, wouldn't someone recognize him as Spiderman later on? 2.  I was just wondering how Parker managed to get the Green Goblin's suit off of Norman after he died, and why wasn't he bleeding?  Ok, I'm not a science major so fill me in please. 3.  MJ realizes something after kissing Parker in the funeral scene.  So, why doesn't she run after him?  Hello? 4.  Of course, just like Superman, it's obvious Parker is Spiderman but that's part of almost all superhero stories. 5.  Why doesn't the Green Goblin pull off Spiderman's mask when he knocks him out with gas?  It'd be a whole lot easier to get him on your side! 6.  Why didn't MJ go after Harry in high school if she wanted a rich boy? Well then again, I think Flash Thompson had some money. 7.  This one person in my theatre was laughing at all the Green Goblin scenes when Norman is battling his split personality.  That can't be good, can it?  Even though I thought Dafoe did a memorable job. 8.  MJ really would have had died in the final confrontation scene, ie her arms would have popped out when she fell like fifty feet. 9.  Batman is more cool because he's more human and more vulnerable.<br/><br/>In any case, I'm not trying to fight with the SW fans, but Spiderman is really a whole lot better than the Clones.  It's not perfect but I was entertained.  Can't wait for the sequel!<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","After seeing Spiderman, I'm pleased to see that the super-heroes we loved as kids and some of us still as adults are finally being brought to the big screen they way they should be. No more hokey scripts like the one's that destroyed the Batman series, and CG effects that do them justice. Maybe Hollywood will finally pull their head out and realize these stories are box office gold if they are taken seriously and done right.<br/><br/>X-Men was good, and it was also done with good believable dialogue and acting. Spiderman continues that trend. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst do a commendable job, and again like so many characters of this type which happen to be young adults like Peter Parker, the problems and emotions that they go through are believable. Which is why Marvel Comics stays in business as long as they have, because they inject this very ingredient into their comic books.<br/><br/>Hopefully the upcoming ""Hulk"" movie will stay on this course. I'd love to see more of the Marvel and DC heroes on the big screen in the near future."

","I was attracted to Spider-Man, not by the hype - or even the names of Sam Raimi and the brilliant Tobey Maguire - but the most brilliant trailer since Titanic.  How did it measure up???<br/><br/>Let's get one thing out of the way... there is little if any philosophical depth to the movie.  But on a stylistic level, Raimi and his collaborators have done a very good job both of establishing a couple of fine central characters and reproducing on film the zip-zap highly accelerated narrative structure of the original comics.(And doubtless Stan Lee must and should take come considerable credit for that).  <br/><br/>There are some lovely scene transitions that bring thematic echoes along with narrative economy, and the scene in which Parker realises the nature of his new-found powers is a model of emotional gear-change in modern cinema.<br/><br/>Finally (leave the best to last), Maguire is magnificent - arguably his best role since the glorious Ice Storm.  <br/><br/>No cinephile should feel embarrassed to see this film - but keep your eye on the style and don't expect too much in the content."

","I thoroughly enjoyed ""Spider-Man,"" which I saw in a screening. I thought the movie was very engrossing. Director Sam Raimi kept the action quotient high, but also emphasized the human element of the story. Tobey Maguire was very believable as the gawky teenager in the early part of the film and then, after his run-in with the radioactive, genetically engineered spider, as the athletic, acrobatic superhero of the title. His boyish glee at discovering his new superpowers was infectious and got a lot of laughs. I also didn't mind the changes to the ""Peter Parker: The Amazing Spider-Man"" comic book story that the film's writers made, e.g., having Spider-Man's web come out of glands in his wrists rather than being an invention of Peter Parker's. Especially good were Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson as Aunt May and Uncle Ben Parker, Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/the Green Goblin, James Franco as Harry Osborn, and Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. And in a small but memorable role, J.K. Simmons (""Oz,"" Law & Order"") as newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson was hilarious. Perfect casting. I also thought the special effects were very good. Although I could easily tell when Spidey was a computer-generated image (or a stunt double for that matter), it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the movie. However, I saw the movie with a six-year-old, who found the villainous Green Goblin -- superbly personified by Willem Dafoe -- very, very frightening, so I would advise against taking children younger than 10 years of age to this movie. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" comic book was a childhood favorite of mine, and I can honestly say that Sam Raimi has done it justice! I'm going to go see this movie again (sans terrified six-year-old). Everybody enjoyed the movie along with me."

Now the bad news:  ""Spider-Man"" does not have enough sharp and fun action sequences to keep it from bogging down with monotonous and mundane dialogue and sappy characters.  Willem Dafoe is the standout actor, but if you want to see him in an intelligent film that doesn't bore or bog down, see ""Shadow of the Vampire"", or even the older movie, ""Platoon"".

","In my youth back in the 60's, I went to the local drugstore every Tuesday right after school to use my allowance to buy all the newest editions of the Marvel comics available (Fantastic Four, Thor, the Hulk, Daredevil, Captain America, etc.) and Spiderman was one of my favorites.  I far preferred Marvel comics to DC (Superman, Batman) because they illustrated real people put into extraordinary circumstances, complete with emotion and angst.  In my opinion, Sam Raimi captured the essence of what Stan Lee intended in creating these masterpieces... I honestly don't know how it could have been better.  Spiderman the movie brought back a lot of memories from my youth, as I used to identify with Peter Parker (the nerd) quite a lot.  The casting was perfect, the special effects were great, and the story conveyed exactly what the comic(s) always emphasized: ""With great power comes great responsibility.""<br/><br/>But, in all honesty, I would have like to seen Peter get a chance to boff MJ, at least once...<br/><br/>All in all, a masterpiece that raised the significantly raises the bar for movies made from comics.

","Upon hearing that Sam ""Xena"" Raimi was directing the big screen treatment of Spider Hyphen Man, I was shocked. Of course I loved the Evil Dead series, but everything he's done since then has bit the big one. However I really did enjoy Spider Hyphen Man. It had some amazing action sequences and an okay plot which is all you can really ask for in a big summer movie. As for Mary Jane though, I just don't get why people think you have to be a damn supermodel to be in a movie like this. She was fine. Before I go I do have to vent two gripes...One, the CG used in certain scenes (i.e. when Peter goes after the robber) was a little too XBOX for me. And two, Mary Jane is a tramp! I lost count of how many boyfriens she mowed through. Overall though, very fun."

","Sam Raimi has created one enjoyable ride.  It seems without question after watching Spider-man that Raimi is a comic book fan.  This film litteraly plays out like the so many paneled stories in the Spiderman series, and even the shots look like art work taken from many of the books.  A particular shot of Spider-man getting hit with a grenade seems like a drawing lifted from the artists pages.<br/><br/>The casting is quite good.  Maguire who is usualy bad as a leading man excels here cause Peter Parker is a young kid who is cocky yet very unsure about the weight and burden now put on him with his new superpowers.  This forces Maguire to take the role of a person who doesn't have a lot of confidence but must do what is right, and it suits him very well.  Dunst is fine as Mary Jane, and who can't like Dafoe as the Green Goblin.<br/><br/>Also while I knew the story of Spiderman's origin, Raimi gives the audience plenty of suspense in telling the already familiar story.  Some of the acting between Mary Jane and Parker is a bit contrived, maybe sometimes even a little long winded, but at least they have a chemistry on screen.  It also looks like they created the most memorable on screen kiss this year so far...<br/><br/>Also the swinging special effects look neat, can't say I've seen anything like it before and it's very refreshing.

"hockeyguy9","10","0","0","22 May 2002"," Near-Perfect
","This is a near-perfect film, in that it not only provides the origin of Spider-Man, balancing the comic origin with film-friendly changes, but it also immediately introduces the Green Goblin as well as other great characters.  I don't know that I've seen many films that could introduce so many characters in 2 hours, and give them some kind of depth and backstory. The first 45 minutes or so of this movie are tremendous.  We meet Mary Jane and get to see the whole story of Peter becoming Spider-Man, testing out his powers (some of the best parts of the movie!) and learning that he needs to use his new abilities wisely.  Then we are thrust full-speed into Spider-Man's conflict with the Green Goblin (played very well by Willem Dafoe), which does not disappoint as well.<br/><br/>I was nervous at first about Tobey Maguire being Peter Parker/Spider-Man, but within the first 10 minutes he proves himself to be ideal for the part. I now could not see anyone else playing Spidey.  He nails not only the nerdy pre-superpowers Peter Parker, but also the confident and determined post-superpowers Parker/Spider-Man.  He handles the dualities of the character very well...shy but confident, clumsy yet intelligent, meek early on and brave as the story progresses.  Meanwhile, Sam Raimi's direction is excellent.  The CGI'ed scenes are wonderful and the fight scenes not only are exciting but tell the story well.  These are what I think are the three keys to this movie's success.<br/><br/>The feel of the movie is perfect.  It's not dark like Batman was, but we understand from the get-go that Peter understands that his newfound powers bring great responsibility.  Raimi did an excellent job of making this movie feel like what a Spider-Man movie should.  He also does the tough job of helping us understand Spidey's powers.  Particularly the Spider-Sense.  In the comics, we see squiggly lines above Spidey's head to show us he knows something will happen.  In the movie, Raimi SHOWS us how Peter can sense things before they happen.  Expertly done.  The direction is just excellent.<br/><br/>The acting is between adequate and excellent all around.  Even the small roles, such as J.K. Simmons as J.Jonah Jameson, are honest to the comic book characters and done very well without detracting from the realism of the story.  After all, comic characters can get away with things film characters can't.  The pacing of the story is perfect.  I never felt that anything was rushed, nor that anything dragged.  I saw this movie three times in the first week and a half, and it never bored me, and the pacing was the reason. And finally, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco were good in their roles as Mary Jane and Harry Osborn.  Dunst didn't get a lot to work with script-wise, as her character wasn't given an enormous amount of depth, but she works with what she was given excellently and at least makes us understand why Peter loves her so much.  Franco does a good job of showing Harry's struggle with his relationship with his father, and in a lot of ways, Harry is the character that develops the most throughout the film.<br/><br/>All in all, an excellent film in every way.  It is so good that I can only think of two extremely minor things that I didn't like.  One was after the kiss, where they show Mary Jane in slow motion for a second, looking up. That was tacky and cliche, and it should have gone to the next scene after showing the sky with the rain falling.  The other was when we get a closeup of M.J. swinging with Spidey.  Spidey doesn't move whatsoever as M.J. is looking around, and it looks pretty awkward and fake.  That's a total of about 3 seconds of film.  Pretty minor flaws!  Really close to perfectly done.  A wonderful film.  And as a side note, I can't believe people actually have beef with the organic web-shooters.  Who cares?  The way they happened naturally accounted for some of the funnier parts of the movie, so I've got no problem with it.  And since when did comic book heroes need logic explanations, anyway?  10/10."

","Granted, Spiderman does have some excellent special effects, and it does have some above average camera work, but apart from that it's all hype.<br/><br/>None of the actors can really carry this movie. Neither Tobey Maguire, nor Kirsten Dunst are actually believable in their roles; the worst performance however is delivered by Willem Dafoe. While he makes a decent attempt, he simply cannot put any motive or sense in the Green Goblin. I don't think he is to blame, though, I doubt anyone could with a character so ridiculous. The real problem with the movie however lies with the plot. It is so absolutely laughable and predictable that one might be tempted to write this whole thing off as a comedy that tries to make fun of the genre. Such an approach could actually work - the movie however takes itself way to seriously for that.<br/><br/>Maybe the picture is watch able if you have read the Spiderman comics. I never have - for me it was a perfect example of a movie that needed not be made.<br/><br/>Infinitely inferior to that other comic-book-superhero-movie: X-Men.<br/><br/>4 out of 10 (for camerawork)"

","Overall, this was an above-average effort at transforming Spider-Man the comic superhero into his movie counterpart. Given all the hype of the film though, I was a touch disappointed with this first part of a probable 3 episode series. It was entertaining stuff but at times the film seemed to fall between a romance/drama flick (emphasised by the nature of the ending) and a superhero action flick. Throughout Peter Parker was portrayed way too nerdy and besotted with the girl. Another actor -less geeky would have been a better choice than Tobey Maguire. There were too many sentimental scenes for this genre of movie- Spiderman's famous sense of humour was completely discarded-hopefully this side of his character will be developed in the sequel. I'd prefer this any day to the ""blubbing"" Parker that was seen here. The character played by Kirsten Dunst was iffy- portrayed as a materialistic, boyfriend-changing, Broadway wannabe who by the end is deeply ""in love"" with the nerdy Parker. This didn't really work and seemed contrived. The pacing was erratic at times - a measured build-up to develop the characters and introduce Spiderman...good, but then within seconds of film-time he's ""well known"" by everybody in New York City (this worked well in Ghostbusters '84 -but not here!) Also the Green Goblin character was a bit of a mystery-and what was with the ridiculous mask?! The best moments were when Spidey was in action- kicking ass,swinging through the avenues of Manhattan, posturing athletically- basically being a superhero. The special effects were good and Spiderman's acrobatics-enthralling, along with a mix of some really humourous moments and some great action scenes. The best characters in the movie were the ones who ""had character"" -Parker's uncle, Willem Dafoe's Dr Osborne and the newspaper editor Jamison. Look forward to Spiderman II. Overall rating 7/10."
"GotWookiee","7","0","0","23 May 2002"," Mediocre
","I have to say I was a pleasantly surprised by Spider-Man. I've never really like movies based on comic books, other than Tim Burton's Batman (1989) and the Superman films with Christopher Reeve. Spider-Man was much better than I had anticipated. It had some really wonderful action scenes, not just hard-pounding, visceral thrill-rides, but scenes that really excited you and made you wanna stand up and shout ""Go get 'em, Spider-Man!"" It thankfully didn't score the action sequences with the latest ""rock music"" like The Matrix did. Sam Ramai definately made some effort to not make Spider-Man as dated as The Matrix will be in 10-20 years.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire and William Dafoe have always been excellent actors. I really like Maguire's performance in Cider House Rules. But beyond that, the acting was wooden, especially in some key moments such as the scene with Uncle Ben in the station wagon, and the final graveyard scenes. The actors, especially Kirsten Dunst, sounded like they were reading lines rather than speaking. It wasn't the writing, just the performances, and it really hurt the film most during many of the emotional or philosophically important scenes. This is what really brought the film down to a mediocre C level. Action, special effects, and heroic derring-doo don't make up for weak performances. Allot of this film is for Joe Sixpack, who goes to the movies for laughs and action and snickers at everything else. If it wasn't for the fact that it's attached to the Spider-Man comic book, the film would have been forgotten in just a few short years."

","I want to compare this movie with the classic Batman movie from 1989. The movie resembles a lot to the classic by Tim Burton, but Spider-Man fails in delivering strong characters. In the Batman movie the character of Bruce Wayne is deeply affected by the murder of his parents and the movie explains how he has become the person he is. In Spider-Man Peter Parker is bitten by a spider and the action starts from there, now that's just a little too simple for me. I also thought the Green Goblin was kind of a corny villain. The suit he wears is incredibly boring and looks a lot like one from the Japanese Ultraman. Also character building is an issue here, Willem Dafoe does a fine job, but his character isn't really frightening. Compared to Jack Nicholson's Joker he is just a wimp. Still Spider-Man is a fun movie to watch and it will not bore you. But it is not the classic it could have been. Rating : 3 stars out of 5"

The action sequences are satisfying, the entertainment value is pretty high. What distinguishes this film from others opening at the beginning of the summer season is the remarkably fine acting of Tobey MacGuire and Willem Dafoe. Lucas should pay attention here--it pays to use actors who know their way around a film script. The acting itself gives a sense of immediacy and the performances provide depth to already familiar characters. As far as story goes, it is very much in keeping with what you already know about the Spiderman story, and the romantic subplot remains appropriately in the background as motivation to propel the classic good-versus-evil plot. An excellent movie, perhaps even more appreciated after one views the mediocre Star Wars: Episode II.

Furthermore, all of the cast does a great job of portraying the enemies and friends of Spidey, Toby Maguire was perfect for his part. The storyline hints towards a sequel and supplies a great ending.

","Star Wars 2 was blah, Scooby Doo *sudden onset of shudders*that's not worth the film its printed on-I can tell even without having seen the entire film(God willing I should never board an airplane with that atrocity as the entertainment), the rest of the summer fare looks typical, and even though Anthony Hopkins-one of my fave actors-is in that movie with Chris Rock, I WILL never forgive the producer of that one for his abominable perversion of Pearl Harbor. NEVER. HE will never get a dime from me ever again, and neither will Michael Bay. But I digress; while those films look to range from passable to rotting garbage, Spidey SWINGS.<br/><br/>This film is like a blast of innocence, much needed in our jaded, cynical times. It's a terrific summer movie, very well put together, very well acted, which aside from the enormous ads prominently displayed in the Times Square sequence, seems rather wholesome, and pure.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is great in the lead. He has a sweet, geeky sort of charm along with a terrific body that makes for an agreeable hero. I was with him all the way.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst makes Peter's crush on her infectious to the male audience members. She is the girlfriend everyone wishes they could have from the way she twirls her hair to her sweet, high laugh-not to mention her adorable smile.<br/><br/>William Dafoe is a rather weak villan, and that mask is ridiculous. His best moments are when perfectly calm. As businessman he is sinister, velvet voiced Christopher Walker clone that brings to mind that actor's terrific turn as Max Shreck in Batman Returns.<br/><br/>James Franco is barely given time to stretch his acting muscles as Dafoe's son, Harry. But when he does, I have to say he does a good job. The relationship between father and son from the comics is truly brought to life in their brief scenes together.<br/><br/>All in all, an ace job. The first time I enjoyed, but the second time-I LOVED it. Without the big crowd, I guess, it's easier to focus on the movie, as opposed to the audiences loud, sudden outbursts. A 10 out of 10."

There was some parts where I'd jump up from my seat and felt my heart jump up to my throat but hey. Tobey-wow. He was so great as Spider-man and Peter. I especially like the part where he was trying to command the web to come out. That was funny. I remembered me clapping and cheering at some parts and at the end of the movie I was like, ""I gotta get this when it comes out to video."" Now since I heard there will be a sequel which I was hoping, now, I'm truly excited and looking forward to. If Tobey or Kirsten is reading it, GOOD JOB OF BEING PART OF THIS. You guys were so good. I'm not an huge fan of comic books or of the cartoon, but now Spidey tops the cake. One more thing: The director directed it so well.

It's not that I didn't like the movie, which I did, but I do hope that Spider 2 would be far better than this one. I enjoyed seeing Tobey Maguire as Spider-man and Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane.

","As one of the most anticipated movies of the past few decades, fans (myself included) were really holding their breath for a phenominal film.  Now that it's finally out, people are giving it all sorts of praise, but come on, it was OK, but there have been better comic book movies, such as the first Batman or even X-Men.<br/><br/>For those of us that know the origin story, the first half of the movie was all familiar territory, but it was still somewhat entertaining.  I felt like the major flaw in the film was the introduction and use of the Green Goblin, I felt like he was underdeveloped and uninteresting.  Once he avenged the corporate downfall of Norman Osborn, he just wanted to blow stuff up for the sake of mayhem.  Then he fought Spider-Man a few times, including once where he knocked him unconscious and didn't bother to take his mask off (what??). The reason I think both Batman and X-Men were better films is because the characters, villains especially, were more developed, more interesting, and took more interesting courses of action.<br/><br/>Perhaps I would think Spider-Man is a great film if I was ten years younger, but today I have to give it the old ""OK"" rating."
"jmt-18","7","0","0","20 May 2002"," It's like watching a live action comic book
","There have been mixed results for comic books turned into movies but Spiderman is one that definitely delivers. There is a lot to admire about this film. The cinematography from Don Burgess is stunning, credit also has to go to the editing and (despite my doubts) Tobey Maguire is brillliant as Peter Parker AND Spiderman.<br/><br/>However, this movie was far from perfect. While Kirsten Dunst put in a solid performance as Mary Jane Watson she was nothing more than fodder for Spiderman's heroics. In this day and age it's a bit disheartening to see this `damsel in distress' tactic still at the forefront of mainstream Hollywood. Also the rescue sequence bore a strong resemblence to the payoff in `Batman Forever'.<br/><br/>One area that I think will cause much debate between movie fans is the way the dialogue was used. Instead of going down the route of attempting sharp witticisms (something used to disastrous effect in `Batman and Robin' and `Blade 2') the dialogue was similiar to what you would read in one of the Spiderman comic books. While this will thrill `Spidey's' original fans it may become irritating to fans of movies who are looking for a solid screenplay.<br/><br/>All in all, a good effort to the comic book/movie fraternity. While I look forward a lot more to `X-2', Spiderman was still a great deal better than Star Wars.<br/><br/>P.S: At the end of the movie Spiderman is on a New York skyscraper with an oversized American flag in the background. I suspect that this was a scene added at the last minute because the scene involving the World Trade Centre was cut because of the September 11th attack. Fair enough, it was a terrible occurance but, as I am English, I can guarantee that it was a major turn-off for viewers not in America. But as the film has smashed box-office records, I don't think the distributors will care much anyway."

"Karlos-3","7","0","0","21 May 2002"," Great visual adaptation, but the spirit is lost..
","This movie is probably the BEST visual adaptation of a comic hero. No movie before has every captured a comic hero as closely (from a visual stand point) as this movie has captured Spiderman. <br/><br/>The moment Spidey sets out slinging his webs and swinging from building to building, you will get flashbacks from the comics you read when you were young. The interaction between the computer generated spidey, the special effects and the Spiderman played by Tobey is pretty slick.<br/><br/>
Still, I think the movie failed to capture Spiderman's most important attribute, which is not his web slinging or wall crawling or heightened senses.. It's actually his sense of humour. <br/><br/>The attribute that set Spiderman apart from all comic hero's was his constant sarcasm.. Those little bubbles above his head where he would make fun of himself after a bad landing or make fun of Dr.Doom after something he says. This whole aspect of Spidey's character is totally lost in the movie and that is a big blow to any adaptation of Spiderman's comics.<br/><br/>The script was not the work of legends, there are many cheesy parts in the movie (especially a whole scene which is totally uncalled for where Spidey saves Marie-Jane from rapists).<br/><br/>Acting is done rather well in the movie, Tobey does a great job as the nerd, Dunst is not needed for her role, it is greatly beneath her acting skills and she is too nice to be MJ, but she does pretty well and then there is Willem Dafoe whom I thought was awesome."

","Spider Man is way better than anticipated. The best and the worst this movie owns to the direction of Sam Raimi. The ending could've been a lot better, but in overall an excellent movie. The action sequences are good, and so are the everyday life of the characters. A lot of people will easly relate to Parker's high-school experiences. Good acting helped a lot: Tobey Maguire is convincing as Peter Parker, Kristen Dunst is a surprise and William Dafoe plays a great Green Goblin. The other minor characters are also well acted. Small details like Parker looking half-surprised when dodging punches in school or his very goofy uniform when first appearing as Spider Man are a joy. Another important factor is that Raimi understood that just because this is a comic-based book doesn't mean the director should turn it into clownsville, like what happened on the Batman movies, specially the last one (Batman & Robin). Most of the movie at least looks reasonably normal, with the exception of the super-hero and super-villain. It's an ordinary world, with ordinary men living an extraordinary, amazing experience.<br/><br/>Minor spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>Parts of this movie are brought straight from the Superman movie, but it's a good thing. And that's not about plot details like the fact that the hero is goofy, social inadequate, wears glasses, works in a newspaper, was raised by someone who isn't his biological father but that he loves as one, and loses him. But the scene where Spider Man saves Mary Jane from the falling balcony is just like Superman saving Louis Lane from the falling helicopter."

"nowonmai42","Null","0","0","19 May 2002"," The greatest advance for mucuous since the booger.
","The last few years have been tough for old-school Sam Raimi fans. It's not that he's disappeared - to the contrary, Raimi has been quite busy lately with some high-profile projects. Neither is it that those projects were crap. Well, `For Love of the Game' probably was. But `A Simple Plan' was a masterful change of pace from Raimi's usual ADHD-inflected style. Even `The Gift,' considerable flaws notwithstanding, was a beautiful evocation of mood and atmosphere. The problem is that the Sam Raimi of old has himself gone on extended leave. Over the years, he's gradually moved away from the manic energy and gleeful cheesiness that made `Darkman' and the `Evil Dead' movies so much fun (in particular, `Army of Darkness,' one of the greatest movies to be made since prehistoric man first picked up a camera).<br/><br/>It was all the more exciting, therefore, to hear that Raimi would be helming `Spider-Man' (pretty much the only news that could ease the disappointment that the `James Cameron to direct, Bruce Campbell to star' rumors were untrue). Such source material would seem rife with opportunities for moving object-cam shots and stupid, wiseass dialogue. Indeed, Raimi's fun gene does seem to have been reawakened by his latest project. In many ways, he's got the right idea of how to approach a `Spider-Man' film. Unfortunately, a combination of fanzine-level writing and silly costume design leave us with a `Spider-Man' that's less Marvel comics and more Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. Tobey Maguire is a good choice for Peter Parker, the wimpy high school nerd who develops the fortuitous alter ego. While on a field trip to the Nuclear Spiders Lab, or wherever, Parker gets nipped by one of the little neon-colored nasties that escapes from its cage. As we all can attest from our own experiences with creature bites, superhuman powers are not far behind for Parker, including the power to shoot sticky mucilage from his wrists (creator Stan Lee made the wise decision in the original comic not to have him secrete silk from his ass). This, along with his newfound ability to scale walls, inspires him. Why not make a few bucks as an amateur wrestler? Alas, more pressing matters are soon vying for Parker's attention, transforming him from `the Human Spider' the wrestler into Spider-Man the superhero in the process. There's a green guy in a metal suit that's been flying around blowing things up, and he needs to be stopped. It's here that `Spider-Man' begins to let things spin out of control (no pun intended). Early on, Raimi has the patience to let Parker slowly discover and master his powers, deftly echoing more worldly teenage self-discoveries and rites of passage. But by the time Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin shows up, Raimi seems to be looking at his watch, wondering how he's going to pack everything into the running time. The Goblin turns out not to have any particular plan, other than to generally wreck stuff, and to say things like `nobody says no to me!' and `time to die!' Dafoe's uncanny resemblance to a chimpanzee, when not dressed as an evil head of broccoli, doesn't help matters. Then there's Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). Poor Mary Jane. How could a character named after pot be so extraneous, so empty? Dunst bounces through no fewer than three men in `Spider-Man,' and is indeed helpless the few times she's away from them. By the end of the film, when she's finally realized - through a kiss - that the masked hero with the same build and voice as Peter Parker is, in fact, Peter Parker, and has confessed her love for the non-Amazing half of that dichotomy, Raimi has put in place the comic book ending, nearly line-for-line, that wrapped things up in `Darkman.' It's another indication of the director straining mightily for his roots, and being unable to grasp them firmly. Oh well - it's a step in the right direction, at least."

Alone from his great Evil Dead movies, I wondered what he could do with such a high budget and different script. From a directorial standpoint he succeeded and the movie was great as a result. It had lots of action, especially considering this was the first Spider-Man and a lot of introduction of character had to be done, etc. Everything was going great, until the end when MJ, played by the BEEEEEEEEEAUTIFUL Kirsten Dunst, proclaimed her love for Pete Parker. Now, I don't care what genre of movie this is or what story plot came before the scene, no straight guy and I mean no straight guy is pulling the ""let's just be friends"" line in this situation. It blew my mind. The way I figure, if I'm Tobey Maguire, the studio needs me for the next 2 Spider-Man movies, so I go for a script change that lets me get Kirsten. I don't think it would change anything that much, plus it would make a lot more sense. Let's face it, there is a better chance of a radioactive spider biting someone, giving him super powers and him using them to become a super hero, as opposed to a man declining Kirsten Dunst's offerings of love.

","All right. I am having a hard time figuring out what to say in this review without being a horrible, over-analytical, high-standards party pooper. So I'm just going to tell it like it is and hope that I'm not breaking any hearts here. Spider-Man is cheesy. I fully understand that superhero movies in general tend to get on the campy side, but this is just ridiculous. And let it be known that I am primarily talking about the screenplay here people - it was awful. To the point where I absolutely groaned out loud at least 5 or 6 times. Thankfully, I was able to stifle the rest.<br/><br/>That said, the most distressing moments for me were clearly the high points for the rest of the lemmings in the audience at the 7pm opening night showing at the Boston Common Theater (you know who you are). It's been a while since I witnessed such a high degree of repeated and inappropriate emotional outpouring from the audience. It was better than a sitcom laugh track, not to mention the mad applause that kept breaking out every time Spidey did something notable. Anyway, this tangent does have a point, and that point is that obviously a lot of people enjoyed this movie on a profound level, and who am I to rain on their respective parades?<br/><br/>Aside from reaching new heights in dialogue predictability, Spider-Man also was extra-lame in the character development department. After geeky Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is bitten by a genetically engineered spider, he turns into a boy with spider powers. I'm fine with that part. But his understanding and mastery of his new powers are far too rapid and should have been fleshed out a lot more. Unlike the comic book, where Peter uses his nerdiness to create his own web shooters, the movie hero actually has organic webs flying out of his wrists, which in all honesty is just kind of gross. And more importantly, a great opportunity for the character to become more of a self-made superhero (part of the Spider-Man appeal) is lost. The perfect casting of Maguire becomes irrelevant because the screenplay doesn't allow for him to achieve the creative and intellectual depth that we want to believe he possesses. The comments that other characters in the film make about his brilliance aren't really backed up.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe is nice and evil (just the way I like him), but the goofy and one-dimensional Green Goblin does very little besides cackle malevolently and whizz in and out of Manhattan on a flying metal surfboard to wreak havoc upon things. Sure, we get the story of his fall to the dark side, but even his alternate persona is pretty flat. A scene where he actually converses with himself in the mirror Jekyl-and-Hyde style seals the deal: this is just stupid. Kirsten Dunst is cute and perky, as ever, in the role of Mary Jane, Peter's long time unrequited love. I don't have any complaints about her particular performance as she's pretty much everything you're looking for in a damsel in distress. And she gets bonus points for having the good sense to at least fight back and kick her attackers in the crotch before Spider-Man shows up to rescue her.<br/><br/>There are still a couple of good things to be said. With the exception of one climbing-up-a-building scene where Spidey seems way too CGI, the effects are good. His super-fast reflexes make for some fun (if overused) matrix-esque action sequences. His web powers are also really cool. I mean, there is a lot of money to be made in swinging from skyscraper to skyscraper across the city in less than 5 minutes. Imagine what commuters would pay to hitch a ride with him instead of fighting for a cab!<br/><br/>All in all, I was bitterly disappointed. Next time I go see a summer blockbuster, I vow to go in with my expectations set at a more appropriate level."

I really, truly felt that if Sam Ramie had allowed that to perpetrate all his characters, I would have considered myself fully entertained.<br/><br/>But this first blockbuster of the year is really setting a hopeful precedence on this year."

","This is a fine film that draws you in with a real story and great action and ideas.  Excellent acting especially from the uncle, Goblin, aunt, and even the Newspaper Editor.  Durnst was the young girl also in Jumanji and it is interesting to see her older here.      Interestingly, this film grabs at the ideas of Luke Skywalker from the old Starwars and is not ashamed of it.  This film even seemed to satisfy most of the usual hecklers and people who laugh at all the wrong times at so many movies.  Also, many people leaving the new Star Wars mentioned that Spiderman is a better movie.  We really wanted Star Wars to be great. Spiderman has a strong plot line but does not skip the characters either. I look forward to the sequel."

","This movie takes one of the geat comic icons of our time and makes a movie that does it justice. Though I never grew up on comics, I knew who the big ones were, Spider-Man was one of those. Even though I knew little of the comic, I still had a working knowledge of Spider-Man. This is what the movie does, it takes someone who may not know that much of him and educates them in a way that the layperson can understand. This movie speaks to all ages wether you grew up with the original or watched the cartoon. That is what a movie should do."

Then there was that whole ten-minute love speech in the hospital room. I could have done without.<br/><br/>To my surprise, I did enjoy the Green Goblin very much.

","Spider-Man is a good film.  It is good because much like X-Men and Tim Burton's Batman it takes itself seriously.  The story is very close to the comic book which should please fans.  The film presents us with the familiar story of an underdog who is subjected to extraordinary circumstances.  My only gripe was with the character of the Green Goblin.  His suit seemed a bit ridiculous at times and it seemed as if the character should have been developed a bit more before becoming the movie's villain.  The dialogue is lacking in some parts and seems to have been hastily written.  But these are only small problems as the film is put together rather well.

","I'm 30 this year and have been a Spider-Man fan since I was 7. When I first heard that Spider-Man was going to be made into a movie, I was really excited! I mean, come on, reports were that James Cameron was going to write and direct the movie, with Arnold Schwarzenegger as Dr. Octopus! Mouth-watering to say the least! Then came the bombshell - Sam Raimi's gonna direct, Tobey MaGuire's gonna be Spidey and Williem Dafoe's gonna be the Green Goblin. Wow...whoopie-doo, I thought...Sam Raimi...didn't I see his name amongst the credits for shows like Hercules and Xena? Oh boy...Tobey MaGuire? Man, isn't he a little..erm..small for the role? And Williem Dafoe...he's no biggie like Arnie! Great, down the drain I thought...<br/><br/>Saw the movie yesterday and BOY, WAS I WRONG about everything! Tobey's a GREAT Peter Parker just as Williem Dafoe's a GREAT Green Goblin.  In fact, the entire cast was perfect - from Kirsten Dunst as MJ to JK Simmons as J Jonah Jameson (the only downer was Bill Nunn as Robbie Robertson - Robbie's not supposed to be fat!!). And what can I say about Sam Raimi's direction? It was EXCELLENT! He managed to find a balance between action and telling a human story (the latter being the heart of Spidey).  Misgivings about the CGI were unfounded as I found it to be satisfactory after some nifty editing job.<br/><br/>The movie has won new fans for Spidey and for an old-timer like me, reinforced my commitment to the web-slinging hero. Most of all, it has made me a fan of Sam Raimi, Tobey MaGuire, Williem Dafoe and Kirsten Dunst. Now things would be perfect if Marvel puts in as much quality work into the Spider-Man comic book series, which have seen some really crappy story-lines (the clone saga and maximum carnage series - they sucked!).<br/><br/>I'm going to watch the movie again next week and perhaps again the week after. It gets a perfect 10 rating from me and I'd recommend the movie to all who haven't watched it yet.<br/><br/>Final comments, I think the organic web depicted in the movie is GREAT! It makes much more sense than the comic book where Peter Parker gets his webs from web-shooters (I mean, come on, he gets a spider sense and the ability to scale walls like a spider but he doesn't spin web naturally like a spider?) Ideas for sequels - Warren Miles the Jackal and the original cloning story-line (examining the cloning issue that's relevant for us today); Dr. Octopus and his romance with Aunt May (dealing with the issue of trust and finding a new partner). And how about this for mind-blowing - Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Tobey MaGuire as Spider-Man in a Marvel team-up against Dwayne Johnson (aka the Rock) as The Juggernaut? Excelsior!"

"Wiseguy32","Null","0","0","16 May 2002"," Spider-Man (2002) - ***1/2 (out of ****)
","PLOT: Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerd who is constantly picked on at school.  His secret crush, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), doesn't even notice him, even though they've been next-door neighbors for a long time. But one day, everything changes for Peter.  While at a science exhibit, he is bitten by a genetically altered spider.  This bite causes Peter to gain super human strength, the ability to stick to walls, ""spidey sense"" which alerts him when danger is near, and the ability to shoot web from slits in his wrist.  Meanwhile, Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), father of Peter's best friend Harry (James Franco), undergoes an experiment which gives him equal super human strength, and he turns into Spidey's first big enemy: the Green Gobin.  Also, Spidey learns one important life lesson: ""With great power comes great responsibility.""<br/><br/>MY TAKE: Spider-Man kicks off the summer 2002 season to an excellent start. Except for some changes (disclusion of Gwen Stacy being the biggest one), it completely captures the feel of the excellent comic book.  Spider-Man sports some stylish, exciting action, while also keeping the human element intact. The performances are all excellent - Tobey Maguire is perfect as the nerdy Peter Parker.  Kirsten Dunst is also great as the beautiful and sweet Mary Jane Watson.  Norman Osborn/Green Goblin can easily give anybody chills, as Dafoe puts a lot of obvious menace into his role.  And lets not forget the excellent human element - a tragic death in Peter's family is touching, and we're really hoping that Mary Jane and Peter get together.  Sloppy direction could've easily diminished this element, but Raimi's direction is solid. There are some minor flaws in Spider-Man, like the Green Goblin's costume could've been better, but minor flaws like that don't defeat the real purpose of Spider-Man: to provide two solid hours of popcorn movie fun.  I can't wait for the upcoming sequels."

","Having just seen the dismal Star Wars Episode 2, I felt compelled to comment on a movie that truly deserves to be seen. Spider-Man is a masterpiece of adventure film making. The pace, dialogue, characterizations, special effects, directing, casting and any other elements you can think of are all masterfully done. Every scene flows into the next. This is coming from a 20 plus year reader of Marvel Comics, so I know the web slinger very well. I even enjoyed the changes in Spidey's origin-- a clever combination of Amazing Fantasy #15, Ultimate Spider-Man #1 and Spider-Man 2099's all genetic powers. The updating of the Goblin suit was refreshing, and made perfect sense in the context of the film. Tobey Maguire's performance is inspired, with even greater turns by Willem Dafoe and James Franco (best supporting actor Oscar? Hmm?). And as always, Kirsten Dunst was wonderful. Beautiful AND talented, how rare is THAT?!? The only drawback to this movie is that Sam Raimi has managed to make such a fantastic comic book adaptation, it makes Brian Singer's X-Men and Tim Burton's Batman look kind of weak. This is the new standard people. Is it Shakespeare? No. Is is Gone With The Wind? No. Is it Empire Strikes Back? No. What it is, however, is the MOST entertaining film I've seen in years-- and THAT is what movie making is all about! Bravo Spider-Man cast and crew! Encore!"

","I found the film very enjoyable for an adult audience, even though I went to an early show with a lot of kids in the theater. When the French director Trauffaut was criticized for praising Hitchcoks's Rear Window and told the reason he liked the film so much is that he had not lived in New York City and Greenwich Village. He replied that the film is not about the village but about the cinema. If I may rephrase this great quote and say that Spiderman is not about a comic character but about loneliness and not being understood. Having said, for parents who think this is a great action movie for kids, I must find the ending is rather grim. Do not expect too much excitement from your son or daughter. In fact, if they think the film is not much fun, it may mean they are very intelligent. I should add, I am not the only adult that thinks this way."

","*Mild spoilers ahead*<br/><br/>It's not really a surprise, is it? A superhero is a superhero is a superhero, after all.<br/><br/>Good thing is, this movie doesn't disappoint on many levels. It's a good movie. An entertaining movie. A nice departure from the moralistic / ultraviolent / depressive superhero movies of the last decade. And it does seem better than ""Superman"", but not quite as good as ""Batman"", which is a very, very good thing. <br/><br/>There are way too many parallels with those two movies, actually. It takes the strong, colorful, happy world of Superman, mixes it with the hero's search for belonging, and in the process makes Peter Parker's everyman character to be immediately identified with the viewer. He's not tall. He's not strong. He's not popular. Yet he wishes so much to be. He's a likeable intelligent, everyday man just looking to make sense out of his life. Then, it takes the dark philosophical conflicts of Batman. He carries a responsability he decided to bring upon himself. He is condemned to live a life he wouldn't have chosen in the first place. Once he finds some inner strength, he has to sacrifice his personal life for the good of others. That, the dark alley scenes, and, of course, the balloon parade (a scene which is lifted intact from Batman, except that now the scene is filmed in broad daylight - the parade, the ballons exploding, the aerial chase shootout). Curiously enough, this scene also features some shoots eerily similar to Louise Lane falling from the helicopter - except now, it's M.J. about to fall from a balcony.<br/><br/>There is a lesson in here for George Lucas, if he can swallow his pride for once. The lesson is, people like movies about everyday men leading extraordinary lives. Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Peter Parker, Bruce Wayne, Clark Kent, Neo, ""Jack"" - they were all ordinary men who happened to be in the right place at the right time. And they all had a jolly good time with it. <br/><br/>As such, Spider-man is a very good, entertaining film which takes its cues from 2 excellent superhero movies. Hey, imitation is the most sincere form of flattery, right?"

The characters could be better, but as the overall emphasis is on action, this is more than adequate.

","Rarely does a movie do so poorly and get the acclaim that Spiderman has gotten.  I can point out obvious flaws which have gone seemingly unnoticed. First of all I'd like to say that I like the Spiderman comic series, but I'm not a purist, it doesn't bother me at all that the web-slinger is biological instead of mechanical like in the comicbook. The first flaw is that it's incredibly poorly directed, even by cult-classic Sam Raimi standards.  I've only seen the movie once and I noticed several continuity errors and at least two shots of the boom mic.  In addition, it seems like Raimi just chose camera angles at random from a preset list, the only exception being for the swooping scenes. The acting was a bit over the top, which is acceptable because they portray comic book characters, which are necessarily melodramatic.  The plot however was exceedlingly fast, and for all the discussion that this movie does really good with the Peter Parker Mary-Jane Watson relationship, I felt it was simplistic to the extreme. One last point, this movie has a couple of scenes which should clearly reveal Spidey's true identity, such as the cafeteria scene.  Yet for some reason no one in the school, including Mary Jane thinks he's spiderman, until the very end of the movie.  My question here is why in the world the writers would craft scenes which deliberatley make otherwise intelligent people appear as morons.  The answer I feel is that the makers of this movie just wanted to make a movie about spiderman because they thought it was a cool story. Their treatment of it, however, left much to be desired in the category of quality assurance.  This movie suffers from bad writing, mediocre acting (the exception in my opinion is the stellar performance by Kirsten Dunst), horrible direction, and a general lack of quality.<br/><br/>Yet I still liked this movie, because as I said, I like the story of Spiderman, and this movie does relate the story very fast and fairly accurately."

With his new powers he must stop the evil Green Goblin while hiding his love for his neighbor Mary Jane. The acting is better than one can expect for a comic book based film. Toby Maguire does a terrific job at being a nerdy kid who has little confidence and is in love with his longtime childhood friend. Without him in the movie, it would have been a routine action film. The other actors did fair jobs at their performance, but they were nothing special. Willem Dafoe did a pretty good job at the Green Goblin, and he did what he could to make him sinister and disturbed. The talented Kirsten Dunst also did a fine job as Mary Jane, but she didn't have to be saved by Spider-Man three times.<br/><br/>The visual effects were not as bad as I thought they were going to be. They were better than most and they were able to show Spider-Man swinging through the city. The only objections that I had about them is that at most times you can tell when the images are CGI, they sometimes look like cartoons, and there is no weight to Spider-Man when he is leaping of swinging, but they are still exciting effects to view.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very good action/adventure popcorn movie that delivers in evert aspect.

That is to say, he made the movie.  It was his charm, his screen charisma that is almost entirely accountable for it's success.<br/><br/>Now, I am a big fan of Willem Dafoe, but, as good as he was, he alone couldn't have saved his poorly-scripted Goblin.  Why are villians written for the big screen so one-dimensionally?  With all due respect to Dafoe, Green Goblin didn't do it for me.<br/><br/>The special effects played like something seperate from the live action of the movie.  It was like watching a Sony Playstation version of Spiderman slinging through the city.  It didn't work, it didn't mesh.  However, it also didn't ruin the movie for me either. <br/><br/>Again, I can't recall too many movies that clearly are saved by a performer in as big a way as ""Spiderman"" is by Toby Maguire.

","...and so were the book, the strip, the TV series, and the Saturday morning cartoon. The film must have cost a big fat bundle, but it feels like TV, and everything in it has been done better on TV, as well as in other movies. What was effective in the preview--the one-liners, Kirsten Dunst's delight at being rescued, the exhilaration of the web swinging--falls flat in context because it is inadequately prepared for and because whoever made the preview didn't make the movie. For instance, when Peter is testing out his powers, the big swing across town comes too soon and too easy. Here, and in the other dramatic progressions, big and necessary steps are missing. The actors are miscast, as compared to the comic book or to the script. In addition, they are ill-matched, except for Willem Dafoe and the Ethan Hawke clone playing his son. Dunst doesn't seem like Maguire's lifelong neighbor or his girlfriend (too old, too self-centered, from a different world), Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris don't seem like his uncle and aunt, or like husband and wife, and so on. It would be difficult, I think, to match Tobey Maguire with any actor. Even so, he and Dafoe do very entertaining work, given that they're doing solos and they perforce miss certain notes outside their ranges. But between them they carry the movie. My biggest disappointment was in the lack of the surge I had hoped for from Spider Man's flights through the city. I only felt it in the last scene (which I'm pretty sure was given away in the preview); in most of the others the movements are too fast or too dark to be clearly made out, and when they can be, the super-characters often look like computer cartoons, which indeed they are. I suppose the reason their masks are stiff and inexpressive is to enable the actors to be matched more easily with the cartoons, but it weakens the dramatic scenes; we might as well be watching the cartoons. The heavies--Dafoe in his Green Goblin activities (which owe a lot to the Wicked Witch of the West) and Jonah Jameson--are too silly and irritating to be taken seriously. Most of all, the numerous rescues convey no sense of danger or relief, no joy in deliverance or gratitude for the coming of a deliverer, no reason to cheer the hero.<br/><br/>Maybe ""2"" will be better."

One of the most serious problems with the movie is that it's never exciting, there is no suspense, which is sort of the central point in an adventure flick.<br/><br/>To sum things up: put your money on something else, like renting good comic book character movies like Batman or even X-Men."

","Rather surprisingly, Spiderman has ushered in another generation of young movie-goers to summertime action like predecessors Batman (1989) and Superman (1978) previously did. Spiderman may share more in common with those movies than one would think. For nearly 10 years, all movie studios have been attempting to rekindle the summertime super-hero flame that was last seen in its full fury with 1989's Batman, but few have had the success that Spidey is apparently seeing.<br/><br/>And that is not to say its undeserved, but rather unexpected. Columbia has several things in their favor on this one, namely, a veteran director and more importantly, no super-sized egos on the marquee (G.Clooney anyone ?). Tobey Maguire seems like a natural to play P.Parker but what I found a little surprising was how fetching Kirsten Dunst was as the love interest and Willem Dafoe's believably evil turn as the nemesis.<br/><br/>
All the pieces just seem to come together for this blockbuster (and for once, the name is appropriate), but unfortunately, if history is any indicator, this is as good as it will get: the sequels almost never hold up against the original so movie goers - enjoy it while you can !"

","I originally wanted to see this movie because two other movies influenced me.  Sam Raimi also directed The Gift which i liked a lot, and i enjoyed X-Men(dont ask). I also was persuaded to see this movie by the swarm of movie unconscious people who raved about this movie.  (never trust somebody who thought Return to Me was 'cute') Anyway, I suffered through the 2 hours and came out of the movie awkward and frustrated. First off, the movie is so discombobulated and flighty that it was hard to determine WHEN THE MOVIE WAS GOING TO END!!! He saves M.J.'s life (how hard is it to say Mary Jane anyway?). Cool, is the movie over yet?  Nope, it keeps going.  Damn. The only thing that saved this movie was the casting.  Tobey Maguire is one of my guilty pleasures, from the Ice Storm to Wonder Boys, he proved that he is the king of off-beat nerds.  In this movie he was a nerd, but then he became this strong, athletic, confident guy, which broke the typecasting. Kirsten Dunst........eh.  Nothing too special.  I dont know if it was the script or her acting that made me want to claw my eyes out.  Such cheezy lines.  I mean, shes an o.k. actress, but did she READ the script before agreeing to this part?!  Come on. I am a big fan of Willem Dafoe, and even in this film he was good.  I mean, it was a trashy movie, but even so, he did a good job.  Props to Willy. So, 1 out of 10, 10 being the best...i give it........maybe a 4 or 5. Nothing too special."

","If you're a Spider-Man fan, you might not be satisfied by the way the story's being told. Some differences between the story in the comics and this movie are there. But it's not very important for common people since this movie is AMAZINGLY ENTERTAINING!!! The problems may arise when this movie is going to be made in sequels. Hopefully, they will manage it somehow. <br/><br/>Basically, this movie tells the story of how Peter Parker became Spider-man and facing many problems in his life. His love life with Mary Jane, his friendship with Harry Osborn and his enemy, The Green Goblin, none other than his bestfriend's father. But the most fantastic thing about this movie, you can enjoy the swing of a Spider-Man while you're watching. It is a great camera work that I must salute this movie. But unfortunately, we can't see any great acting of its stars. Even some scenes of this movie are too plain, the players were not acting naturally. The one who's quite natural in acting is Kirsten Dunst, who played Mary Jane, even though it's not quite brilliant either. By the way, Tobey's face and body was quite fit into the Spider-man's character but not into Spider-man's behavior as I had expected.<br/><br/>
So, when you watch this movie, just enjoy the movie for it is entertaining. For more than two hours, you'll enjoy the artistic set, the special effect (but not the computer generated Spider-man which looked too obvious) the action and the way the story is being told to you. It is fun to watch this movie, especially when you miss the superhero kind of movies."

","All sarcasm aside, i agree it was a damn entertaining flick ... hell ive watched it 3 times already ;P ... i suppose all of us love those parts when losers (like peter parker in this instance) beat the hell out of the school bully .. dunno what it is, it just gives one an inner satisfaction .. The wrestling part with macho man randy savage was pretty cool ... and i never recognized it was him till pete actually comes inside the ring and savage talks crap in his face ... i was like woaahhh, its macho-man himself... The hero was a bit lame, i suppose hollywood cuda done a bit better .. but then again, the lamer the peter parker character, the more added pizzaz it gives his alter-ego, ze spiderman .. The effects were simply outstanding ... brilliant ... loved 'em .. cant get over 'em .. gotta watch 'em again! esp. the absolute ending after he sez 'who am I? I'm spiderman' ... The story-line was surprisingly quite good ... usually u find a weak storyline in these vigilante type flicks .. but there was good transition and connexion in this flick ... esp. loved the part when pete realizes that had he stopped the robber at the wrestling arena, he proly wud have prevented his uncle from being killed .. Though i must say, after the part when Ben parker bukofies the immortal line 'with great power comes great responsibility' and the subsequent brushing off courtesy his nephew, the discerning viewer will immediately catch on to the importance of that line and predict ben's untimely demise sometime soon... The ending was quite ludicrous ... when MJ divulges her undying love for peter .. the lamest line was ""when i thought i was gonna die, there was just one person i was thinking off and it wasnt whom i thought it was, it was u pete, u ..."" ... errr whateva MJ ! When someone sees his/her death beckoning, she's petrified, possessed with fear .. and if there's just even an inkling of a chance that she can be saved, then her mind automatically looks towards that source for safety .. in this case, spiderman .. not towards a next door neighbor who cares for her ... and that little scene, when MJ touches her lips and it dawns upon her that peter is spiderman, was helluva predictable (a memorable scene from one of the batman flicks, if my memory serves me correctly) ... But, no matter how much I lambast MJ's hard-to-stomach finishing dialogues, I will not retract from the attributes of her body ... wow, what a figure... esp. when spiderman saves her from those typical newyork thugs in the rain and her heavenly body is at show for everyone to witness ;P ... Reminded me of when I was a 16yr old teenager and rewound the tape again n again for those rare bits way back in '89 I watched Terminator2 together Sarah Connor exposed her appreciable bosom for us horny teenagers to ogle at... :PP The villain now ... though not as dynamic/brilliant as Carrey and Jones in the Riddler and Harvey roles (batman forever alert), was colorful, well-acted and certainly very evil ... Dafoe, as in most of his roles, put in a determined effort and played the dissociative identity (also known as split personality) of Norman Osborn almost to perfection... All in all, a must see flick and at par with the other great superhero flicks, viz. Superman and Batman ... if not for anything else, then just for the effects alone! :)"
"Funky A","8","0","0","15 May 2002"," With the rights to a great franchise comes great responsibilities... and Raimi is up to the job!
","I always loved comic book super-heroes, like the X-Men, Batman, Superman and, of course, Spider-Man. So the fact that so many Marvel movies are going to be released is great news for me. After the very good but a bit disappointing X-Men, I couldn't wait to see what Sam Raimi would do with Spider-Man. And I must say the overdose of CGI that was the preview of this movie made me fear for the worst, and I didn't see Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. But what Sam Raimi delivers is an excellent super-hero movie that will also entertain regular moviegoers! Raimi's love of the main character is undeniable and he approches the Webslinger with the light entertaining touch required, dosing funny moments and action scenes perfectly while not forgeting to devellop the storyline, which the movie does very well, dealing with the origins of Spider-Man in a way that wont bore anyone, even those who came to see loads of nonstop action and can't wait for something to blow up... He also deals with the death of important characters very well. But the two biggest surprises came from Tobey Maguire and the special effects. Maguire was perfect in his role and the special effects were not an overdose of high-budget but cheap-looking CGI we have been getting recently. It seems some people think that if it is CGI, people can only think it looks good, although some creatures in movies like The Lord of the Rings weren't very convincing. Well, in Spider-Man, the job is well-done. Of course, Willem Dafoe was amazing as the Green Goblin... But can Willem Dafoe be anything else but great? JK Simmons is the J. Jonah Jameson everyone wanted and as anyone who loved the Evil Dead movies, I was pleased to see Bruce Campbell! Kirsten Dunst was cute and that is the only thing she had to do and the rest of the cast was good. Now, of course, the movie wasn't perfect and some of the dialogue was cheesy. But apart from the dialogue, Spider-Man is everything it had to be: an incredibly entertaining movie that will please people who love comic books and people who just want to see a good summer movie, with great characters (although the Green Goblin ain't the best Spidey villain ever and I will be more than happy to see a Venom/Carnage or Mysterio movie) and a good introduction to what is sure to become a very popular franchise.<br/><br/>84%"

Well the pacing was really good for the film. Even if you knew nothing about Spiderman you could enjoy the film.  There's action, but there's also touching and funny moments.

","Ok, I liked Spiderman, eventhough the computer generated superhero was obviously computer generated.  That worked thought for the web slinger. Toby Maguire was great and much less an amature as he has been in his previous movies.  The chemisty between him and Dunst was wonderful.  I also liked the Green Goblin played by the wonderful Willem DeFoe.  However, the costume that DeFoe wore was kind of silly.  His laugh was intense.   I also liked the person that played Jonnah Jameson!!  His way of talking was cracking me up!!  They sure didn't have him enough in it.  I am sure he will be a character in the upcoming sequals.  What's the deal with Harry?  He was saying that he will avenge his father's death and kill spiderman. Does this mean that Harry will become a super villian?  I wonder who he will play? Dr. Octopus?  I also liked the music by Danny Elfman in this movie.  It fit Sam Raimi's directorial style very well.  The movie had tinges of darkness in it.  This movie delivered the goods."

","I don't get it.  How is this movie is so popular?  It's not all that good, it's just an average, ordinary action movie.  It's such a shame because I love the Spidey comics, but this movie does not due Spidey justice. First of all they watered down the whole story line, Gwen Stacy (and the tension of two girls) is gone.  Harry's drug problems which caused such a furor by mot being approved by the comics code are left out, just to name two.  What's left is a sacchrine love / action story. Second, it's just average and predictible.  No different then any Swartzenager or Segal movie. Yeah, there are good scenes, and the action is fun.  Tobey is good as Spidey, though Kirsten Dunst is not very good as Mary Jane.  Dafoe is good, and it's nice to see someone from the great Freaks and Geeks show doing something (James Franco as Harry). Overall 2 1/2 stars at most.  Wait to rent it on DVD, your not missing anything great."

I was worried when first heard that Tobey Maquire was Peter Parker/Spider-Man.  I couldn't see him as an comic book hero.  When i saw the movie, my opinion changed completely. He was the best cast as Parker.  At times though I thought he was a little under what I was expecting for Spider-Man, but I think he did very well. And then there is the fact of the special effects.  Great, but in a few spots, it is so obvious when things change from real-life to CGI especially toward the beginning.  Towards the end, though, I had stopped noticing and was completely into the movie.  Now that I've seen it once, I NEED to go see it again.  I also can't wait for the next 2 in the coming years."

","This movie I have now seen twice.  Rarely, if ever, does a movie become more than just a movie.  Seldom do I walk out of the theater, smiling, with only one other thought on my mind.. ""I wanna do that again!""  Yup, this movie is definitely that.  I'll be honest to you all.  The movie is not PERFECT, but it IS perfectly entertaining.  You'll see what I mean after you've sat through this flick.  True, some of the CGI special-fx are not as realistic as you would expect from a film given a budget over $100,000,000.  But, they are good enough to convincingly tell a really good story.  No, scratch that last remark.  A really GREAT story!<br/><br/>Spider-Man is one of those movies that you'll remember long after you've taken those final steps out of the local theater.  I found it funny at times, heartwarming at others, and action-packed when it needed to be. Tobey is the perfect choice for Peter Parker/Spiderman because, well, he just is.  He convinces us that he's an outcasted dork who has his eyes sat upon the seemingly un-reachable MJ, who suddenly is overwhelmed with new powers and responsiblities.  He does a good job of playing Spidey.  From the sharp-wit to the honest nature of Peter Parker.  He pulls it off nicely.<br/><br/>William Dafoe does one of the most convincing Jekyll/Hyde scenes you may ever see in your life.  He's talking to his alter-personality, the Green Goblin, in a mirror.. switching back and forth between Norman Osborn and 'ol Gobbie.  It's shocking how much scarier Mr. Dafoe can look WITHOUT the Goblin mask.  In fact, I think he could have pulled of the Goblin with just a little bit of green makeup.  Dafoe IS that good in this movie.  There are some moments where Gobbie's gonna make you laugh, trust me.  They're hilarious.<br/><br/>The movie's story is really great, and it WILL entertain you.  For those who have a problem with the oragnic web-shooting spidey, no need to worry. It's hardly even noticeable in the film.  It really isn't a big deal.<br/><br/>I did, however, have one complaint.  I really wish the Goblin mask would have had the ability to move the Goblin's mouth.  It just felt a little stupid looking at that big gaping hole in close-up shots.  From a distance (i.e. when flying) it doesn't look so bad though.<br/><br/>Stick around during the credits, you'll get to hear a special surprise!!"
"beckbee-2","3","0","0","14 May 2002"," Spider-man, a superhero who falls flat
","I was going into this movie expecting a light, fun, entertaining action movie, and for the most part I was right.  I was interested in how Peter Parker was turned into spider-man, and I found the scenes where he came up with the concept for ""spider-man"" amusing, but once he decided to become a ""superhero"" I started looking at my watch.  This movie did not hold my attention, and I found the costume of the Green Goblin laughable.  The fight scene at the end was trite and EXTREMELY predictable.   Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are cute together, but they don't have very many scenes together.  (Not that anyone would go to a movie like this expecting anything but a love interest that spider-man has to save).   I think that this movie could have been a lot better if it was re-edited.  It seems to jump for one part to another with no rhyme nor reason.  Willem Dafoe's scenes where he is talking to the Green Goblin are interesting, but why was time getting the audience to pity the bad guy?   Going into the movie you already now that something will happen to Mary Jane, and that Spider-man will save her and get rid of the bad guy, all the audience cares about is how it plays out. To me this movie was slow, (we didn't see the Green Goblin until 45 minutes into the movie) and never did anything to make me engage with the characters. Spider-man is a beautiful looking movie and we all know how great CGI can be, it no long impresses me to see how real they can make stuff look, now it is important to use CGI with a purpose.  All in all the movie was slightly entertaining with way too much set up and a rather jumbled plot.  But, it is light and for the most part it is fun"

"The Movie Buff","8","0","0","15 May 2002"," Spider-Man has arrived with a big splash
","Spiderman is a well made, ahead of its time, comic book action flick.  Some of the footage in this movie is the most exhilarating I have ever experienced.  When he jumps from building to building in NyC, you feel like you are along with him for the ride.  When I first heard that Tobey McGuire was playing Spiderman, I thought it was a huge mistake, that he wasn't fit for the part.  However, Tobey proved me wrong.  Though he wasn't sensational and carried the movie, he was good enough, which is all you have to be when the title of the movie is Spiderman.  People don't go see it for the acting.<br/><br/>	The dialogue was ok, with a couple of very corny, predicable, lines that you can see coming from a mile away.  One was when Spiderman just got finished wrestling for money, but the owner shortchanged him. Tobey told the owner that he needed the money, and the owner replied `Explain to me how that's my problem' or something like that.  Then, shortly after, the owner gets robbed; Spiderman just let the robber go right past him.  Then the owner confronted Tobey telling him that the robber just took all his money, which Tobey replied `Explain to me how that's my problem.'  The ending dialogue was also kind of corny, with Dunst spilling her heart.<br/><br/>	The acting was decent, despite the presence of Dunst. Willem Dafoe was very good as the green goblin.  The best scene of the whole movie was when Spiderman faced Goblin in Times Square.  For some reason, they spent too much time showing straight up fight scenes between the two.  It would have been better to show more chasing scenes, rather than just seeing the two in a boxing match.<br/><br/>	The movie also developed the story at a good pace, not moving too fast or too slow. I would rate Spiderman as the best comic book adaptation since superman.  It might even be a better action flick than superman. After the boring dialogue at the end, the movie finishes with a very strong ending, Spiderman jumping through the city, ending up on top of the empire state building.  I gave Spiderman an 8/10."

Well so far, but I hardly doubt that any movie this summer could top this and that includes Episode 2. Just flat out, I loved this movie. Yes, I am a true comic geek, but even if I had not read any comic in my life, I would have loved it. I know this, becuase my friend loved it, and he had never read any Spidey comic! The reason that this movie is so good is that it has great action, a great plot, great acting, and of course great directing. Sam Raimi nailed it on this one. It is almost exactly like the comic sans a few differences. I'll stop here, becuase I don't want to ramble on and on. Plus I am just wasting your prescious movie time.

","This film is fun, plain and simple.  It manages to achieve the perfect balance of portraying the serious aspects of being a super hero (the ""with great power comes great responsibility"" byline) and the sheer glee of suddenly finding yourself embued with said powers (AND the rapt attention of the girl you've loved since your childhood).  Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and Willem DaFoe (get it? DaFoe??! DA FOE!!?) were all superb as well. Maguire always manages to hit the perfect human tone in his performances, making him sympathetic and believable. Kirsten...she just has to show up, and of course DaFoe was MORE than capable as the evil and disgusting Green Goblin.  The long, detailed set-up was so well rendered that when the first action sequence took place, it seemed like an extra treat, the icing on the cake.  In so many of these sort of films, the stuff between the action sequences drones on and on in an artlessly contrived fashion, but in Spider-Man it was the opposite. Kudos to Raimi and the entire production team for (forgive me) weaving the perfect web."

Early on in the movie is when the Spider-man powers are added in. While on a class trip to a museum, Peter Parker - the class nerd - is bitten by a spider that soon gives him the powers he'd never thought he have.

","When I heard that Spider-man was going out in theaters, I didn't really expect a great movie. After all, the current adaptations haven't been the best in the world; Harry Potter, for example, was a huge let-down because of the enormous missing chunks and dullness. I've been a Spider-man fan for as long as I can remember, and I guess I didn't want to see some director screw up my favorite super hero's reputation by making a below-average movie. I'm just that kind of girl who can't stand a disappointment. And so, on opening day, I listened to my friends talk about how they wanted to see the movie so badly, and when they asked if I wanted to go with them, I refused the offer. But one of the movie-goers later told me it was an excellent movie and I should watch with him (he wanted to watch it again. I was surprised) again. And so I did, and my reaction was one of pure amazement.<br/><br/>First of all, the casting is excellent. Tobey Maguire made a great Spider-man, much to my surprise. He played Peter Parker like Peter Parker should be. I don't mean the sharp-tongued witty sort of guy most super heroes are, but just a regular person who, of course, can mess up. I thought Kirsten Dunst wasn't the right type of person for the part of M.J., but she played the role pretty well. Her little speech at the end was corny and mushy, and I didn't like that too much. The Green Goblin was the best of the actors and actresses. When you watch him, you can see that he isn't acting out his part well; he IS his part. I really hated the people who would go, ""Oh! It's Spider-man!"" or a stupid line like, ""Oh gee! What's that in the sky?"" It got really annoying after a while and I was thinking, ""Yes it's Spider-man, you idiots."" The people in this movie were great nevertheless, whether they made the audience laugh, scream, cry, or fall off (or jump out of) their seats.<br/><br/>The plot was a bit off. It's just sort of the regular good against evil sort of theme and everyone knows how that will end. I did liked how the director didn't make the entire movie about the action and the explosives and the kicking and the leaping from bombed buildings and all that extra action stuff some people add to their movies to increase an audience's excitement level. There was actually a back story and mixed in tid bits that gave this movie a harder punch. But augh! The special effects were really bad! The scenes where Spider-man is swinging around the city in his costume were okay, and most of the action sequences were okay, but otherwise, they stank. The impression the audience gets in certain parts is, ""Wow. That was really fake,"" and the people watching the movie won't believe the story anymore.<br/><br/>These are only some of the points. I do think though, that this movie definitely deserves at least, if rated one out of ten, an 8 (I think it'd have to be one heck of a movie to get a ten ;-P)<br/><br/>~Bonnie *huggies and kisses* Email me!~"

","This is a really good movie, both as a movie itself and as an adaptation of the comic-book character I've long been a fan of.  As with any such adaptation, there are, of course, some changes... the origin story is a bit simplified (but still retains its impact, in my opinion), and events are 'condensed' somewhat, but that's unavoidable when you try to adapt a comic book story that developed over several years into a movie-length plot. The simplification is well done, and it avoids the pitfalls of so many comic-book based movies that try to do too many things at once (witness the later Batman movies, which by splitting their attention between two villains and their plotlines manage to do none of them justice).<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is, as one of my friends put it, 'eerily perfect' in the title role, and on the whole the movie is cast very well.  I have a few quibble here and there... it's not *perfect*... but it's very good.  If you like Spider-Man, see this movie.  If you don't know Spider-Man, see this movie, and you will.  If you hate Spider-Man... well, you probably won't like the movie because it *is* Spider-Man and not only in name.

"gary_loftus","4","0","0","14 May 2002"," Disappointing to the point of being poor
","SPOILERS ALERT!<br/><br/>I have to say I really did not enjoy this film very much. While the general ideas were good the execution was extremely poor.<br/><br/>First, the positives:-<br/><br/>The story was very true to the comics and no real liberties were taken.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe was very good as the Goblin ( even if the character, like most of the others, was very poorly fleshed out and realised ).<br/><br/>Unfortunately that is all the positive things I can say about the film.<br/><br/>Now, the negatives:-<br/><br/>My first, and main, criticism of the film is it's pacing. The film never feels settled. It tries so hard to add deep, meaningful scenes to the characters that it rushes through the action sequences and their consequences ( the first moment that the Goblin appears must last about 30 seconds and leaves you totally bewildered ).<br/><br/>Second, the deep meaningful scenes feel very false with poor acting, probably due to the awful script. The final scene, while working nicely in terms of the storyline in regard to the comics, feels very flat and totally out of place ( as do most of the scenes between Mary Jane and Peter Parker ). And, for a film with so many scenes the lesser characters are poorly fleshed out ( Harry Osbourne and Aunt May in particular ). The only relationship I thought was well executed was that between Peter Parker and Uncle Ben.<br/><br/>Next I have to criticise most of the acting, Tobey Macguire in particular. The scene where he is mourning his Uncle's death is simply him sitting on his bed with glycerine in his eyes looking slightly morose and reading his lines.<br/><br/>Finally, I felt the CGI scenes were poorly done, looking blatantly obviously like CGI characters ( Spiderman in particular ). I sincerely hope that the productions of Daredevil and The Hulk are not using the same special effects company.<br/><br/>I really wanted to enjoy this film. I was very excited to hear that Marvel were finally getting big productions of their characters and after the brilliant X-Men I had very high hopes for this, but I am afraid that Sam Raimi and co. have let me down. Here's hoping Daredevil and The Hulk can make up for it!"

","After watching camp-fests such as the Batman and Superman movies (as well as most super-hero films), this was a refreshing breath of fresh air.  This movie is probably the most realistic superhero movie made so far.  You get the feeling that these are normal, everyday people with everyday problems. The only difference is that at least two of these people have super powers. You don't have goofy dialouge like ""Chicks dig the car"" or lame scenes of Richard Pryor skiing down a skyscraper.  Instead, you get VERY believable characters who have to deal with deaths in the family, living on their own, or their best friend going out with their dream-girl behind their backs. I think everyone who watches this movie can find something to relate to."
"twiss54","8","0","0","15 May 2002"," Much better than the reviews would have us believe
","I read the reviews, waited past the first two weekends, and sat down to what I expected would be ho-hum special effects and a so-so story. I was pleasantly surprised. The story was fairly faithful to the Marvel version, and I thought Maguire gave more dimension to his superhero than any of his cloaked and masked predecessors. Granted, he's onscreen about 95% of the time, but that didn't seem like overexposure in this case. Contrary to most reviews I read, Dafoe makes a great Green Goblin, troubled and insane and evil. He didn't steal the movie as Nicholson's Riddler did in Burton's 'Batman,' but I consider that a plus. <br/><br/>Maybe it's because so much studio hype has come out about the 'maybe' romance between Maguire and Dunst (and I consider it just 'hype'), but there seemed to be some onscreen chemistry there.<br/><br/>Special effects were much better than Roger Ebert would have you believe."

"blteigen","9","0","0","13 May 2002"," One of the best movies of 2002...
","Warning: Spoilers<br/><br/>This will probably be one of the best movies of 2002, perhaps the best all summer, with that Minority Report and Austin Powers movie as rivals. Spiderman is one of the best comic book-adapted films since The Crow.  It certainly beats X-Men and Batman and Robin.  The acting is superb and the storyline is easy to follow. Tobey Maguire was a good casting choice as the masked hero who protects NYC from thugs and criminals.  Kirsten Dunst was not at all annoying like she was in Bring It On and made her character as MJ very believable.  But the best part of the movie, in my opinion, had to be Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. I've heard that people complained that his costume sucks (so what) and that he is not evil enough.  Are these people kidding?  Goblin was a very disturbing character, in and out of his costume, especially when he starts accusing MJ of being only interested in his son's wealth and in one moment delivers Aunt May fruit cake out of costume and then in the next attacks as she's saying her prayers.  But then sometimes it is easy to sympathize with him, especially when he dies and he doesn't want his son to know what he really is.  The only true villain is one where you cannot help feeling even the tiniest bit sorry for them, but these kind of characters just don't happen in cinema any more. All in all, Spiderman is an excellent film.  You have to see it at least twice in the theater.  I give it a 9 out of 10."
"Rovin","6","0","0","13 May 2002"," barely competent drama undermined by unfaithful adaptation
","There are two ways to look at Spider-man. One is as a summer escapist movie about a teenager undergoing a startling transformation from nerd to superhero. The other is as the first motion picture based on the 40 year old comic book character. In the first sense, Spider-man is a modestly entertaining summer action pic. The characters are sympathetic and there is just enough story cohesion to make the film satisfying. I didn't feel cheated, but I wasn't anxious to step in line to see it again either. The dialogue could be mediocre at times, but no worse than some other films of this genre. There were some ridiculously melodramatic touches--like the two romantic leads having lived beside each other for 12 years and never having spoken a word to each other---but overall the film delivered what it promised. And that was all.<br/><br/>But as a longtime Spidey fan I could find some other faults with the film, changes to the accepted history, which in one case actually undermined the film as a coherent drama.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi demonstrated that he could visualize a comic book world like no one else with Darkman(1990), although that heavy-handed melodramatic film suffered from a cruel streak--as if mocking the trials and tribulations of the tortured main character. Echoes of Darkman are found throughout Spider-man. Nevertheless, I welcomed the selection of Raimi--until word spread that he had decided that an audience could not accept that a high school science nerd in an IMAGINARY, FICTITIOUS, LARGER THAN LIFE, COMIC BOOK-INSPIRED movie would be able to come up with mechanical webshooter devices--a trademark attribute of the comic book character and every television incarnation. Instead, they would be organic--existing as part of the mutation Peter Parker develops from the spider bite. Now, one could point out that developing super powers from a spider bite is also difficult to accept, as is the idea that a man from another planet who looks completely human could fly around in a red cape and shoot laser beams from his eyes. But alas, the decision was made. High schooler Peter Parker would have to demonstrate his scientific genius by... writing a term paper on nano-technology, and prove his creative genius by being a rather skilled fashion artist and costume designer! Some Hollywood apologists counter that we could not expect any screen time to the webshooter fabrication because of the length of the movie. Nonsense. A one minute-montage would have sufficed. No audience member would have walked out in protest. But the webshooter issue is actually minor in comparison to another change in the origin story. In the comics, Peter originally had no friends, and while he was interested in girls he did not have any particular crush. The decision was made to condense his social experiences so that his later friend Harry Osbourne would be introduced from the beginning(thus removing Parker's status as a loner) , and to establish that Mary Jane Watson was his destined love(an embellishment not established in the comics until 20 years later). This latter change undermines the story of Peter Parker, devoting far too much screen time to the personal problems of Mary Jane as well as Harry, and creating an awkward moment for the film's conclusion. In the comics, Peter was always concerned that some super-villain would discover his true identity and hurt his loved ones---but the manner in which this is conveyed in the film's final moments is problematic and left some members of the audience I viewed the film with wondering: (MINOR SPOILER)  ""Huh? After all that talk about how he loved her, he rebuffs her advances?""<br/><br/>One other change worthy of note: The character of Flash Thompson is reduced to a one dimensional bully--in the comics he tormented Peter Parker but was actually Spider-man's number one fan.<br/><br/>The cast was certainly competent, given the material they were working with. Maguire and Dunst were sufficient in their roles, although i would not say that neither of them embodied the spirit of comic book characters. Maguire's Peter Parker was sympathetic, but subdued, lacking the introspection and expressiveness of his comic book counterpart(and as stated above, wallowing too much on his relationship with Mary Jane). As Spider-man, he did not employ many wise cracks and taunts, another trademark of the comic book and cartoon persona. Dunst's Mary Jane was well played, but her interest in Peter Parker was obvious from the beginning--a very artificial love story.<br/><br/>With the exception of the final shot of Spider-man, the FX work relied too much on computer graphics that were not always convincing, and in some cases distant, detracting from an epic feel to the visuals. The biggest design problem would have to be the decision to hide Willem Dafoe's face under an expressionless helmet rather than make up prosthetics. It detracted from the performance in a couple of key scenes. And the music was truly sub-par. Recycling the tv cartoon theme from the 1960s would have contributed more energy (although they did find a way to incorporate it into the film at one brief point). Overall, Spider-man does not achieve the accomplishment of the original Superman, nor does it fall as flat as Batman."

The performances were great,far superior than any other action movie and the great work on casting helped a lot.The effects weren't perfect but still they were very very good.The camera techniques used for this film blew my mind away!When Peter Parker hunts his uncle's murder through the skycrapers it is as if i were into a rollercoster!Breathtaking and in the same time never irritating.<br/><br/>I don't know what many of you think but the last act in the cemetery,with Harry telling that he will take revenge upon Spiderman and Peter refusing the love of Mary Jane,is great job and something different than other movies (the hero wins the villain and takes the girl).<br/><br/>My only instance has to do with two scenes.I don't want to be senseless but i didn't like the scene in the bridge,where the people of New York are throwing several object to the Green Goblin,saying that ""if you mess up with Spiderman,you mess up with the whole New York city"" or something.The second scene is the ending,where Spiderman crawls on the USA flag.Both scenes seem to be puted there just to satisfy the people after the tragical events of the 11th September.I don't have any problem against such of thing,movies are here to make people forget their everyday problems,but those two scenes seem to be just made up for this case.I hope i would not get missunderstood.<br/><br/>Resuming,i would like to say that the movie gets 5/5 points for me.A great example of superb action movie.I hope that ""X-men 2"" and Ang Lee's ""The Hulk"" would follow the standards Spidey set on.And hopefully i beg that it would be a sequel!"

","'Spider-man' is an extremely entertaining movie.  It is well cast, acted and directed.  This movie thrives not so much on action, but on characters, which is the ultimate strength of the movie.  I am thankful that there is a good deal of dialogue because otherwise this movie would have been a lot less.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is a perfect Peter Parker.  His early relationship(and awkwardness)with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst)is played out to perfection.  We get a character we can relate with, in Parker.  This is the relationship that drives the movie very well. <br/><br/>William Dafoe also plays his duel role to perfection.  This is also a credit to Sam Raimi.  The Green Goblin is captured beautifully, and the Osborns are portrayed true to the comic book form.  The relationship between Harry and Norman is very accurate.  Actually, every relationship in this movie is very true to the comic book, and I appreciated that, and they could set up the next movie quite logically.<br/><br/>What I didn't like were some of the special effects.  I understand that it is near impossible to capture the movements of such a character, and this movie made a very noble attempt.  It is obvious, however, when they switch between special effects and the live action actor.  The movements of the special effects Spider-man are much to quick, without gravity, and at times, specifically in some fight sequences, a little to bouncy.  The same can be said for the Green Goblin.  At times though, they are quite stunning. <br/><br/>
The effects are good, but the best parts of the movie are when the characters interact without the use of the effects.  The final showdown is specifically well done, and one of my favorite parts of the movie.  Sam Raimi did a hell of a good job directing this movie, and I am looking forward to a sequel.  8 out of 10."

","Before watching this movie I had doubts about this movie and braced myself expecting a non-stop concoction of mindless visuals and action where the story plays a secondary role. I was very pleasantly surprised with the whole movie as it had an excellent blend of action, and visuals and dare to say.. a rather nice story line. This film kept me entertained all the way through and I couldn't help but smile during some of the scenes. In the first twenty minutes of the movie I knew this movie was going to entertain because the producers had paid tiny attention to detail which tends to get unnoticed in some of the movies of today. I am guessing this film took a great deal of time to plan and finish and boy has it been worth it. Apart from just creating a mish-mash of a non-stop mindless action with no theme behind it the producers of this movie worked very hard to create a nice balance between the portrayal of a superhero's character and the real living man behind superhero Peter Parker. The film strikes true by showing the clumsy attempts of the superhero's unashamed mistakes when using his new found powers. In all, a lively entertaining film that is fun to watch and makes you feel close to a superhero character than has ever before possible. This includes the film Batman which does a respectable job of bringing a superhero to life but the film setting appears in a fantasy city of Gotham which makes the story less believable. Thumbs up to the producer and director of this movie for bringing a super hero character a lot more closer to life. A must see movie."

","Spider-Man is easily one of the best comics-to-screen adaptation ever. After the not-so-good attempts by Batman, Spawn (very underrated), X-Men and other superheroes (Superman did quite well), Spider-Man does, what no other has. It is an ultimate thrill-ride, with good computer generated scenes, the humor, the villain, the atmosphere and most of all - the action. All of it makes this movie a wonderful experience.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is wonderful in the role of Peter Parker and with his sort-of ""loser"" character approaches everyone of us. When he becomes Spider-Man, everyone of us somehow does too. He relates to us, as he is shown completely human, troubled and has gone through great loss of his loved ones. His adapting to his strengths is very funny. His character is very-well developed, something, we could not say for the rest of the characters.<br/><br/>
Mary Jane was well portrayed by Kirsten Dunst, but her character lacked in depth. Her attraction towards Peter was baffling, as she hadn't noticed him for six years since they've moved next to him. The best character, however, is Harry Osborn (Willem Dafoe), who acts as a desperate man, who realizes that family is more important too late and is haunted by his dementia in the form of the Green Goblin. Great casting.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie forms a much clearer message than its predecessors in superhero movies - with great power comes great responsibility. Compliments to Sam Raimi for this great portrayal of this great superhero.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.<br/><br/>Leo Zingy<br/><br/>*****/*****"

","Yes, I am a comic geek. I go to my local comic shop every week and buy anywhere from one to 5 comics (My absolute favorite being Ultimate Spiderman, which you guys should check out whether you liked the movie or not). I know that the genre of comic book movies is a risky genre. For every successful comic movie there are many more failed movies, unreadable scripts, and mindless sequels.<br/><br/>When I saw the first Spiderman trailer (The WTC web thing) I was very worried that Spiderman was going down the road of the last Batman movie. Tobey Maguire as Spiderman? I saw more trailers, started to become more interested, and soon I was dying to see this movie. It's definitely worse to really want to see a movie than to not be that interested in it, cause then you'll be set up for disappointment (Pearl Harbor, Final Fantasy and Lord of the Rings comes to mind for me).<br/><br/>So I go and see it, and I was shocked. Yeah, some dialogue is super cheesy, and yes, the CGI isn't that great. But this movie is what so many other puffed up so-called ""Summer Blockbusters"" aren't; it's fun. Tobey turned out to be the perfect Peter Parker, and the rest of the cast was right on. For me it was like stepping right into a comic book. It's colorful, larger than life, pure fun. My non-comic type friends loved it too. And considering how it is doing so much better than anyone could of dreamed off, I would love to see it beat Star Wars this summer.

After seeing Peter's Uncle Ben, played by Cliff Robertson, I began to recall some fragments of the spidey story from my youth.  ""Doesn't his Uncle die?"" I asked my wife, and she replied, ""I don't remember.""  But it has been so long since I watched the cartoons and listened to the Spiderman vinyl long-playing (LP) record album my brother and I were given!  If only I still had that today, it might actually be worth something 25+ years later!  (and I think it had the Green Goblin as a featured character as well, maybe Dr. Octopus too!)<br/><br/>The movie is long but we rate how ""good"" it is by the amount of ""seat-surfing"" we do or whether the nerves in our butts begin to tingle from lack of blood flow and oxygen!  Ha!  I am very happy to report that Spider-Man truly made me forget I even have a butt and allowed me to get wrapped up in the story all over again!<br/><br/>ONE MINOR POINT OF AGGRAVATION: This movie is NOT, repeat NOT, for children under the Age of 5!  Parents, please, please do everyone a favor (and help the economy) by hiring a baby-sitter!  My wife was astonished to see one couple bringing in an infant baby in carrier in addition to their 3 other young children, but thankfully they sat in the nose-bleed seats above everyone else.<br/><br/>I can't say the same for the 4 or 5 year old girl that talked incessantly throught the entire movie, and kicked my wife's seat (which she didn't inform me of until afterwards).  ""Mommy where is Spider-Man's Uncle?"" and ""Mommy why is that man [the Green Goblin] trying to hurt Spider-Man?"" gets really old, really quick!  (Sorry if any parents are offended by this, but...)  This movie is a combination action-adventure and life values drama, and there is no way a child under age 7 or 8 is going to understand better than 40% of the plot.  Let alone the violence, references to insanity, use of experimental drugs, killing of U.S. Military personnel (and civilians), and other references to genetic engineering.  Good grief!<br/><br/>(this is turning into more of a Spoiler than I thought)<br/><br/>I thought the ending was just fine.  When MJ kissed Peter Parker and he says something about only having friendship to give, then she touched her lips in realization of the ACTUAL truth?  (Duh!)  She knows the scoop by the end of the movie, but I can't remember if this agrees with the original Spider-Man 2D story or not.  It is a variation on Lois Lane's quandary in knowing Superman, and being in love with the man who saved her life.  (Superheroes all have pretty awful love lives if you want my opinion)<br/><br/>I can't wait for the sequel, and I want to know if Peter Parker's going to reveal the impact of his ""accidental"" exposure to the genetically enhanced spider in the research lab!?  What would the world be like with more than one Spider-Man running around?  (There's a real 'the military could exploit this' weapon for you!)"

The problem I have with that is that he looks like Jar-Jar-Binks running along the roof - TOO MUCH FLUIDITY - (straight out of 3d Studio Max).<br/><br/>The other problem I have with the movie is that it broke away from the original story-line in that his body produces the web, whereas the original, he develops the web fluid himself and has canisters of the stuff stored all over the city.<br/><br/>But the rest of the movie more than makes up for these little problems, and all in all i give this wonderful piece of work 98%."

"Keleel3","Null","0","0","12 May 2002"," The Amazing Hype Machine
","Warning, Slight spoilers.<br/><br/>As I write this review, Spiderman is sitting at the number 99 spot as the best 250 movies ever on IMDB.  Directly following is ""The Graduate"" and further down the list are ""Battleship Potemkin,"" ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" ""Toy Story,""  ""Brazil"" and ""The Great Dictator"" to name just a select few that are being considered inferior to Spiderman.<br/><br/>Now I'm not some film-school elitist that thinks scoffs and thinks that Spiderman is trash because it's based on a comic book, but I do think that hype has created a nasty, nasty product.  The movie is one of the better comic book to film translations, yet that's only possible because of the lack of all but a few great comic book films.<br/><br/>Spiderman's fun, very fun, and there's a definite energy to the film. I've seen it two times; the first was of my own volition, and the other two times were because my friends hadn't seen it and the wanted to see it badly.  I agreed, and though I tried to enjoy it upon subsequent viewings, there were too many things that stuck out as things that could've been improved upon.<br/><br/>
There's no reason to go into the story, as you can find that in essentially any review.  Peter Parker in love with Mary Jane, gets bit by a genetically-altered spider, gets powers, while his best friend's dad creates a different personality within him, known as the Green Goblin.  Action and love scenes follow.<br/><br/>Now I gotta say, I love the action scenes.  Some of them have a definite cartoonish feel, but overall they're well done.  Some complain the CG looks too fake, or the web-slinging isn't realistically portrayed, but we're supposed to be believing that a guy can have spider powers from a spider bite.  It's excusable, and believable, and I never really questioned it.<br/><br/>
However, what I did question were moments where basic common sense would be a necessity.  Mary Jane, played by Kirsten Dunst has to be one of the most ignorant characters ever on film.  Tobey Maguire, as has been stated many times, is great as Peter Parker, but despite slight changes in mannerism playing Parker and Spiderman, one does not see the split dichotomy as is seen in other comic book translations.  The reason we, the audience can believe that Lois Lane and Vicky Vale would be unable to identify the main character is beause of the vast difference between a bumbling Clark Kent and a brash Superman, or the low-key Bruce Wayne and very cynical and no-nonsense Batman.  Peter Parker is Spiderman in a costume, and Spiderman is Peter Parker without the costume.  And let's be honest, Tobey Maguire, fabulous as he is in this role, has a very unique voice.  During moments in the film, I wondered how MJ could possibly NOT figure out that they were both the same, considering that Spiderman and Parker use the same line within 5 minutes of saying it (I was in the neighborhood.)<br/><br/>
Another moment is the instance where The Green Goblin knocks Spiderman unconscious and temporarily paralyzes him, why does he not simply take off Spiderman's mask?  Would it be because he was trying to show his integrity in being a good business partner?  Look, this is the same character that had killed several innocent civilians, and his former board members.  Respect isn't a main priority for him.  Perhaps the question remains to be unanswered.<br/><br/>My other qualms seem to focus on a number of things including the writing and directing.  The first hour of the movie is great; it is much like the first hour of Superman, showing the genesis of a superhero.  Parker is insecure, but then grows confident as he continues to develop his powers. But the movie moves fast after that, trying to cram as much in as possible. The Green Goblin and Spiderman don't have their first conflict until about an hour and a half into the film, so there is little time for development of the conflict.  Likewise, the love story was written poorly.  The same sentiments that are expressed in lines like ""When you look into her eyes, and she looks into yours, you feel... etc.""  could have been done so more subtley and without as much cheese.  In general, this love subplot was needed, but could have been tightened up.<br/><br/>I love Sam Raimi as a director, but he seemed a little bit unsure if he wanted to go the tongue-in-cheek route as some of his earlier efforts (the Evil Dead trilogy) or a more profound and serious work (A Simple Plan.) The movie seemed half and half, and some moments that would have worked quite well as tongue-in-cheek (the Aunt May ""from Evil!"" scene) are played out more seriously.  In fact, the best moment of the film, perhaps because of the presence of the charismatic Bruce Campbell was the wrestling cage scene where Randy Savage in an over-the-top fashion says, ""Hey!  You're going NOWHERE!""<br/><br/>It may seem like I hated the film, but actually, I enjoyed it quite much. The action scenes were very fun, and a lot of the film centered around web-slinging which is fun.  I'm one of the few that enjoyed the score. Though it's not as memorable as some of Elfman's other scores (particularly most of his Burton efforts) that could simply be dismissed because the story was not as dark as one for which Elfman usually composes.<br/><br/>
One thing that deserves mention is the acting.  While Dunst is passable, Maguire is great.  He plays the insecurities of the role perfectly. Willem Dafoe is quite simply one of the most versatile actors of his generation; being able to play several differing roles from a sympathetic Sargeant in Vietnam, to a snarling vampire, even to Jesus Christ himself, he has a talent.  Unfortunately, there were few scenes that allowed him to show his true acting caliber.  Luckily, he pulls these off perfectly.<br/><br/>
In terms of comic book films, Spiderman fans should be overjoyed.  While I think it's definitely the most pure ""fun"" of the comic book films, I enjoy several better.  ""Superman"" while it hasn't aged well, still has a great story and acting in it, ""Batman"" showed the dark side of comics and placed it more in realism, and ""X-men"" displayed the maturity and incredibly tragedy that is usually found in comic-books, but are usually overlooked by those not familiar with them.<br/><br/>The film is recommended.  The ranking will go down in time, but for now, enjoy it. Just watch out for the hype."

","Spider-Man was always my fave comic character after The Thing from the Fantastic Four, so I have been waiting for this film for a LONG time. With Sam Raimi directing, you know it's gonna be good, and Spider-Man certainly was. Unfortunately, the ""special effects"" sucked big-time.<br/><br/> What is with all the CGI in movies today? ""Spider-man"" during the action sequences especially, looked like a cartoon. I don't care if you do it with a pen, pencil, or computer - it's a DRAWING. A cartoon. And it shows. CGI ""special effects"" are making movies look like crap. The action sequences in ""Spider-Man"" looked like scenes from a Playstation videogame.<br/><br/> ""Superman"" and ""Superman 2"" were made almost 25 years ago, and their special effects completely blow away the cartoons in the new ""Spider-Man."" Think about that - FX have degressed so much that a 25-year old film has better effects than one of today's blockbusters. Compare the scenes - Superman's first scene, Spidey's first scene; Superman's big battle with the supervillians on the streets of Metropolis/Spidey vs. The Green Goblin in NYC on the Queensboro bridge; the final shot of Superman and the final shots of Spiderman...it goes on. In every case, the FX of Superman were real flesh and blood FX, and the FX of Spider-Man were fake looking cartoons.<br/><br/> Otherwise, ""Spider-man"" was a really good movie, nice direction, good acting and casting, Bruce Campbell, the ""car"" (whoever doesn't get that one should do their Raimi homework), and other nice pluses. Jameson was great but seriously underused. But really, these asinine cartoon FX have got to go. They are making movies look horrible. The sad thing is, many people don't seem to care, and the computer geeks that sit at their computers and draw these FX actually think they look good. They don't.<br/><br/> Some people may say, ""they wanted a comic-book feel,"" but they don't understand that when you spend $120 million on a film, it's not supposed to LOOK like a comic book or a cartoon. The 1967 Spider-Man cartoon had ""special effects"" as good as the new movie, only drawn differently. And say what you want about the cheesy 1978 TV series - at least it was REAL FLESH AND BLOOD and not a CARTOON!<br/><br/> For me, the best parts in ""Spider-Man"" were when Spider-Man was OUT of costume as Peter Parker. Because those scenes weren't a cartoon. Anyone who wants to see real FX, watch the first two Superman films (heck even 3 and 4). ""Spider-Man"" was a good film that could have been great if only it had real special effects."

","While this was an enjoyable film, it didn't quite meet up to my expectations (which were pretty high - the trailers for the movie were excellent!)<br/><br/>I had three main complaints:<br/><br/>(1) The movie would have benefited by adding an additional 15-25 minutes of final footage and a little more time on the editing floor. I felt that the director/Marvel tried to fit way too much plot & character development into a 2 hour film. The end result was a congested film that didn't flow smoothly. There were also odd plot ""jumps"" that could have been eliminated.<br/><br/>(2) The love scenes could have been more polished and had less ""comic book"" script lines. It was clear that the actors struggled with many of the love scene lines.<br/><br/>(3) Marvel/Sony should have spent a little more on the Green Goblin / Spider-man special effects. A lot of the action scenes looked obviously computer-generated. Today's technology could have provided a more realistic result. The claims about how the director ""wanted"" that look are purely ridiculous and just a cover-up for where they just didn't want to spend the money. (How did his webbing work in the movie? They weren't really clear on that ...)<br/><br/>These points aside, I think Marvel/Sony did an great job otherwise. The film was fun to watch, and I really enjoyed seeing one of my favorite comic-book heroes come to life. Toby McGuire did an excellent job as Peter Parker, and many of the other characters were believable as well. The plotline of how he got his powers in the movie had a more realistic ring to it than the comic line of a ""radioactive"" spider bite.<br/><br/>I look forward to a sequel that is better than the first movie...<br/><br/>azjazz"

I appreciated the scenes when he was learning how to use his spider powers.<br/><br/>Even though the triangle between Harry Osborn, Peter, and Norman Osborn wasn't expanded upon very greatly, I'm sure it'll get treated more thoroughly in a future sequel.<br/><br/>Great movie!!!"

","I am completely surprised with the fact that I did not enjoy this film. Did I hate it? No, although it does reuse, recycle and remix key plot points and storylines from the super-hero films that precede it. Spider-man never fully takes off, and rather is content on being a fluff introduction to its title hero, filled with some campy style, dead-end dialogue, and matinee drama.<br/><br/>The film does stay true to most of the origin of Spider-man from the original Stan Lee comic (in a blink and you'll miss cameo). Peter Parker, a teenager that is picked on by his classmates and who has in fact been in love with his next door neighbor Mary-Jane for the longest time, is suddenly endowed with spider-like powers as a result of being bitten by a radioactive spider while on a class field trip. As he discovers the powers, his best friend Harry's dad, Norman Osborn, a brilliant scientist who's experimental project to create a new weapon for the army is in financial trouble and thus decides to test it out on himself, but in result becomes the villain dubbed as Green Goblin.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is a nice choice for Peter Parker, as are most of the casting choices for the film. By far the most entertaining role belonged to J.K. Simmons who plays the cigar-smoking J. Jonah Jameson from the Daily Bugle, a paper which Peter Parker sells photos of Spider-man to. Those scenes made me smile and remember some moments from the early cartoon. In fact Sam Raimi kindly inserts nostalgic elements from the early 'toons and comics throughout the movie, perhaps to satisfy the purist of Spidey fans. Now I don't know about you, but I would much rather watch a great Spider-man story told on screen rather then a few live-action recreations. In that respect the script had a lot to do with why this film just didn't deliver as well as it could.<br/><br/>I always wonder why it is in super-hero movies that the unstoppable villain is always created at the same time as the all mighty hero. Now I understand that the film may need a villain otherwise this just leaves Spider-Man discovering his powers the whole movie while fighting `regular' criminals (then again would that have been such a bad thing? This is a movie about Spider-man). I think about movies like `Unbreakable', `Batman' and even `Batman Returns', where the villains are handled much better in the storyline, and I feel as though they have a reason to be there, more than just to be part of the movie.<br/><br/>This is big budget pop-corn film not unlike any you've seen before. It drags to make up for what should be story-telling and the special effects come up short many times throughout, and that's unbelievable when you figure they had a 120 million dollar budget for this thing. I just didn't see the value on screen. They should have cut some of those out and made room for more character development, after all they do set up a sort of love triangle between Peter, Harry and Mary-Jane. I would have loved to actually feel some tension in those scenes instead of just having them involved because the script called for it.<br/><br/>If by now your thinking this thing is filled with plot-holes, then your right! And please don't say that it's just a comic film and that it's ok. Sure, some of the hero stuff you just have to let slide, but I know that this story could have been told much better than it was, but this is not why I gave it 2 out of 4 stars. I actually found myself getting annoyed when scenes between characters we're cut short by some lame explosion and/or action sequence. Enough already! I want to know more about these people. Willem Dafoe actually managed to have a great scene, where he argues in front of the mirror with his Goblin counterpart. Well done, but scenes like this we're way to few and far between.<br/><br/>The ending of this movie, especially the battle scene between Spider-man and Green Goblin, is near laughable and goes by so quickly it makes you wonder what we'd been building up to exactly. I would love to openly say the problems and plot holes they leave at the end, but as always I attempt to keep my reviews spoiler free. Just know that I was in complete shock by the behaviors of these characters in reaction to each other based on the way they'd been behaving the whole time. And Green Goblin's dialogue is pure recycled garbage villain dialogue from a million other films before. Sheesh!<br/><br/>Basically there is some nostalgia involved when seeing a comic hero I read, drew, and role played in my early years growing up, finally make it onto the big screen. It's larger than life itself. The medium of film has perfectly evolved to make a character like Spider-man shine, and knowing that adds to the disappointment of watching the end result. This could have been an instant classic, but here and now it is happy with simply being the flavor of the month.<br/><br/>Extra Note: I actually liked the fact that they made the webbing come out of Spider-man's wrists, seemed much more logical than him creating those incredible web-shooters and fluid like in the original comic. But I wonder; since they filled this film with so much ridiculous stuff, why not just leave them in. They could have been used to put him in all kinds of other dangerous situations, like he could be in a situation where he runs out of webbing, so on. Ah I can go on forever, but this isn't relevant to the film."

","Look, the romance between the hero and heroine is good in ""Spider-Man."" The goofy evolution of the Spider-Suit is even better.  But a couple of brilliant moments in a movie aren't enough to carry it to greatness. There have to be more elements in play for that.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is quirky and inspired casting - for Peter Parker.  But as Spider-Man, I must admit a certain lack of gravitas in Maguire's superhero mode.  It may not be entirely his fault; director Sam Raimi green-lit many of the film's questionable choices.  I mean, am I the only one who cringed at Maguire's squeaky delivery of: ""I'm just your friendly, neighborhood Spider-Man?""  Did anyone else feel he was forcing himself to cry onscreen (and seriously, did Uncle Ben feel like that much of a loss)?  And wasn't Spidey, as the world knows him, just a little more...sly?<br/><br/>I feel Raimi's web-slinger is a little too muzak; a little less rock n' roll.  Where's the cleverness Spider-Man had?  Where's the cunning (not nerd-intelligence, but crime-fighting smarts)?  Or is your argument that Spidey the teenager is just testing his sea-legs, and we have to endure the puberty of his big-screen evolution.with sequels?  Wasn't Spidey cooler than that?  Didn't you want to see him kick ass now?  I mean, ain't that why you read the comic books, or watched the TV shows?<br/><br/>And whose idea was it to mask Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin?  Spidey's doomed to a mask - it's a given.  But to de-personalize Dafoe's performance with a faceplate?  Oh, if you look hard enough you can see his lips move.  But does that do it for you?  Even character-wise, I saw no reason to hate him. What, split personalities?  `I need to experiment on myself because they need a bad guy by the first reel?'  Gimme a break.  Gimme something more. Make me a believer.<br/><br/>Let's play the game of  `I Loved That Part When.'  How about when Peter Parker gets J. Jonah Jameson those Spidey photos for the first time?  How about when the cop lets Spidey back into the burning building instead of arresting him?  And of course that kiss?  But what of the flip-side of this coin?  Did you buy corporate mega-millionaire Norman Osborn agreeing to Thanksgiving at a stupid apartment?  (His son couldn't convince him to let him take the BUS.)  Did you love the obviousness of Raimi's shielding Spider-Man from murder (look, a convenient pipe and three-story window)? Or was the best part when Spider-Man says, quite cheesily: `Goblin, what have you done?'<br/><br/>The Spider-Man I knew was without cheese.  He was without goofiness.  What made him great was not that he was awkward, but that he was misunderstood. Yet he did the right thing anyway.  Isn't that why we all wish we could be him?"
"Rovin","6","0","0","12 May 2002"," watchable action fantasy undermined by unfaithful adaptation
","There are two ways to look at Spider-man. One is as a summer escapist movie about a teenager undergoing a startling transformation from nerd to superhero. The other is as the first motion picture based on the 40 year old comic book character.  In the first sense, Spider-man is a modestly entertaining summer action pic. The characters are sympathetic and there is just enough story cohesion to make the film satisfying. I didn't feel cheated, but I wasn?t anxious to step in line to see it again either. The dialogue could be mediocre at times, but no worse than some other films of this genre. There were some ridiculously melodramatic touches like the two romantic leads having lived beside each other for 12 years and never having spoken a word to each other but overall the film delivered what it promised. And that was all.<br/><br/>But as a longtime Spidey fan I could find some other faults with the film, changes to the accepted history, which in one case actually undermined the film as a coherent drama.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi demonstrated that he could visualize a comic book world like no one else with Darkman(1990), although that heavy-handed melodramatic film suffered from a cruel streak--as if mocking the trials and tribulations of the tortured main character. Echoes of Darkman are found throughout Spider-man. Nevertheless, I welcomed the selection of Raimi--until word spread that he had decided that an audience could not accept that a high school science nerd in an IMAGINARY, FICTITIOUS, LARGER THAN LIFE, COMIC BOOK-INSPIRED movie would be able to come up with mechanical webshooter devices--a trademark attribute of the comic book character and every television incarnation. Instead, they would be organic--existing as part of the mutation Peter Parker develops from the spider bite. Now, one could point out that developing super powers from a spider bite is also difficult to accept, as is the idea that a man from another planet who looks completely human could fly around in a red cape and shoot laser beams from his eyes. But alas, the decision was made. High schooler Peter Parker would have to demonstrate his scientific genius by... writing a term paper on nano-technology, and prove his creative genius by being a rather skilled fashion artist and costume designer! Some Hollywood apologists counter that we could not expect any screen time to the webshooter fabrication because of the length of the movie. Nonsense. A one minute-montage would have sufficed. No audience member would have walked out in protest. But the webshooter issue is actually minor in comparison to another change in the origin story. In the comics, Peter originally had no friends, and while he was interested in girls he did not have any particular crush. The decision was made to condense his social experiences so that his later friend Harry Osbourne would be introduced from the beginning(thus removing Parker?s status as a loner) , and to establish that Mary Jane Watson was his destined love(an embellishment not established in the comics until 20 years later). This latter change undermines the story of Peter Parker, devoting far too much screen time to the personal problems of Mary Jane as well as Harry, and creating an awkward moment for the film?s conclusion. In the comics, Peter was always concerned that some super-villain would discover his true identity and hurt his loved ones?-but the manner in which this is conveyed in the film?s final moments is problematic and left some members of the audience I viewed the film with wondering: ?Huh? After all that talk about how he loved her, he rebuffs her advances??<br/><br/>One other change worthy of note:  The character of Flash Thompson is reduced to a one dimensional bully, in the comics he tormented Peter Parker but was actually Spider-man?s number one fan.<br/><br/>The cast was certainly competent, given the material they were working with. Maguire and Dunst were sufficient in their roles, although i would not say that neither of them embodied the spirit of comic book characters. Maguire's Peter Parker was sympathetic, but subdued, lacking the introspection and expressiveness of his comic book counterpart(and as stated above, wallowing too much on his relationship with Mary Jane). As Spider-man, he did not employ many wise cracks and taunts, another trademark of the comic book and cartoon persona. Dunst's Mary Jane was well played, but her interest in Peter Parker was obvious from the beginning?a very artificial love story.<br/><br/>
With the exception of the final shot of Spider-man, the FX work relied too much on computer graphics that were not always convincing, and in some cases distant, detracting from an epic feel to the visuals.  The biggest design problem would have to be the decision to hide Willem Dafoe?s face under an expressionless helmet rather than make up prosthetics. It detracted from the performance in a couple of key scenes. And the music was truly  sub-par. Recycling the tv cartoon theme from the 1960s would have contributed more energy (although they did find a way to incorporate it into the film at one brief point).  Overall, Spider-man does not achieve the accomplishment of the original Superman, nor does it fall as flat as Batman."

","Tobey Maguire may have been an unusual choice for an action hero, but for showing the gawky Peter Parker side of the web-slinging arachnoid, he was clearly the right man for the job. When not amid a hail of action and explosions, Tobey Maguire gives such life to Mr. Parker as to give much satisfaction to those of us who grew up watching countless episodes of the animated Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane Watson was a clear winner, as the writers remembered to bring back such wonderful tidbits as her calling Peter ""Tiger,"" and those wonderful eyes added so much to the character. For long-time fans, it's a great piece, and is sure to make new long-time fans. Finally, Willem Dafoe, in a villainous part that surprisingly upstages even the hero, gives an excellent performance, with emotion and vitality. I've never seen any actor give such a chilling performance. Want to see an incredible sequence? Keep an eye out for Dafoe's mirror scene. He succeeds very well in bringing out the maniacal nature of the Green Goblin, as he descends into madness right before the audience. Most of the credit for the incredible adaptation of this classic tale should go to the casting director. The writers had a rich history to draw from, and the director had to be careful not to tread too heavily on the existing legacy, but the casting director quite honestly kicked major butt. All of the actors and actresses fit like a glove, and the movie is a must-see for any age. Definitely a classic in my book."

","Spider-Man was the best movie I saw this year, hands down. I have to say that Sam Raimi did an excellent job with Spider-Man, which I think is his first action film (the other films he did were gross-out horror flicks like the Evil Dead series). Sam does the Spider-Man name justice, even though in the movie there are several Evil Dead connections like the yellow cadillac (which is in all of Raimi's movies), the ring announcer in the wrestling scene (who is Bruce Campbell himself), and the fight scene with Goblin and Spidey at the end of the film (which reminded me of Evil Dead so much.)<br/><br/>All the hype, the video games, and the ads were right. This is THE movie to see this summer. And it came at a good time as well, before Attack Of The Clones invades the theaters. Tobey Maguire (Peter Parker) was excellent and I thought he fit well into his role as Spidey's alter ego. This movie, excluding it's excellent CGI and action scenes, has great comedic elements. James J. Jamison was one guy who uddered nothing but one-liners. Maguire also had some real funny moments in the movie, mostly when he's discovering his spider-powers.<br/><br/>All in all, a great movie to watch. I know that when the new Star Wars flick comes out we'll all be watching that, but The Spider makes his film debut in style. Kudos to Raimi!"

","One word best describes this movie: awesome. I haven't had this much watching a comic book-inspired movie since probably THE PHANTOM. Relieving the bad taste left behind by X-MEN, SPIDER-MAN is a powerhouse of what every comic book movie should be. It's amazing how faithful the movie remained to the source material, with only very minor alterations that don't become a problem thanks to Sam Raimi's mastery of the rest of the film. Knowing the film opened with a good deal of focus on the origin story, I was fearing a long drawn-out exposition with lots of talk and little excitement. But watching the development of Peter Parker from a nerdy everyday teen to a man learning to deal with incredible powers was just as exciting as watching Spider-Man and the Green Goblin fight it out over Times Square.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire makes an appealing Peter Parker, someone we can instantly identify with. We feel sorry for him when he's harrassed by the school bully, and we root for him when he gets the upper hand during a fight with them. Kirsten Dunst is good as Mary-Jane Watson (even though the character was not Parker's first love interest), and though her portrayal of the character is a little different from the comics, it's still one that should win over most of the die hard fans. The always-watchable Willem Dafoe is a delight as Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin. What could have been a typical over-the-top, maniacal super-villain is instead an intriguing struggle between Norman's good and bad side. The scene in which Good Osborn talks to Evil Osborn in a mirror is terrific. James Franco is also good as son Harry Osborn, one of Parker's few true friends. Veteran screen actor Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris, and J.K. Simmons (as J. Jonah Jameson, a part I always thought character actor Peter Jason would be perfect for) round out the good supporting cast, with Raimi usual Bruce Campbell doing a great little cameo. Spider-Man creator Stan Lee also has a blink-and-you-miss-him cameo during the parade attack. Watch closely.<br/><br/>With references to Dr. Curtis ""The Lizard"" Conners and (apparently) Eddie ""Venom"" Brock, and MJ calling Peter ""Tiger,"" among other references, screenwriter David Koepp obviously did his research in writing the story. Many moments throughout the film are taken verbatim from their original source, and while some may see that as lazy, I see it as excellent: staying nearly 100% true to what has already been established, whereas BATMAN and SUPERMAN had their origins and other things altered for the film versions. The CGI of the film was much better than I had been lead to believe. I've heard complaints that the CGI Spidey was terrible, but it was incredible. Although I feel CGI will never replace live actors, recreating an entire human form and making it appear fluid (at least in regards to making these characters act the way you would expect) now appears very doable.<br/><br/>All-in-all, a really incredible film that that has set a new standard for comic book-to-film adaptations that I think will be very hard to pass. Let's hope the sequels maintain quality, unlike the BATMAN films. 10/10."

","Spiderman: The Movie was well worth the wait, and I'm glad Sam Raimi ended up getting the job instead of James Cameron. <br/><br/>   This is one of those comic book adaptations that lives up to the original vision by respecting the fundamental elements and treating the material with integrity. At the same time, it isn't afraid to add a couple of new touches, which in this case, doesn't detract from the classic, and in fact, might improve it. (If only the Batman franchise had received this kind of care...)<br/><br/>   The nuts and bolts:<br/><br/>   Acting/casting: very good. Special effects: very good. Storytelling: very good. Cinematography: very good. Direction: very good<br/><br/>   Specifically, Maguire is a super Peter Parker/Spiderman, and Cliff Robertson was a really effective Uncle Ben. (Honorable Mention to ""Bonesaw"") Everything looks good and moves well, which I think is a credit to Sam Raimi of ""Army of Darkness"" fame. To anyone considering him a ""B grade"" director, I say ""Ha""! With ""A Simple Plan"" and ""The Gift"", ""Spiderman"" nicely rounds out his recent roster of quality moviemaking--""mainstream"" but with flashes of creativity and originality.<br/><br/>   Recommended. If you're a fan of the comics, then highly recommended. 8/10"

"stealth1ninja","9","0","0","12 May 2002"," perhaps the best comic adaptation of all time.
","This movie was spectacular.  I've always been an avid follower of the spiderman mythos, and this captures all the important elements perfectly. The comic was followed fairly faithfully, and all the action scenes with spidey make it feel like a live spiderman comic book.  Loved the depictions of spidey's style of fighting, and his comic poses were very accurate!<br/><br/>
The minor changes to the spidey universe did not detract from the movie at all.  The screenplay covered quite a bit of spidey history, and incorporated MANY well known storylines.  Impressive that so many years of history could be condensed and streamlined into about 2 hours.  As a comic adaptation, this is as good as it gets.<br/><br/>The people who nitpicked about EVERYTHING obviously missed the point. This movie is not an art film.  It is a superhero movie.  Of course things will be cliche...it's supposed to be like a comic book for god sakes!  Yes, there were things that could have been improved...and a few scenes where people seemed to just read the lines...but overall, the character development was good, the personalities of the characters true to the comics, and the casting very well done.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe's schizoid performance at the mirror was great!  The Uncle Ben section was very moving.  Aunt May and JJ Jameson were PERFECTLY characterized.  Kirsten Dunst played a very sweet and beautiful Mary Jane. Tobey had the nerdy Peter Parker down, and his spiderman looked very good. The gimpy Goblin costume could've been better though.  He looked a lot like a power ranger villain...which I think often detracted from his credibility. Perhaps a better mask would have helped.<br/><br/>Overall, as a movie on its own, this movie is about average or above average, which is not bad at all.  3.5 out of 5. As a comic adaptation, it is very good, and captured everything that made the comics so enjoyable.  The best and most accurate adaptation in ages, if not of all time. 4.5 out of 5.<br/><br/>This movie will make you believe that there is a spiderman.  It is definately the best movie out right now, and I highly recommend it.  Great fun, and worth seeing more than once."
"jgardner3","Null","0","0","12 May 2002"," This is from a Comic book, people. Its supposed to be cheesy.
","I just wanted to add my little two cents worth here. My husband is a total Spiderman freak, and we, of course, had to stand in line for an hour, on opening night no less, to go see this movie. Over the years, my husband has taught me a lot about various comic-book characters and story lines, and, having enjoyed this movie immensely myself, I was especially glad to find that he loved it, being the spidey afficionado that he is. I would just like to point out to all the folks out there raggin' on the 'cheesiness' of this story and its seeming lack of plot, that this IS based on a COMIC BOOK.  This movie was not meant to have some amazing (no pun intended) plotline or awesome thought-provoking lines.  It is supposed to be a bit over-the-top, a little bit goofy in parts. The special effects were not perfect, but damn near, and it was a fun movie because of its minor lack of perfection.  No, most of the things that happened in this movie could not have happened in real life, and again, that is one of the things that makes this movie so much fun.<br/><br/>The acting was excellent, when it had to be. The plot was, too.<br/><br/>
If you go into this theatre expecting some fancy, sophisticated action flick, then you are definitely no comic book fan, not knowing that the Spiderman storyline is just a tad bit silly anyway. This is a great movie for anyone over 10, as was stated by another person, who sat thru the movie with a frightened 6 year old.  Anyone, young or old, fan or not, will enjoy this funny, exciting adaptation of the famous Amazing Spider-man."

","When I heard that there was a Spider-Man movie in the works I was instantly sure that it would be a large, expensive, record setting, wreck of a film. I was extremely surprised when it came out and it began to get fantastic reviews.  Many of my most trusted sources(this site included)were saying what a fantastic film it was and it even made the top 100. I read dozens of reviews, almost all of them very positive, saying that this was a must see film. These things and the endless good things I heard about it from friends and acquaintances got my hopes up and made me go see the film.<br/><br/>I was stunned.  The film was crap!  I demand to know where the $100 million went!  It certainly didn't go towards getting some decent CGI put into the film, or maybe some writers who can write dialogue that is funny instead of corny. During one of the encounters between the Green Goblin and Spidey, ""Gobby"" says something to Spidey about being out(forgive me for not remembering exactly what he said, by this point in the film my attention had been drawn to the ceiling fan which was much more entertaining)and Spidey actually replies ""Your out Gobby.  Out of your mind."" Forgive me if I'm wrong but is that not rather terrible? I have only one good thing to say about this movie.  It was well acted. Willem Dafoe was the saving grace of this film.

","This was a well done movie, but it lacked in the action sequences.  The supposed love story, Peter is madly in love with M.J.  But at the end, he walks away from her.  Doesn't make sense.  Another problem I found, was that he didn't feel weird about the powers granted to him by the spider, or does he have to ""learn"" how to use them.  This was a crucial mistake, as I found Peter jumping from building to building with considerable ease, he didn't really have to try to hard to figure out how to shoot webbing, or how to master web-flying as well.  As for the plot-line, it is well written, and I can't really see anyone else in the lead roles.  Maybe for the next two movies, they might want to actually ""slow down"" the action scenes, as they were very difficult to follow."

Add to that incredibly bad dialogue, poor costume design for the Green Goblin, a very bad performance as Mary Jane by Kirsten Dunst and inadequate character-building of Uncle Ben (why should we feel Peter's grief when it is never shown that the two are that close?) and you have just another summer blockbuster...entertaining, but very forgettable."

","Well Marvel did it again; they took a wonderful comic book, and turned it into a movie.  I had to admit, with all the hype and rumors that I heard about this movie I had my doubts, and then, they were proven correct when I finally saw it.  Were can I start?  Marvel in its gross endeavor to bring their most successful comic to the big screen rushed through the process and ignored the most important factor that makes the a movie worth while, a plot.  Like the X-Men, they took liberties with the character in order to adapt it to the big screen.  (Organic web shooters.)  Why Tobey Maguire? What was Stan Lee thinking?  Did he have a say in the casting?  Kirsten Dunst as MJ? (I was waiting for the rest of the Toro's to show up)  And where was Gwen Stacy? Probably one of the most pivital players in webhead's life, ignored. The movie also had a bad habit of dragging in quite a number of places.  Although it was amusing at times, it ended with that.  Willem Dafoe's performance as the Goblin however, was fantastic.  Other then that the movie sucked.  Marvel has one more chance, with the HULK, after that they should give it up."

","I have to say, I've been a huge Spider-Man fan for most of my life and when I got wind of this movie nearly 5 or so years ago, I was so excited.  I waited and waited until finally, it was here.  The story was pretty much inline with the comic books with a few subtle differences that gave it that ""updated"" feel.  I was a little concerned about the 2 leading characters, Peter and Mary Jane, however, they really pulled it off well.  My only gripe with the movie is this...  Now I'm no special effects guy, nor am I saying the effects were terrible, but I do feel they could have been better. There were time when Spider-Man looked really good, and other times, he looked a bit dark.  Sometimes the suit looked rubbery, and other times it was clearly cloth.  When he was spinning around town, he seemed a bit blurry (which I understand would probably happen if one were to really spin around town), however, I thought it looked very CGIish (which it was).  Some say there were never any ""rendered"" Spider-Man figures in the movie, but I really think there were.  There were several sequences where he looked just a bit to jello-eee and the physics seemed just a bit off.<br/><br/>All in all though, it was a very entertaining movie and I can't wait to see the sequel.  I'm sure the CGI will be much better, and perhaps we'll get a taste of Spidey's black costume..."

"jmclaughlin82","10","0","0","11 May 2002"," Excellent movie *** give away warning***
","This was an excellent movie. Classic tale of good versus evil, set in a modern day setting. I especially like the way that they taught Peter to good with his power, the killing of his uncle by a man he let get away when he had the power to stop him was a great twist. They also thought of calling Mary Jane MJ, a great modern twist. Anyone who has gone to High School in the last few years knows that a girl with a name like Mary Jane wouldn't last 3 minutes with the social elite, especially in a New York high school. Of course she would have a nickname that friends would call her, and what better than MJ. The special effects were great, seamless, all except one scene where he's running across the tops of buildings, and the scenery behind him is obviously fake, it's not moving at nearly the speed he is. Other than that, it's great, from his first experiments with his powers with the bully at school to the ending, where he defeats the Green Goblin. Obvious opening for a sequel though, since we all want him to end up with MJ, but he turns her advances away, knowing that she could get hurt by his powers. And the end of the movie quotes his uncle ""With great power comes great responsibility."" I generally all around loved it."

"sgt_tsuyoi","7","0","0","11 May 2002"," Loads of Fun, But That's it.
","I gotta admit, this movie was fun and entertaining.  However it seemed a little too shallow and underdeveloped.  Much of the characters true conflicts are not shown to us through effective, emotional means.  Instead much happens through expository dialogue.  Don't just tell us what will happen, show us!<br/><br/>Spider-man's plot, isn't too new.  We've seen it before in ""Superman"" and ""Batman.""  This film seems to have borrowed elements from both of those films, thus lacks some originality.<br/><br/>Both of the former explored their heroes' and the villians' characters more in depth.  Both films gave us a true feeling of how their heroes/villians felt when saving people or vice versa.  ""Superman"" and ""Batman"" had their action scenes revolve around the heroes and villians' lifelong conflicts, something that must exist or else there would've been no movie.  Yes, Parker's humble beginnings and the Green Goblin's tragedy are introduced to us, but as soon as things kick off, this film seems to rush into violent-action sequences right away.  This story ""revolves around violence."" C'mon give the Green Goblin and Spider-man a little something more substantial to gnaw on.<br/><br/>The film did have some great moments.  The web-roping around the city was awesome and breath-taking!  If only ""Batman"" had been filmed with similar technology.  Spider-man's evolution was also brilliant.  Especially the origin of his name.  Minor references to ""Gladiator (2000)"" and ""Superman"" were interesting.  However, much of the CG animation made the action sequences look too sped-up and unreal, like someone pressed the ""FF"" button on the VCR or something.  It had a ""Power Rangers"" look to it.<br/><br/>Major plotholes: why did MJ and the Green Goblin not try to uncover Spider-man's identity when they had the chance.  They didn't even attempt it.  Why does Spider-man have unlimited web-spitting ability?  The amount of webbing that he ejected was more in volume than three times his body volume. Spiders take a lot of time to ""knit"" a web.  Why does the web's come out already done?  Also, where in the world did a kid like Peter Parker get such an awesome suit?  He can't knit it himself.  And he surely didn't enlist the aid of Oscorp.  There are things that we want to know here, part I.  There are other plot holes, but I do not want to have spoilers to ruin an otherwise entertaining movie.<br/><br/>Yes, it feels like a Japanese superhero-cult film and it feels like to vehicle to sequels and merchandise, but it is great, fun way to start out the summer.  The first true summer movie of 2002.  For its pace and fun I can still manage to give it 3* out of 4*."

I also thought that the movie would turn out like a parody of all super-heroes. Instead, I received 2 hours 25 minutes of nothing but solid fun from begining to end.<br/><br/>A high school science nerd named Peter (Tobey Maguire) has discovered a new species of spider during a class field trip one day. In fact, he is fiercely bitten by the new form of spider. Meanwhile, a tycoon scientist named Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe) is working on a transportation system for the city and may fail with his company if the test results indeed do so. Peter ends up saving his longtime crush, the sexy Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), from falling down in the cafeteria. What he discovers is that he can shoot a web from his wrist and dodge punches and bullying by his classmates. Norman Osborne then performs a test which turns out wrong and deadly because he is accidently mutated into the Green Goblin, a creature that wants nothing but evil. Peter then discovers his own new ablities and turns himself into the famous Spider-Man, a crimefighter who stops the big busts and dealers of New York and now is assigned to destroy the Green Goblin before it is too late.<br/><br/>Spider-Man, I would have to say, is the best comic book movie produced incredibley ever since 1977 when Alexander and Ilya Salkind produced Superman.<br/><br/>Produced by Laura Ziskin and Ian Bryce, and directed by Sam Raimi (A Simple Plan, Army of Darkness), Spider-Man will blow you away completley.

A lot of stuff was just badly written or badly delivered. The writing in the comics right now is ten times better. ....and they got to work on this script for how many years? ....and it went through what? 2,722 drafts?<br/><br/>they especially blew it with Spider-man's dialogue.

Spider-man- ""It is you who is out, GOBBY!"" ....and i still think the Goblin outfit is horrible. The glider was great, but the costume....guh.<br/><br/>One more thing that bothered me was how ""the burglar"" died . They should've stuck with the comics on this one. Wouldn't it have been so much better if Pete had beaten him within an inch of his life and forced himself not to kill the guy who murdered his uncle ?<br/><br/>Instead he tripped....and fell out of a window.<br/><br/>i guess i'd give it a 7.5/10.

","Never before have I been excited to see a certain movie. I wasn't excited at all to see Star Wars Episode I then, nor am I excited to see the coming Episode II. Spider-Man though, had me hanging (pun intended) since they mentioned it was going to the big screen. I've been a Marvel Comics fanatic pretty much more than half my life, and I was afraid it wouldn't live up to expectations. But after seeing it on the opening night (I just had to), I just couldn't believe it. The opening credits, the introduction of the main players in the story, the retelling of Spidey's origin - is perfect. Let me put it this way: Kirsten Dunst IS Mary Jane Watson, Willem Dafoe IS Norman Osborn/Green Goblin and Tobey Maguire is definitely the perfect Peter Parker/Spider-Man just as Christopher Reeve is Superman or Michael Keaton is Batman. Maguire actually pulls off the character better than I'd expected, managing to exude the perfect geeky awkwardness in his encounters with MJ, as well as nerdish enthusiasm during the scenes in the laboratory and the exact over-exuberant reaction you'd expect from someone who's just discovered that he can do whatever a spider can. They all have played their respective roles to perfection, not to mention the supporting cast: Rosemary Harris as Parker's beloved Aunt May, J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and James Franco as Harry Osborn (who we might see in the sequel as the 'resurrected' Green Goblin). Perfect casting. A lot of credit goes to director Sam Raimi, for his depiction of Spider-Man has done this film justice. This movie owes a lot to the success of another Marvel comic to big screen adaptation of 'X-Men', which is the standpoint for all future superhero films. Great film, from start to finish. Go see it."
"sickink2","8","0","0","11 May 2002"," OK, once again
","To sum it up, the movie was great.  Raimi nailed all the little nuances from the comic, and the actors couldn't have been more suited to their roles.  I've seen it four times so far, and I may even go again in a week or two.  This is one of the best movies of any genre to come around in a while."
"clandestine","9","0","0","10 May 2002"," As Good As It Gets
","Adaptations are tough; an adaptation of something as uniquely magical as a comic book is tougher. Ask the legion of directors and writers who have tried it over the past quarter century. But Raimi, Koepp, and company have come about as close as is humanly possible, and with one of the most difficult and nuanced characters ever to grace a comic book panel:  Spider-Man. The resulting film captures the essence of the whole Marvel Universe, moreso even than ""X-Men"" (which was a solid, enjoyable movie).<br/><br/>Given 30+ years of storytelling, it's rare when screenwriters actually mine the vein for classic storylines, but Koepp expertly weaves several classic threads into the plot. Spider-Man always sported an ensemble cast and it's nice to see it preserved in the film:  Aunt May and Ben Parker, MJ, Flash, Harry, and, best of all, a superb J. Jonah Jameson! A delicate balance between flashy action scenes and quiet moments, Raimi really succeeds in keeping a comic book feel in a modern big-budget film.<br/><br/>
The good: the casting is wonderful. Dafoe really sells it as Osborne as does Franco as his son (you can tell they studied the books). J.K. Simmons nails JJJ in some of the best scenes in the film. The costuming and effects are well done. Some people have been bothered by the CGI (although many of the action scenes really are Maguire), but some restraint was actually used. It's not as though the effects dominate the picture. The action perfectly captures Spider-Man...his movement, his ballet-like agility, and a bit of the humor as well. And this movie does have humor, though perhaps not as much as the comic.<br/><br/>The bad:  well, nothing bad, but yes, some of the dialogue is a little over-the-top, most likely by design. It IS based on a comic book, after all. And the usual plot holes and continuity errors. But in light of the accomplishment, bringing the heart along with the flash, it's a great film and a rollicking good time, too."

When was the last time you saw a convincing person climb a building without the ""hidden"" wire-line of falsety? For those of you that know the story, ""Spiderman"" (or Peter Parker) was your typical picked-on teen. The director of this film was right on the money by casting Tobey Maguire as the web-spinning wonder. I can't think of a single actor who could have been more convincing as a spacey geek, introvert, romantic, pretty-boy, and superhero. My first complaint is in regards to Kirsten Dunst. Her character was a little styolized, but still convincing. Her red hair for this picture was a bit of a distraction, but it was a minor oversight. Another minor little thing is the fact that Willem Dafoe's character (although he makes for an excellent villian) could have been more developed. But all in all, Spiderman was a job well done. A definite must-see for everyone."
"loramer","7","0","0","10 May 2002"," Definitely a fun movie. Not necessarily a good movie though.
","This movie was amazingly fun to watch and had a lot of good laughs and great action scenes.  But, as much as I enjoyed the movie, there were some aspects that really bugged me.  The worst of which was the clunky dialouge (the hospital scene in particular).  If you were one of the thousands that were annoyed by Star Wars: Episode I's dialouge, then you will most likely have the same problems with the dialouge that I had.  If you don't understand why I don't like the dialouge in either movie, then consider yourself lucky not to have noticed.<br/><br/>My other main problem was that some of the effects looked like I could have done a better job using photoshop on a Mac.  The scenes in particular that i am speaking of are the scenes in which Peter Parker is jumping from building to building in his plain clothes (near the begining) and the scene at the end with MJ hanging on the cable and getting tossed around like a rag doll after the Green Goblin makes his pass.<br/><br/>Both of these scenes, along with the clunky dialouge, took me out of the fantasy world that was created around me and reminded me that I was just watching a movie.<br/><br/>All in all, the rest of the film is done very well, and there are wonderful performances by Tobey MacGuire, Kirsten Dunst (I normally have really big problems with her performances, but this time she outdid herself), and Willem DaFoe.  Another notable performance was J.K. Simmons, who plays teh part of J. Jonah Jameson perfectly, and I must say that I really enjoyed his scenes.<br/><br/>I would suggest going to see this movie to anyone that wants to be entertained and have a good time, but still don't think it's going to win any awards."

","Perhaps I was expecting too much, but after all the hype and high ratings, I found it quite disappointing.  Digital effects were either ""Matrix clone no. 2,347"" or disorienting, and based on the angles I suspect half the webs missed their target. Realism?  After being bitten by a genetically engineered super-spider would you simply say ""ouch"" (with very little conviction) and walk home?  Like most superhero films the build-up of the first half was best, because, let's face it folks, after the first few unequal battles, it becomes clear that a superhero's life is as humdrum as the rest of the world.  Seen one, seen 'em all.  I think the comic did the personal stuff better."

","I was excited about the whole idea about the movie before I went and saw it. The whole concept of having one of the most recognized comic characters on the big screen was incredible.  Though it has produced previous movies this was to be different.  The age of the previous movies meant substandard graphics easily produced today.  What we have in 2002 just blows everything away.  It was a very exciting movie with an awesome cast.  Tobey Maguire made a great Peter Parker as did Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson.  On a side note I don't really care for red heads, but Kirsten was an exception. Anyway it has it all.

"FilmbuffsForum","Null","0","0","10 May 2002"," The wait is over!
","He's survived forty years of comic books, a cheesy but enjoyable 1960's cartoon, an awful 1970's television show, and now after years of being tangled in a web of legal issues, Marvel Comics' flagship character has finally hit the big screen. It's been well worth the wait.<br/><br/>Spider-Man : The Movie is a comic book come alive. In the deft hands of director Sam Raimi the world's most famous arachnid has burst from the confines of a four-color panel to become the movie by which all superhero movies will be compared.<br/><br/>By now the story of Peter Parker, bullied high school nerd who is bitten by a radioactive spider and acquires the critter's ability to - well, do whatever a spider can - all the while longing for the love of the girl next door, is as famous a beginning as that of the son of Jor-El. Raimi, with help from screenwriter David Koepp, have made some alterations to bring the story into the present day. The infamous spider has now become a genetically altered creature and our hero now spins his own organic webs, as opposed to inventing web shooters and fluid to create synthetic strands. These changes, seen with disdain by many hardcore comic fans, take nothing away from the story and at times enhance it. The rest of our protagonist's origin stays fairly close to home. After being bitten by said spider, Peter decides to use his ability for monetary gain, until a personal tragedy forces him to change his way of thinking.<br/><br/>Every hero must have a villain and here we get a classic. The Green Goblin, alter ego of Norman Osborne, scientist and father of Peter's best friend, is a demented sole bent on destroying those who have wronged him. For once a villain's plan isn't world domination or global destruction. A science experiment gone awry sends Osborne into a Jekyll and Hyde spin, arguing with himself, fighting to keep the Goblin under control. Dressed in green armor and flying through the city canyons on his glider, the Goblin looks out for what he considers to be in the best interests of Osborne.<br/><br/>The movie is paced nicely, setting up Peter's home and school life before the incident and carrying us through his transformation. There are comedic touches as Peter first learns of his power and his beginning attempts at web swinging. Once he gets the hang of it is when the film takes off. The action is high energy and evenly distributed throughout. Spidey's battles with the Goblin are interspersed with scenes of true character development, a rarity for a summer blockbuster. In a sense, this is what makes the movie work more than anything. These are characters that we not only care about, but feel could be real. Spider-Man has been attractive to so many for so long because he is just like one of us. He is a real human - not an alien with unlimited power or a millionaire with unlimited wealth and resources - with everyday problems; looking to pass classes, get a job and pay his rent. All of this, piled on top of his new found powers makes for an interesting combination of angst and confusion. Working out these personal problems is what makes Spider-Man so different and why the masses connect with him.<br/><br/>The performances throughout are top-notch and should be the mark of all comic book movies to come. Tobey Maquire, newly buffed up for this role, has the perfect combination of boyhood innocence, awkward juvenile and newfound wonder to pull off this role flawlessly. His biggest downfall comes when he speaks from under the mask. We expect our heroes to have deep resonant voices, but Maquire sounds less like Peter Parker, superhero and more like Peter Brady going through puberty. While dubbing should have been out of the question, a mild baritone could have helped in the believability factor. Willem Defoe is Norman Osborne, who is transformed into the maniacal Green Goblin. With just the right amount of scenery chewing, Defoe brings out the schizophrenic nature of his creation without crossing the line to campiness. Conversations with himself are the highlight of this performance. Kirsten Dunst is Mary Jane Watson, the love of Peter's life. While she has little more to do than be the standard maiden in distress, she fills out the roll better than past superhero mistresses such as Kim Basinger's one-note turn in Batman. J.K Simmons, playing the grouchiest newspaper editor since Lou Grant, steals every scene he's in. James Franco, still in brooding James Dean mode, is Harry Osborne, son of Norman and heir apparent to the Goblin legacy. Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris round out the cast as Peter's Uncle Ben and Aunt May.<br/><br/>The effects are, like the Goblin, a bit schizophrenic. While much of our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man's web swinging is impressive, some of it seems a bit off. While Peter is jumping along the rooftops of his Queens neighborhood, the look tends to be a bit cartoonish, as does a fight with several armored truck highjackers. This would probably be more distracting in other films, but in a movie like this we can accept it more, relating it to its comic book origins. Even so, a cleaner transition from real to CGI would have been appreciated. Another downside tends to be conversations between the Goblin and our hero. As in the comics, Spidey tosses off wise cracks and thinly veiled insults as our villain menaces and threatens. All of this is done from behind their masks, so no emotion or facial movements can be seen. Even one time when Spider-Man yells an impassioned plea to the Goblin, we don't see the movement of his mouth beneath his mask, making one think the sound was added in as an afterthought. The look comes off more like a child playing with action figures than a big budget Hollywood film.<br/><br/>
But none of this takes away from the pure joy of watching a childhood hero so vividly brought to life. There will be many more adventures for the wall-crawler to have, and I will be sitting there watching them all."

","I'm hoping that use of the word 'Schizophrenic' will deter the vast majority of those that this movie seemed to be geared for because 10-year-olds probably don't know what the term means.  And if you're 10 or younger, know what it means, and are still reading this, then please accept my apologies. :)<br/><br/>Basically, I enjoyed the movie to an extent but really expected a whole lot more with all the hype and with the technological movie industry advancements that have been made since the Batman movies were released. The special effects were decent but you could easily tell when the background was engineered and I really didn't care much for the blatant disregard of how life really is.  If you found out that your best friend and roommate was dating the girl that he knows that you loved for eons, would he still be your best friend??  Doubtful.  Would he still be your roommate?  Certainly not.<br/><br/>I went on my lunch hour (OK, 2 hours) to the opening day matinee thinking that I'd be blown away...but I really wasn't.  Much like 'Pearl Harbor' and 'Titanic', this movie concentrated WAY TOO MUCH on having a romantic by-line.  Don't get me wrong, I thought Kirsten Dunst did a fine job as MJ and, like the masses, I am definitely a cog in the ""We Love The Alley Rain Sequence"" machine...but I assure you it wasn't for the budding romance.<br/><br/>So, I've read most of the reviews in order to not replicate what others have already said but it seems like pretty much everything I saw to be lacking has been addressed.  So, instead of wasting your time, how about this??<br/><br/>This movie was decent but it could have been a LOT better.  Just like 'Star Wars: Episode I', I thought it was geared entirely to the youth population...maybe that's just me losing touch with that inner child but the movie as a whole certainly didn't appeal too much to me.  Although I will freely admit that having Macho Man in there as Bone Saw was a great choice...that brought me back to when I was a kid, anyway.  I mean, I see the whole point of wanting to make money and, therefore, the movie must appeal to all the demographics...but the only one that I think adequately addressed this was Shrek...since the sequel is all but obvious (will Harry be Venom??), my only suggestions to the film-makers is:<br/><br/>1.  Nix the love stuff...moms are going to go to the movie whether they like it or not and<br/><br/>2.  Bring back Spiderman's wise-crack sense of humor...make his lines kind of like the numerous adult references in Shrek...you know, funny to adults, incomprehensible to kids (but they'll laugh anyway because everyone else is laughing).<br/><br/>Over-all grade: C+"

","This was an excellent movie. I highly recommend it. Tobey Maguire is wonderful, as is Kirsten Dunst. Script is VERY true to the comic book, despite the fact that the webs come out of his body instead of through a mechanical device.<br/><br/>Tobey WAS a modern day Peter Parker. Kirsten Dunst actually WAS a modern day Mary Jane, with the big smile hiding the sad heart (I would have liked to see Gwen Stacy too, but hey, I'm old school).<br/><br/>The action sequences, despite the fact that they defied physics, had a wonderful feel to them, overall. None of those annoying, lingering shots of the hero posing before he fights like they had in so many other comic book movies. No stupid looking haymakers thrown. Just fast action that you'll miss if you blink.<br/><br/>Personal minor quibble: Robbie Robertson (yes, I am a geek) seemed nice, but a bit doughy. I always thought of him as a strong, Sidney Poitier looking guy...<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>What I liked most about the movie was that it captured the magic of it's source material better than any other ""comic-book movie"" that came before it:<br/><br/>I think any comparison to Batman, X-Men, or any of the other major ""comic book movies"" are off base. This is a far superior film to all of them.<br/><br/>When I think of Batman (which I thought was not bad), I can't help but think about the clunky fighting scenes, that awful, mechanical looking rubber batman suit, and the completely incongruous personality of Michael Keaton as a Bruce Wayne. Dark knight, my ass.<br/><br/>XMen (again, I liked it): Pretty loose adaptation of the comic book. With the exception of Professor X, Magneto, & Wolverine... the interesting personalities of all the characters was lost. Storm was a joke, Cyclops & Jean Grey were generic. Plus, except for the fistfights, the action sequences didn't have the magic of the comic books... (Cyclops', Storms', & Jean Grey's use of their powers just looked clunky)."
"JJCA","6","0","0","9 May 2002"," The film's ok, Tobey Maguire is perfect, but the pacing!
","Action movies come and go, and many of them take their cue for pacing from a roller-coaster ride.  Fast, faster and yet more exciting, and then a nice lull to get you ready for the next ""drop"".  This film seems to follow that practice, however the lull periods r..e..a..l..l..y drag.  Not only did i notice this, but so did every young child in the theatre. Unfortunately, most of these periods seem to exist when there is interaction tween spidey and kirsten dunst!  The most deadly thing in a relationship is boredom, even if it is the audience's boredom. In hindsight, this flaw shows up even as the credits run at the beginning of the film- on and on and on.  On the positive side, the action is pretty good, spidey is perfectly cast in tobey maguire, and the whole tone of the film comes off as the comic book genre it really is."
"L23SHMI","Null","0","0","9 May 2002"," Mixed bag
","The movie adaptation of the `Spiderman' comic books and cartoon is a mixed bag.  The story is classic, though not quite done justice by a bland script, but there are a few scenes that are entirely too syrupy.  Also, the acting in the film has its ups and downs, with some characters emerging as not-quite-believable.  However, the film is visually dazzling, and the scenes that retain a comic-book quality are extremely well-done.<br/><br/>As most people who go to see `Spider-man' are aware, the story revolves around Peter Parker, a young man who is bitten by a genetically altered spider, and gains super-hero powers.  He discovers that `with great power comes great responsibility' and through the rest of the movie, juggles his obligations to society as a super-hero, and his obligations towards his Aunt May, secret love interest Mary Jane, and best friend Harry Osborn.  It's a story with dangerous potential towards cheesiness, something that takes over in certain scenes.  Any scene where Peter Parker talks with Mary Jane, for example, ends up being hard to watch without a smirk.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire's performance as Peter Parker is somewhat strange: he has the `high school nerd' part down to an art, but when it comes down to things like crying over Uncle Ben, Maguire isn't perfectly convincing.  Tears come out of his eyes, but the corners of his mouth stay inexplicably up-turned. Kirsten Dunst is sort of annoying throughout the movie, seemingly fascinated by raindrops after an encounter with Spider-man in one scene.  Also, at the end of the movie, it would take a much better performance than Dunst's to convince us that `while I was hanging there, about to die, all I could think of was 'I hope I can live through this to see Peter Parker again.' However, both Willem Dafoe and J.K. Simmons give brilliant performances. Dafoe is convincingly fierce as Norman Osborn/the Green Goblin, while Simmons takes immediate control of any scene that he is in as J. Jonah Jameson, Parker's hard-headed boss.  James Franco is flawed as Parker's friend Harry Osborn; he seems stuck trying to play James Dean, but this time with a few nasty rich-kid quirks which make us wonder why Parker feels any loyalty at all towards his friend. The scenes where Spider-man web-slings through the city are great to watch, as is the first airborne scuffle between him and the Green Goblin against the backdrop of a crumbling balcony.  The final fight scene, however, is a little disappointing, since it simply involves brutal, face-punching hand-to-hand combat, instead of the web-slinging agility that is Spider-man's trademark."

","It's not going to win any Oscars, and, invariably, critics are going to bash it, but Spider-Man is an immensely satisfying flick.  It simply could not have been done any better.  There was plenty of what everyone came to see: smoothly stylized web-slinging and wall-crawling, made to look just as the comics depicted them; an over-the-top, believably psychotic villain in Willem Dafoe (who also had Green Goblin's posture down perfect, a nice touch and the kind of thing that makes having a huge fan direct the movie worthwhile); and a well-played love triangle that also captures of the feel of the comic perfectly.<br/><br/>I've heard people gripe that there was no plot, but the movie followed the comic book almost to a tee; there was no reason to expect that it would be any different.  If anything, David Koepp did a great job melding the Green Goblin storyline into the introduction to what will probably end up being a series of films.  I've already been to see it three times, and I'm sure I'll go at least a few more.  I give it a 10/10."

But when you stand back a ways, and look at it in comparison with the other buildings around, you can see that it is tall, but is shorter than a lot of buildings around it.<br/><br/>Such is the case with Spider Man.  I think as time passes people will gain more perspective and will be able to rationally rank this movie.  Right now, it is irrationally rated so highly in the top 250.  The movie was fun, kind of like The Mummy, but certainly not great.  The acting was mediocre, as was the writing and the character development.

"Dasher111","Null","0","0","12 May 2002"," Good origin, but little else original (SPOILERS)
","""Spider-Man"" is a respectable adaptation of the comic-book superhero.  This is the first film in a hoped-for series, meaning that it's an introduction to the character and his world.  This is never really the most interesting type of story, in films or comics, but everything has to start somewhere.<br/><br/>
The problem with this film is that unlike ""Superman"" (which only told the hero's origin) or ""Batman"" (which did it for the villain), ""Spider-Man"" gives both the hero AND the villain's origin - and forgets to come up with a plot for the two of them.    <br/><br/>The first section of the film explains how Spider-Man came to be.  With the exception of some contemporary changes, it matches the comic-book origin almost scene for scene.  We learn how nerdy teenager Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) gains arachnid abilities after an ill-timed spider bite.  After a brief stint in wrestling, a personal tragedy convinces him to fight crime. This material is faithfully handled by director Sam Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp.  It's a testament to the power of the Stan Lee/Steve Ditko tale that the filmmakers kept so much of Spider-Man's origin intact.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Spidey's first nemesis is born - defense contractor Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) tests a ""performance enhancer"" serum on himself and develops an evil alter ego.  He steals his company's flight suit and rocket-powered glider, and takes to the skies as the Green Goblin.<br/><br/>The film starts to unravel after Spider-Man and the Goblin meet at the World Unity Festival (the film's best action sequence).  A wimpy scene has the Goblin proposing to Spidey that they join forces...but to do what, exactly? And why would the Goblin do this after seeing Spidey rescue people? Wouldn't he know what side he was on? It doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>There is never a clear motivation for what the Goblin wants - and, therefore, never a good reason for him to go after Spider-Man.  Once the two origins were told, the script needed a larger-than-life plot to keep things interesting.  In ""Superman,"" it was Luthor trying to destroy California and make millions in real estate.  ""Batman"" had the Joker's product tampering. In ""X-Men,"" it was Magneto's campaign to turn world leaders into mutants.

","Not since the first Superman film has a comic book movie been translated to the silver screen so superbly.

During a field trip to a science lab, Peter is bitten by a genetically altered spider, and soon transforms into Spider-Man.

"Ace-38","Null","0","0","12 May 2002"," Excellent summer blockbuster, but.....
","The first real blockbuster of the summer season has arrived, and with good reason.  ""Spider-Man"" is an excellently crafted, written, shot and acted film.  With the exceptions of numerous continuity and factual errors (77 last I heard), some overly obvious CGI shots and the occasional line of very hokey dialog, this is a film well worth seeing.<br/><br/>Plotline closely mirrors the early comic books premise.  Meek little teen nerd Peter Parker is bitten by a (in this case) genetically enhanced ""super-spider"" and overnight finds he has the ability to climb walls, see clearly, and (in one of the funniest sequences)shoot webs from his wrists.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire excels in his dual role.  Maguire has not only the physical look (can't believe Freddie Prinze Jr. and Leonardo DiCaprio were even considered) but the mannerisms to make both characters come to life.  Peter takes his newfound abilities lightly at first, but after failing to use them to stop the robbery of a promoter who failed to deliver on his end of the bargain does the reality and importance of what Peter is capable of hit home.  <br/><br/>Willam Defoe is masterful as the deranged Green Goblin.  Also a dual role, Defoe brings an arrogant, dry styled Norman Osborn...but lights things up after a genetic experiment of his own brings out the dark side of his personality.  Green Goblin may rank up there with Nicholson's Joker as far as super villain performances to reference.  <br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst is beautiful as Mary Jane, the longtime object of Peter's quiet affections.  However, she doesn't seem to throw herself into the role as much as she has previous roles.  While I hate to say anything bad about Kirsten, as she is one of the few actresses who's name alone can get me into the theater, she clearly seemed underwhelmed by this opportunity.  Perhaps overlapping this with ""Cat's Meow"" tired her out?  Not a bad performance by any means, but not up to her usual standards.<br/><br/>As far as supporting cast goes, Cliff Robertson was admirable as Uncle Ben and Rosemary Harris was a delightful Aunt May.  J.K. Simmons was a bit overly grating as J. Jonah Jameson, but that's how he was in the comics as well.  Everyone else was basically background clutter, especially James Franco's Harry Osborn.  Perhaps when he returns as Green Goblin #2 he'll act more alive...we'll see.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man"" is a wonderful two hours.  Director Sam Raimi delivers his best work since the original ""The Evil Dead"" and clearly this was a labor of love for him.  Great film, and it opened huge, but with ""Attack of the Clones"" following close behind, this one may not quite have the staying power Marvel/Sony hopes for.<br/><br/>3 3/4 out of 5"

","Before I go on, I'd like to establish that I had no intention on seeing this movie in the first place.  I've never read the Spiderman comics, and I didn't buy my tickets in advance.  Of course, I've heard of Spiderman in the past, but I didn't know anything about his superpowers, arch enemies, etc. prior to this movie.  And guess what?  I was very impressed! <br/><br/>
Tobey Maguire is a fine actor, but I wasn't sure how he'd fill the shoes of a landmark superhero.  Playing Homer in ""Cider House"" is a lot different from playing Peter Parker in ""Spider-Man.""  But he is totally convincing in the lead role, and I can tell he worked out a lot to prepare for this role. Kirsten Dunst is...well...her beautiful self.  She flashes her beautiful smile, going through the motions as the helpless victim.  Sure, she did a fine job, but she didn't have much to work with.  The great Willem Dafoe steals the movie as scientist Norman Osborn who later turns into Spidey's arch enemy, The Green Goblin.  Dafoe is perfectly fiendish, as always.  I had no idea he was going to be in the cast, prior to seeing the movie, so I was very impressed to see him pop up on screen.  Cliff Robertson is great as Parker's uncle.  And, I forgot the actor's name, but the guy who played Jameson is also a scene-stealer.  I loved his scenes, which were reminiscent of the fast-talking farces of the old days.<br/><br/>There's a lot of action, a lot of excitement, good special effects and touches of humor to boot.  I can't complain.  The plot is by-the-numbers superhero fare, and there are no real surprises.  Nevertheless, I was entertained throughout and not a minute left me unsatisfied.  In a way, ""Spider-Man"" brought out the kid in me, but even the most discerning adult viewers should be impressed.  Trust me.<br/><br/>This is one big-budget summer blockbuster in which I can honestly say it was worth every buck!  <br/><br/>My score:  7 (out of 10)"

","When talks of a Spider-Man movie to be released in 2002 surfaced, I was really excited since I loved the comics and the animated series. I was also skeptical since many superhero comic-book movies are not as good as expected. <br/><br/>At first I was worried how they would fit the whole story in the film without being too long and boring. Luckily everything was handled very well - all credit to the crew. The film gets right into it - with Peter Parker being bitten in the first fifteen or so minutes of the film. From there everything unfolds brilliantly. Tobey Maguire was well cast as the friendly neighbourhood wall crawler, Willem Dafoe was (as always) brilliant in his part as the Green Goblin, Kirsten Dunst made an ideal Mary Jane Watson, so did James Franco as the rich bratty Harry Osborne and not forgetting J.K Simmons as the Grumpy and Feisty J Jonah Jameson.<br/><br/>Many people were quick to point out the flaws, but that is just plain stupid. If you going to film looking for flaws you will obviously find them - no film is perfect. If there were if a few things that should have been criticized, one would be the Green Goblins gawky mask and the other would be the fact that spidey's ""spider sense"" could have been better, and more widely used throughout the film.<br/><br/>*I personally hoped that the World Trade Center would have been included but I understand why it was not*<br/><br/>I must say that I thought Spider-Man was fantastic. The cast was perfect, the plot was excellent and very true to the comic, and the film entertaining. Sam Raimi's direction was crisp and well rolled out. The script was as good as it could be, and the score was marvelous.<br/><br/>From now on, when people talk about brilliant superhero movies, forget Superman, Batman, Spawn, Blade and X-Men - SPIDER-MAN IS DEFINITELY THE BEST."

"Pierrot-10","9","0","0","11 May 2002"," Flabbergasting...
","This is a very cute movie, built around a love story and a teenager stepping into adulthood and discovering his own body - slightly superhuman body, that is. I think Sam Raimi (and the script writer David Koepp, who previously did a great job on Stir of Echoes) is faithful to the spirit of the Spiderman comics by focusing deliberately on the human side of the story, which is well served by a good cast - Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco - the weakest being probably Willem Dafoe, who looks so much a like a goblin anyway that he didn't have to put much effort into his part. This portrait of the superhero as a young man blends skillfully his apprenticeship as a human spider with his more common teenager concerns and love interest. The result might not be as spectacular as X-Men; on the other hand it's not trying to, but instead depicts a very human and attaching Spiderman."

Let me say that first,I'm a huge comics fan (including Spidey) and I don't at all have a problem with the changes in the basic story arc. Mind you,I prefer Peter inventing his own webshooters but that's a small complaint. The movie simply didn't capture Spiderman. It was too much flash and not enough substance. Yea,it told a story that wasn't paper thin but it didn't communicate it very well. I'm not altogether sure that I'm happy with the takeover of computer animation.

","Having grown up on the classic event blockbusters of the 70s and 80s like Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Back to the Future et al and then having to sit through the 90s blockbuster tosh (Godzilla and Batman and Robin come to mind) this film has everything I could wish for.<br/><br/>First the characters, Maguire is perfect as Peter Parker the reluctant hero who we can all root for, he grounds the character so well that you feel a much greater connection to him than say Bruce Wayne as Batman. Dunst plays Mary Jane as everything the girl next door should be; smart and sexy but never too far out of reach, it's easy to see why Peter obsesses about her. Their romance never feels tacked on (unlike The Matrix or Lord of the Rings) and the dialogue walks the fine line between sweet and corny very well, its played with so much charm and heart that even the most granite hearted cynic will be suckered by it (how it should've been in Attack of the Clones). Dafoe as Norman Osborn is one of the best baddies for years, his menacing expression is so good he's less scary in costume. But he also gives his character depth never forgetting his human side, the strained relationship he has with Harry is believable and not over done. The confrontation between the Goblin and Osborn in the mirror is like OTT Shakespeare but it keeps right in the spirit of things. The support is bang on too, Aunt May and Uncle Ben dispense their philosophies with out sounding cheesy (in any other situation they would be) and Franco gives Harry Osborn more depth than it first appears and the relationships he has with his dad and Peter are more interesting than they should be. J.K Simmons is brilliant as J.J.Jameson, giving one of the best comic relief performances in years.<br/><br/>The story is simple and by concentrating more on the characters the film appears richer than most blockbusters (even Lord of the Rings). When the action takes place it might not be visually stunning but it feels more important than the eye candy from the Matrix or Attack of the Clones, the final showdown has more in common with Fight Club. The film feels like it was lifted straight form the pages of a comic book, at some points you could pause the film and put it straight into print. It's the same with the dialogue with lines like 'We'll meet again Spider-man' and 'I could crush you like a bug' fitting perfectly with the atmosphere of the movie and never sounding ridiculous.<br/><br/>This movie gives you the over excited feeling the new Star Wars films try and fail to create. This and Lord of the Rings are the only action-adventures of the past decade that stand up to the old school classics of 10 to 20 years ago and is probably in my top ten blockbusters of all-time. 9/10."

"Skeletors_Hood","9","0","0","20 July 2002"," A great movie with minor flaws
","I went to this movie with the same frame of awe and excitement that I had as a young lad, reading Spider-Man comics.  My father and I would always enjoy a great comic together, especially Spider-Man.<br/><br/>How he would have loved this movie.<br/><br/>Okay kids, it has some flaws to it, and I won't deny that.  There are times when the script lags, and scenes drag on (especially the ones with Mary Jane). I would have liked to see a more traditional Green Goblin outfit, but I forgive that, because it still worked, and Defoe was so great as the villain that I concentrated more on his performance than his clothes.  Some of the cgi is a little too fast paced, and it seems to be choppy, but I wonder if that was on purpose?  Something to think about perhaps.<br/><br/>My BIG complaint centers around Mary Jane.  I am not a Dunst fan in any way, shape or form, and I still think that she should have been left out of the project.  It was just so hard to believe her as MJ.  However, if she had played Gwen Stacey, then she would have been perfect, especially with the last scene on top of the bridge.  She had no real chemistry with Peter, and it was hard to believe that they were becoming closer.  And it was these scenes that dragged on.<br/><br/>Now, as to why everything else works.  Folks, it's a movie based from a comic book, and whenever Hollywood makes a movie like that, it will be a hit or a bomb for one basic reason, and that is how faithful it is to its source.  Basically, for my money, this movie included all the major points of the Spider-Man mythos; the spider-bite, the family situation, the death of a father figure, the outfit (not leather, you'll notice), the love interest, the change in character with Peter wanting fame to becoming a hero, etc.  If you look at other comic book movies, they succeed if they do just that.  Batman and Superman both kept the basic elements of the story, as did X-Men, the Mask and the Crow.  These movies are considered great comic book films because if it, and yes, a good script helps as well. <br/><br/>
Overall, there are flaws, as in every movie.  However, Spider-Man sets a standard to be lived up to, as did Superman in the 70's. Superman is still my fave comic book movie, and is still a better movie that Spider-Man, but as far as comic book movies go, it's on my top 3 (just under Batman)."

My other friend and I waited until he was out of range before scoffing quietly: ""Not amazing, entertaining."" My other friend replied: ""There's a big difference.""<br/><br/>We were right, it was not amazing, but it was entertaining.<br/><br/>
Firstly, the good points. Tobey was perfect for Peter Parker. J.J. Jameson did make me laugh (be it through my nose) a good few times. The stunts were OK. The SFX, although looking out of place in some shots, did what they were supposed to do. Kirsten Dunst...because...I'm 15, nuff said.<br/><br/>Secondly,the bad points. The Norman Osborne story was flat. He seemed to be more of a James Bond villain. Although the story of Spiderman 2 should be better, especially the complicated relationship that will grow between Peter, Harry and Spidey. The cheesy one-liners, although common in the cartoon, seemed out of place in the film. Some shots also seemed out of place e.g. Spiderman running from the line of bullets following him from the glider,and after he rescues Mary Jane (the first time) and lands on top of the building with her. Probably because of the fact it was an actual person in a suit and he looked....too human.<br/><br/>Altogether an average transaction from comic/cartoon to the silver screen, but not, however, a good FILM. I must also add that anyone who applauded after seeing this(as was the case with my viewing), obviously only judged it on the last half hour. Tut tut tut.<br/><br/>P.S.

If weird is what you want, employ Willem Dafoe - he looks a freaky person in Spider-Man with his high cheekbones and glaring, piercing eyes, he really brought the acting up at least 2 notches. I don't know the guy who did his backstabbing son; he was alright. The ending was C-R-A-P, by the way, but Spider-Man 2 & 3's on their way, so they should definitely come out with something better.

"ramshot","9","0","0","16 July 2002"," Nicely done!
","I've been a Marvel-fan all my life basically, and I have to say that Spider-Man gave me JUST those vibes that I get when reading the comics, and was the first movie to do so. X-men was an ok movie, but it didn't quite manage to capture the feeling of the original comics. The most disturbing flaw in X-men was the fact that the powers really didn't seem all that ""powerful"" in the movie as they did in the comics. I mean I could have taken Cyclops on any time with a Luger, you know what I'm saying? Also, these was serious lack of depth in the characters, wherein the comics character development plays a huge part.<br/><br/>Now Spider-Man is a totally different story. While all of the effects do not look as good as they could, they certainly do their job well - spider-man is just as fast, agile and flexible as he is in the comics. A friend of mine complained that it didn't look real, but hey, how REAL would a guy who can dodge bullets look in the real world?<br/><br/>The story is great. It's basically been told before in the comics tho, but some modifications have been made and things removed to make it better for our viewing pleasure, I guess. However, unlike in many movies based on comics or books, the changes are not too vast. I truly felt like I was watching a movie made out of the comics I've read for years, not something that was loosely ""based"" on them. This is a good thing, as Spider-Man is not Marvel's most popular character for nothing.<br/><br/>Last but not least, Directer Sam Raimi had earned my respect already with the hilarious Evil Dead movies, but now has proven that he is capable of much more than just blood and guts - Spider-Man is simply great quality entertainment.<br/><br/>Go see this one people, Marvelist or not. Just don't take it seriously, it's a _fantasy_ story and you should treat it as such.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I'm with those who are puzzled at all the praise being heaped on this movie. Horrible script: ""I'll be there for you"" was used how many times? And ""Thank God for you..Spider man,"" ""Thank God for you, Peter."" <br/><br/>
Long, drawn-out scenes of dialog where nothing really happens, and, to add insult to injury, lame special effects.  <br/><br/>So many little annoyances:  What was with the scene where Tobey M. takes his shirt off?  Was he supposed to have all of a sudden gotten more muscular? If so, why didn't anyone else notice?  If I suddenly bulked up within a day of my loved ones seeing me, I think they would take note. What was the point of the scene?  <br/><br/>And Kirsten Dunst screaming all the time?  Oy.  And her pulling off her mask to kiss him when he's upside down?  But only enough to see his lips?  And how could she not recognize that voice?  I know that no one ever recognized Superman's voice when he was Clark Kent but somehow I couldn't buy it here. And Willem Dafoe effective as the villain? With that laugh?  Please.  Now, Margaret Hamilton in ""The Wizard of Oz"" there was a villain, and one with a laugh, to boot. But here, the laugh seemed to be one continuous loop.<br/><br/>A big waste of time and money, in my book. But, hey Mr. and Ms. Movie-goer who are spending gobs of money and time on this movie, to each his own! :)"

","I have to say that I was not at all moved by Spider-Man. For a concept that was over 20 yrs in the making & heavily anticipated by millions of fans, the final product is a vast disappointment. The producers do very little to enhance the classic story of Peter Parker & his transformation into Marvel Comic's most popular hero. I found the CGI to be substandard, most of the time our hero LOOKS like a rubbery computer-generated puppet akin to JarJar Binks. The battle sequences are uninspired & many elements are stolen from countless other FX-driven films. The Goblin's costume looks like a plastic horror, why not simply stick with the classic fabric version from the comic books? The acting is mostly average to dull with the exception of Tobey Maguire who does his best despite a mediocre script. The plot is choppy & frenetically paced with little explanation of the sequence of events. Calling this the best superhero film is an overstatement considering the better job done with X-Men two years ago."

","Spider Man is not a great movie, but it is very well done.  Director Sam Raimi is the true star.  He recognizes that character development is just as important as Peter Parker being able to swing through Manhattan.  I can count on one hand how many movies based on comic books that are more concerned about blowing things up and showing off what the superheroes can do, than in making the audience give a damn about the person behind the mask.  Tim Burton gave it whirl in the original Batman but Raimi does it better because it is when Spider Man is his geeky alter ego trying to win the heart of Mary Jane is when this movie is at its best.  We like Parker because he's ridiculously ordinary and we immediately identify with him and his plight.  We want him to get the girl.  He's down-to-earth and funny, not some macho guy with a body like a pro wrestler.  He's the guy that everybody remembers from high school.  He could use his gift to get anything he wants (including Mary Jane), but he doesn't. It's who he is as a person AND as a superhero that makes him and ultimately the movie, so popular. Interestingly enough, the movie is somewhat of a letdown from a special effects standpoint.  However Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco (has this quiet intensity that I really admired) and Willem Dafoe do such a great job of bringing the story to life that you can forgive Raimi for the less-than-special special effects.  Just make up for it one the next one! 8.5 out of 10"

But was this movie really that good?  Did it deserve to make $400 million in North America alone? God no!<br/><br/>The acting was ok and I think McGuire was a good choice for Parker.  But the real shiner in this movie is Willem Dafoe.  He excells in these types of roles, and he pretty much made the movie for me.  Without him, Spiderman would be lucky to get a 5/10 from me.  The action sequences, now let's be honest, were few and far between and the special effects were absolutely horrible.  John Dykstra (of Star Wars fame back in the day) really should have stayed with Lucas' ILM.  I haven't seen very obvious fake-looking effects since the dragons in that horrible film Dungeons and Dragons. Spiderman and the G. Goblin looked like cartoons.<br/><br/>Anyway, the two movies being touted as blockbusters this summer were Spiderman and of course, Star Wars Episode 2 Attack of the Clones.  The latter was a far superior movie, with a better story and MUCH better SFX.<br/><br/>I realy don't understand how Americans can see Spiderman more than once, because that is what is necessary for a film to make over 400 million dollars in two months.  Repeat viewings for Spiderman? It surely did not warrant it.  An okay summer film, which I'll probably never watch again.  I just did not understand the hype at all!<br/><br/>6/10"

","I've just seen 'Spider-Man'. Good, but not great. The first part of the movie I spent thinking 'yeah, yeah, I know all this' - how PP turned into Spidey, the wrestling bit, how his uncle got killed. That's the difference between this movie and that all time great comic book film 'Batman' - the story started right away. Everybody knows who Bruce Wayne is, how he came to be the Batman. So why loose 60 minutes telling it? Plus, there was so much more atmosphere to it. And all these memorable scenes. For me, there are only two in 'Spider-man': Norman Osborn talking to his reflection in the mirror, and aunt May saying the 'Our Father' when the Green Goblin attacks her and summons her to finish the prayer. On the plus side: great cast, good acting, spectacular action sequences. And yet, I somehow missed the delightfully wacky direction of Sam Raimy which made me like 'Darkman' and 'The Quick and the Dead' so much. As if Columbia reigned him in: this is a major motion picture and has to do well at the box office, so no experimenting with the direction. Style wise, Warner Bros. took a bigger chance with their super hero flick. To end on a positive note: as far as I could tell, there were no real holes in the script - something I can't say about my beloved Bats movie."

There are some nice touches to it, and Tobey Maguire plays the lead role very well. But the story itself is not very intriguing or captivating. About as intriguing as the comic books themselves are, I suspect. Except I have not actually read any of the comic books, so I wouldn't really know.<br/><br/>I guess this movie is great if you love the comic books, or if you love similar types of super-hero stories.

","If you're a Spider-Man fan like me, then you doubtless enjoyed this respectful retelling of his beginnings; and more than any character in comics, HOW Spider-Man started is crucial to who he is.  A man who made a mistake as a boy, and will spend his life fruitlessly trying to atone.  I highly recommend this movie.<br/><br/>This movie worked, but it had to use a lot of tricks to do so.  CGI is the least of it; I enjoyed the effects in the spirit they were presented: to me, they looked so unreal precisely because that is how Spider-Man would appear to move.  But the real problem is for a character to have emotional heft when you cannot see his face.  They solved that THIS time by having his mask shredded in the film's final battle, which was an excellent physical and emotional one.  But they can't do that twice without the artifice showing. Toby Maguire will need to convey things much better through his body language next time.  Maybe have a mime consult the next film, or a deaf person who has to rely much more heavily on posture for context."

","I'm a mediate comic book fan, and Spider-Man has always been one of my favorite movies of all time, but this movie could have been better.

All my friends say that it is based on a comic book and it's supposed to be cornballish in ways, but that isn't true.  Look at Batman, that was seriously with a little and proper comedy relief in the mix.  Tim Burton should have directed Spider-Man.<br/><br/>
Don't get me wrong, I loved the action packed scenes and for once I actually enjoyed the CGI (which I normally hate).  Although I didn't really care for Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man, I did, however, thought that Willem Dafoe played an excellent green goblin and who could not love the very beautiful Kirsten Dunst.  The reason why I gave this a 6, is that in between all these great action scenes were these over-acted, and cornballish dialogue and romance scenes.  That is what spoiled this movie."
"nathan-abrams","Null","0","0","12 July 2002"," What a Disappointment
","Spiderman: the Movie<br/><br/>Spiderman. What a disappointment. And from the director who made The Evil Dead and Darkman which makes it doubly disappointing.  Just as another promising director, Tim Burton, fell by the wayside when he made a big budget, summer blockbuster remake of Planet of the Apes, so, too, has Raimi with this adaptation of the comic.<br/><br/>Based on the Marvel comic strip and updated to contemporary New York, Tobey Maquire (The Ice Storm) plays Peter Parker, the inept, bespectacled, bumbling nerd who is bitten by a genetically modified (in a reworking of the original, radioactive and no doubt reflecting our contemporary fears over GM as opposed to postwar fears of nuclear apocalypse) spider during a field trip to Columbia University.<br/><br/>This story is a conventional love story. As the opening voiceover says, `like all good stories, it's about a girl'. Parker - all spectacles, spam and centre parting - has loved his next-door neighbour, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), since the age of six.  Once bitter, Peter grapples with the overnight transformation to his body, a very obvious metaphor for the hormonal changes all teenagers go through.  He develops muscle tone, the ability to jump, climb walls and, in another reworking of the original, shoot webs out of his wrists.<br/><br/>Things seem to be going well for Peter - he impresses Mary Jane, he beats up her bullying boyfriend - until his uncle is shot and the Green Goblin (played excellently by Willem Dafoe) arrives on the scene.  Peter internalises the last words of his uncle: 'with great power comes great responsibility' and, as Spiderman, he sets out to fight crime, prompted by the knowledge he could have prevented his uncle's death.  His crime-fighting, though is compounded by the entrance of the maniacal Goblin, who is determined to persuade Spiderman to join him or kill him if he won't. The Goblin is the alter ego of Norman Osborn, an scientist and businessman, and the father of Peter's best friend who, it turns out, is also dating Mary Jane.<br/><br/>The sequences of Spiderman demonstrating his skills are by far the best. Spiderman leaps, swings, jumps and so on. The battle sequences with the Green Goblin are exciting, particularly against the backdrop of the re-edited New York City (sequences depicting the World Trade Center were recut).  J.K. Simmons as Jonah Jameson, the tabloid editor who gives Parker his first job as a photographer, was great (particularly when compared to his role as a neo-Nazi on the cult series Oz). And Kirsten Dunst looked cute as the gal.<br/><br/>Overall, though, the parts did not equal the sum. The CGI wasn't adequate: when Spiderman climbed walls I did not willingly suspend disbelief.  The narrative pace was jerky. Long-winded romantic scenes slowed action sequences down and the overall pace was not maintained.  Perhaps big-budgets do not suit Raimi, but then he has a hard act to live up to because his Darkman was, and probably still is, the best comic-book style adaptation on film.  This does not bode well. If Raimi can't handle such an adaptation, then what hope do we have for the forthcoming Scooby Doo and others?"

","To be honest, i had a good feeling about this film when i heard it was in production.  Especially after i found out that it had been directed by Sam Raimi (A Simple Plan was stunning).  After the pitiful recent superhero films, by these i am mainly talking about the latest batman ones, it was nice to have a refreshing change.  The special effects were good, and the way that Tobey Maguire gave Peter Parker that nerdy look really made you back the hero more.  I am now looking forward to Hulk which is due for release in 2003, comic books make great films, mainly because the imagination of the reader/viewer plays a great part in the way that they interpret the hero.  Credit to Willem Dafoe for a good performance as Osbourne, but i did find that at times the Green Goblin didnt seem so much of a threat to the main character and didnt seem to want to take over the city, i think if they had based the film on the ride at IOA it would have been better<br/><br/>Excellent film though"

","This is the big event movie' of the year very exciting because everyone has heard of Spider Man the comic book hero who started life as high school geek Peter Parker and became a crime-fighter after he was bitten by a radioactive spider.  The only previous comic book adaptations I have cared for are Superman' and Batman'.  I was never a comic book reader and I do not care whether these films bear any resemblance to the original comics. All I want is to be entertained and my only question before seeing this film was does it live up to the hype?  <br/><br/>What makes Spider Man stand out from other big budget blockbusters is that time is spent on providing the background of the hero turning him into a character you can sympathise with and therefore one who is worth rooting for.  As Peter comes to terms with the idea that his wrists are capable of projecting a web-like substance and before he learns how to control his super-hero powers, he does what you or I would have learnt from watching cartoons as a kid you point your hands forward and shout Go web!'  At first, he is confused by the fact that his glasses suddenly makes his vision blurry and fascinated by his new muscular physique.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire in the lead role ups his hunk status and gives a likeable and endearing performance.  The love story of Peter's crush on his neighbour Mary Jane is sweet but never corny and this is credit to Kirsten Dunst who is both appealing and convincing in her role.  Willem Dafoe as the scientist Norman Osborn and his alter-ego, Green Goblin makes for an effective villain although I am still bewildered as to why Norman becomes the Green Goblin in the first place!<br/><br/>Inevitably, there will be sequels to come and only time will tell whether these will become as tiresome as the Batman' sequels.  In the meantime, I suggest that you enjoy the original: Spider-Man' is great summer entertainment which successfully combines humour and action."

However, even for a Spiderman-Stupid person as myself, I was able to quickly fill the gaps of what I knew and what was going on just by watching the film.<br/><br/> I think the camera work was fantastic.  Having Willem Dafoe argue with himself using the mirror was a nice touch of cinematography.  Maguire managed to deliver the classic ""Silly-Spidey"" lines with just the right intonation and effect.<br/><br/> Showing how he was CONSTANTLY looking for work and money to support himself whilst NOT saving MJ gives the story a lot more realism than Batman (Of course Bruce Wayne was filthy rich) or Superman (who, though he worked, didn't seem to really need the money).<br/><br/> As for the scenes that show things EVERYone knows about Spiderman - I found myself cringing, wishing Peter Parker would move when the spider was going to bite him.  I found myself wincing when I saw Norman Osborn becoming the Green Goblin in the lab.<br/><br/>Overall, this by far gives me a new hope for comic book or even video game to film translations.

","SPIDER-MAN: Good, not great.<br/><br/>The story and characterizations remain true to the source material while adding innovation and adapting it well to the big screen.<br/><br/>
As to the performances:<br/><br/>-Tobey Mcguire is flawless. Captures Peter Parker's sensitive loser persona, and the sheer exhilaration and joy as he revels in his new powers.<br/><br/>
-Rosemary Harris is a great actress, with serious gravitas, who grounds the movie with her portrayal of Aunt May, in limited screen time.<br/><br/>-Willem Dafoe is becoming a living cartoon version of himself but is entertainingly psychotic.<br/><br/>-Jk simmons is PERFECT as irascible publisher, J Jonah Jameson.<br/><br/>
-Kirsten Dunst, however, was just slightly disappointing to me. Mary Jane's self-assuredness, covering her self-esteem problems, is never convincing. She acts with her hair.<br/><br/><ul><li>Meanwhile, none of the other characters or performances really register.</li></ul><br/><br/>
As for the script, its faithful, and the story revisions are quite good. Especially, the ""organic"" web shooters. The only problems for me were that Peter's life is not quite dismal ENOUGH, and the citizenry embraces Spidey WAY too quickly. Also, despite good acting, the long soliloquies by Peter and MJ about their love are examples of embarrassingly bad writing.<br/><br/>My main problem is with the tone. I think of Lee/Ditko's Spider-man as an eerie, horrific character. This is more like the Romita Spider-Man... more like Superman then Batman. It lacks edge, lacks darkness.<br/><br/>
For example: in the comic, Spidey's first girlfriend is not MJ, but Gwen Stacy. It is SHE that the Goblin kidnaps and throws off a bridge. When Peter tries to save her by snaring her with his webbing, her neck snaps and she dies. He KILLS his own girlfriend in the attempt to save her. Now THAT's edgy. THAT adds tragic depth to the character.<br/><br/>Here, instead, while saving not only MJ but also a tram load of ""innocent children"", the Goblin is stalled in his effort to kill Spider-Man by a rowdy crowd of stereotypical NYers hurling debris at the Goblin, giving Spidey time to save everybody. UGH. How cornballishly ""Superman"" is that?<br/><br/>In the comics, the populace is persuaded by megalomaniacal publisher Jameson that Spidey is a bad guy. It was an early 60s expression of the power of the media to manipulate the truth. Here, The Bugle is apparently ignored by the people, as they quickly recognize our hero's, um, heroism. NO EDGE. NO TRAGIC AMIBIGUITY. Just cutesy-poo shtick.<br/><br/>As for the production's look... at first, I hated the bright, cartoony style, with the CGI FX of Spider-man's movements. But, on second viewing, they grew on me. For the kind of story it is, it's an appropriate look. Danny Elfman's music is uncharacteristically forgettable. You have to wait till the end of the credits to hear the original ""Spider-man"" theme song, which still rocks.<br/><br/>All in all, SPIDER-MAN is entertaining enough. I don't think it's as good as the first 1/3 of the first SUPERMAN movie, nor does it have the production design and interesting dark tone of the first 2 BATMAN movies (despite those films' extreme turgidity). I'd say it's on par with X-MEN, which I also rather enjoyed."

"tomm4004","6","0","0","9 July 2002"," Spider-Man vs. Peter Parker
","For me this felt like two films - Spider-Man and Peter Parker.<br/><br/>
The latter is the story of a geeky kid amazingly transformed into a superhero while pursuing a career and the girl of his dreams. It is the most interesting part of the duo. On the plus side it had the reliable Toby Maguire portraying convincing teenage angst, laced with wide-eyed humour at his newly adopted powers. On the downside, I found Maguire and Kirsten Dunst a bit laconic at times, though fault probably lies with the helmsman Sam Raimi for his static handling of their scenes. They basically just stand and talk to each other while the music tries hard to drown them out. Couldn't they have walked or something? Parker takes to his new powers like a duck to water without ever really questioning or having any doubts about them. It all seemed a little too pat. Also, one major plot point - the identity of the car jacker - was a real give away, then never really dealt with.<br/><br/>
As Peter Parker the movie dissolved into Spider-Man the movie it got tangled up in its own webbing. The action scenes were functional but never engaging or thrilling. One main problem was that the hero and villain were masked and thus not able to exude emotion or personality. The director tried to circumvent that a couple times, including the final battle, probably realizing the problem. Also, the web-spinning scenes were very cartoonish and I never had a sense of danger or of ""being-there"". Whenever Mary Jane was going to fall it was obvious that Spidey would swoop in and save her, thus there was no sense of danger. There's also a plot device in a fire that was telegraphed, hence making the ""predictable"" line seem like a bad in-joke. Somehow Spider-Man zipping around the tops of buildings just wasn't exciting to watch. I would have bet that it would be, as I'm sure the filmmakers did, but some things just don't come off well on film. It's just the way it goes. I remember my favourite shot from the old TV cartoon - it was of a two-fisted Spidey coming right at the camera. I can't remember any specific shot from this film that had the same thrilling effect.<br/><br/>
It was nice to have the story of Peter Parker come to the big screen and see what they could do to Spider-Man with modern computer technology. Unfortunately, the latter was ""not much."" Now that the story of the geek gone vigilante has been told, it doesn't bode well for the sequels."

The idea to make an analogy between Parker's growing power and him becoming an adult work well and is handled intelligently. The pace is good and fast and there is some humor that works well. Tobey MaGuire's Peter Parker/Spider-Man is spot on. He has that something that make us believing what is going om with him. Kirsten Dunst is good though her character is less complex and remain a little bit flat. Willem Dafoe, to my taste, is lacking the menace that his character demands. But that is my taste and in general he does a good job.<br/><br/>I did have 2 problems with the film:<br/><br/>1. The effects of Spider-Man  flying through the streets has been done completely by computer and it shows. The computer has problem of imitating a natural human movement and you see it in any move that Spider-Man does.<br/><br/>2. The script,though good, has holes in it. An example for that can be seen in M.J. declaration of love to Peter Parker towards the end of the film. It comes from nowhere. Suddenly, out of nowhere, she declares her love to him. There are several examples for that and that is a shame.<br/><br/>It is good, entertaining and relatively short(only 2 hours run)which is a blessing. Go see it. It worth every Euro/Dollar you will spend on it."

","I have just one thing to comment about this Movie, that's the way to do it. I'm a real fan of super heroes, so I always enjoy watching a movie about those, but I hadn't seen a god version since I watch Spidey! -At last a god super heroe movie!-That's what I say You can have fun with a movie, like X-Men(my favorite super heroes team), but the movie is awful! as a real movie version from the comics, no one looks the same (except Xavier). The director gives the impression that to be a super hero is funny...but, anyway, that's not the point, now is time to talk about Spiderman. A complete story, with drama, suspense, love, action, death... You can think whatever you want about the heroe, but you must recognize that Spiderman is the best movie of Super heroes ever done, and movies like Batman, X-Men or Judge Dred are a traition to the original spirit of the comic-book."

","The genre that encompasses this film and all others that set out to make a film from a comic book character and story need to be watched with that in mind.  I'm getting the feeling that some people watched this movie around the time their rent check was due.  Keep in mind entertainment, laughter, and FUN.  This movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and neither should the viewer.<br/><br/>With that out there, I loved this movie.  It didn't disappoint me in any way.  Know why?  I didn't watch it, thinking it would become my all-time favorite movie.  Though, it in many ways did accomplish just that.  For days after seeing Spiderman, I had to concentrate to imagine a time I was more entertained.  It made me want to go around like I did when I was a kid, pressing my two middle fingers into my palm and making the swishing sound. I've always been a Spiderman fan and was severely disappointed in the older live acting versions of this story.  I was actually glad to see some CGI going into this movie.  When you think about it, CGI is just another way to portray things that can't humanly be done, yet.  At least not as well. Could you imagine someone trying to whip around New York with a harness and cables.<br/><br/>The story was fun, the acting just how it should be for these characters, and the direction was right on.  Toby McGuire acted just how I've always imagined Peter Parker behaved.  Kinda geeky, but relatable; like me.  Not the way nerds are often portrayed in movies where you just can't relate to or sympathize with them.<br/><br/>Spiderman (2002) 9.5/10 *'s - thank you"

"Aidan McGuinness","Null","0","0","4 July 2002"," With great budgets, comes a not-so-great movie
","What's the deal with the lashings of praise heaped on 'Spider-man', including a current ranking of #138? Certainly I can't quite fathom it, although 'Spider-man' is fairly entertaining. The plot? Does it matter? Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) gets bitten by a spider, develops spider powers, decides to help people, must fight the Green Goblin who is actually his best friend's schizoid father. Oh and there's a conflicted love interest to pursue in the form of Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) - well there would have to be wouldn't there? (Yes, it's an element of the comic I know.)<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire was - and with the sequels still is - a great choice for the role. He has enough geeky charm to pull off the awkward Parker, and enough conviction of character, to pull off Parker's dual Spiderman identity. He effortless captures the screen with the awkward tics he has mannered, the shy furtive glances, and the strength lying underneath. Dafoe is a good actor, but he never really feels menacing here as Spiderman's nemesis - and this is quite a flaw. Indeed when Dafoe is acting as the Green Goblin I remained pretty much detached from the scene - a cast of miscasting I feel (although others have equally praised the performance). Dunst does what Dunst does best - love interest, and she's quite capable at it. The other actors are all fine, although they needn't bother writing up any acceptance speeches for next year.<br/><br/>The problem with the movie is that it's flawed. The first half of the movie is definitely good. It deals with Parker gaining his powers, and discovering how to work with them. There's a lot of cute humour, and good character development and the SFX are non-intrusive. The characters all interact well - including Peter's relationship with his Aunt and Uncle. I had good hopes for the movie at this point. Unfortunately once Parker assumes the Spiderman identity to a proper degree and begins fighting crime, the movie starts to descend to a more banal action flick. Spiderman sense bad thing - Spiderman stop bad thing. Yes, it's what he does in the comics but seeing Spiderman flinging himself about for an hour in a series of action set pieces grows wearisome. This isn't helped by the fact that the SFX employed at times are downright dreadful - while the web swinging is generally impressive, the effects of the Green Goblin can appear irritatingly cartoonish, forcing the viewer out of the picture. There's also some incredible clichés in it about saving girls and making choices. This continues right up to the end with some cringe-inducing dialog about choices and responsibilities - it made my skin wince in pain. Admittedly this may be in keeping with what you expect from a comic book, but I expect a little bit more from action on screen, especially with a surfeit of brainless action flicks.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi, the director of the piece, does at least like his material. He gets good performances from his cast and the action - while predictable - is well filmed, with dizzying vertigo shots of Spiderman swinging through New York. There's a nice comic book feel to the proceedings - everything is painted and designed that bit much more intensely than life (there's no drabness here) and it gives a good homage to the comic book ideals. Nonetheless it can't quite make me love this movie. It's enjoyable sure and if it had kept to the spirit of the first half of the movie I'd give it a firm recommendation. As it is I can say to watch it, just don't expect too much from it other than a fun flick. Somewhat disappointing, given the hype. 6.3/10."

And I shall confess to you all, abit picky as I can be, not much was flawed in this very amusing, exciting and breathtaking adventure!<br/><br/>The special effects did their job, but there were some drawbacks. At some point the hero (as Peter Parker) swings thru the city and you can hear him scream of joy. Setback? Mouth ain't moving...<br/><br/>But that's just a petitesse, there is so much to talk about that brings a smile to my face.<br/><br/>The actors are excellent and perfectly casted for the parts.

Oh, and not to forget J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the Daily Bugles cheiftant and master in a brilliant and lovingly act as one of the most love-to-hate good guys ever to hit the silver screen!<br/><br/>The story is as you spiderloving friends all now it to be.

"thepts","7","0","0","5 July 2002"," Dis.App.Ointing!!
","Yes, this movie is disappointing. I've heard so much hype from people I know and trust, that I actually had some expectations for sensation & innovation here..<br/><br/>I like the nerdy main character, but Spidey wasn't a nerd when he was Spidey. He was a really cool character with all the right, relaxed punchlines in the middle of danger (while his thoughts betrayed that he was anything besides relaxed). Also, when things got a little too ""super-heroey"" and the bad guys sported fancy moves and evil, over-the-top cheesy costumes, Spidey always had a sarcastic comment about their suit or similarly, to make them even more angry..<br/><br/>Nothing of that here. The only thing we hear Spidey say, is with a squeaky, nerdy voice - exactly like Peter Parker's. Sigh.<br/><br/>Of course, we get the obligatory upside-down-with-mask-half-off - kiss, which is nice enough. The school bully get's a serious beating, which is a great scene. There is also some nice comic relief, for instance when Spidey wears his first suit.. that was really funny, but so were the ""worst"" love scenes.<br/><br/>The evil character is REALLY weakly designed. With the brushed metallic suit, carrying an eeevil grin (help!), it was laughable, and even more kitschily ""I wanna be hitech"" than Batman's suit in the latter film.<br/><br/>Also, the special effects are terrible. When Spidey did his first, spider-like jumps here, you could VERY easily see what was CG and what wasn't. That was especially annoying when there, in a ""jumping from roof-to-roof""-scene, for a while was 2 sec CG, 2 sec film, 2 sec CG, etc.. terrible.<br/><br/>
Attack of the Clones not only - surprisingly (!) - has MUCH less embarrassing, gut-wrenching, mushy love scences, but also is a much more sensational and innovative movie, all over. I thought there might be a ""duel"" between these two, but no chance whatsoever for Spidey here.<br/><br/>All in all, an OK ""superhero movie"" (which is definitively what it is), but except for the nerdiness and personal problems, it has few of the qualities that made the comic a success. I'm sorry to say that this first Spiderman movie will be forgotten faster than you can say ""Two Towers"".. 7/10"
"gazdolphin","Null","0","0","5 July 2002"," This review may contain Spoilers - please avoid!
","The choice of Tobey Maguire is a good one on the behalf of the Producer. The vulnerable, naive look of Maguire makes his transformation into superhero all the more exciting. The contrast in the level of his confidence before and after the transformation is something you really cannot miss.<br/><br/>Originally the producers had Jude Law on the cards to play Spider-man, and it's pleasing to hear they decided against using the attractive star in the film. Jude Law is a handsome looking man and possesses the tanned and muscular body of any reputable Hollywood star. Due to his nature, he wouldn't have portrayed the nerdy look needed for Peter Parker with any realism. Maguire's slightly fragile look (and he isn't the most attractive of actors) lends itself well to the bullying, humiliating scenes of Spider-man's beginning. <br/><br/>The effects are at times breathtaking, and involve probably some of the greatest gravity defying stunts seen on celluloid. However, the predictable swinging and flying of the superhero star can become repetitive. This isn't helped by the film's overly long running time - a good 20 minutes might have been cut for a better result. The usual cliche of Hero against Villain (where Evil almost defeats the Hero) is in full form at the climax of the film. Yet we always know that the Hero will manipulate a final surge of courage and strength to defeat the Villain. You can expect the usual turn around of events courtesy of the hero's fluked prowess at his scrape with death.<br/><br/>There are some unexpected scenes of sadness, that if you can watch them without feeling a lump in your throat, then you have no heart. Obviously though not on the scale of a pure Romantic flick, these scenes can really bring home the consequences - both positive and negative - of one's actions and choices. <br/><br/>I think one improvement might have been to tone down the vigilante image of Spider-man. Of course the film should reiterate Spider-man's passion for crime stopping and peace; but the frequency of his 'crusades' wrongly suggest that New York is some kind of permanently hostile crime zone.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the film very much, but I await the inevitable sequel with, perhaps, a slightly wary anticipation."

","*Spoiler   I have to admit that I had my reservations about Spider-Man when I went to see it for the first time, in fact, it was really only my sister's recommendations of the film that managed to get me into the cinema. As a long-term, if occasionally disinterested, Spidey fan I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film, starting with the excellent opening sequence. I must also give praise to Danny Elfman's musical score, which really heightened the emotional tension and un-natural atmosphere of the film, just as it did in Batman. As Peter Parker, Tobey Maguire was as good, I think, as anyone they could have gotten for the role and I can't think of anyone who could have portrayed Peter better. Yet as Spider-Man, I was a little dismayed about his comic delivery, although to be fair the comic material in the script was rather poor. As for the rest of the cast, I thoroughly enjoyed Kirsten Dunst's performance as Mary-Jane, although I didn't like it how the script-writers turned her character into some helpless damsel in distress who needs to be saved all the time. James Franco portrayed Harry Osborn excellently, really making the audience feel for an average, under-achieving teen who has been lumbered with a genius father who feels ashamed of him. Willem Dafoe WAS the Green Goblin, I thought he was perfect as the schizophrenic Norman Osborn, although I didn't like the Green Goblin costume, finding it too reminiscent of ""Power-Rangers"" for my tastes, I would have preffered the Green Goblin to resemble more closely the comic-book character, perhaps if the human enhancers Oscorp were developing had been organic instead of some robotic-armour.     That aside, the only snivelling little complaints are as follows:<br/><br/>1.) How come Mary Jane has to slog her guts out as a waitress when she has a millionairre boyfriend? <br/><br/>2.) On that note, why does Peter have to risk severe injury wrestling to save enough money to buy a car? why doesn't he just ask his super-rich best friend Harry if he can loan him some money to buy a car?<br/><br/>3.) Isn't it a tad strange how Peter Parker and Norman Osborn both have their little ""accidents"" at exactly the same time? That said, Spider-Man does seem to establish himself before the Green Goblin.<br/><br/>     Anyway, who cares what I think?, the film is still the best super-hero film to date and well worth the admission fee. <br/><br/>Fortunately enough I don't have to worry about that since I own the film on DVD having bought a rather dodgy copy from the far east from an even dodgier store-owner, and let me tell you! the English subtitles are sooooo Cool/Bad!(e.g With Gay Power comes Gay responsibility) and Mary-Jane now wants an ""axe"" instead of ""act"".

I liked how it started of as peter parker being a major geek and then when he gets his powers he doesnt take crap from anybody, Now the love was very good in this movie it showed how Mary Jane was some really cool girl that had tons of friend big boy friend and everything and Peter just was some normal kid has one good friend and lived with his aunt may and uncle ben, And it showed how nice Peter was to Mary Jane like when Mary Jane's Dad told her to come in the damn house to make dinner, And she was crying and everything and Peter cherred her up by telling her dont worry about it your a pretty girl, So that was good. Willam Dafoe did really good in this movie i think no one else can play the green goblin like willam defoe the story is good as troubles are all coming on Peter Parker when he got his powers he started to act kinda big and bad not hanging with his aunt and uncle too much and it was so sad how his uncle died cause it was Peter's fault (dont mean to sound like a the bad guy) and then it was aunt may going to the hospital after a visit from the goblin then greeny went to far taking Peter's love Mary Jane to the brige where spiderman had to make a nerve racking decision wheter to save his girlfriend or the chrildren evendently spiderman saved both and after killed the green goblin. What i REALLY liked about this movie was the end when there in the cemetery and Mary and Peter are talking and mary kisses Peter and Peter says ""I cant"" and Mary said ""cant what"" then he said cant love u (because everyone one he loves goes in danger) so while hes walking away Mary finds out so now i think Mary Jane will know hes spiderman and tell him.

","Spider-Man shows what kind of bloat can settle into comic-book adaptations once people stop caring about them, forcing the filmmakers into a desperate, all-senses barrage of cheap stimuli. One of the most wrongheaded films to come out of Hollywood in years, Spider-Man throws even more spaghetti against the wall than its insidious Marvel precursor Captain America (1990). This time, none of it sticks. That Tobey McGuire was paid to be more irritating than the villain Green Goblin gets at the massive size and scope of this misfire. His nerdiness isn't enough to hide the fact that he is to many screaming, 13-year old pre-pubescent girls, an overrated hunk starring in the most overrated CHICK FLICK since Titanic. It's like he's the world's worst stand-up comic pitching Spandex tights to a room full of ballet dancers. As Mary Jane Watson, Kirsten Dunst slips, whines, slobers, and annoys just as she did on ""Bring It On"" minus the pom poms. Willem Defoe's portrayal of the Green Goblin is not exactly a disaster, but he does rob the formerly brooding villain of all his mystery and charm from the comics & animated series. The watered-down set design with its horribly integrated CGI effects pales in comparison to the fertile imagination of Tim Burton's scale-model masterpieces from the first 2 Batman films, feels like a tawdry rip-off of the old Spiderman video game from 2 decades past. Everything about this film is oversized and underthought, with wretched dialogue and some of the most overblown yet poorly choreographed action sequences ever to come down the pike. Spider-Man is very typical of what is wrong with today's fledgling Hollywood system. Praise from a few incompetent film critics along with endless airing of TV ADs 8 mos. prior to a film's premiere is enough to propel any medicore film to box office phenomenon."

The last movie of this kind I saw was `X-Men', and that was only because my friends forced me to see it. I found that movie to be dreadful, and was determined never to see another `superhero movie' again.<br/><br/>Obviously, I was highly reluctant to go see Spider-Man.  When my friends finally dragged me to the theater to go see it, I was expecting yet another piece of poorly written childish fantasy. It turned out that this was exactly what Spider-Man was not. Somehow this movie managed to hold my attention, from the opening credits to the last scene with Mary Jane and Peter Parker.  Few Hollywood movies I have watched in recent years have been able to do this.<br/><br/>Spider-Man has an old-fashioned type of innocence and charm that is very much lacking in most of the movies being produced today. Tobey Maguire was brilliant as Peter Parker, and accomplished the nearly impossible task of making the premise of this movie - a teenager being bitten by genetically altered spider and ultimately becoming a superhero - seem plausible. I really cared about what happened to this character. The supporting cast was excellent, and I enjoyed almost every scene in the movie.<br/><br/>
The most surprising thing about Spider-Man was that it remained highly enjoyable even after many repeated viewings. I am not a person who enjoys watching the same movie over and over again, yet somehow I ended up seeing Spider-Man a record four times with various friends. I think their enthusiasm for this movie was infectious, because each time I watched it, the movie still felt exciting and compelling.  I am actually considering purchasing this movie when it is released on video, something I have not done in a long time.<br/><br/>Well done Sam Raimi (?). For better or for worse, you have turned this cynical skeptic into a Spider-Man fan, and I am looking forward to the sequel."

"Ptroinks","4","0","0","2 July 2002"," Real actors and sets vs. CGI...
","I had kind of high expectations of this movie, and after I saw it, I couldn't stop being puzzled by the poor way computer graphics were used in the film. Yes, a lot of the scenes in the film required some kind of special effects-use (and some actually required the entire shot to be CGI), but to this degree? I don't think so. Just about ALL of the scenes including Spider-Man (as Spider-Man, not Peter Parker) were CGI. And that's OK, I guess, but ONLY if it looks real! By using some sort of mix between using the actor on a blue-screen and CGI, in stead of ONLY using CGI, I think the results would have been much better.<br/><br/>If I had brought a pen and some paper with me, I'm pretty sure I could have spotted at least 80-90% of the scenes\shots where computer graphics were used. In particular, I'd like to mention the scene (SMALL SPOILER AHEAD!!!) just after Peter Parker discovers his new ""gift"". He's running and jumping from roof to roof, and in that entire sequence, there's no Tobey Maguire on screen. It's all CGI, and it's all too visible. The point of CGI (in my opinion) is to help make a scene more interesting and dramatic to tell the story better, but in order to do so, the CGI-usage must be believable. There were a few times, as I watched the movie, where I thought that this should be in a computer game, not in a film. Altogether, the bad CGI in this movie ruined the experience for me. In a computer game, you can get away with it. But not on the big-screen."
"Parallax-UK","8","0","0","1 July 2002"," Falls short of being a true classic, but nevertheless an extraordinarily good blockbuster.
","Recent advances in special-effects technology seems to have triggered quite a spate of super-hero films, although few have been as high profile as Spider-Man. As what has now become traditional, the film begins by telling the story of how the hero, in this case Peter Parker, becomes the titular super-hero. The story is told well. Although many purists have criticised certain liberties the makers have taken with the original storyline (such as Spidey's web-shooters being organic in the film, as opposed to manufactured), none have been taken unnecessarily. If any criticism can be made, it is that some of the characterisation is not as strong as it could have been. Although Tobey Maguire brings a lot to the Peter Parker character, he did seem to be playing him as Clarke Kent. Also, Aunt May is hugely one-dimensional. Okay, this is a film of a comic book, but when the characters are flatter than those that featured in the cartoon, alarm bells ring. Characterisation aside, the film as a whole has many good points. The story is competent, although some loose ends were left. The special effects have been much discussed. Whereas many were very good, there was the occasional piece of CGI stunt-work that was so clumsy (think of the TV show Andromeda) that suspension of disbelief was brought crashing down to earth on several occasions. Another problem with this was the spectacle of the film. Although the scenes of Spidey swinging through New York were satisfying, one can't help but feel that an opportunity has been missed to really go for the breathtaking, heart-stopping, amazing spectacle that the trailer promised. For example, for those lucky enough to witness the awe-inspiring sight of a helicopter caught up in a giant web suspended between the mighty Twin Towers in the teaser released prior to the tragic events in New York will be disappointed to see that no scene in the film comes close to provoking such astonishment. I've said a lot of negative things about this film, but that isn't because it's poor. In fact, it is an extremely good film, with a reasonably strong and amusing story, and scenes that will stay with you for a while after seeing them. The reason I've criticised the film is because it was so close to being truly great - a real classic. Instead, it is merely very good, and I would highly recommend anyone who enjoys blockbusters to see it. My score: 8/10"

","Did they release two versions of this movie? One that I saw and one that all these people who are writing good comments about the movie saw?

When Tobey Maguire cried in the hospital I was looking for the Visine bottle letting out drops from above his head.. Half of the audience laughed at this scene in the theater... Oh, and how about Willem Defoe? Did anyone buy him as the schizo rich guy? The scenes in which he struggles with his alter ego in the mansion? Give me a break! Oh, and maybe they should try hiring writers for Spidey 2, so that the dialogue won't be so stilted and bumbling.<br/><br/>Watch the original Batman and try to say this was a good comic adaptation. Better yet, watch A Beautiful Mind so you can see what a truly talented on screen couple can do.

","You know the great feeling when you leave the movie theater after seeing certain films? Well, I had it after seeing Spiderman. Might be that I have been a Spiderman fan above other superheroes all my life, but still, I think this film has captured the original cartoon's feeling and atmosphere. You could feel yourself jumping above New York along Spiderman. Also I think J.K. Simmons made a marvelous role as J.J. Jameson, he captured the original cartoon character's nature so well, that I was all smile when he was showed on screen.

","Went to see this movie at Finnkino's Plevna theatrecentre, at firstnight show, with 2 friends, and we all were amazed by this motion picture. Acting was good, esp. Tobey Maguire(Parker) and Kirsten Dunst(M.J) did their roles as passionate as possible!<br/><br/>Recommended for everyone!"
"G-B-A","Null","0","0","28 June 2002"," Perfect film
","I wrote a long review and then everything crashed... but in the bottom line, the film is the best comic adaption ever.<br/><br/>The acting is superb especially by Toby and of course Simmons as Jameson (truly brilliant casting) and Dafoe (but nobody steals the show from the hero... unlike some other comic films). Kirsten Dunst is wonderful... one or two scenes I didn't like (their first re-meeting outside where MJ works was wrong somehow) but overall, it was excellent, the chemistry between them was perfect.<br/><br/>I ESPECIALLY liked the dialogue - don't believe what people say. It was exactly the opposite from SW 2 where it all seemed phony and badly acted. Here it was just right... if you could symphatise with the spirit of the comic, with the moral issues (and not be cynical about them but really appreciate the truths in those moral lessons and the situations), and identify with the way Peter feels towards Mary Jane, you'd love it. Some people just don't realise that this is the way it happens in reality too (admittedly, with a touch of a comic book feel), but this really happens. You fall in love so strongly with somebody and you can say those things, can feel these feelings, wanting to protect somebody... it's the truth and it's beautiful.<br/><br/>Slight drawback are the special effects - the swinging over the buildings do capture the spirit, but it's tiring to see the same CGI effects again. I want to see really good effects again, with mini models and hard work. Make it more real.... a bit of a shame.<br/><br/>Surprised me that nobody mentioned how inconsistent this is with the whole Gwen Stacy story but it really doesn't matter - Sam Raimi and the rest of the team somehow managed to capture exactly the essence into one film with hardly any faults. This movie tops by far (and I'm not saying I disliked the other comic films) X-Men, Batman, Superman.... they are all inferior because none of thems makes you really want to be in the hero's place - not because he kicks ass but because he's someone like you who... who you root for because it's right. You like Peter Parker FIRST, only then Spider Man. 9.5 / 10, five stars out of five.... this film is one of the best ever made. BRILLIANT!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>(Sequels - I'd really love to see Venom and Carnage, maybe in the third film. Can't see how they'll manage to fit the Lizard, Dr. Octupus AND Harry Osborn all in one film. I hope it won't turn out to be a disaster like Batman and Robin (yuck). I've read somewhere a suggestion to cast Gary Oldman instead of San Neil in the role of Dr. Octupus - go for it...)<br/><br/>Again, Top Notch. GO WATCH IT NOW (again)."
"ma_teng","Null","0","0","28 June 2002"," what a debacle
","***spoilers, maybe***<br/><br/>This wretched movie seems to have taken America by storm. Pity America.<br/><br/>
It's difficult to know where to begin. The violence is amplified beyond belief and exquisitely irrelevant to the story and overpowers the characters. Compare with the first two Evil Dead films Sam Raimi made - superb, original movies with horror and violence in perfect balance. With Spider-Man, the violence is assaultive and pointless, given that kids are the primary target. Hey, I don't mind a good, bloody, violent movie, but this piece of junk is worthless to adults as a romance or as an adventure. So who is the audience? Trekkies in withdrawal?<br/><br/>The effects are fun but overdose heavily on CG - no stuntmen, by the looks. The script is rock-bottom. At every opportunity David Koepp inserts lines that are either corny (but not charming) or cliched. There is no character development. Peter Parker changes from a dope into a bland jerk in a red and blue suit instead of a hero. Why does he suddenly wisecrack ala Schwarzenegger? Why can't he get it on with Kirsten Dunst? Is it because he has eyes for James Franco instead? Watch this space - the sequel is on the way.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire - I can see why people like him, but really, his performance was in complete monotone, as if he'd just been attending a Charles Bronson master class. Some of the lovey-dovey dialogue between him and Kirsten Dunst (especially in the hospital) was particularly awful - people were cackling in the theatre where I saw it. Still, he tried hard. Dunst - a thankless role but a good effort. But still forgettable. Some other actors in this film - who shall remain nameless - were inexplicably bad.<br/><br/>Spider-Man lacks completely the warmth and sincerity of Donner's Superman and the wicked humour and bleakness of Burton's Batman. Yet it rips off both films and even puts in jokey references to Superman AND Star Wars (of the ""I am your father, Luke"" variety). I thought the dark side to Michael Keaton in Batman was not entirely convincing, but how wrong I was after watching this.<br/><br/>
Oh, and listen up, those who dream of the death of ""political correctness"" will be overjoyed to see two key scenes: (1) the wrestling sequence, where newly confident Spider-Man in his prototype suit baits the incumbent with an idiotic fag joke (jeez, we all laughed at that), and (2) when Kirsten Dunst is about to be gang-raped, and is saved by Spidey, and she instantly recovers from this everyday experience to kiss him passionately. Say boys, did you notice her wet shirt with protuding nipples? Just the ticket in the aftermath of a rape threat scene. Michael Winner himself couldn't have done better (though he tried real hard in Death Wish II).<br/><br/>When Spidey does his last little aerobatic display and lands atop a building with the American flag, I thought - hang on, have I missed something? Is there a reference here to something deeper? Like US foreign policy going berserk, what with all this ""with power comes responsibility"" stuff? Nah. Naaaah. Spider-Man doesn't touch the wealthiest, nastiest criminals; he sticks to folks who snatch bags from little old ladies. How charmingly naive. Just like the airbrushed twin towers: perfect for post-S11 America.<br/><br/>
It is incredible to think that Stan Lee associated himself with this cynical film. It's a travesty. I just cannot believe that Sam Raimi, of all people, could go so corporate and trash the idea of Spider-Man."

","This movie was little more than American Pie meets Arachnophobia with a bit of Tarzan thrown in. Please do not allow Kirsten Dunst to speak in movies. She was great in Virgin Suicides for the simple fact that she only had a line every half hour or so. She is wonderful at walking down the street looking over her shoulder, but there it ends. The guy playing spiderman nearly had me walking out of the theatre when he came out with that amorous drivel - ""I love you too much, no, not enough, but the two of us could be, only if I didn't have eight legs""... Please. Willem Dafoe was wasted here - I would have made him Spiderman, who cares about the teenage bit.<br/><br/>I liked the swinging around the buildings part but all in all this film was appallingly acted.

","Spider-Man, Spider-Man, does whatever a spider can. Or a Batman. Or an X-Man. Yeah, here we are again, another summer blockbuster based on a classic superhero. The plot is exactly the same as all the others, with the exception that instead of having a strong male lead we seem to have a pretty version of that nerdy guy from Road Trip. Oh dear.<br/><br/>Every single element in this film is utterly predictable, but it's also one of the dumbest films I've ever seen. Why didn't Peter Parker immediately go to a doctor after being bitten by a genetically-enhanced spider? Surely there's a lawsuit in there: ""I was bitten by a spider and as a result I have become a crappy computer-generated caricature, swinging from building to building and in and out of massive plotholes and de riguer action movie cliches.""<br/><br/>And as for Mary-Jane whatever, at one point in the film (hopefully intentionally) she refers to herself as ""stupid"". How stupid can you get? You almost get raped at knifepoint, only to be predictably saved by Spider-Man, and then start dancing about happily in the rain as if a billion puppies with pink daisies for tales are licking your face and pooing chocolate. YOU JUST ALMOST GOT RAPED AT KNIFEPOINT. Hopefully the next movie will deal with Mary Jane's post-traumatic stress disorder. Now there's a movie: imagine her at one of those support groups in Fight Club: ""I was almost raped at knifepoint only to be saved by Spider-Man, who OBVIOUSLY ISN'T Peter Parker, despite the fact that I saw him in school the other day with webs coming out of his hands and lightning-fast reactions. Which is something that I see on a daily basis.""<br/><br/>As with all other directors of blockbuster superhero movies, Sam Raimi's name is completely inconsequential as all of these films are so heavily reliant on what can be achieved with computer-aided trickery. Anyone could have directed this movie, the only thing that made it a Raimi film is the now-standard Hollywood gimmick of referencing the director's oeuvre: this time it's the sequence in which the Green Goblin has an argument with himself in front of the mirror, a reference to the nihilistically brilliant scene in Evil Dead 2 where Bruce Campbell's reflection strangles him. This gimmick keeps the director's fans happy, masking the fact that this film is just another product of the Hollywood production line. That's how it works these days, there's no imagination involved, it's just up to the CPU of a computer. As for the character animation, no matter how many millions of dollars Hollywood throws at it, it just ain't gonna look right. You can represent a human, but it's physically impossible to simulate one, they're just too complex, too unique. Just think about all the money Hollywood has wasted trying to achieve this.<br/><br/>I also counted at least ten (10) continuity errors, just simple things like the position of character's hands and the expressions on their faces between shots. If a director or editor can't handle the basest of film-making rules, what hope have they got on a big-budget Hollywood film? Well, judging by Spider-Man, none, obviously. I can imagine quizzing Raimi on this, and I know what his answer would be: ""Well, this one goes up to eleven..."""

","I meant to review this months ago when I had (by great luck) managed to attend the premiere in Los Angeles.  Regardless, with a ""better late than never"" attitude, this has turned out to be one of Summer 2002's bright spots in an incredibly busy movie season.<br/><br/>As it stands, ""Spider-Man"" has all the right elements: A real comic book ""feel"" to it, an excellent Danny Elfman score, Tobey Maguire as a totally believable Peter Parker (with just the right amounts of shyness and the ""old Parker luck""), an appropriately sinister Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, and a scene-stealing performance by J. K. Simmons as the cigar-chomping J. Jonah Jameson.  That's a character that should have been used more in the movie, as he was a lot of fun to see in action.  Here's hoping for more screen time in the next one.<br/><br/>There wasn't a lot that I didn't like about this movie.  I still didn't like the Green Goblin costume as much as I tried to, the organic web-shooters didn't bother me half as much as I had figured (perhaps as they weren't overplayed as being so), and while Kirsten Dunst didn't do a bad job as Mary Jane, she just never really captured the ""look"" of what I though the character should be.<br/><br/>As for the ""goods"" of the film, the battles were perfectly set up as comic-cook style brawls, with plenty of exaggerated movements and situations.  When Spider-Man web-swung through the streets of New York (love the costume), I couldn't help but get a chilled sense of awe that I originally felt after seeing the first trailer last year.  And the character relationships were great.  ""Spider-Man"" the comic has always been as much about the man behind the mask as it is about the hero.  I'm so relieved that Sam Raimi took noticeable attempts to balance the two.<br/><br/>Despite its comic-book origins, the last battle is pretty intense, comparably so to the Tim Burton ""Batman"" films.  And the Green Goblin's scare tactics even made myself jump a few times.  So parents with very little ones may want to check out the film first to see if the kids can handle it.  But in that regard, I'm glad Raimi took the film seriously enough to not let it delve into the lame campiness that was ""Batman & Robin"".  And I'm really glad that they didn't take too many liberties with the Spider-Man origin to remove the emotional impact that it carried throughout the film.<br/><br/>As a movie, it retained all of the wonder, excitement and fun that has endeared me to Spider-Man since I was a kid.  As a super-hero film, I can compare it to the orignal ""Batman"" and ""Superman"" films in its high-quality treatment.  I will wait impatiently for the feature-packed (I hope) DVD, and will have faith that the next installment of the series will be as rewarding as this one was.  A must see.  A fun movie."
"HenryHextonEsq","6","0","0","30 June 2002"," Truly depends on how you judge it.
","I'm not going to expend time and verbiage in attacking this film; I haven't the time or inclination. Yes, it is indeed poor in many respects, but I did enjoy it, unlike such ""blockbusters"" as ""Blade II"", ""The Fast and the Furious"" and ""The Mummy Returns"".<br/><br/>Let me concede no vested interests here; I am no ""Spiderman"" fan of yore. Never read comics or seen the cartoon I don't think. It strangely eluded me really; maybe slightly before my time. I can, I feel, offer a fairly objective view here. Firstly, if anyone judges this movie by a yardstick of realism they would be very foolish. If they were to judge it by a measure of how good a film it is then they would be perhaps more understandably unwise. While I'm setting up the view that it must be viewed as a comic book interpretation, it should be said there have to be grounds for judging bad dialogue etc. on its own terms. An example would have to be the almost painfully two-dimensional and near comatose ""emotional scenes"" and particularly Kirsten Dunst's performance. There are comic book characters, and there are, well, very bad displays of acting. ""I'd like to learn how to act?"" I think she pallidly says at one point early on; well, the words seem apposite for Dunst herself. It is a swollen, perhaps thankless performance for an admittedly limited role. Maguire, well, very one-note and not all that impressive, especially as the film wears on. Willem Dafoe, and particularly J.K. Simmons as Jameson give far better ideas of how these sort of larger-than-life creations should be played... J.J. Jameson is an absurd, amusing character pitched at the right level; ""They gotta be giving names to these weirdos now!"" etc.<br/><br/>It is often very difficult to tell whether the film is intentionally or unintentionally funny. The absurd haplessness of Parker's first Spider-Man costume is surely meant, as are certain touches of dialogue. A bizarre bit is where Dafoe, as Norman Osborne, launches a broadside against ""MJ"", or Mary Jane as she is belatedly known later on in the film. Something like ""you should do what you want with her and then broom her!"" I must say I laughed, as did my cohorts. Very odd wording and a plain absurd tone to it. Also, what was that Aunt of Parker's doing cropping up all over the place later on in the picture. She seemed to have insinuated herself into Mr Osborne's family. This isn't commented upon at any point. What was she doing frankly!? Dialogue like ""With great power comes great responsibility"" and Parker's beleaguered description of why he likes MJ really does make one laugh and not I suspect intentionally. And have I touched on the completely unnecessary and ludicrous advertising of having Macy Gray just tacked in there...? ;-) Oh, yes and the ludicrous, hackneyed scenes with Cliff Robertson's Uncle Ben and the ultimatum offered by the Green Goblin - ""The girl or the kiddies!!!!"" My word, the ""Green Goblin"", eh? Seemed a rum sort of villain, having little or no specified aims other than to be a madman, torment Spiderman and perhaps - but it is left very vague - get back at a few businessman...! What of the scene where the scantily-attired Dunst is ""accosted"" by these men doing weird dog impressions...?! Reminded me of a scene with Bobby Briggs in the ""Twin Peaks"" pilot episode... Very odd tone here, with a rape very much implied.<br/><br/>Some moments perhaps jarred a little, with the cartoon violence - perhaps itself questionable if this is targeted at younger audiences - all too numbing. The change in a late scene to realistic bloody violence just doesn't feel right somehow; both depictions of violence here have their problems and jar with each other.<br/><br/>While as you can see, I have much to question in this film, I must emphasize that I did enjoy the damn thing. It's better thought out and has more of a modicum of intelligence about it than the ""Blade II""s... Be wary of high expectations; this is hack work, and not always as well done as it could be, but it is at least fun to watch.<br/><br/>Rating:- ***/*****"

","Spiderman has been considered through the years as one of the greatest comic book heroes around. It is no surprise that the movie world has been eagerly awaiting its transition to the big screen. Any fan boy will be able to regail you with countless 혩spidey' exploits (although I wouldn't recommend getting them started.) For all this hype and speculation, has the movie lived up to our expectations?<br/><br/>Much like Tim Burtons' piece Batman, Raimi's rendition of Spiderman has gone against what many would expect. Rather than invest in a complex modern plot and hard hitting issues, the film harks back to when Spiderman comics made their debut. This is a clean, wholesome Manhattan, full of stereotyped buffoons and colour-saturated skylines. Peter Parker, faithfully played by Tobey Maguire, is a bright young student, and the brunt of the jokes from the school bullies. After being bitten by a genetically engineered spider, he becomes - you guessed it - spider man.<br/><br/>It must be noted at this point that if the actors had not thrown themselves into the comic book world on screen, the film would have been quite terrible indeed. Raimi is clearly at home with this kind of material, having previously portrayed 혩zero to hero' stories in the Evil Dead series and Darkman. And it shows in the performances - Kirsten Dunst is the perfect damsel in distress as Mary Jane Watson, and Willem Dafoe gives a malign super villain life as the Green Goblin. Aside from an unnecessary appearance from Macy Gray, the entire cast of characters brilliantly reinforced the illusion of a moving comic book.<br/><br/>Is the film just a milieu of pretty pictures? 혩Is there any reason I should go' , I am asked, 혩and see a man in red and blue lycra swing between buildings?' Spiderman is certainly no brain buster, but we must remember that this was not Raimi's objective. The film serves instead as a playground for all involved. Maguire and Dafoe, familiar with countless serious and more obscure roles, have clearly savoured their time with the outlandish Raimi. A no-brainer? Yes, but a well played one - and it never claimed to be anything more."

","Either I need to see this movie again, or the people who are giving it the thumbs up need to see it again. Unless forced, I doubt I will watch Spider-Man again. Hopefully, the sequel will be leaps and bounds above this one. I feel as though the makers of this film ""phoned it in."" I do like this genre of film (Superman, Batman I, and X-men), but I almost had to walk out of this one. My supporting details are as follows:<br/><br/>1. Lack of chemistry between Maguire and Dunst. Yes, I know they were dating in real life, but they seemed like they were strangers. I almost fell asleep during the hospital scene and at the finale. 2. Maguire's lack of charisma. This movie should have been fun. The fun thing about Spider-Man was that he was a wise-ass, cocky teenager. Yes, Peter Parker was supposed to be dull, but Spider-Man is not. 3. Dafoe. Yes, comic book movies are an excuse for hamming up the villain role. But Dafoe made Schwartzenegger's Mr. Freeze look like Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor. The costume was bad (i.e., terrible), but Dafoe was bad even as Norman Osborne. 4. Writing. Most of the memorable comic book movies offer fans new information or a new story. This one was a mix of several famous storylines, complete with themes that had the subtlety of a sledge-hammer.<br/><br/>5. Effects. I thought the swinging looked cool, but the Sonic the Hedgehog bouncing was too much. Yes, he's agile. But he's not made of Silly Putty. For some reason, the Goblin bounced a bit too much. Only at the end of the movie, did I feel that we were looking at a man in a costume, instead of some CGI creation.<br/><br/>Overall, the problems with this movie are the fault of the director. I like Sam Raimi's previous work. However, with this genre you have to have suspension of disbelief. As they said about the Superman movie, you have to believe a man can fly. At no time, did the movie pull me in far enough to make it the enjoyable fantasy it should have been. I think James Franco and the actor playing J.J. Jameson were the lone standouts."

","Why did I see this?! My brother was constantly telling me that some people he knows liked it. I kept trying to say no, but I kept saying, ""I don't know."" Eventually, I just decided to go see it.<br/><br/>Just when he gets his spider-powers, the film documents how headache-inducing the camerawork can be, constantly moving when he's swinging around. I didn't like the idea of unlimited web shooting--after all, it must have provided a challenge in the comics, and he's a science whiz, so what's to stop him from designing something like that? It showed where it stuck at one point (a crane at a construction site), but after that, we have few ideas of where it could stick! And, they stole from other movies, such as the much more enjoyable ""Arthur"" (about getting to the neighborhood through multiple rides), and the boring ""Episode 1"" (about Mary Jane being an ""angel"").<br/><br/>I have got to stop believing the majority. (Well, in the case of ""Minority Report,"" maybe I should believe them.) Why do you need a comics adaption of every single comic book? <br/><br/>Make more movies like ""Cube,"" ""Waking Life,"" ""Pi,"" or at least ""AI: Artificial Intelligence,"" Hollywood! Or, to Sam Raimi, go back to making movies like ""Darkman."" It wasn't very great, but it was way better than selling out!<br/><br/>1/6"
"supertom-3","9","0","0","29 June 2002"," The best comic-to-film ever!!!
","Spiderman has come to the big screen after decades of wait. We've had Spidy appear in comics, cartoons and some more low profile movies but his exploits have never lit up the big screen, until now.<br/><br/>This movie had to produce the goods, not just for Spiderman fans but for movie goers in general. It successfully brings to life one of the most popular comic characters ever and is definitely the best film of this year and in my opinion the best comic to film movie ever made, even better than Batman. What makes this better than most other effects movies is that it combines special effects wizardry with a good movie itself, what I mean is if you look at Star wars episode 2, take away the amazing effects and the movie is trash. Spiderman like Lord of the Rings is a great movie. It combines a good plot and interesting characters, and also has great performances. The film is very much like a comic book brought to life, it doesn't take itself to seriously and in Peter Parker we have a relatable hero who is likeable and suitably vulnerable. Unlike your typical action film with Schwarzenegger et al,  we have a human, 3 dimensional character.<br/><br/>The cast are all good and are a large factor in the success of the film. Toby McGuires casting as Peter Parker/Spidy had quite a debate amongst Spiderman fanatics as to whether he was the right man for the job. I, and most fans will agree his casting was perfection. McGuire holds the screen and plays the part superbly. The character is also, like the comic, complex. Spiderman's actions have consequences even when he is doing good. He has conflicting emotions and as his uncle Ben says `with great power comes great responsibility'. It is an interesting part of the film, Spiderman can't do anything without different repercussions, just as in real life. For example, Peter Parker enters a wrestling competition and wins (beating none other than the Macho Man Randy Savage) he expects to win $3000 but is only given $100. When the organiser is robbed, Parker has a chance to stop the criminal but lets him go to get back at the organiser. Later that same criminal car jacks Peters uncle and shoots him in the process, killing him. Its scenes like this that add depth to the character and make you get behind him, and there are more examples particularly towards the end. <br/><br/>Also very good in the film, in a similarly likeable character is the lovely Kirsten Dunst playing Mary Jane. She is excellent, she's charming, sweet and very pretty. Basically Dunst is playing the character to perfection. Mary Jane, like Peter, is faithfully recreated. Willem Defoe stars as the Green Goblin and his alter ego, scientist and entrepreneur, Norman Osborn. He is suitably menacing in the guise of the Green Goblin and plays the troubled Osborn equally as well. James Franco is also good as Osborn's son and friend of Peter. The action scenes are very good. With some great effects. Spiderman swings through the city and the camera swoops along with him to a vertigo inducingly brilliant affect. Sam Raimi's free flowing camera adds the perfect style to this film and he seems to have been made to direct the film. It's always exciting and importantly is well paced.<br/><br/>Like most films that are effects based there is the odd moment where the effects look a bit off but that rarely happens and doesn't spoil the film.<br/><br/>The movie is great, combining elements that make a great popcorn movie and elements that make a great film. It has a great cast, great action, a good story and a brilliant score from Danny Elfman. The film seems at times seems like a cross between Darkman and Batman, combining what made them great and adding to that. Overall it is the best film I've seen since Lord of the Rings and gets a well deserved 9/10"

","I saw Spider-Man before it was released, and I am only now writing a review of it, so I don't know what I can add that hasn't already been said, so I'll be brief. Tobey Maguire was the perfect choice for Spider-Man (duh), Kirsten Dunst is easily the best looking, and possibly the most talented (although Ms. Portman and Ms. Ricci may have something to say about that) actress under the age of 25 working now.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi has always been an underrated director (overshadowed by the likes of Tarantino), but he finally gets a big hit to put him more into the public spotlight. I noticed some similarities between ""Spider-Man"" and Raimi's other ""superhero"" film, ""Darkman"". While ""Darkman"" at times looks like it was directed by a mental patient (which is an oh-so-good thing), ""Spider-Man"" has a more honed look, although it is clearly a Raimi film (most notably in the climactic fight between Spidey and the Green Goblin).<br/><br/>J.K. Simmons steals every scene that he is in as the newspaper editor, and if he is not in the sequel it's a bigger loss to the cast than anyone but Maguire and Dunst. Randy Savage is laugh out loud funny as wrestling champion Bonesaw McGraw, as well as a quote machine (""I got you for threeeeeeeee minutes!!!""). There are just so many wonderful elements to this film, both large and small, that I don't know what to talk about here (and I know I will be kicking myself in 5 minutes for leaving something out of my review). So, fantastic movie, see it if you haven't yet for some reason, and see it again if you've only seen it once, 9 out of 10."

","Spider-Man is most certainly one of the best, if not the best comic book adaptaion of this century, had it been made five years earlier it would have most likely starred Leonardo DiCaprio and would have been directed by James Cameron. No disrespect to Cameron but thank god for Sam Rami and Tobey Maguire, their contributions must have made the great Stan Lee a very happy man. The acting was superb, one of Maguire's best performances and I thought that the balance between action and romance was just right.

While Peter Parker seemed to look about the same age, Dunst's character seemed to age about 20 years in the course of the movie.  I understand that the plot covered a certain amount of time, but I didn't think it was that much.<br/><br/>

","I saw this flick the opening weekend, and was simply amazed. Not only because the theaters were packed, but because of how real the movie seemed. Now of course no one can have powers like Peter Parker, but everything he and MJ go through feels real. The movie itself was excellent and I'm glad that Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and director Sam Raimi are returning for a second film. The only thing that bothered me, as well as a lot of my friends is that Peter doesn't make his webbing, like in the comic and cartoons. Also if I loved someone like MJ like he loves her I wouldn't pass up the chance, I do understand however his reasons. William Defoe was perfect as Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin. I'm also grateful that Sam Raimi left the WTC buildings in the movie, because that would only tell the people responsible that we were mortally wounded in that tragedy.

","No question about it Spider-Man is a very entertaining film. Credit must go to the casting of Tobey Maguire in the title role rather than a more established house hold name, who frankly wouldn't have been as good. There are unfortunately a few problems with the film which could so easily have been altered to make the film more enjoyable. Firstly, the Goblins voice was a joke, some of his sentences were reminiscent of the power rangers which isn't a very good thing. Also although this film has received much more acclaim that any of the Batman series, the similarities between the two are there for all to see. The musical score and title sequence particularly felt similar to Batman Forever. The love element was probably slightly over played as well, I'm certainly not averse to there being a romantical interest but does it really need to underpin the whole story; I'm not so sure. (Although without this, there would be no Kirsten Dunst and thats bad because she's beautiful).<br/><br/>The city swinging scenes and the fight scenes were the best and this made the film overall entertaining."

Fanboys might quibble about<br/><br/>the organic webbing, or the fact that it was Gwen Stacy, not Mary Jane, who was around during the original Green Goblin storyline.  Toby Maguire was a bit stiff at times, and I just can't buy into Kristen Dunst as Mary Jane.  I really think they need another actress with more enthusiasm and light in her eyes.  Aunt May<br/><br/>was on spot, and Willem Dafoe handled his role as Osborn/Goblin quite well. <br/><br/>The special effects were seamless, and I just loved the way the webbing looked!

","SPOILER Even though the visual effects are spectacular and the movie itself is quite entertaining when i left the cinema i felt that it could have been much better just changing a few details. First of all, I don´t understand why the director changed esential parts from the original story. I think it is unfear to change such important moment in spiderman life like the beginning of his special power. It is also untrue that the spider´s web is another natural gift. People should know that Peter Parker was not a stupid at all and that he was able to invent this speciall web. Probably the Director thaught that this way the movie was going to be much ""fun"". It was also unnecesary to make mentions to the actuality (E.g. Julia Roberts). They are only effect was to take you out from spiderman´s fantastic world. I would like to mention the Green Goblin carachter. I think that Dafoe ´s own face would have been much better than the unexpresive mask they ´ve used in the film. Finally i will refer to the end of the movie. I have just can´t understand how the created such a stupid death for the Green Goblin. This confirms that the fact that you have wasted so much money doesn´t mean that your film is going to be creative."

","It's with a mixed feeling of different expectations I sit down in the cinema to watch SPIDER-MAN. I had a hope to see a Great Superheroflick, in the same class as Tim Burton's masterpiece BATMAN (1989). Then I had this more realistic spidersense telling me that ""you know, this'll probably be a lot of fun, but really nothing else"". Well, my sense was more right than my hopes, but ""a lot of fun"" is kind of an understatement; It's REALLY a lot of fun watching SPIDER-MAN.<br/><br/>First off, there is two things that made me want to see this film;<br/><br/>1. As a kid Spidey was my idol, and Marvel my heaven. This resulted in me knowing state-of-the-art-geek-stuff for the rest of my life. Therefore when time came for ""Spidey the movie"", my ancient knowledge sparked to life, at least for a while, and for just a couple of hours I was all back to my 11-year-old-mania.<br/><br/>2. My favorite director, Sam Raimi isn't, but I have faith in the man and I trust him to make a fun flick. As a horrorfan his THE EVIL DEAD (1982) remains more or less as a gift. His directing is wild and crazy, unstoppable but therefore also guaranteed to float out of the frames. But I heard Raimi would be a bit more down-to-earth, in SPIDER-MAN. Well that sounded good.<br/><br/>Indeed, Raimi doesn't get all that carried away, even though the movie ooze from his fun directing manners. If you've seen DARKMAN (1990) or ARMY OF DARKNESS (1993) you'll see that SPIDER-MAN has the same crazed tempo. Of course BRUCE CAMPBELL does a semi-cameo, Raimi holds up his traditions. Yeah, about the actors, SPIDER-MAN's lineup gives us three stars in the leading roles, Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe and Kirsten Dunst. They are no real favs of mine, but it's a good combination: all three of them are just about as OK actors. Dafoe did his thing, Dunst was cute (as always), I think Maguire stood out making Peter Parker a truly sympathetic character. Of course, to make an a-lot-of-fun-actionadventure these days requires some heavy artilleries from the digital front. True, the digital effects are slick and perfect for the entertainment-meter. When Spidey swings around Manhattan, I can't do nothing else but kick off my shoes (I literary did this) and lean back and just enjoy the ride. 'Cause that is what you gotta do in a movie like this. Forget that it contains two love-declarations, one from Maguire and one from Dunst, that are absolutely ridiculous (and that the dialogues overall are no hotshots). Then you'll have a lot of fun. My rating is 7/10, a bit of a challanger to BATMAN RETURNS (1992) and proving that BATMAN (1989) still is the best.<br/><br/>Buy the way. There is a Spider-Man 2 and 3 coming up. Good idea. This movie was very true to the comicbook it was based on, but Spidey lacked his unresistable wits and some of the stuff that are basic to the Spidey-reader are not yet shown off in the movie. Hopefully we'll see more of this in the sequels. Even though I wonder... Sam Neill as DocOc? Bring in Eddie Brock!"

","I have to say, I came out after seeing this movie and thinking 'wow'. Its not often that I come out for a movie and think that it was definitely worth seeing but this one was because it managed to capture a comic book character that would have been hard to display on the screen.<br/><br/>But to just see him swinging through the city, the special effects managing to capture his agile nature is breath taking. But the story is surprisingly well done managing the portraying the characters to a depth that is unusual for such a movie. At the end, you will have really managed to get a good understanding of Peter Parker, Mary Jane and even the Green Goblin. This first movie has at its core a romance and while I was dismayed at the amount of romantic scenes during the movie, I realised how important they were at the end for introducing the character of Spiderman.<br/><br/>The Green Goblin is a superb adversory for Spiderman but I wish there were more actions scenes if anything else although the ones that were displayed were unbelievable visually. But in maintaining a balance between action scenes, character depth and overall movie length, I am happy with what they chose. I am betting that the sequel will be more action packed now that the important character integration is done.<br/><br/>I previously enjoyed X-Men but I think it pales in comparison to Spiderman which displays great skill in making you believe the fantasy story and how it could fit into a world like ours. I just can't believe I will have to wait for the sequel, argh!<br/><br/>P.S I had always liked Spiderman but after watching this movie and seeing him in full splendor on the silver screen, I am now a *fan* and watching Superman/Batman/X-Men never did that for me.

Some of the costumes looked as if they came right out of a Power Rangers episode. Some animations of Spiderman looked extremely fake and computer generated. The last few minutes (I don't mean the scene on the cemetery but the last fight) were a bit boring, and in the second half of the movie it somehow lost its humor.<br/><br/>Again this sounds as if this would be just a mediocre movie, but it isn't.

And when you watch the ""famous"" kissing scene you only think of the water that allegedly drips into his nose. And now to the bad: The film is very slow-moving and even boring at times. The dialogues are tremendously bad - as if they'd been taken from the comic without any change. The acting is not bad, but with such dialogues even a good actor looks stupid. And I bet like many other Europeans we're getting a bit fed up with all those expressions of American patriotism and those pathetic ""big"" heroes that Americans seem to love so much.

","Although only nominally based on it's original source material (Manuel Puig's 'Kiss of the Spider Woman') this new film has much to commend it. Dealing with the often harrowing and sadly all too common story of human-arachnid transformation Tobey MacGuire plays Peter Parker, the High School nerd who is transformed into a superhero with spider-like abilities (eating flies, laying eggs etc.) after an everyday visit to a science lab goes awry - with hilarious consequences! <br/><br/>The film is generally very entertaining and has a fine cast. MacGuire gives easily his best performance since his Grange Hill days. Equally Kirsten Dunst (Bring it Up, Get it Off) gives a performance comparable to her memorable debut in Tim Rice's 'Interview With A Virgin' even if her character does seem a bit stupid not to connect Spiderman with Parker's new found arachnid acrobatics performed at High School. Willem Dafoe is similarly strong as the Green Goblin despite becoming sadly typecast. His character - a billionaire tycoon tormented by a malevolent Hyde-like alternate persona is practically a straight reprisal of the Vietnam vet 'Sgt. Elias' and 'Jesus' characters he played in Platoon and Monty Python's Last Temptation of Christ respectively. Overall though, certainly the best film I've yet to see this year so far.<br/><br/>If you like this film I'd also recommend Jeff Goldblum in David Cronenberg's Cold War classic 'The Fly Who Came In From the Cold' (1988)."

","I enjoyed this film a lot because it hearkens back to the fundamental differences between heroes and villains-their morality.  The Green Goblin and Spiderman are very different in this film.  The Green Goblin is a very thoughtless, callous murderer while Spiderman could not be more sincere and considerate.  Neither character is drawn in varying shades of grey.  They are black and white, night and day, yin and yang.  So when they battle, one feels compelled to root for the good guy as the bad guy has no redeeming qualities.  I think the credit for this should go to the writers and director Sam Raimi who allow the difference in morality to usher the story towards its inevitable showdown between good and evil.  Willem Dafoe steals the show here, but once again, Tobey Maguire successfully conveys anger at the evil in the world, his desire to impress Mary Jane Watson (Kirstin Dunst), and his excitement at having such amazing powers.  One feels that the only thing keeping this film from being an old Spiderman comic strip are the ""Bam Pow Slam"" captions."

","When I first heard that a Spiderman movie was being made I knew I had to see it. Of course I heard that it was being made when I was in high school and that was 11 years ago. All I have to say is that it was worth the wait! From the opening credits to the final scene (poor Mary-Jane) I was enthraled with all of the characters. Initially, I wasn't sure about Tobey Maguire but after seeing him chasing the bus, being tripped in the aisle and generally teased he was the perfect choice. His transition from the geek to the strongman is evident enough to notice but slow and subtle enough to believe that it's gradual. There's so much that can be said about this movie but I think it speaks for itself. Volumes in fact. I haven't been to a movie that I wanted to buy even before I walked out of the theatre in a long time but this one is mine for sure when it comes out. If you haven't seen it, go, now, waste no more time. It's definately a movie that should be seen in the theatre at least once if not twice or three or ten or twenty times. All this from a lousy Spiderbite!"

","Well, what to say? I admit, I did not know what to expect from this movie, I was just interested in whether all that hype was justified. It definitely wasn´t. The ""spidrous"" part of the story is really thin, the movie only has some depth in the development of the love story between Peter and MJ. The special effects are far from being a new landmark. When Spiderman travels the streets like Tarzan, I cannot help being reminded of some Play Station (TM) animations. Willem Dafoe must have been offered an awful lot of money as a compensation for being pushed into such a lousy script. But what is most appalling is an almost complete lack of humor. Good fantasy action movies (not e.g. ""First Blood"", which is to be taken serious) should contain a fair amount of humor. The audience ought to realize that the movie doesn´t take itself too serious. I clearly miss this aspect.<br/><br/>A well defined target group for Spiderman are 6- to 10-year old boys, who watch it, talk about it on schoolyard the next day, and then forget about it, as there should be a fresh Disney animation at their theatre."

"sa013","Null","0","0","23 June 2002"," Watch it just for J. Jonah Jameson!
","I am constantly waiting for someone to screw up a 'comic-book into film' movie but Spider-man isn't that film.  By all accounts, Spider-man carries on this recent trend without cheapening the story.<br/><br/>Like most of the recent comic-come-movie efforts the director has obviously heavily resisted the urge to go O.T.T., with the effect of making the film slightly reek of restraint.  Spider-man isn't as good as X-Men.  There are two possible reasons for this.  The first would be that there was greater wealth of characters in X-Men.  Spider-man is basically Peter Parker/Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) versus Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin (Willem Defoe).  Most of the other characters are pretty forgettable, with the notable exception of J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson.  In contrast, X-Men had all the old comic-book favourites: Wolverine, Cyclops, Magneto, Storm, Sabretooth and Professor X.<br/><br/>The second possibility might be the quality of the actors (warning! Prepare for patriotic British rant!).  X-Men has the superior quality of that great British acting knight, Sir Ian McKellen (Magneto), and the classically trained Shakespearian officer of the Order of the British Empire, Mr. Patrick Stewart (Xavier), the talented Mr. Ray Park (Toad) and the lovely Miss Anna Pacquin (Rogue).  There was also our Australian cousin, Mr. Jackman (Wolverine) and the beautiful Halle Berry (Storm). <br/><br/>
Spider-man had very little big-name talent (none of them British, I hasten to add).  Pretty much anyone could have been Spider-man but Tobey Maguire was perfect as Peter Parker and Kirsten Dunst was an excellent up-and-coming choice for Spiderman's love-interest, Mary Jane Watson.  J.K. Simmons, the actor who played Parker's curmudgeonly editor-employer, J. Jonah Jameson, was simply brilliant, hilarious!  Now, Mr. Willem Defoe... he is not an actor for whom I have ever had any particular affection and this opinion was cemented by his performance in the villain in Speed 2: Cruise Control (a truly awful film!).  However, Defoe performs quite adequately as the desperate entrepreneur, Norman Osborn, who, through an excellently done sequence of schizophrenic split-personality sequences, eventually becomes Spiderman's antithesis, The Green Goblin.  Having seen Spider-man, I cannot imagine anyone else playing the role of the Goblin, due to Defoe's uniquely structured face, although the inanimate mask he wears is annoying at first because the gaping jaws of the Goblin never move, even when he's in full flow, and later it's annoying because, thanks to close-ups, you can see Defoe's mouth talking through the blackout of the mouth.<br/><br/>In terms of villains Defoe's Goblin is certainly no match for Sir Ian's Magneto.  A friend of mine suggested that Jack Nicholson would have been better but I would maintain that Nicholson will always be The Joker!  Defoe performed adequately considering the mighty foot-steps he's following (I certainly wouldn't want to be up against Nicholson or McKellen if talent was being measured).<br/><br/>In conclusion, the storyline is good and not too unbelieveable, although it seemed somewhat unambitious given the media hype.  The much raved about special effects were good for the most part but for some lousy editing when Maguire gets replaced by a CGI Spiderman climbing up a wall.  I can't help thinking that the camera being turned on it's side to film Adam West's Batman walking ""up"" a wall looked more real.  Some have criticised the director's attempt to inject humour into the story but I found most of the jokes quite funny (i.e., Spiderman's early career as an amateur wrestler). However, the script let's them down and I expected better banter between Spiderman and the Goblin (more of the kind of great one-liners we got from Magneto and Joker).  There was also the increasingly obligatory product-placement (kudos to Carlsberg) but I have forgiven them because they put Kirsten Dunst in a wet T-shirt!<br/><br/>To be perfectly honest, it's worth seeing just for that and also the few scenes with Simmons (Jameson) in.  It's good fun to watch and most of the criticisms (in Britain anyway) that it's too violent are akin to the criticisms that Harry Potter promotes the occult!  Thank God comic-book films aren't going down the same ruinous road as the computer-game films (i.e., Lara Croft, Street Fighter, Mortal Combat, etc.), except for some idiot giving the Batman films to Joel Schumacher!  However, remaining cynical, I await Ben Affleck as the DareDevil and the Incredible Hulk films with great interest.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

"chrisbrown6453","8","0","0","20 June 2002"," Sam Raimi pulled it off folks.
","The Spider-Man movie is one of those unique comic book adaptations that fulfill all of the fans expectations and will undoubtedly please just about everyone who sees it. After seeing what Raimi did with Marvel Comics wall-crawling superhero, I doubt that even James Cameron himself could have done better.<br/><br/>Benefiting from four decades worth of comic book stories that have been told, Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp know what works and what doesn't when crafting the cinematic version of Spider-Man's origin. Indeed, it's a testament to the filmmakers' faith and love for the source material that so much of the movie's character arcs and plot points are borrowed directly from the comic books. If you're a fan of Spidey you'll be able to pick up on the many recognizable situations sprinkled throughout the movie. If not, don't worry. It won't affect your enjoyment one bit.<br/><br/>Placed front-and-center in the hero's role, Tobey Maguire does a great job of giving a face to teenage science geek Peter Parker, as well as the wiseass mannerism of Spider-Man. Maguire may not have been the most likely actor to leap into my mind when I thought about who should put on the blue and red spandex costume, but damn it if the kid doesn't play the perfect Peter...and any comic fan worth his weight will tell you that's way more important to nail than filling out the Spider suit (evident in the Batman series.)<br/><br/>The same holds true for Willem Dafoe who nails the unenviable task of playing Norman Osborne and his maniacal alter ego The Green Goblin. In lesser hands the Goblin could have easily been a watered down version of Jack Nicholson's Joker from Batman. Instead, Dafoe gives a crackling vibrant energy in his scenes as Spidey's nemesis, and any reservations I had about the Guyver-like Goblin costume were dispelled once Dafoe's Goblin hit his stride and started cackling his torments to his victims.<br/><br/>While no one will ever argue that Kristen Dunst isn't lovely to look at as Mary Jane, Peter/Spider-Man's love interest, really there's not much to her part. If there's a weakness the movie version of Spider-Man has it comes from her acting, and her character not serving much of a purpose except to serve as Peter's unrequited love and float from boyfriend to boyfriend. I'm hoping that MJ will have more to do in the sequel, and perhaps some much needed acting lessons. Maybe a little romantic tension from a secondary love interest for Peter, like comic book hotties Gwen Stacy or Betty Brant, or maybe even someone pining for Spidey, such as Felicia Hardy/Black Cat, would definitely stir the pot. Incidentally, I read somewhere that the decision to shorten Mary Jane's name to MJ for this movie was based on the fact that Mary Jane is universally recognized as another name for marijuana, and we can't be having that in a kids movie now can we.<br/><br/>The remainder of the cast shines in their supporting roles. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson play a perfect Aunt May and Uncle Ben while J.K. Simmons manages to steal every scene he's in as Peter's Daily Bugle boss J. Jonah Jameson. As Harry Osborne, James Franco does a great job, an awesome job, of playing a best friend and a tormented son. After watching his final scene in this film, I'd like to change my vote from seeing villains like The Lizard or Doctor Octopus in the sequel to instead bringing Franco back and give him the spotlight as the next big bad guy Spider-Man faces.  He does, after all, turn into the Hob Goblin.<br/><br/>The special effects do an outstanding job of showing us the concrete canyons Spider-Man swings through. Moments such as the first time Peter experiments with swinging left to right down a city street, or when he crawls up a wall for the first time, or the webbing he leaves behind are all executed brilliantly. This is the stuff all the fans have been dreaming about seeing. If you were worried the CGI would look CGI-ish, it does. But don't worry, you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Other than Dunst's bad acting, the only part that disappointed me about this much anticipated film was the fact that it was decided to keep Spiderman's original red and blue suit.  Ugh.  Look what Tim Burton did to Batman, and how it helped, if not completely change, the idea of a comic book hero being real.  It was hard to watch this `hero' run around in his pajamas, and believe me; I had pajamas EXACTLY like those.  Should have gave him a black outfit, or at least a redesigned one.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is a wonderful delight, the first real blockbuster of this summer. Sam Raimi remained absolutely true to the spirit of the character but was smart enough to know what aspects needed to be re-forged into the film's story."

","Contains spoilers<br/><br/>Having waited what seems an eternity for Spider-Man to reach the big screen, Sam Raimi's adaptation of the Marvel comic book hero is a lot of fun.  It also looks good, has an interesting cast, follows Stan Lee's original story with admirable faithfulness and has the obligatory summer blockbuster bells and whistles.  So why have I left the cinema both the times I have seen it with a slight sense of anti-climax?  Don't get me wrong, I liked the film but it failed to meet my sky-high expectations.<br/><br/>Raimi's Spider-Man is more like Richard Donner's Superman than Tim Burton's Batman, in its bright and breezy approach.  However, the dilemmas of Peter Parker, played to a tee by Tobey Maguire, are captured well by Raimi.  It takes the death of his uncle to realise that he can do more than make money out of his alter ego and the viewer sympathises with Parker's plight. Although `with great power comes great responsibility', he laments that the choices he makes always seem to hurt those he holds dearest.  His ultimate duty to the spider inside means that he has to push away the girl he has always loved, Mary Jane Watson (ably carried off by Kirstin Dunst).  In this sense Raimi successfully makes the viewer understand all aspects of being a superhero.<br/><br/>Although the story of Parker's ephiphany is told with care by Raimi, an avowed fan of the comics, the plot is traditional comic book adaptation fare: oddball loner discovers superpowers, suffers personal injustice, decides to fight crime, encounters maniacal bad guy, wins the day in grand finale.  Perhaps I was expecting too much of Raimi's film - it is after all only based on a comic book.  But I wanted a little more than I got. Nevertheless, the special effects are very good, in spite of my worst fears. I had been expecting dodgy, cartoonish CGI but, for the most part, Spider-Man convincingly spins his way through a pre-11 September Manhattan. The film's delayed production has meant that advances in digital technology have given the 'Human Spider' a fluency of movement that was impossible to pull off only 5 years ago.  His web slinging and wall crawling are spot on throughout, with some excellent swooping camera work giving the impression of being right there with him.  The overhead scenes where Parker is leaping from rooftop to rooftop are the only ones where the special effects look amateurish.<br/><br/>J.K Simmons steals the show in his brief role as the hilariously irascible Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson.  Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris push the necessary buttons as Ben and May.  Willem Dafoe as 'da foe' (boom boom) is larger than life for the film's duration.  He is a well cast Norman Osborn/Green Goblin and is a worthy, menacing adversary for Spider-Man's first outing.  And, with an ending that screams `sequel', you can be sure that the web-head will be back.  It remains to be seen whether Spider-Man falls into the trap of other comic book franchises, such as Batman, which quickly headed south in terms of quality as the sequels racked up.<br/><br/>

And I was stunned.<br/><br/>This movie illustrates how a superhero film can be made without bogging itself down in special effects and action sequences. It gives us characters we can relate to, even the (I'll admit, not the best written) Green Goblin has a human side of him. Unlike X-Men which felt more like an introduction, Spiderman stands as a story in itself. There is more to come, yes. But we now have a strong handle on Spiderman's universe.<br/><br/>there are some minor flaws though. the Americanisms were annoying but sparse, so I can't really complain. The Green Goblins suit still seems out of place to me, but it doesn't destory the film. Mary Jane's character seemed somewhat underdeveloped compared to the comic, but it was still wonderfully played out by Kirsten Dunst. And the Green Goblin's death- disapointing, but then again I know his career from the comics.<br/><br/>
Sam Raimi has done a great job of reflecting what Spiderman is truly about. Even the comics have wandered off the point sometimes. Spiderman is a hero who does not have the best of lives, but he works at it.

","In the end, it's just another superhero versus supervillan movie. Yes, the angst of Peter Parker is an interesting addition - both in the original comic strips and in the movie, but the second half of the film is so formulaic that this overpowers the better points. Having said that, unlike other reviewers, I thought the effects were very good and at a large screen cinema, Spiderman swinging through New York streets nearly gave me vertigo, they were so good. The Green Goblin character was pretty banal and the amorous scenes between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson were some of the hammiest I've seen. The music accompanying these scenes was also 'so predictable'.<br/><br/>Casting on the whole was good with Tobey Maguire quite perfect in his role as Spiderman/Peter Parker. It is such a shame that a potentially good film was let down by such a weak script and - towards the end - such unoriginal treatment during which the characters become more and more cartoon-like.<br/><br/>Sadly, as I write this I see that Spiderman is already in the top 250 films around the 120 mark - a reflection that even IMDB's excellent chart is open to the most recent and over-hyped films achieving far higher positions than they truly deserve. Had Spiderman been released ten years ago I am sure far fewer people would have voted for it and would give it far lower ratings. It is sad that these inclinations cannot be compensated for, even with IMDB's vote weighting. Director Sam Raimi made a 10/10 movie a few years back, 'A Simple Plan', based on an excellent novel, it doesn't figure on the charts as it was an undersold, under hyped movie, yet here is Sam storming up the charts with a film based on a shoddy script that in my opinion rates 4/10.<br/><br/>One final point, I watch my favourite movies (some highly rated in the IMDB charts - such as 'The Usual Suspects', 'Godfather' & 'Shawshank Redemption' - to quote a few) many times over, and I certainly would not consider watching Spiderman again, though I'm perfectly happy to have seen it the once."

It looked like a power ranger. I think more imagination could have gone into that. besides that this movie lived up to the hype and i went away from it realizing why it made so much money. Few films fail to accomplish this. I would recomend this film to anyone.   10/10stars"

","While the film does have a lot of good aspects (Sam Raimi's direction, the casting especially with Tobey Maguire and Willem DaFoe), there are four main gripes with this film that always impinge my enjoyment of it.<br/><br/>Plot holes. The wrestling promoter would know Spiderman's identity (after seeing him pulling off his stunts in the ring), and also has an axe to grind with him - after he did nothing to prevent the robber from taking the money. For some reason however he doesn't bother to go to anyone about it when he could charge a lot of money to reveal Spiderman's alter ego.<br/><br/>His origin. This may seem like a geeky fanboy quip, but I thought that the events leading up to the murder of Ben Parker and the creation of the crime-fighting Spider-man made Peter appear particularly inhuman and bitter. The scenes also lacked the emotional force of the comic, or even the 90s animated series.<br/><br/>Badguy deaths. I could accept that the thief who murdered Ben might have had an accident where Spiderman would be on a thin line of did he/ didn't he kill him, but when the same fate befell the Green Goblin, it stank of a cop-out by the makers.<br/><br/>Yankee heroics. As a non-American filmgoer, I find it disgusting that we must once again have American culture (or the movie version of American culture) rubbed in our faces. The scene on the bridge was bad enough (""You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us"" or something similar had most of the people in the cinema rolling their eyes and groaning - why didn't the Goblin just pumpkin bomb them anyway?) but to end the film with Spiderman on a pole with a huge waving USA flag just made it worse. In a film such as Superman, the character's Americanism can be tolerated as he is known for being an American hero, but Spiderman is supposed to be a world hero - someone everyone can look up to, as even Raimi said.<br/><br/>There is also the topic of incidental music and theme, or lack thereof, but I don't think that any major gripes can be drawn over miniscule details such as that. The (mostly poor)CGI and reappearing boom mic also distracted. Also, was it necessary for Kirsten Dunst to get her shirt wet? I'm not complaining, but gratuitous sexual images both p*** me off and turn me on at the same time. Must be the hormones.<br/><br/>5/10"

","Having waited for well over a year for the release of this film I had a terrible fear that it wouldn't live up to my expectations. I was wrong to be concerned. This film lived up to all of my expectations - and then some! I am usually sceptical when it comes to comic book adaptations, mainly because many of them have a tendency to play things more for laughs, believing somehow that the movie going public won't accept the possibility of a ""real-life"" superhero. This may be true but everyone would like to believe such realities are somehow a possibility.<br/><br/>The actors performances were very impressive. Toby Maguire put in a trademark astounding performance. But the real star of this film was William Dafoe. Despite some occasionally ropy dialogue Dafoe was breath-takingly good as The Green Goblin.<br/><br/>Perhaps the only real problem that I had with the film was the Green Goblin's costume. I'm not entirely sure whether it was too 'cartoony' or it just transferred to CGI badly but something seemed wrong with it. It didn't always fit in with the rest of the scene perhaps as well as it could have. But this is a minor issue and in no way taints the overall feeling of the film.<br/><br/>Finally, kudos to Raimi for adding the original Spider-man theme at the end of the credits - a huge cheer went up in the cinema!"

","I must admit right off, I was incredibly biased in favor of Spider-Man before I saw it.  I was a huge fan of the comic and an even bigger fan of director Sam Raimi.  Heck, I even have the posters for the Evil Dead series on my living room wall.  My sister has my favorite childhood chair, which was covered in Spider-Man wallpaper.  If this gives you some kind of idea where I'm coming from, and you're looking for an objective review of this movie, you might want to go elsewhere.  But if you're a fan of either the comic or Sam Raimi, you'll know where I'm coming from.<br/><br/>The reason I say this is the most faithful comic to film adaptation ever is the tone of the movie, not the strict following of the traditional Spider-Man story.  The way Peter Parker and Mary Jane meet is different, but their relationship is still remarkably faithful (there's that word again) to the comic, and other things have changed, as well.  But in the end, the soul of Spider-Man has been kept intact.  And that's no small feat in current Hollywood productions.<br/><br/>The humor is still there (""Your friendly neighborhood Spiderman"").  The teen angst, and moral questions still abound.  My hat's off to Raimi for so successfully distilling the essence of Spiderman, the comic.  I look forward to the second one (and possibly Evil Dead 4?) soon from this gifted director who is finally being given his due."

The story is very simple and straightforward, the characters are interesting and there is lots of action. I give Raimi credit for not trying to do too much, something that has hurt other comic book movies (like X-Men).

And considering it was coming from teh view of Sam Raimi (director of the previously banned Evil Dead, Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn), I expected so much more. The writers didn't seem to get it, that theres as much adults who liek Spiderman as there is kids. Not forgetting that it's based on a 35 year old + superhero.<br/><br/>The action sequences score high, and I liked the way they adapted the Green Goblin's form into that of an electronic flight-suit instead of Green Rubber spandex, but there's too much of a love interest, and the story is written accordingly to the origional Green Goblin story, which is a spoiler for the sort of people who live and breave these comics die-hard. The whole story is just 99% predicatble. Who hasn't seen an American superhero movie that they had sussed from the opening. It's an honest to God disapointment, and a real pitty, because a title like Spiderman had the pottential to go as far as Batman did in 1989, had the script been giving good looking at.

","Spiderman has all the ingredients of the best comic-book superhero movies: a likeable leading man, a beautiful love interest, strong sexual tension, a villain played by a top-notch actor, cool special effects. What lets it down is an odd thing for such a big-budget movie: a silly costume.<br/><br/> The movie is strongest in its opening half, when the characters are being introduced and Peter is learning his new powers. One of the best scenes in the movies is when Peter stares in delight at the new muscles he's grown overnight and flexes them in the mirror. Every skinny man's dream. Tobey Maguire is an excellent Spiderman: he has a wide-eyed sense of wonder and innocence about him that helps us feel both his pleasures and pains. There is also genuine chemistry between him and Kirstin Dunst, something which feels all the more real after the horrible attempt at romance in 'Attack of the Clones'. There are some corny lines and sometimes when Spiderman is web-slinging his way across New York it does feel like you're watching someone else playing Playstation, but overall director Sam Raimi has done a fine job.<br/><br/> But back to that costume. It's not Spiderman's that is the problem, indeed reliable sources tell me that Maguire looks quite sexy in his skin-tight suit.Rather it is the Green Goblin, who looks like a cross between a carnival clown and a cheesy, plastic-armoured 'Star Trek' extra. Willem Dafoe is convincing as both loving father and vicious killer, but as soon as he puts on his mask he becomes just another raving maniac in a ridiculous outfit. Because of this it is hard to get involved in the fights between the hero and the villain, the centrepiece of any superhero movie, which is why I would rank this below such films as 'X-Men', 'Superman' and Tim Burton's brilliant 'Batman' movies.<br/><br/> That aside, Spiderman is a good film, and its huge success in the States will produce several sequels. I look forward to seeing Maguire and Dunst in them.<br/><br/> 6 1/2 / 10"

","Whilst I enjoyed Spider-Man, I, like some other reviewers, was a bit disappointed, and I don't think it's as good as some are giving credit for. For instance, I thought the Star Wars movie was much better, in spite of atrocious dialogue. I had heard that there was a good story but there wasn't. It needed more plot and I fear that the follow-ups could be flops if the storylines aren't improved. I have no qualms about the cast, because they were all perfect, especially Tobey Maguire in the title role, but then I knew he was a star in the wings beforehand. Dafoe was actually more recognisable as the Green Goblin than he was in 'Shadow of the Vampire'if indeed it were he behind that ridiculous metal mask. In my view, the gorgeous Kirsten Dunst was totally wasted in this part. Just when I thought she was shedding the teen image behind her, along comes this character she was playing four years ago. She did an adequate job, but this role is just going to chain her as an evergreen teen, which would be a pity. My real gripe is that red hair. Now, listen here, Kirsten, you are one of the most fabulous blondes on the planet, and I don't like you with red hair! Can MJ take a leaf out of Reese Witherspoon's book, and 'go blonde' for the sequel? (Sorry, Reese, I know you are a real blonde.) This is the best comic book film I've seen for ages but it's nowhere near up to the first 2 Superman movies, which had those 'moments' to treasure. There are some good moments, but overall, the movie is not memorable."

","Well, Spidey has been a favorite of mine since before I can remember and I was a bit scared when I heard they were doing a film, only because of the seemingly perpetual flops of comic book adaptations (Xmen, the Batman sequels, the Punisher, etc.)<br/><br/>This movie however, for the most part, does Spidey great justice.  The way the film is shot and paced, it's very comic book-like, which is great.  The action and effects are excellent and the human element between not only Peter Parker and Mary Jane, but between Parker and Harry Osborne, Harry and Norman Osborne, Peter and Aunt May, etc is also very well portrayed.<br/><br/>I had only two complaints about the film (POSSIBLE SPOILERS); the first is the lack of wisecracks from Spidey, who has always been notorious for making jokes in the heat of battle against the likes of Goblin, Venom, Sandman, Doc Ock, etc.  Though McGuire gets in a few good one liners (usually as Parker), I wish they had included more from Spidey in mid-battle.  It sounds like a tacky request, but that's what made Spider-Man so great, his humor.<br/><br/>The second complaint is the Green Goblin, a most pathetic villain at best. Willem Dafoe, who I'm sure plays the part as good as he could with the given script, is just a one dimensional foe, mindlessly bombing and gunning down pedestrians.  I never found myself hating him or even really caring if he succeeded in his `mad' plans for.whatever he wanted.  He was simply a formality of the film, a big bad guy for Spidey to beat.  Beyond his lack of purpose, I was deeply disappointed that they used the costume they did.  It was the only injustice the film does to the original comic (thank goodness they left Spidey's costume alone!)  I was much more inclined to comic artist Alex Ross' design . The GG outfit they used was far too futuristic and plastic looking.<br/><br/>Lastly, I truly appreciated the ending (HUGE SPOILERS!); the swelling hatred from Harry towards Spiderman and the broken heart of Mary Jane.  Classic sequel setup and very comic-like, leaving us all waiting with anticipation for the next `issue'.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10"

Comparatively speaking, it wasn't as good as X-Men.<br/><br/>The acting was stiff and uncomfortable, and the storyline was a little bland.  The story behind Spiderman's origin was suppose to be dark and foreboding, but that's no reason to keep it emotionless.  Where's the sorrow and regret?  Where's the yearning for the love he cannot get?  Yes the producers did TRY to show the strings of his heart being pulled every which way, but they weren't able to accomplish this all that well.<br/><br/>Spiderman's computer generated scenes were a little over the top, as was his costume.  While the prop and special effects people spent so much time on Spiderman's costume, they seemed to put much less effort into the Goblin's.

So I needed no encouragement to see another fantasy super-hero brought to the big screen and the record-breaking $114M opening weekend in the States just whetted my appetite. The film does not disappoint, providing fun and flying in good measure with some superb computer animation - but it's hard to see just how it took so much money so fast. For me, the first two ""Superman"" films still take some beating. <br/><br/>Perhaps it's something to do with the post-September 11 need for protection and it was right - although cinematically a loss - to cut the original sequence involving New York's twin towers. Perhaps it's 'that kiss', unlikely and uncomfortable though such an inverted encounter would be. It must have something to do with Tobey Maguire who was so weird in ""The Ice Storm"", but brings a kind of nerdy charm to Peter Parker. It may well owe something to Willem Dafoe who looks bizarre even before he dons the Green Goblin mask and gives the most over the top performance of a super-villain since Jack Nicholson was the Joker (I'd love to have his flying device).<br/><br/>
Surely it wasn't Kirtsen Dunst as Mary Jane (MJ) - liked the cute dimples, but hated the red hair, and really she is a rather plain Jane. It certainly wasn't the puerile plot or the dire dialogue.

","Hottest movie of the year. Tobey Maguire shows us exactly why he is rated as the hottest young actor on the circuit.  This movie relies heavily on how subtle it can be delivered and in Maguire they have gotten one of the most subtle actors on the planet. Its one thing that he is great at and one thing that's often understated in moves laden with special effects.  He carries the weight of the performance with such ease and at times makes it look like he is not even trying. After all he is playing to the most hypocritical and hard to please audience out there...  The comic book guys. While the film doesn't port everything over from the comic the changes are acceptable and minimal.  Webs coming from glands in the wrist and being bitten by a genetically modified spider rather than a radio active one. The latter doesn't make any difference as genetic modification was unknown when the concept of spider-man was being penned all those years ago and to be fair had it been known, he probably would have gone with the genetics anyway!!!  Dafoe gives us a performance somewhat restricting him and with this he delivers by his standards what can only be called an adequate performance.  The cameo of the day has got to go to J.K. Simmons who delivered a mast piece of a cameo in the shape of newspaper editor J J, Jameson.  Any fan of the comic will tell you that the part was carried out to perfection. To sum up the film was brilliant and should secure Maguire's future as a major box office draw.  He is great at subtlety, something that all the great actors have, Ed Harris, Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro etc... On a finishing note I thought it was brilliant and a little bit special that the original song be put in at the end of this film.

Jonah Jameson as he delivers the best performance of the movie. The first shots of Spider-Man swinging through New York seem promising even if the CGI is a little rough in comparison to Star Wars, and Spider-Man's first confrontation with a car-jacker is played out fairly well. In the second half of the movie however, things go from good to bad to awful. The CGI of the fight scenes is laughable, with the Green Goblin in particular looking like . Plot holes start springing up all over the place until they are impossible to ignore and begin to seriously detract from the experience. The worst is saved for last however as the film is saddled with the most pathetic final showdown I have seen in a movie for quite awhile, with zero suspense and barely any action. Not what you want from a super-hero movie. Finally, to add insult to injury, Sam Raimi sees fit to end the film with a romantic scene so bad that it makes Attack of the Clones' romance seem positively Shakespearean.

It worked very well.<br/><br/>Do I have any criticisms of the film...of course.  But, they are really quite minor.  Tobey Maguire tends to mumble.  Where did this fantastic Spider-Man costume come from...after Peter's pathetic attempt at costume making in the wrestling scenes, who made this amazing costume.  Why doesn't anyone from the wrestling match remember Spider-Man once he becomes a superhero.  Surely, the wrestling match organiser would remember (and he saw Peter's face - unmasked).<br/><br/>Even though the CGI was obvious on some scenes, it wasn't in the vast majority of the Spider-Man sequences.<br/><br/>The one thing I always like about the Spider-Man comics and cartoon, was Spider-Man's one-liners.  I'd heard that these would, for the most part, be absent from the film.  The film was so good that I didn't even notice.<br/><br/>All in all, this was an excellent film and the best I've seen in a very long time (streaks ahead of Star Wars II - George should take lessons from Sam).<br/><br/>I gave it a ten."

","Well, I liked this one, but not as much as some other flicks I've seen. First of all, the main character, Peter Parker, is very believable as a nerd that isn't very well accepted by his fellow students, but gains super powers that he has to learn to handle and to use responsibly, which is of course not an easy task. I liked the other figures, too. What I didn't like that much, though, are some scenes that seem to be endlessly slow, which won't fit into the whole concept as a fast paced movie, but that is, of course, highly subjective. I you haven't seen this one yet, I can recommend it to you."

","Perhaps it isn't all `Spider-Man's fault that it was released 24 years after the original `Superman' or 13 years after the original `Batman' movies.  But the fact is that those films beat this new film considerably to the punch, which probably explains why `Spider-Man,' for all its sophisticated special effects, feels decidedly Old Hat  especially compared to the infinitely more complex and sophisticated `X-Men' from a few years back, not to mention the brilliant `Darkman' from way back in 1990.  That last comparison is particularly apt since' Spider-Man's director, Sam Raimi, virtually cut his teeth on that film.  In `Darkman,' Raimi brought a seriousness of purpose and a uniqueness of vision to the project that helped to carry the comic book movie genre to new artistic heights.  `Spider-Man,' though inoffensive, seems bland and benign in comparison, calculated to reach the widest audience possible (which apparently it has succeeded in doing, a fact that says less about the quality of the movie, perhaps, than about the undemanding tastes of modern moviegoers).<br/><br/>`Spider-Man' seems so by-the-book in its narrative, tone and purpose that it never soars much above the ordinary and never carries the audience to the kind of exciting, visionary world one would expect from a film of this type. The movie is blessed in one all-important respect though: its inspired decision to cast Tobey Maguire in the lead role of Peter Parker, a mild mannered nerd who becomes a super hero after he's bitten by a genetically altered spider.  Maguire's winning and disarming performance is the film's one incontestable virtue.  All else seems problematic, beginning with the storyline, which plays virtually by rote.  One needn't list all the conventional elements, starting with the poor, picked-on geek who can't get the girl he loves to even acknowledge his existence, the loving, older guardians who support their boy in everything he does, the tortured super villain (in this case, the Green Goblin) who is both the hero's alter ego as well as his arch nemesis.  All this is, of course, par for the course, but I guess the thing I object to the most is that the tone is simply too innocuous and sunny.  The film can't generate any real suspense or excitement because the threats seem so halfhearted.  By the same token, the film doesn't have much of a playful spirit either.  The love scenes between Spider-Man and his truelove, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), work only because the actors themselves are so likable in the roles.  Otherwise, the romantic element is as underwhelming and clichéd as virtually every other feature of the film.  Probably the most unaccountable aspect of the plot is that, despite the fact that Spider-Man does only good for the citizens of Manhattan, we keep being told that the citizens are ambiguous in their attitudes towards him.  Yet, we are given no reason to credit this possibility for even a split second.  It is an arbitrary plot device thrown in to try and generate some desperately needed suspense in an admittedly pretty lackluster screenplay.<br/><br/>Which pretty much leaves us with the special effects.  Though adequate at times, many of the shots of Spider-Man swooping along the streets of New York City, his web suspended from the tops of skyscrapers, seem strangely unconvincing.  Perhaps since we feel no immediate involvement in the proceedings, the special effects sequences never manage to catch us up in the excitement of what they are showing us.   One keeps hoping and expecting to be carried away by the film, but it simply never happens.<br/><br/>`Spider-Man' simply does not rate the box office revenue it has earned."

"Brogan","10","0","0","14 June 2002"," Another Success for Marvel Comics!
","I've always enjoyed movies that are made based on comic books.  In fact one of my earliest movie going memories was watching the original 1978 SUPERMAN with Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman.  Then when BATMAN was released I then not only enjoyed movies more, but also comic books.  Then Hollywood decided to ""cash in"" on the success of BATMAN, and release more films based on comic books (PUNISHER, CAPTIAN AMERICA, SPAWN, BLADE, etc.) But Warner Bros. was just as gulity by releasing more than enough sequals for BATMAN (they should have stopped after Tim Burton and Michael Keaton bowed out).  But now the latest craze is Marvel comics.  With the success and great quality of X-MEN two years ago, now comes the biggest and most anticipated Marvel super-hero: SPIDER-MAN! For those who never read the comic, or watch the 1970's cartoon (with the catchy song title) here is the basic story of the plot that is in the film.  Before he was a super-hero, he was a super-nerd, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is the top student and achiever at his high school.  For that he is teased and picked on by the other jealous and cruel students, but Peter has normal small dreams.  The only thing that he really wants is to win the heart of the friendly girl that he has had the biggest crush with, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  I can relate with that.  While on a field trip at the science center, Peter is bitten at his hand by one of the super-spiders that are scientific engineered.  With this bite, Peter inherits all of the powers that the super-spider has: stong web, able to jump great distance, stonger muscles, etc.  While Peter discovers his new powers, his only other friend (besides Mary Jane) Harry Osborn (James Franco) is realizing that his father, brilliant scientist and millionare Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) is acting strange, and there are bizarre murders surrounding Norman's science company.  Norman self-tested a powerful chemical that backfired and drove Norman to become schizophrenic and also have super human strength.  With Peter and Norman's super strength, Peter becomes the friendly and brave Spider-Man, with Norman's new evil mind he becomes the dark and vicious Green Goblin. Now with these two powers in New York City, who will win? That is the premise of the plot, it's not complex, but then again which comic book into film is?  Comic books are mostly based on characters and their personalities.  But to have a successful comic film, you need to have your characters (especially your super-heroes) well developed, not paper thin.  SUPERMAN, BATMAN, and X-MEN all did this, and I'm pleased to say that SPIDER-MAN is the same. Screenwriter David Koepp does a great job developing the characters for the screen.  You understand who Peter, Mary Jane, and Norman are, and you seen that there is more of a human personality with their characters. While director Sam Raimi does a great job with the pacing of the story, keeping it entertaining and exciting.  But most of all, giving it the same type of flow that you would read in a comic-book.  And the music score by the much beloved Danny Elfman also gives it a comic-book feel.  Note: if you're going to make a comic-book into film, you must have Danny Elfman do the music score. But what I feel the strongest element with SPIDER-MAN is the romantic chemistry between Peter and Mary Jane.  I haven't seen such a romantic relationship in a comic into film since Superman and Lois Lane. Instead of just casting someone to play the damsel in distress, Kristin Dunst does a great job as Mary Jane.  While Tobey Maguire also gets kudos as the love-struck Peter who is always smitten with her, but won't reveal his secret-identity as Spider-Man (with whom Mary Jane falls in love with). And Willem Dafoe is also good as the villian Green Goblin. I think creator Stan Lee should be proud of what Sam Raimi and company did with his most popular comic character.  What I also enjoyed about SPIDER-MAN is that it has a tounge-in-cheek humor similar to the original SUPERMAN.  Who didn't laugh when Clark Kent went to the phone booth to change into Superman, to see that it's not a full booth?  The scene where Peter first reveals his super-human strength during a wrestling match has the same kind of humor. Overall, SPIDER-MAN isn't Oscar material, but it is fun, and that's it purpose.  Had SPIDER-MAN been released last summer, it would have easily been the best film of the summer, along with A.I.  Let's just hope that the rest of this summer's film will be just as good.  But I doubt it will. Very entertaining and enjoyable!  ***** (out of five)"

Tobey Maguire is cast perfectly, and even manages to make the script sound intelligent. Spiderman is completely successful in translating the atmosphere of the Stan Lee/Steve Ditko comic book, and that's a good thing.<br/><br/>Minus points? The Willem Dafoe villain. While Spiderman is a neurotic, error-prone (semi-)human, Green Goblin is a cardboard cutout, a stereotypical sci-fi bogie man - even the graphic style of his costume is wrong, he looks like a 1980's Marvel villain, and doesn't match the perfectly captured vintage webslinger.

","Spider-Man is the best comic-book to movie adaptation yet. Forget about the original Batman movie. Compared to Spider-Man, it doesn't hold up. Raimi has faithfully brought the world's favorite wallcrawler to the big screen and offered a fine introduction to what should prove to be an excellent series of films. For once, Hollywood has offered up a superhero film with more story than action, and that's what makes this movie work and why it is a thoroughly faithful representation of the comic book. Marvel pioneered the idea of looking at superheroes as real people. It did a lot in the '70s to show the people behind the masks and to highlight the problems that being a superhero causes in their personal lives. Spider-Man was the best at showing this, and the movie has accurately represented that.<br/><br/>The only thing that detracts from the film at all is that the special effects are less than perfect. But given that you become so engrossed in the story, you hardly notice. Other movies rely too heavily on the special effects, so if there's the tiniest flaw, it makes the movie laughable. In Spider-Man, the special effects take a back seat to the characters and the story.<br/><br/>I applaud Spider-Man as the best superhero movie made to date."

Where was the excitement and tension? This had no 'wow' factor whatsoever.  This is guilty of everything Clones has been accused of - slow, too much love stuff, rough CGI (unfounded as far Im concerned)- but at least that had an awesome final 45 minutes.

","It has been a good many years since I read a `Spider-Man' comic and I would say that, failing lapses in memory, this was a very faithful adaptation. Yes, there are probably minor points that the hardcore fans would object to - the organic webshooters, Mary Jane Watson's white trash background, the Green Goblin's outfit, the different circumstances that lead to Peter Parker's first meeting with the mugger that would change his life - but these were minor and did not affect the the story.<br/><br/>What absolute perfect casting Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe were as the leads.  Tobey Maguire  fine actor as we all knew, but I was especially impressed with Willem Dafoe.  Like many people before the film went into production I read that the part of the Green Goblin had been offered to John Malkovich, and I was sad that he eventually decided to turn the part down. Now I would say that I could not imagine any other actor but Willem Dafoe in the role.  He was brilliant.  And as for Kirsten Dunstshe has become a very beautiful and attractive woman, probably the only qualification required for the part of Mary Jane Watson.<br/><br/>There are a couple of criticisms.  The special effects were not what they could have been.  Everybody has said that.  Post-production haste?  The film also suffered in exactly the same way as the first Christopher Reeve `Superman' in that it was too slow and too long.  It seemed that there was an awful lot of essential back story to fill in, and the film does fill it all in, and at great length.  But, saying that, now that the back story is out of the way, `Spider-Man 2' looks like it could be a total classic in much the same way that `Superman 2' was a total classic of its kind.<br/><br/>And I do hope that Sam Neill does play Dr. Octopus!"

","While I enjoyed much of SPIDERMAN, I had the curious feeling that this film was very much the result of dozens of drafts and rewrites. The opening and closing ""bookends"" seem to inhabit one universe, while the middle of the film is quite another. Are these teenagers? Young adults? If they are so smart/wealthly why don't they go on to college? How much time passes during the running time? Is Spiderman a science whiz or just a hobbyist photographer? Besides one newspaper's headlines, why would all of NYC suddenly turn on Spiderman despite his heroics? All of these questions kept popping into my head, and the best reason I could give for most of them, is that it's largely a result of all the years of ""development"" (more accurately ""devolve-ment"") the film went thru from Menachem Golan to James Cameron to David Koepp/Sam Raimi (with numerous other stops in between). And, I give Stan Lee a LOT more credit than believing he envisioned SPIDER-MAN as such an obvious ripoff of the Mario Puzo/Richard Donner/Salkind SUPERMAN film(s). Some of the scenes border on outright theft. The cast is fine (though two fine actors Cliff Roberston and Rosemary Harris seem lost at times under Raimi's unsure direction). One final question, if you hire such an enjoyable ham as Willem Dafoe for your villain, why would you hide him under a helmet for much of the film?! (Even Stan Lee says this was a mistake). The big mano-a-mano confrontation between Spidey & Dafoe degenerates into a battle between two stunt men (Maguire's double is at least 25 lbs. heavier) with dueling voice-overs of your lead actors."
"wilde_at_heart","Null","0","0","11 June 2002"," Best Super-hero film ever?
","Created about 40 years ago by the inimitable Stan Lee, Spiderman is one of the most popular and enduring superheroes of all time. Since his humble beginnings in the final issue of Amazing Stories, Peter Parker and his costumed alter-ego, the web-slinging Peter Parker has been appearing in multiple Marvel comic books of his own, the cult classic cartoon and some highly disreputable live action TV series and even a couple of monster-flop movies. Throughout it all, Spiderman's motto has never changed; with great power comes great responsibility. Thankfully, it is a philosophy that seems to have been first and foremost in director Sam Raimi's mind  he had the power to make the film, and an equally important responsibility to the millions of Spiderman fans across the world to do it right. Thankfully, despite the inevitable grumbling of the hard-core fans, he has pretty much got it as near to perfect as possible. The decision to cast Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman would be a stroke of genius if it weren't such a no-brainer. Although Spiderman is by no means an acting tour de force, the talented Mr Maguire has demonstrated in diverse films such as Ride With The Devil, Pleasantville, Cider House Rules and to a lesser extent Wonder Boys, his innate ability to meld a sense of wide-eyed innocence and all the charm of the ideal all-American boy-next-door with the inner strength and mettle to get a difficult job done. These two features are central to the appeal of Spiderman, who in many ways is as equally heroic in either of his personas. Raimi certainly understands this important facet of Spiderman's story and he and Maguire give us one of the best grounded and rounded super-heroes in cinematic history. Like the X-Men movie, Spiderman attempts to condense many of the important features of a storyline that stretches over decades into a movie that also follows the action/adventure formula that guarantees bums on seats. After the critical success of X-Men, it is heartening to see that Raimi also chose to treat the mythology with the respect that it deserves, changing it as little as possible while bringing it swinging into modern times. The duality that typifies Spidey also extends to his enemies, in this case, Norman Osborn/Green Goblin in a great if typical performance from Willem Dafoe. While the Goblin's mask may be scary, it is certainly less scary than Dafoe can be himself, which is the film's one major drawback. However, as industrialist millionaire Norman Osborn, father to Peter's best friend Harry (Franco), he gets plenty of opportunities to deliver the scares without his costume. The rest of the cast is a bit of a mixed bag  Kirsten Dunst as Peter's life-long unrequited love MJ Watson has never looked more beautiful, but unfortunately the script really lets her down, making her look like window dressing at best and a coquettish and indecisive vamp at worst. Meanwhile, Harry radiates a deep-seated insecurity and sense of inherent danger that long time Spidey fans will appreciate. Without a doubt, the Special FX Department shares top billing in this flick, with an entirely computer generated Spiderman performing most of the incredible action sequences in the film. Many may argue that the use of CGI in Spiderman is too obvious, but given the alternative of an acrobat performing against a bluescreen, Raimi has chosen the wiser approach. Furthermore, it places the film halfway between live action and hi-tech cartoon, which allows it to draw both from the talent of the actors and the visual style of the comics/cartoons that have made Spiderman's name legend. Only a fool would suggest that this film stands alone as a perfect super-hero flick, but to date, there has been no such thing. Instead, we have a near-perfect compromise that will recruit millions of new fans to the story and give everybody some great thrills along the way. Bring on (or swing on) Spiderman 2, slated for 2004."

","I did not go into Spiderman thinking it was going to be the greatest movie ever,I just went in hoping it would be good like most reviews were claiming.It failed and I found myself rather bored at times,not to mention annoyed at the dialogue and some other factors. Problems: 1. If you thought the Star Wars romance was corny,forget it! I found myself groaning and flopping around in my seat whenever the Spiderman couple was on screen.Not only did Kirstin Dunst and Toby Maguire have no chemistry whatsoever,I wondered how Kirstin ever got into the movie industry.Then again,when has bad acting been a problem? 2.The dialogue was extremely hokey at times,such as a scene involving Spiderman's uncle telling him some ""fatherly advice"".Yet no one else has seemed to notice this. 3.It just lacked the intelligence of X-Men and any real humor or anything interesting.The characters were not very interesting and they were rather flat. 4.The Spiderman effects were clearly computer and there was nothing thrilling about the flying sequences. Nothing personal to Spiderman fans out there,I just didn't like this movie very much at all.I really do not understand how it has been so popular. Rating:4 out of 10."

","I have been itching to see Spider-Man after I only mildly enjoyed ""Attack of the clones"". that film did not live up to its hype..so I was fairly scepticle when it came to this film... as the hype was even more than that of Star wars.<br/><br/>With one exception. This film delivers. Big time.<br/><br/>It was everything I enjoyed about the Spider-man comic and cartoon, Tobey maguire is awesome as Peter Parker/Spider-Man totally nailing everything about the character. Kirsten Dunst was great as MJ, she kept getting to me, every time her and peter had a 'moment'. Wilem Dafoe relishes his role as the green goblin...He's over the top without being too hammy. But the real treasure..the man who makes the film, is J.K. Simmons, who plays peter's boss J.Jonah Jameson. I couldnt stop laughing everytime I heard his voice.<br/><br/>Sam raimi's direction is spot on. He has truly bought this comic book to life. I never doubted that raimi's touch would lift this above a mere popcorn movie. Like the orignal Batman, he treats the character with respect.<br/><br/>I also trusted David Koepp's writing. He's been behind some the biggest Blockbusters ever made (Jurrasic Park) and He know how to avoid making things corny.<br/><br/>Overall there is nothing I didnt like about this film...it completely lives up to its hype. ***** 5 out of 5"

","I have seen Spider-Man three times and I have been able to enjoy and still be shocked by the effects every single time! Tobey Maguire did both characters perfectly and I loved and laughed at the beginning scenes when he learns his new powers. Kirsten Dunst was wonderful at playing the girl-next-door MJ. Willem Dafoe was both frightening and enjoyable as Mr.Osborn/Green Goblin. The rest of the cast was well-picked also. This movie was well written and thought out and I thought it was very good how they were careful to put scenes in that clashed with 9/11. I also thought it was very nice how they sticked to the comic but changed things that wouldn't be appealing to audiences that weren't fans of the comics since I for one am one of those people. I loved it so much that my friends who have not seen it yet are getting tired of me talking about it! It was a funny, sad, happy, and an action-packed movie. I enjoyed every single second of it and was still on the edge of my seat by the end of the third time I had see the movie! A triumph for the director, the actors, and of course everyone else who helped make this wonderful and enjoyable movie!"

","Slick special effects hung over a simple plot don't always make for a good film.  Fortunately, 'Spider-Man' is saved from being just another big-budget Hollywood blowout by the utterly guileless performance of Tobey Maguire and the humorous touch of Sam Raimi and the writers.  A darker tone might have made it more interesting, but than can wait for one of the many sequels which are undoubtedly in pre-production.  The choices they made this time were the right ones: America needs a hero right now, and any film which has a bridge full New Yorkers rallying behind an everyday guy as he fights a villainous mastermind is going to rock at the US box-office  especially after that oh-so-unfortunate teaser trailer involving the WTC towers."

I wasn't expecting much from this film other than hoping for an action packed movie. However the only action in the entire film was a couple of fight scenes and watching Spider-Man swing along some buildings!. There was never going to be a great script or great acting.

The movie was great but the costumes were just too damn gay, Especially the Green Goblin (eeewww)the only thing that costume was missing was some sprinkles,jewels. Just like in Batman (the one with Chris O'Donnel as Robin) the costumes just get gayer and gayer.

Toby Maguire plays the role of Peter Parker just the way you'd want him to, with not a hint of arrogance that he's landed the role of a lifetime, but someone every bulleyed kid anywhere can relate to and want to be.

","The film the fans have been waiting for should have been the tagline for this film. Only a fan could forgive Sam Raimi the basic mistakes, which made this okay start to the spiderman film franchise nearly mediocre. Tobey Maguire is superb and does come across as a near perfect Peter parker and could have been drawn straight from the mind of Stan Lee (who puts in a great cameo). William Defeo brilliantly hams it up as the psycho Green Goblin, and the rest of the cast work well with what they've been given. I must give a thumbs up to J.K Simmons he was J. Jonah Jameson to perfection, Please come back for the next movies. So with all this praise for the actors what went wrong?<br/><br/>The script for one thing, it had moments of genius the scene with Peter being ripped off by the fight promoter up to the confrontation with uncle Ben's killer. The scene where Spiderman takes out the armoured car robbers and poses for the camera going off, and any scene, which involved J.J.Jameson. See the pattern, any scene that the writers took straight out of the comics worked perfectly the scenes they tried to write themselves didn't. Then there's the effects directors and studios need to learn that super-fast moving humans/superheroes don't look good yet when done by computers, take Blade2 (fight scene in the warehouse with Danny john-Jules) and Harry Potter (Quiddich match) The scenes with Spiderman swinging through the city were great.<br/><br/>To sum up. This is a okay film if only for some superb acting but its a fan film and doesn't appeal to a wider audience and may leave a lot of people disappointed. Hopefully the 2nd film will be better but the studio should not expect it to be as big as this one."

","Peter Parker (played by Tobey Maguire) is a very smart, very socially awkward high school student who lives with his aunt and uncle. He is in love with Mary Jane Watson (a.k.a., ""M.J."", played by Kirsten Dunst), and has been since she moved in next door when they were both children. One day they are both on a field trip, and a genetically altered, radioactive spider bites Peter. He feels ill and goes home to fall asleep. When he wakes up he begins to figure out that his body has changed. He is far stronger, can stick to surfaces, and then there are the webs. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Peter's best friend's father, Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), runs a large company attempting to sell advanced technology to the military. When an experiment in human augmentation stalls, he decides to make himself a human guinea pig, and he begins his transformation into the extremely schizophrenic Green Goblin. <br/><br/>That's just the set-up. There's a lot more story, as Peter Parker becomes Spider-Man, and then, with the help of his uncle, figures out what Spider-Man should stand for. Tobey Maguire does a better job of this transition than most actors one might have thought of casting for a superhero role would have, but he isn't given enough to work with. And Kirsten Dunst has even less to do. Willem Dafoe might be the stand out, but only because he is supposed to chew the scenery and does, quite effectively.<br/><br/>
Director Sam Raimi is apparently a huge fan of the comic book hero, and he has given this film a distinctly comic book feel, starting from the comic book opening credits. This can be charming at times, but, for me at least, falls flat at many others. The dialog is unintentionally funny far too often. <br/><br/>I'll sum up here with my summary as we left the theater on 5/17/2002: This movie somehow manages to be both entertaining *and* lame."

","I would just like to address all the people out there who complained, griped and otherwise whined about how ""fake"" and ""unbelievable"" it was.  GROW UP!!! Jesus, are you people ever picky.  One more thing, which will justify your complaints, but also explain why you're stupid to have them: IT'S NOT BASED IN REALITY!!!<br/><br/>That having been said I would now like to go into my review.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man"", for all intended purposes delivered well, considering all the competition it had from other movies... among them, some science fiction movie....I can't remember the title.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire did a fantastic job as Peter Parker/Spider-Man.  His physical commitment to the film shows just the caliber of actor he really is and is a testament to his professionalism.  The one thing that weirded the hell out of me, was his voice.  When he yells, his voice actually gets higher in pitch.  While he speaks, however, his voice carries well.<br/><br/>
Kirsten Dunst is a fabulous actress.  I've been following her since ""interview"", and she played the part well as MJ.  Actually I had no problems with her until a friend of mine (a woman, of course) pointed out that she doesn't work as a redhead.  She's too pale.  True enough I figured...this friend of mine is a redhead with a darker complexion and shes Hot!<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe. I cant even begin to describe him.  He's evil. He's cut-throat.  He's a father.  He has brought a performance so unique and interesting, that it can only be matched by Jack Nicholson.  Or vise versa. Willem Dafoe is one of those cool actors who has done everything possible, so now he's earned the right to have a fun role.  And you can tell he had fun in this role.  Actually, he's cool just judging by his name.  Willem, Willem, Willem....<br/><br/>Now the supporting cast.  JK Simmons is a really good mean guy (REALLY REALLY GOOD) Rosemarry Harris is worrisome, and motherly, and Cliff Robertson dies.  The supporting cast is all top-notch, they all pull their weight and carry their scenes well.  As for JK Simmons....He MAKES a couple scenes as JJ.<br/><br/>The Special Effects were very good.  I cant believe how many people complained of how fakely the movie represented a skinny (but built) teenager in a bright red and blue, skin-tight suit, swinging down 80 stories and recoiling up at speeds of 70 mph, while shooting out a sticky fluid out of his wrist as he chases down a green man in a bionic suit linked to a jet glider.  Actually....now that I read what I just said....your right...how fake!!!!  (idiots...)<br/><br/>And finally, because I fear I'm nearing 1000 words.  I would like to rate this film 4.5 stars out of 5.  If you want to know my other thoughts on Spider-man, e-Mail me....I love mail.<br/><br/>And for all you who think I'm too biased in favor of Spider-Man....why don't you tell that to my Spidey Tattoo?"

","I grew up with all the COOL superheroes - Superman, Batman, Spiderman, The Green Hornet. Love those dark souls to death. So, when I heard they chose baby-faced Toby Maguire as the twilight lead in ""Spiderman"", I cringed and vowed not to see it. Well, I couldn't take it anymore, especially after hearing ""Hero"" (why do they ALWAYS wait until the last of the credits to play the best songs?). The dark possibilities drew me against my will, and I saw Spiderman today. Wow! WOW!<br/><br/>Mom always said to watch out for the quiet ones as still waters run deep, and Maquire's performance as dear dark Spidey was no exception. He may appear cherubic, but there's definitely more going on than meets the eye. He was a wonderful surprise, and I live now for the sequel when an older, wiser Maguire takes on more evil in our world. His performance was powerful without being overpowering or over-the-top. He's an actor to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>I've loved Kirsten Dunst's performances since I first laid eyes on her in ""Interview With A Vampire"" (as Claudia). She magically makes each role her own, and she's shown great range in her brief career. My only complaint with her role as MJ in ""Spiderman"" is superficial - she looks nearly asleep in many of her close-ups. (Perhaps pretty boy Maguire has her under his spell?)<br/><br/>Willem Defoe let's it all hang out as Gobby (don't you just love Spidey's pet name for the nasty Green Goblin?) and he's a blast. He's completely convincing as the schizophrenic madman who tries to destroy Spidey and everyone he loves. I almost forgot he was the bad man a couple of times and felt sorry for him.<br/><br/>This film would never have worked had it not been for the genius of Sam Raimi (another selling point for getting me to the theatre). He's shows more subtlety in ""Spiderman"" but his trademark slo-mo's are still there, and he takes what could have been another boring superhero flick and adds his unique brand of excitement (can you imagine ""The Quick and The Dead"" without Raimi's influence?)<br/><br/>All in all, the film is a great afternoon romp, and I may go see it again (to hold me until the sequel). There are a couple of scenes that will bewilder the very young, though there were some in the audience and they didn't seem to be too disturbed. Still, I wouldn't chance it with anyone under 10. The Green Gob is pretty scary."

","There was always gonna be a lot of pressure on any director who took this film aboard. Sam Raimi had a lot to contend with - and even more to achieve. When I first heard that Tobey Maguire had been cast as Peter Parker, I did have my doubts - but in hindsight and after watching Tobey in action, I can't imagine anyone else playing a better Peter Parker. Maguire successfully brings across the teenage angst, isolation and comedy associated with the Peter Parker character. His 'lost in space' persona, boy-ish grins and mannerisms are ideal. Kirsten Dunst is so-so. She isn't<br/><br/>bad, but could have pushed her character just the bit further. We, or I at least, felt very little sympathy her character where it was due - living in a poor, dysfunctional family - her constant harrassment, use and abuse merely as a trophy figure for jocks (Flash Thompson) and wealthy rich kids like Harry Osbourn. JK Simmons was entertaining as a more comical J. Jonah Jameson character than portrayed in the comic-books or cartoons - but it suited the character well in this film at least.<br/><br/>Cliff Robertson was neither here-nor-there as Uncle Ben. Aunt May's portrayl was poor and lacking in parts where emotion was needed. However, my biggest character disappointment was Willem Dafoe's portrayl of the Green Goblin. Granted, the story between Norman and Harry was a welcome and interesting insight - but Dafoe could have brought so much more depth and menace and madness and black comedy to his lunatic alter-ego, as Jack Nicholson did with The Joker in the first Batman.<br/><br/>David Koepp's script was adequate, though I did feel much of the movie was rushed in scenes where it should not have been, and vice-versa - as well as many plot holes and inappropriacies (eg. Uncle Ben shot on a NYC street as opposed to at home) - it may be forgiven, because this movie had a lot to establish and serve up within a reasonable (2hr) amount of time. I believe Sam Raimi was aware of this requirement and hence, did have to allow for some unavoidable inadequacies as a result.<br/><br/>However, Spiderman has superb possibilities as a franchise, but it has to be handled very carefully - not like Warner Bros Batman or Superman series. It shouldn't lose the vital human story to action and dual villans. The reason Spiderman works is because it is a human story first and foremost - the audience relates to this. There is a great romantic element which should be delicately exploited. People have to feel for this character. PLEASE SONY, DON'T DESTROY WHAT COULD BE THE BIGGEST JEWEL IN YOUR CROWN. Spiderman has to be rooted in reality with fantastical elements. Raimi can do this. Now Spiderman has an established plot-base, this has to be developed and explored.<br/><br/>Spiderman could be a great movie power - intelligent, emotional and always exciting. I hope writers, Raimi, Ziskin and Bryce will learn from their own lessons in Spiderman. With great power, comes great responsibility."

","We moan and groan year in year out at the tripe Hollywood peddle the masses in their supermarket cinemas, and we have every reason to. But it is when they get their Mainstream formula right that they deserve credit, and I for one will pay it when it is due. ""Spider-Man"" is the Comic Book, Hollywood formula film reality that entertains right to the last frame. Only when the formula works this well can we ignore the often cliché script and unoriginal filmmaking. ""Spider-Man"" truly is a Saturday Night joy ride that does not fail to deliver.<br/><br/>The standard hero formula of Romance, Action, Good vs. Evil, Dark side/Good side gets a good work-out here and unlike the recent ""Star Wars Ep2: Attack of the Clones"", this film pulls it off with flying colours. Each aspect of the film receives its due and none of it over-powers the show. Now the draw back here is there is nothing original, and if you're a fan of the comic book then you would of read this script before. It is admittedly a no-brainer and to some that is offensive, but if your out to enjoy something without using your noggin' then this film is definitely for you!<br/><br/>It is good to see Comic Book converts receiving the respect they deserve and the film will not disappoint long time fans of ""Spider-Man"". The film is well described as a motion picture comic and is structured in the exact way any off the shelf comic would be. This of course has led to some rather static and short sequences that are often a thorn in an otherwise well structured film. Some sequences are so short that you would question their relevance. However it is all a sideshow and does not damage the film's entertainment value.<br/><br/>One of the major reasons this film hits its formula bliss is the superb performance of Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man and Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin. Tobey is a perfect and shy Peter Parker whilst still a perfect Spider-Man, he has an honesty in his performance that drives the audience to like him both as the character and the actor. All the while Willem Dafoe sizzles as the villain and ultimately steels the show; He is scarier without the mask and manages to bring a touch of darkness to a bright green character on a flying board. There is no room for awards here but the job is done and done very well.<br/><br/>The Special effects also get top score as the men at the helm have given reality the driving seat and slotted the computer generation in the make-up department. This movie is a classic example of how special effects can be used to add to a production, to make the final gloss rather than become the whole production, as is generally the case. Digital effects still have a long way to come and this film certainly pushed the limits, but it did not cross them and as a result has retained a sense of believability. There are moment s however where the film ruins its own suspended disbelief, mainly in the form of some of the Green Goblins toys, but it is again not enough to disrupt the film as a whole. <br/><br/>At the end of it all you have both a rather average film and a perfect entertainment package The question is what your in the mood for? I will certainly add this to my collection for those times when I wish to escape and be entertained and it is for those moments this film is absolutely perfect. <br/><br/>8/10"

","I saw this last Friday and was very pleased with it. To make a live-action version of a comic book is difficult, and Sam Raimi and co. successfully deliver on this one. <br/><br/>Tobey Maguire was an excellent casting choice, providing the right bumbling, geeky science-obsessed nerdy high school boy characterization.<br/><br/>
Like Tim Burton's 'Batman', this film has the correct comic book feel to it, but unlike 'Batman' and 'Dick Tracy', the aesthetics were not made to look comic-bookish. The colors, lights, and buildings, etc. were all normal looking, which IMO fit this movie as it didn't have the intensity that 'Batman' had. <br/><br/>The movie was very clever, creative, and humorous. Also unlike 'Batman' as I mentioned, 'Spiderman' was much less intense and less violent. The emphasis seemed to be more on the psychological and humorous aspects of Spiderman rather than the action aspects, which may dissatisfy some true comic book fans.   <br/><br/>My only complaint-the Green Goblin character. For one, the costume was ridiculously simple and low-key. It looked like something a kid would get from the five-and-dime for Halloween-totally laughable!! How could the filmmakers screw up so badly on that one? I also thought the Green Goblin's demise at the end was too simple and kind of stupid. A better death would of been for him to become the victim of that special ball weapon he had that obliterated people. His son could of heard about Dad's death another way other than to see his body, which obviously wouldn't exist anymore if he was obliterated. <br/><br/>Sam Raimi's usual trademark touches of in-your-face, startling action is perfect for the action-movie genre, he was an excellent choice for the Spiderman films. Now the only question is, will the sequel measure up??<br/><br/>
I give this film 8/10."
"amrten","7","0","0","7 June 2002"," Good, but Amazing...?
","On the whole I liked Spider-Man. It was good escapist fun. Where my disappointment in the movie lies is that the film makers were so close to making the movie smart and serious, as well as action packed and entertaining, but for my money, they backed out on the smart and serious at the last minute. What was left in made me want more of it. The actors were having emotional responses, but the film makers forgot to connect the audience to what was going on. That's just BAD. I would have even been willing to sacrifice one or two of the action sequences for a little more plot and character development, so that I cared about the characters. I think that Hollywood has forgotten that they can still make a movie that appeals to the kids that is smart enough and engaging enough to keep the adults interested as well (take a lesson from The Simpsons, which appeals on so many levels and works for young and old alike). Not everyone has Attention Deficit Disorder. But sadly, Hollywood will look at the Box Office receipts and say if it ain't broke.... I was so disappointed when I looked up on the screen and said ""oh well, it is after all only a Comic Book.""<br/><br/>I am happy for Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. They are incredible young actors and the future of the movies for the next decade. They deserve to get this big pay day, and they still were able to give emotionally rich and inspired performances, in spite of everything else. I hope that they won't loose sight of there talent.<br/><br/>Possible spoilers!!! although, I may be the last person in America to have seen this movie, so I don't know who I would be spoiling it for. Being from New York, and at the World Trade Center on September 11th, it was a little disturbing to see the sequence where the Green Goblin attacks the Oscorp Headquarters and pieces of the building were falling on top of police cars and crushing them. I realize that this was more than likely filmed before the events of the 11th, and I am not one to be hyper-sensitive about this if it were an integral part of the movie, but it was at most a one or two second piece of film. Would it have killed the editors to have cut that out? Also, although I have felt very patriotic during this time, was the final sequence with the large American Flag appropriate? I kind of feel that although it was well meaned, it came across a little on the exploitative side."

The live-action fight scenes seemed clumsy and amaturish in comparison to the computer-generated parts. I was a big fan of the Spidey cartoons when I was a kid, but unfortunately this movie tended to feel too much like watching the same cheezy cartoons except with a sexy leading lady.  (Compare it for example to X-Men, which didn't have the same cheezy feel but still was a great action flick for a broader age group).  Tobey Maguire did great as a boy-next-door, but playing the action hero was a stretch and in my mind was not able to quite pull it off.  The SNL skit was right on - you just wanted to fall asleep when he talked."

","Spiderman Spider man; a true comic book hero brought to life. A movie that delivers the action but does not take itself too seriously while it's at it. Where cheesy love lines and predictable action sequences are enjoyable and awaited rather then shunned. One problem I have with many modern superhero movies is that they totally lose the idea of `kid entertainment brought to life' and instead try to pull off some sort of Matrix. This is one of the problems I found in X Men. It took itself excessively seriously. There was absolutely no hummer in the movie what so ever. Where humor was to be expected one found heavy drama. Spiderman, on the other hand, felt like a cartoon, just with real people. The fake look of the Green Goblin was amusing, as was the swing of the `human spider' from building to towering building. This is for those Spiderman fans out there, the new and the old, this is NOT for someone in love with Blade II; they would probably do better with The Scorpion King. Know who you are and do not complain about this movie if you would not be caught dead watching the cartoon or reading the comics. The one comment I have is that it failed to explain what powers the Green Goblin had or how the second spider costume came about, other then that, the movie satisfied me perfectly."

","Having had high expectations for this movie ( Having enjoyed the Spiderman comics without being a rabid fan ), I was rather let down by it  - cries of HERESY !!!! start now .<br/><br/>Two reasons for this - the general pacing ( it takes almost an hour before the Hero finally gets his act together and starts swinging in earnest ) and the high amount of screentime the ""talks from the heart"" scenes take - especially the long and tortured talks between Spiderman(-to-be ) and MJ. Some crisp editing here could have done wonders for the whole movie. Its not really necessary to plow over the same territory repeatedly - even the daftest drunk will get the point that MJs family is broken, her boyfriend Flash is a classic idiot etc, after the first exposition - and frankly, I guess, the audience was not in the theater for a suburban sociological exploration.<br/><br/>Second, the longwinded (if perhaps necessary ) introduction, which IMHO could have been much more easily done with ""flashbacks"" - Its a long time before Peter Parker discovers his abilities, and even longer before he starts applying them creatively. Hmmmmpf - I expected more in this regard from Sam Raimi of all possible directors.<br/><br/>The costumes, set designs and camera work are on par, but nothing to remember as novel, impressive or breathtaking (like say, the ""bullet time"" sequences in Matrix ). I can live with the cybered up, armoured Green Goblin and never had a moment of disbelief seeing Peter spiderclimb up walls or swing and bounce through the streets like ""Tarzan-on-speed"".<br/><br/>On the up side, when the story takes off, the effects are brilliant, the acting by Macquire and especially William Dafoe is great to exceptional ( I only say ""mirror sequence"" - hats off to Mr Dafoe ), the small walk-ins from and references to the original graphic novel are well done, and there is a strange, wistful humour around. Unfortunately - only until the next overlong and sappy exposition scene ( I personally found the scenes with Aunt May especially tedious - strangely enough the women with us found the MJ scenes ""stale""). Editing and pacekeeping are weak in this one, essential point. Sorry for repeating myself on this.<br/><br/>Not bad, but could have been way better.<br/><br/>6 out of 10 goblins"

","and I feel inclined not to disagree with him. This film is just plain excellent from start to finish. It's not perfect, it contains far too many cheesy lines although to be fair the majority of them come from the 60s comics so they were always bound to be cheesy but could you do Spider-Man without the ""great power comes great responsibility"" line? Of course not so we'll put the odd cheesy line to one side for the moment.<br/><br/>This movie was never going to be your standard Hollywood blockbuster with the potential oddball coupling of Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire. Raimi is a talented director and throughout his career his films have had 2 things in common, entertainment and Bruce Campbell. Spider-Man disappoints on neither score. Add in the lovely Kirsten Dunst and a Green Goblin played by someone who yet again you wouldn't think would do this kind of movie (though he did do Body of Evidence....) and it's a recipe for not only box office success but also critical success. <br/><br/>This film was always going to be the first in a series of films about one of the best superhero chracters available and it's excellence across the board merely means were unlikely to ever see one of them go straight to video. The quality of the script, acting and directing and also it's faithfulness to a comic legend means no-one should be disappointed. That all said it's not the sort of film likely to win Oscars (except the technical awards) but then Titanic isn't half the movie this is and it won a shedload.<br/><br/>
My only complaints, the odd cheesy line which I'll forgive and the Green Goblin's mask which makes him look like a Mighty Morphon Power Ranger baddie. Come on Willem Dafoe just needed his face painted green!"

","Spider-Man scurries about sideways, extending its web for probably half an hour too long. But the web is lustrous at its best.<br/><br/>Director Sam Raimi has some impressive credits, mostly from his wonderful Evil Dead films, but he also lays claim to the wonderful A Simple Plan, as well The Cider House Rules. Cider House also starred Spider-Man's lead Tobey Maguire and it would seem that that's a  profitable association. (We'll charitably forget perhaps The Quick And The Dead and The Gift, both of which weren't particularly successful.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire in Spider-Man was an inspired choice as Peter Parker who becomes Spidey. He plays Parker as an affable goofball, a sensitive type who's actually interested in his studies, especially science. I'm not sure Maguire with that twisted little smile could play any other sort of part.<br/><br/>Peter gets bitten by a spider and over night grows muscles, throws away his glasses and finds he can match it with the school bully, in what was for me the best scene in the film. If movies exist partly to realise fantasies for the viewer, Spider-Man provided one of the best ""weakling punches back"" scenes I can remember. At least for me, that scene was worth seeing the film for, which will amply point to certain facets of my character that I'm sure I would have been better off leaving out of this piece. <br/><br/>
Soon Spider-Man starts swinging about from tall buildings and yes, it was terrific. This was Olympic Gymnastics joined to the best of Circus trapeze. Spider-Man was very quick and athletic. It was exhilarating.<br/><br/>The chief baddie in the film is The Green Goblin played very effectively by Willem Dafoe (Platoon, Mississippi Burning, Light Sleeper), although his best bits were probably when it wasn't even Dafoe, as The Goblin zipped about standing on his rocket propelled platform doing dastardly things to Spider-Man's home town.<br/><br/>The Goblin was menacing. This was a digitally enhanced threat of course, but so were Spider-Man's feats of valour.<br/><br/>There's a love story built into the show between Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter Parker but it adds little to the film. If Dunst had been asked to play the part a little more darkly then it might have been more interesting, I would have liked to have seen perhaps Katie Holmes in the part.<br/><br/>
But Dunst has shown she can do ragged in Crazy/Beautiful and bimbo in Bring It On. I'm sure she played the part just as the producers requested.<br/><br/>But that still leaves Spider-Man as alternatively exhilarating and then pretty slow. Perhaps the teenagers will enjoy the teenage romance scenario but I'd say it should have been left from the film. Then Spider-Man would have been just the right length.<br/><br/>3 And A Half Webby Flys Out Of Five<br/><br/>Steve Baker"

","The Marvel Comic phenomenon finally crawls onto the silver screen in the big screen adaption of a cult classic superhero who, after being bitten by a genetically-enhanced new breed of spider, finds himself with arachno-mutant abilities! Set in high-school, high-school aged Peter Parker (played by Pleasantville's Tobey Maguire) is having enough troubles in his life - his Uncle Ben is killed and he lusts after Mary Jane Watson (Dick's Kirsten Dunst) - without having to save the citizens of his city! But a mysterious Green Goblin explodes onto the screen - ahem - scene to rain on Spidey's parade by destroying anything and anybody that gets in his way!<br/><br/>To be honest, I wasn't even going to bother with the big-screen experience of this film simply because Spider-Man was never a favourite superhero of mine (I liked the Batman phenomena much more!) but I'm glad I did! The visual effects are nothing but spectacular - each shot of Spiderman swinging from building to building from his silk-web-rope stuff is superbly choreographed and executed. The fight sequences and stunts are amazing to watch, while the hopeless romantics who view this will love the storyline between Parker, Mary Jane, Harry and Spider-Man. Also, the scenes in which Peter is trying out his new-found powers are extremely charming and funny.<br/><br/>Now, onto the performances. The not-so-obvious casting of Tobey Maguire in the lead role was an inspired idea. The fact that he's not a conventional Hollywood leading man works to his advantage. Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin is great both in and out of costume while his son Harry, played by Freaks And Geeks star James Franco is good as Peter's best friend, although his character is a little stereotypical. Kirsten Dunst (who is just getting better and better) is wonderful as Spidey's love interest Mary Jane, despite the fact that for the 2 hours the film runs for we see her have strong feelings for a milestone four guys (OK, so 2 are the same person, but she didn't know this!). The charismatic high-school couple share great chemistry and hot up the screen in a particularly memorable scene where he rescues her from 5 thugs in the pouring rain.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a truly inspired comic-book to silver screen movie. Not since the first two Batman movies has a superhero film come as close to perfection as this (although admittedly, X-Men wasn't far off!). No doubt there is a sequel already planned and scripted - but that's definetely OK by me! 8.5/10."

","I am not much of a fan of comic-books-turned-into-movies, they've never really interested me (except maybe last year's X Men). I went in with mixed expectations, I'd seen reviews comparing it to Star Wars Episode II, and seen the two flicks go head to head in the ratings war...<br/><br/>...AND SPIDER MAN IS THE SUPERIOR OF THE TWO!!! There are some predictable/cheesy moments (re comic-book moments!!) and there is less action than I expected. There is also a lot less romance scenes to endure, but these are believable and suspension of disbelief is not an absolute necessity! <br/><br/>The movie follows the basic plot line of the early Marvel comic books, where we learn how Peter Parker received his super powers and how he figures out how to use them. The Green Goblin I remember was this mutated freak/creature, not an 'ordinary' man decked out in corny-looking armor complete with really corny mask. His hover sled looked cool though.<br/><br/>My only real gripe is the slowness of the story, I did expect to see more of Spider man's web slinging action and the villain wasn't really menacing enough. <br/><br/>Anyhoo, for those who love C.G.I, there is plenty of that to look at. The C.G.I is used as a narrative tool to move the story along (Spider man and his jumping, swinging around) but doesn't devolve into a cartoonish, fake mishmash of events that drags on for 45 minutes or more. Lord of the Rings is a favorite flick of mine where the C.G.I was also used to its best effect!<br/><br/>CONCLUSION?<br/><br/>This flick is so much better than the boring, over-rated, over-hyped, cartoon-fest called Star Wars II! If Mr Lucas has not learned from watching the vastly superior LotR, he should at the *very* least sit down and watch this movie a dozen times to see how CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT *should* work!!<br/><br/>7/10"

","I saw this film whilst on holiday. Now I don't usually watch movies whilst on holiday preferring instead to lie on a beach somewhere but I was so anxious to see this film and it hadn't yet been released in the United Kingdom so I went into the cinema and watched a fantastic movie.<br/><br/>Superhero films are a strange genre. Sometimes they are good such was the case with Superman or Batman. Other times they are plain bad. The success of a superhero film will often determine whether more are made. If a superhero film performs badly at the box office then movie studios are reluctant to make any more. However, if they do well then it gives a green light for more to be made.<br/><br/>I was skeptical about Spider-Man to be honest. I wondered how two hours of film time could do justice to Parker's introduction, the origin of Spider-Man, the birth of the Green Goblin etc. The writers did a great job.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire was perfect as Spidey, exactly like the original character from Amazing Fantasy Comic no. 15 (1962). Kirsten Dunst was also perfect for the role of Mary Jane. And what can I say about J.K. Simmons as Jonah Jameson-he was spot on.<br/><br/>Credit must go to William Defoe as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. I would go as far to say this is Defoe's best role in years. I actually felt sympathy for Norman Osborn as he had become a bad guy through fate rather than choice and Defoe made the Green Goblin into an interesting character. The Goblin suit was hi-tech as opposed to the costume from the comics; to be honest if the film would have made the Goblin suit exactly like the comics it would have looked rather corny.<br/><br/>The action was just amazing; seeing Spidey leap around and the Goblin on his glider made me feel really excited. The fight scenes were great exactly as one would expect from Sam Raimi. Raimi was the man behind the fight scenes in Xena and Hercules so if you've watched them and enjoyed the fight scenes you'll love this movie.<br/><br/>Well done to all those involved. I cannot wait until Spider-Man 2 hits our screens."

","When first presented with the idea of going to see ""Spider-man,"" I was more than a little leery.  After the plague of Comic Book Heroes Turned Movie Heroes movies over the years, I was expecting nothing less than a depthless action movie flooded with the usual stream of implausible villains, hopelessly-doting females, and muscled heroes spewing out witty one-liners that only draw us more into the realms of the unreal.<br/><br/>What I found myself faced with, however, was nothing less than one of the most excellent, engaging, and entertaining movies I've seen over the last few years.  There are, naturally, certain aspects of ""Spider-man"" that may be seen as slightly unrealistic.  For example, the movie is riddled with coincidences and events that make the viewer say, ""Hm, well, it's a small world, isn't it?""  Additionally, certain aspects of the plot are extremely predictable, not to mention that it's fairly obvious when the images of Spider-man are computer-generated.<br/><br/>Yet, despite all this, and despite the fact that the outfit of the Green Goblin is vaguely comical, ""Spider-man"" is an amazing work of art, which appeases so many movie-going needs that it seems to fall into the stereotypical ""something for everyone"" category.  Even being able to recognize the movie's flaws did not detract at all from thoroughly enjoying it, and I must say that I left the theater with the desire to go stalking through the streets in search of someone in need of rescuing.<br/><br/>As for the wary parent, there is some minimal swearing, a moderate amount of violence, and death.  There is also a scene where young Mary Jane's lack of frontal support is made obvious by an unfortunate rain storm, but aside from that and a great deal of muscle in spandex, there is no nudity, and certainly nothing even bordering on lewd.  As someone else mentioned, young children may find that Green Goblin frightening, but most likely not so frightening that it would taint their movie-going experience."

He was a perfect choice to do this movie, like Tim Burton was the only director who could do Batman justice. Hopefully, Raimi will become part of Hollywood's first league now. It's just so cool that he started with splatter movies and now knocks-out Star Wars!

","This movie was very well done, as to be expected from a director like Sam Raimi. The plot of the film stuck fairly well to the established Spiderman story, while adding in a few necessary and worthwhile details. Most notably the engrained web-slinger. The self-discovery made by Parker to introduce the slinger was certainly worth the change from the original story. The casting for this film was overall excellent. Each actor did a superb job of portraying his/her character and came off genuinely believable. The Goblin character was truly wonderful. Dafoe does a beautiful job of separating Osborn from the Goblin, and then bringing it all together in the end. Of course Maguire is a perfect Parker, combining the physicality of the role with the emotional aspect necessary for the inside of Peter's life. The special effects were very well integrated, taking the approach of enhancing the film not saving it. There were points when you couldn't tell where the real world stopped and the computers began. One of the greatest parts of the film was the sound-track. Once again, Elfman delivers a perfectly suited superhero theme to tie the film together. The symphonic overtones combined with the choral background give a felling not dissimilar to that of Batman, yet are in a league of their own. They really shape the felling of the film and give it an edge from the very start of the opening titles. Overall I would give this film an eight out of ten, very well done."

","This year, ""Spider-Man"" became an unexpected contender in the summer movie race.  I'd say it may not have completely lived up to the hype that was built up for it, but it does deserve the success it's getting.  The visual effects are impressive, showing breathtaking acrobatics you'd swear were done by a real human!  One thing I appreciate about ""Spider-Man"" is that it's not too campy.  That's a factor that can happen often with comic book superhero movies (i.e., ""Batman and Robin"").  Tobey Maguire plays his role well, not only as Spider-Man, but as Peter Parker, insecure high school victim.  And Kirsten Dunst was well cast as Mary Jane Watson, with her girl-next-door looks.  Many comic book purists will scoff at the little liberties taken with the original comic book, such as the organic web spinners and the genetically-enhanced spider, rather than having it be radioactive. (Doesn't quite fit in with the lyric ""Is he strong?  Listen, bud/He's got radioactive blood,"" does it?) But then, these people probably also had similar complaints about ""Batman"" and ""X-Men.""  But it's undeniable that comic books, long dismissed as immature, are becoming more and more accepted in American culture.  And comics-adapted movies like ""Spider-Man"" are helping contribute to that."

Kirsten Dunst however was a major dissapointment for me, normally I think she is fantastic but she just didn't seem to be able to pull off her part and the scenes where she storms out of her house crying were just pitiful. James Franco was boring; besides being incredibly hot he did nothing, he never changed his expression or voice...EVER! He too is normally good (The James Dean movie is awesome!)but he just wasn't there. On a good note the way Spiderman swings through the buildings and the positions he poses in on the wall or while landing were very true to the original comic book drawings which I thought was nice.

","For a comic book adaptation, ""Spider-Man"" certainly isn't a bad movie. The acting is good, the special effects are mostly excellent except for the extremely fake Green Goblin suit, and the whole thing stays very faithful to the comic (as far as I know, I haven't read too many of them). But it's also a very predictable movie. In fact, it's one of the most predictable movies I've ever seen: everything happens exactly the way I expected it would , including the compulsory romance story, which, although not as bad as the one found in ""Star Wars: Episode 2"", is still not very interesting.<br/><br/>
On the plus side, the fight scenes are often spectacular (owing a lot to ""the Matrix"", but hey, which other contemporary action film doesn't ?), and there are plenty of good jokes to laugh about. <br/><br/>But overall, I really don't understand what's so special about this movie, why it broke all the records and why it's still in the IMDB 250. My guess is that it will probably drop out of it as soon as this flick gets released on DVD/Video. <br/><br/>Entertaining and good looking movie with good action, but way too predictable.<br/><br/>**1/2 out of **** stars"

","""You think you know?""  Nobody can be ready for this special effects thrill ride.  ""Spider-Man"" while mostly computerized, is a must see movie that ranks high with other movies such as ""Batman"" and ""X-Men"".  It tells the story everyone has heard before about a teenager named Peter Parker who gets bitten by a radioactive spider and obtains spider-like powers.  But the audience also gets a glimpse into why Spider-Man decides to fight evil.  In other words, Peter Parker doesn't just wake up one day and say, ""I wanna put on a spandex suit and fight bad guys"".  The movie provides a perfect background for the people who didn't read Spider-Man comic books.<br/><br/>As far as acting goes the casting director should give himself a pat on the back.  Tobey Maguire, while 27, pulls off a high school senior very well. He is the perfect selection for the shy, kinda nerdy, Peter Parker.  He is able to have perfect manners and still be as cool as a superhero.  Willem Defoe also gives an awesome performance as the green goblin.  He has a smirk that can give someone nightmares.  He is truly convincing as the bad guy. At the beginning of the movie Peter Parker is narrating and he says,""This like every story is about a girl"".

","Not too bad for a throwaway summer flick.  Tobey and Kirsten fan their romantic flames in classic fashion, delaying and denying their PG-13 attractions to each other as long as possible, even until the inevitable sequels.  Dafoe is remarkably adept in his way-over-the-top out-for-blood-though-tortured villain.  And the action-packed special effects are marvelously stunning, overcoming their cartoonish shortcomings (SpiderMan's jumps remind me of the Mario Brother's Nintendo games) by turning up the violence (when a madman drops a bomb, oh yes, innocents do die).  But the real star is the script, expertly weaving campy dialogue with clever self-deprecating humor (SpiderMan's world wrestling debut was far and away the highlight of the film).

"Duck_of_Death23","10","0","0","3 June 2002"," One of the grandest movie experiences in my life.
","As an avid fan of the comic book super-hero ""Spider-Man"", I found myself disappointed watching the trailer during the theatrical showing of The Lord of the Rings. To me, Spider-Man appeared to be corny and hokey, along with cheesy visual effects and ridiculous costumes such as The Green Goblin. To me, awaiting the film as long as I had, the pain was too large to bear. I had been waiting since 1992, when James Cameron announced his screenplay. Since than, I myself have been patiently waiting and hoping for a good Spider-Man movie. But when I saw the trailer in December, I felt slightly cheated... ...Than fast forward to May 3rd. I went to the movies with my friends to see ""Deuces Wild"". But, one of my friends misinterpreted our intentions to see Deuces, so he went in to see the titled, ""Movie of the summer"": Spider-Man. To be honest, I didn't want to see Deuces Wild, at least not with the missing eight dollars from my wallet. To me, Deuces Wild was a ""Wait-for-video-movie"" if you know what I mean. With this, I felt bad and didn't want him to go in the theater all by his self, so I quickly exchanged my ticket and got a seat to see it with him. I was going to see it the next day with my mother, but I guess I couldn't wait that long. So, I saw Spider-Man and left the theater with a love for a movie I didn't know that I could ever have.<br/><br/>To me, this was the best super-hero movie I had ever seen. It's story was so compelling that when Peter Parker donned his spandex costume, it seems not only irrelevant, but unnecessary. This movie was so attentive that it followed and loved it's characters, not berating and using their misery to feed the mindless cliche-filled plot. The movie cared about what they were and who they were to become. Unlike every other comic book based movie I've ever seen, this one didn't use the characters to simply feed the story itself. Spider-Man's story was the characters.  <br/><br/>Without doubt, this has to be the classic comic book movie brought to life for all time. As far as comic books translated to film are concerned, Spider-Man is and always will be, ""THE DEFINITIVE COMIC BOOK PICTURE OF ALL TIME!!! Even though many didn't like the visual effects and saw them as the films fatal flaw, I LOVED THEM. First of all, it's a motif to the graphic novels. It isn't meant to be realistic. A comic books reality is it's own little world and it would only be fair to include some aspect of that comic into the film. The human side was convincing and realistic. It pulled it off and hit the nail on the head better than a lot of Oscar winning movies even. One of the central themes that runs through the film is about teenagers and their inabilities to express their true feelings to one another. Films like American Beauty fail to explore this degree of emotions simply because the synopsis focuses on the proverbial dark side of these situations. Comics, on the other hand, are an ""Expedient exaggeration"" of the real life world we live in. A satire if you will. Come on! How many maniac criminals would dress up in a green metallic suit and a dinosaur mask with ""pumpkin bombs"" and a futuristic one-man glider with super-sonic jet speed in real life?<br/><br/>I left the theater gleeful, fulfilled and waiting to see it again the next day with my mother."

","9/10 stars (includes what could be construed as minor spoilers - but I'll tell ya when)<br/><br/>""Spider-Man"" is one of the all-time greatest action-adventure movies. It delivers in all departments a good summer blockbuster should: thrills, laughs, tears, jolts, shivers, you name it. ""Spider-Man"" delivers. Definitely one of the best cinematic thrill-rides ever.<br/><br/>When I first learned the principle cast (Maguire, Dafoe, Dunst), I did not see any of them fitting their roles at all. I thought Maguire too whimpy, and I thought Dafoe would ham his role up too much. Well, Dunst was good enough to please me, though she isn't the best choice for MJ. But Maguire and Dafoe were perfect. Two of the best performances ever in this kind of movie, and great performances by any genre standard. Nobody else could play the title role; Tobey Maguire IS Spider-Man! His whimpy-ness actually enhanced his performance. And Dafoe had to be a little hammy to pull off that outrageous costume and personality, but he did so without becoming annoying. He was hammy when necessary but sadistic and despicable when necessary too.<br/><br/>Pacing was flawless, and direction was close to it.  The music was excellent, if not reminiscent of Elfman's other great superhero score for the 1989 ""Batman.""  The special effects were better than expected, and the action was exceptionally choreographed.<br/><br/>I allowed for suspending disbelief on some issues and let the usual corny comic-book hero-villain banter pass. After all, this is a comic-book movie. And actually, every frame looks like a comic book frame, an amazing achievement in directing. And the script is superior to other comic-book movies.<br/><br/>The only other comic book movies that are comparatively excellent are 1990's ""Dick Tracy"" and 1991's ""The Rocketeer.""  ""X-Men"" another great Marvel movie, comes excruciatingly close. And ""Batman"" (1989) will always be a comic-book movie classic, even if it is overly violent. (The rest of the ""Batman"" movies are..y'know what, I won't even get started on those abominations.)<br/><br/>(OK, though not real spoilers, you may wanna skip this paragraph) I gave a 9 only because a 10 seems like a flawless score. 9 seems about equal to a four-star rating though. Only 3 real flaws I saw: the CGI is REALLY obvious at one or two parts; the dialogue gets overly corny at one or two parts (the New Yorkers on the bridge, for instance?); and MJ's little (little?) speech at the end sounds like a script reading. But these are minor flaws in an otherwise perfect film.<br/><br/>Thank you, thank you, thank you Sam Raimi and friends, you've strengthened my faith that, yes, truly great effects movies do exist, and you've done better than I dreamed. And I'm an even bigger Spidey fan now.<br/><br/>Give us ""Spider-Man 2"" PLEASE!!!!!"

Seldom has a contemporary film dared to present such a blatantly retro-Hollywood misogynist worldview, with its musclebound, power-obsessed male protagonists demonstrating only the most primitive interests in the only two female characters, a deferential old lady (ROSEMARY HARRIS???? isn't this a little like casting Laurence Olivier as Grandpa Walton?) who mainly exists to serve food and a young woman (Kirsten Dunst, augmented breasts jutting awkwardly from anorectic ribcage) whose purpose is to totter on high heels between encounters with males bent on raping/murdering/courting/protecting her. Watching pretty Toby Macguire ecstatically shooting through the air on threads of spermlike ""silk"" and stolidly rejecting the woman he ""loves"" because he has more important things to do than actually stick around and have a relationship with her--like zipping around in the night chasing other muscular fellows in tight suits with his sperm-thrower--tells you all you need to know about subtext here.

Then there are the things that are on-par and noticeably fine, do the right things, and are necessary to the story.  Things such as Peter designing his costume, could certainly have been better, but weren't bad.

The space-cam techniques are incredible and deserve all the recognition they've gotten so far.

William Defoe is especially good when around the other principles, acting as a normal citizen, but the Goblin...I'm not so sure.  The laugh is good, the original intentions for his evil are very well done, and him talking to himself to show the insane side of himself are ok, but there are definitely several things very wrong with this villain.  The fact that he's insane is one, you question whether he should be killed or put in a hospital.  His mask and dialogue to match the mask are another, they are quite lame, which I would say is all you can expect, but the Joker from Batman proves otherwise.  Also, he gets his revenge early, and has really no evil scheme or idea after that, it's just sort of pointless.  Kirsten Dunst made me smile throughout the entire thing, and believe it or not, get rather emotional at the end, her presence is enough to light up the screen but she goes the extra mile to win the entire audience. Danny Elfman's score is great, with a solid theme and the most adreneline rushing sequences of music to match with the untouchable action.

","More than anything else the success of Spider-man reflects the astute marketing strategy of its promoters. Relentless advertising and appropriate timing generated a huge wave of expectation that was sadly not fulfilled when one actually saw the film in the theatre. The best thing about the film was the casting of Tobey Maguire as Spider-man. Unfortunately the best parts of the film were those scenes that featured Maguire as Peter Parker without his super hero costume. Therefore the casting success of the superhero was somewhat neutralized by the fact that the actor (or the stunt double) spent most of the film under his costume. Detracting enormously from the movie was the feeling that the producers were constantly testing the waters for a possible sequel. Hence a thin story line already considerably pared down due to the necessity of including as many improbable stunts as possible, was weakened further by positing complex inter relationships among the main characters, which when realized on the screen appeared rather unconvincing.

The wrestling match, crook at the elevator and Uncle Ben's death were all incredibly condensed together.

Aunt May and J. Jonah Jameson had both been terrorized by villians, so naturally they were each attacked by the Goblin, staying true to the comic books in that regard. Major kudos to the man, J. K. Simmons, for his depiction of J. JOnah Jameson. Peter Parker became Spiderman in high school, so I had no problem with him being young again.

","Spiderman has always been one of the most compelling superheroes because of his basic normalcy and goodness. Sam Raimi does a great job of letting the audience know who Peter Parker is and why he does what he does. It is far less of a psychological stretch than the Bruce Wayne/Batman alter-ego. Speaking on the ""Dark Knight"", I would rate this film on par with the first ""Batman"" movie. It had decent performances all around, although I didn't feel anyone reached the level of Jack Nicholson's ""Joker"". Dafoe gives it a shot. Cliff Robertson lends a touch of class to the proceedings. Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast as Peter Parker, he starts out as a good-hearted but nerdy teenager and becomes more and more confident and has a lot of fun with his super-powers.I don't know if the ""Green Goblin"" was the best choice of villain but it works well for Spidey to have a nemesis that challenges him intellectually and well and physically. We mustn't forget that Peter is highly intelligent and I think a disservice was done by not letting him develop his own we-shooters. Still the movie was fun and should dominate the box-office this weekend."

","There has never been a better movie based on a comic book, I must say. Sam Raimi and his cast have perfectly captured the spirit and movements of Spider-Man. If you're a big fan of Raimi or Marvel comics look for the cameo appearances by Ted Raimi, Bruce Campbell and Stan ""The Man"" Lee. Tobey Maguire has proven to me that he is more than just a drama kind of guy, as he was excellent in this sci-fi/action/drama. Kirsten Dunst was better than I thought she would be as Mary Jane, and Willem Dafoe is probably the greatest villain actor in Hollywood. GO SEE SPIDER-MAN!!!"

","This movie starts out great but loses a lot of steam as it changes from a superhero action flick to a soap opera melodrama.  The scenes where Spidey kicks butt are great; the special effects are everything that you'd expect as well.  The excessive love triangle, romance thing, drag what would have a great movie down in the dirt.  James Cameron wanted a shot at this movie after shooting ""Titanic.""  And that's a bloody shame when you consider what he did with ""Aliens."" (The sequel to ""Alien"")  For whatever reason, things didn't work out with the folks at Marvel.  My guess is that Stan Lee wanted the movie to play like the comic series, frame by frame.  The problem is that even as a kid reading Spiderman comics I would skip over the frames dwelling on Aunt May and get to the good stuff.  Sure, you need some character development; but not to the point where you go to sleep!  My 6 year-old son wanted to see this movie so bad.  He couldn't keep his eyes open wide enough during the beginning.  The second hour (when the movie became ""The Mary Jane Story."") he asked me loudly, ""Is it almost over?"" Several people in the audience laughed.  He actually stole the spotlight from Kirsten Dunst (which is nothing to brag about.)  Message to Stan Lee: Reconsider letting Cameron script and direct!!!"

","I had waited for the Spider-Man movie for a good two years before I saw it opening night, but I had lowered my expectations before coming into the film. Man, I shouldn't have done that. The movie had exceeded my excitement and was well worth the two year wait that I endured.  The action was great- how they managed to intersplice computer animation with real life action in some scenes baffled me and the acting was superb (Willem Dafoe's scene at his home in front of the mirror was absolutely incredible). Is the movie for everyone?  Probably not, it was a little more ""cartoony"" than something like x-men or the matrix.  But if you're into the sort of thing that the movie Spider-Man stands for, then you can't go wrong and you'll be hard-pressed to find a better movie."

","Rarely does a film get so much publicity, so much hype, and you walk out of it actually surprised by how good it was. Let me tell you, Spiderman might be one of the few blockbusters that is actually a blockbuster. Spiderman is a classic story and for once in a great while, the film version did the classic story justice. There were two things I said when I left this film: ""The worst thing about this movie is that I am just a regular guy with no superpowers."" and ""The best thing about this movie is that I am 20 years old and can still enjoy it like I am 7."" Some might complain that there is some cheesy dialogue, and there is, but you have to remember that this is a comic book on screen, and the dialogue is exactly how it is in a comic book. I think the most pleasant surprise is just how much Tobey Maguire convinced me that he was Spiderman. I know he was a good actor, but I thought he was too dweeby to be an action star. Well he works wonders as this part and deserves all the fame this film will yield for him. Willem Dafoe...simply outstanding. If you're not into fun, fantasy, adventure, don't see Spiderman. If you are a person who complains at every visible CGI animation, don't see Spiderman. If you want to be taken into a dreamlike, fantasy, adventurous world of superheroes, where you will be swept up and surrounded by all of its excitement and passion, then please, for your own sake, SEE SPIDERMAN!!<br/><br/>9 out of 10."

That, and the, ohh, about a THOUSAND hints they dropped at the end that we should expect more to come. Tobey Maquire is wonderful as Peter/Spidey, showing the heart behind the hero and keeping the sadness and weight right there with the fun. Kirsten Dunst, while not my favorite actress, was wonderful, and the chemistry between the two was believable and one of the best parts of the movie. Willem Defoe was AMAZING as Normon/Goblin, especially in his...well, I'm not going to give away anything... The movie moved when it needed to and let you breath when you needed to.

"FilmFan2001","9","0","0","1 May 2002"," Seconded. It does indeed ""rock""...
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** First of all, I suppose I ought to say that from the age of about ten until around six years ago when I finally stopped reading the comics, I was a huge Spider-man fan. I suppose, deep down, I still am, though I hated what they ended up doing to the comics (the clones) and that's when I stopped reading. So, it's fair to say that I was extremely excited about this and that my inner twelve-year-old had been waiting his whole life to see it.<br/><br/>
So. From the perspective of a serious fan, and one with absurdly high expectations, I absolutely loved it. They got everything right - cast, effects, plot, atmosphere. *Everything*. Furthermore, I think the changes they made (organic web-shooters, Green Goblin's costume) were the right decisions to make, since the original Goblin costume would have looked utterly ridiculous and been impossible to get right.<br/><br/>More good news - the original theme tune from the 1970s cartoon features on the end credits. It's worth sticking around for - I had a ridiculously silly grin plastered on my face afterwards.<br/><br/>Basically, the plot takes perhaps the two most famous Spiderman stories (his origin and The Death of Gwen Stacey) and mixes them together, only with an appropriate time period between them, allowing Peter to both graduate from high school and move to New York.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br/><br/>*Comic geek alert! - Feel free to skip this bit.*<br/><br/>(In the original comics, the most famous story involves the Green Goblin discovering Peter's secret identity and then using his gorgeous blonde girlfriend Gwen Stacey to get at him. He throws her off the Brooklyn Bridge, Spiderman catches her with a web-line but the fall breaks her neck anyway. Spiderman is furious with rage and almost kills the Goblin, who is then killed by a trap he has set for Spiderman. In the comics, it's only after Gwen has died that Peter eventually gets together with Mary-Jane. Anyway, the film substitutes Mary-Jane for Gwen for obvious reasons, but there are a lot of similarities otherwise, which will be a real treat if you ever read those comics).<br/><br/>DEFINITE SPOILERS<br/><br/>As I said, the best thing about this is that they get everything right. All the familiar characters are there, including Flash Thompson and Harry Osborn (James Franco from Freaks & Geeks!). There are also appearances from un-named characters such as Betty Brant and Robbie Robertson - more treats for fans, I suspect. There's even a name-check for 'Dr. Connors' (aka The Lizard), who'd be a good bet for one of the sequels, as Spiderman's best foes always have some sort of close connection to him.<br/><br/>
The set-pieces are terrific. They include: Peter discovering his Spidey-powers (no 'wakes up having 'webbed' himself scene, sadly); beating up Flash Thompson ( Yeah! ); the wrestling match (""The Human Spider!""); chasing the thief; the first attack by the Goblin; the frankly jaw-dropping bridge sequence and the -as promised- extremely violent fight at the end. (It's very very violent for a 12 - yet another example of them not copping out).<br/><br/>Raimi was the perfect choice for this - it's comic-book-ish but in the way it should be. It never takes itself too seriously, but it never dumbs it down or winks at the audience either. And, it has to be said, the effects that count (web-shooting, web-swinging, wall-crawling) are amazing. Okay, so some of the CGI Goblin stuff is a bit disappointing and some of the 'jumping' scenes are over-CGI'd (if that's a phrase) but overall it works beautifully. Raimi also pulls off some excellent 'shock-moments' that work really well.<br/><br/>The cast are terrific. Maguire is perfect, as is Dunst. And that rain scene...wow. When it started raining, the men in the audience all suddenly sat up to pay close attention. Let's just say, this movie will be HUGE on DVD...<br/><br/>Minor criticisms? Well, for one, J.Jonah Jameson isn't in it enough. He's fabulous in the scenes he's in, but then pretty much disappears. Hopefully they'll do the Scorpion in the future and then he'll have a bigger part. Secondly, as much as I loved Danny Elfman's score, it wasn't memorable in the way that his Batman score was - I'd forgotten it before I even got out of the cinema. Thirdly, it's not quite as funny as it should be (particularly in terms of Spiderman's trademark wise-cracks), though there's lots of humour in the first half. Having said that, though, given the tone of the second half, it was probably the right decision. Anyway, these are really minor criticisms, given the film overall.<br/><br/>One more thing. The ending doesn't cop out and is decidedly unexpected, but definitely the right decision. Congratulations to whoever fought (and won) that particular battle.<br/><br/>(Incidentally, see it in the best sound-equipped cinema possible - the sound in one scene in particular was amazing).<br/><br/>SPOILERS END<br/><br/>So, in short, the effects are spectacular , the cast is amazing , it's extremely dark in tone and it doesn't cop out at the end. I'm unashamedly putting this straight into my Top Ten of the Year.<br/><br/>Having said all that, I feel duty-bound to confess that not that many other people seemed to like it - I heard a lot of disappointed opinions on the way out of the cinema. So...it definitely won't be for everyone. But I bloody loved it. So there."

Then, they will create web-swinging on the big screen--but you get into that gently, and i have to say the red and blue spider is a totally cool arachnid, its bite didn't look THAT bad--hey reality is just a sticky hair's breadth from the world of major fantasy mayhem. Can't say it all at once, it's too overpowering.  But will note that Willem Dafoe lit up like i didn't think he could.  And Toby McG. shot off bolts of personal energy like i didn't think he could.

","I was anxiously waiting for this movie. The ""buzz"" seemed to be awesome, but apparently they didn't allow screenings very far in advance. (Ebert and Roeper won't do their TV reviews until opening weekend) This usually does not bode well. Very likely, it was to be full of gosh-wow FX but nothing much in the way of a script.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed. All the characters were just right and the actors wonderfully chosen. Some liberties were taken with the original stories to make it into a movie. Mary Jane Watson becomes the girl next door that Peter Parker has had a thing for since he was six. (In the comic, he doesn't meet MJ until after he's been Spidey awhile and had a short-lived relationship with J Jonah Jameson's secretary Betty Brant). The bit with having the webbing come out of him instead of being a brilliant off the top of his head invention was neat. It sped up the plot and set up some amusing scenes as he tried to learn how to use this ability.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman's music is, as always, a great counterpoint to the super-heroics.<br/><br/>As far as younger kids are concerned, there's no sex or bad language, but lots of action {read: violence) and the Green Goblin may be a bit scary.<br/><br/>Cool stuff.

","Wow!  Best comic book adaptation to date.  The moviemakers clearly took the characters seriously, understanding that Spider-Man is not a campy character, but a young man paying for his own irresponsibility.  Spider-man owes more to ancient Greek tragedy than to comic book tradition.  He owes more to Hamlet than to Superman.  Tobey Maguire delivered the character to the screen as I knew he would.  When he was cast, there were so many who naysayed him because they didn't understand Spider-Man.  Those of us who did were relieved.  There isn't another actor who could have done it.  The cast was perfect, especially Dafoe who may be the first actor to treat a supervillain role seriously.  While I like Hackman and Nicholson as actors, they weren't acting as Luthor and the Joker.  They were hamming.  There is a difference.  Dafoe treated the material with respect and gave the Goblin dimension and force.  Thanks to Koepp, Raimi, and everyone else involved with the movie.  I've loved this character for 30 years.  Just because a story is told with sequential art doesn't make it campy.  Thanks to Raimi for realizing that and loving this story.  It shows.  Wow!"
"mikepwong","8","0","0","4 May 2002"," Amazing movie from a comic book
","I was afraid that Spider-Man was going to be disappointing like The X-Men movie which I found to be more form than substance and lacking lighter moments. After seeing Spider-Man yesterday, I am glad to say that it was far better than I expected. Except for the corny lines in some scenes and the Green Goblin's armour, the movie is spectacular. I am undecided on the biological web shooters. When I first heard about them, I didn't think it was a good idea, but after seeing it in the movie, the idea works well.<br/><br/>Besides the Goblin armour which many viewers will like but I did not and the biological web shooters, Spider-Man follows the comic book very closely. More so than any other comic book brought to the big screen. Fans of the comic book will appreciate Director Sam Raimi's efforts, we should all be happy that he'll be directing the second Spider-Man movie as well.<br/><br/>
The lead actors Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, and Kirsten Dunst were very good. Dafoe is an excellent choice for the Green Goblin. Maguire and Dunst are not exactly what fans picture for Peter Parker and Mary-Jane Watson but few fans will complain.<br/><br/>The actor who plays J. Jonah Jameson looked extremely familiar to me, but I could not figure out who it was, so I had to look it up here on the IMDb. Jameson is played by the actor J.K. Simmons, who plays Vern Schillinger in the prison drama OZ. He is also a recurring character on the Law & Order shows playing Dr. Emil Skoda.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is a wonderful light action movie and is a treat to all Spider-Man fans. I rated this movie a strong 8 out of 10."
"poe426","6","0","0","4 May 2002"," A mixed bag...
","***SPOILERS*** While it's more or less faithful to its source material, Sam Raimi's Big Screen treatment of SPIDER-MAN often teeters on the verge of outright idiocy. How, for instance, could Peter Parker drag a lunch tray around a high school cafeteria, in front of scores of witnesses, with webbing shot from his wrists... and not be found out??? These lapses in logic (which occur throughout the film) work against the powerful, poignant moments that give the movie its emotional resonance. Nor does it help that the movie often drags laboriously along like Raimi's infamous FOR LOVE OF THE GAME. The fx vacillate between real-life believability and video game cheesiness of the LORD OF THE RINGS variety. On the plus side, there are the performances and a sometimes beautifully moving script and superb cinematography and sets and music and touches of directorial brilliance (as with DARKMAN and much else he's done, Raimi distinguishes himself here as a very capable filmmaker when it comes to fx-heavy material). SPIDER-MAN is a mixed bag, to be sure, but it's definitely worth the price of admission."

","Dear Mr. Raimi,<br/><br/>You hack.  You won me over with the Evil Dead films, showed true promise with ""For Love of the Game,"" and showed a true director's gift with ""A Simple Plan.""  What the hell happened?<br/><br/>Mostly, I suppose we can blame the script.  David Koepp has never had a fond place in my heart, and yes, while he did write the very good ""Panic Room,"" the script itself was just okay, it was the director that made that movie. Ditto for ""Jurassic Park,"" and anyone who says differently needs to go back and watch that flick again.  For the second Jurassic Park alone, Mr. Koepp should be run out of town on a rail.<br/><br/>Was it the studio pressure?  I can sure see how it got to Mr. Burton on that ridiculous ""Planet of the Apes"" remake.  Notice, now that the film is all done, and surely making the studio lots of money (all they really care about anyway, so anything said after Opening Day is incidental, right?  WRONG!)... notice how you wimped out, and screwed up a wonderful opportunity:<br/><br/>Peter Parker gets cool spider powers.  Neat-o.  His skin allows him to cling to walls, tiny little hairs that let him stick to metal, paper, brick, what have you.  Ahhhh, yes, but then, now he's wearing a suit.  With gloves.  How can he still do this?<br/><br/>Ohhh, wait a minute, is the argument.  You're nitpicking, Mr. Internet Guy, OBVIOUSLY it's very thin material.<br/><br/>Well, yes, I get that.  I'm not stupid.  Why, then, did you feel the need to not explain that, but then show the flashback of the mugger running past Peter Parker?  Did we forget?  That scene happened TWO MINUTES BEFORE.  Wow, Mr. Raimi, seriously.  Either respect your audience's intelligence, or don't, but riding the fence in such an wimp-out way is only going to get you in trouble.  See also, again, ""Planet of the Apes"" remake.<br/><br/>Lots of nice moments.  Cinematographer Don Burgess still lacks the visual ""wow"" that will ever make him great, so people must hire him because he's cheap; whatever.  Everyone ELSE knew what they were doing here, except Willem Dafoe, who should really go back to drama.  But I can't blame you for casting him; after all, look at what he did for ""Speed 2.""<br/><br/>A valiant effort, Mr. Raimi, and I hope these notes will help you when it comes time to put the sequel together.  Special effects are there to HELP the story, not BE the story.  I'm all happy that Peter Parker is enjoying jumping from buildings, but don't you ever EVER replace a character with a CGI effect.  It didn't work in Harry Potter, it didn't work in Blade 2, it sure didn't work for JarJar, and so it doesn't work here.  If I were a movie executive, I would so fire you.<br/><br/>However, being literate, I am too intelligent to be a movie executive.  You, Mr. Raimi, used to be smart, I suggest you call up your old buddies the Coens and have a long talk before you make any more rash decisions, like script choices, opening credits (I may care about the names of the cast, but 95% of America does not), or that horrible, awful, direct-to-bargain-bin soundtrack (not the score, mind you; but promise me to never hire Aerosmith or flavor-of-the-month Nickelback again, I don't care how many records they sell).<br/><br/>I liked it, but seriously.

I knew it wouldn't be so hot, but with a film this big, you've got to see it or you're out of the loop for the month it's soup du jour. Mainly, the screenplay fell completely flat, suffering from the exact same trevails as Koepp's ""Panic Room"" (not real long-running plot, simple little scenes with no development, concepts, ideas, and ""important facts"" are mentioned then never dealt with again, no rise/fall in tension overall, and the horrendous ""sense of humor"" that is basically just a facade for his own knowledge of how bad his writing is by making fun of himself, the movie, and the dialogue while it's happening). Raimi's magical visual style is cluttered by the video-game special effects, which start in the very beginning with one of the most amateur looking credit sequences (stolen nicely basically from ""X-Men,"" much like most of the rest of the movie, be it the ""Batman"" score, the ""Batman Returns"" end fight scene, and numerous homages to ""Superman,"" enough to the point that one wonders how much was a joke and how much was them just saving their own ass) I've seen since, well, again, ""Panic Room."" The acting bordered on just plain awful for pretty much everyone, but it was so difficult to tell what was supposed to be ""funny"" because of how melodramatic everything was or what was just not done correctly. In the end, a huge mess with a frustrating feel. Even the action sequences and entertaining moments weren't so entertaining. Raimi should stick to his two forte's: slow character pieces or parodying action-adventures (which, this could have been had there been a better screenplay) and Koepp needs to go teach a ""how to write a formulaic, basic, and easily sellable screenplay"" class in film school."

I felt that Spidey's live-action movie was a more successful transfer than the 2000 film ""X-Men"".  It can balance its characters, and give them all equal screen time.  Its heart is also in the right place.

I saw the X-men movie, and liked it.  During the trailers to Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, I was awe struck at the teaser trailer for this movie, basically I have waited for this movie since July 14th (July 14th 2001 to May 3rd 2002, you do the math). <br/><br/>It was weeeeeell worth the wait(a few hours before I wrote this review) I have seen the greatest superhero movie ever. Not only did this movie make you love the characters and love their comic book-esque story, but it made you feel like what it must be like to be Spiderman. Every punch that was given rocked in my gut, every web that was swung on made me feel like I was on a rollercoaster. The special effects (flawed only to those with pecimistic hawk eyes) were glorious, the actors were wonderful. Tobey McGwire is the perfect Peter Parker, Willam Defoe is the perfect Green Goblin. And Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, WHOA! she's worth the price of admission all by herself (Mrs. Dunst, stay a redhead, it really, REALLY suits you). My only compliant with the film is that there were no scenes showing how either Spiderman or the Green Goblin made their suits.<br/><br/>And with that said my glum look for the 2002 movie season has been shot down by Spiderman, a definate must see for anybody who has a comic book fan in them!"

","This wasn't a bad flick by any means.  Lots of action, and special effects (many of the f/x was ""fakey"" but I was willing to let it go, because it was probably the best they could do with current technology.)  The film had relatively good pacing and the writing stayed true to the original Spiderman ""mythology"".  However, the film doesn't do too good of a job of detailing relationships very well.  Peter Parker and Mary Janes relationship feels artificial, as well as the friendship between Harry Osbourne and Peter Parker.  The ""romantic"" scenes between MacGuire and Dunst were also VERY, VERY cheesy.  The scene in the hospital where Tobey kind of expresses his feelings for Mary Jane was bordering on ""groan-out-loud"" bullpuckey, as was MacGuire's final monologue at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Another major problem I had was with Spiderman's personality.  I've never been a big fan of Spiderman comics, but the one thing I liked about the character of Spiderman was that he was a joker -- a wiseass.  He would always make funny observations or pointed insults whenever he was fighting a villain, and that made him human.  MacGuire plays him too straight, and in the end, Spiderman feels boring.  He actually is TOO geeky for the role. Yeah, Peter Parker is supposed to be a nerd, but he also had a sparkling personality, and I think that was lost in this film.<br/><br/>In any event, the film was exciting.  I was never bored.   I would have liked to see Spidey more crime-fighting, instead of the ""montage"" of him thwarting petty burglars, but it felt ""empty"".  It didn't feel like Spiderman really did much for the city (unlike, say Superman or Batman did in their respective movies.)

Don?t they know the song ?Is he strong? Listen Bud, he?s got radioactive blood!? There are a few other things I take issue with but all in all I thought it captured most of the experience nicely. I was worried that Spidey and the Goblin would not display any real signs of super strength like on every cartoon version of Spider-Man ever made where he seems to be significantly weaker than he is in the comics. Instead their battles were some of the best super human fights since ?Superman 2?. Anyway here?s my prediction for Spider-Man 2 or 3? Believing audiences won?t want to see the Green Goblin twice they are going to make Harry become Hobgoblin which would be stupid. Hopefully they won?t do this but instead they will do a mystery in which the audience thinks Harry is the Hobgoblin and then it turns out he isn?t and Hobgoblin is really Ned Leeds, or Jason Macandale or that other guy that he ended up being? that?s what they should do but they won?t? Harry will be Hobgoblin? you read it here first. Anyway despite my irrelevant predictions and stupid complaints it was still the greatest Marvel movie every made unless you count Eddie Murphy?s ?Coming to America? which was clearly the story of the Black Panther. I also like the subtle references to Robot-Master and Johnny Quest. I think I also saw Stan Lee in a crowd scene though I?m not sure? I think this calls for a second viewing."

"tjw1973","9","0","0","3 May 2002"," Spider-Man is the best super hero ever
","I can't say enough great things about this movie.  Spider-Man is the greatest of all the Super hero movies.  It is a very human picture with many of the characters in a grey zone where they have great redeeming qualities and as well as inner demons.   The only character's immune are Peter's Aunt and Uncle, because they are the first glimpse of the super heroes conscience.  It is a much lighter picture than the Batman movies in that Peter Parker/Spiderman is not nearly as conflicted as Bruce Wayne and has had a family.  There is much genuine humor in the film that anyone can relate to because it is based on real human situations even if we are witnessing a superhero deal with them on screen in a fantasy world.  I'd say this is the movie of the summer (well almost..read further), and I'd give Toby McGuire an Oscar for his ability to carry this film on his shoulder. He is SPIDERMAN. I hope that the producers keep him through the sequels a la superman because after seeing this film, no one else could be spiderman. This film is my choice for 2nd best of the summer.  I can't give it first place because I'm a Star Wars fanatic, but if this was  a non Star Wars year it would be #1. 9 out of 10"

","A perfect movie and a great movie are not the same thing.  Meeting the standards of storytelling and adhering to structural guidelines reflects no more inspiration than does a flawed but heartfelt experiment.  But I didn't expect artistic genius as I attended the midnight showing of SPIDER-MAN last night.  That being said, I feel I should give the theatre proprietors more money.  For to have so much fun for a reasonable fee must surely be unfair. <br/><br/>
Charming?  Thrilling?  Take your pick.  Well written?  Splendidly crafted? Take those too.  While you're at it, throw in a couple of your own.  The story is sweet and the action is exciting.  The pace is exhilarating, the visuals striking and atmospheric.  I'll let somebody else comment on the effects because I don't know the technical language.  But they sure looked good to me.<br/><br/>The delightfully simple story flies through three chapters of Peter Parker's life as fast as his strangely acquired powers carry him from building to building.  Writer David Koepp wastes not a second in the transition from laughable geek to athlete of the year.  Century? <br/><br/>Once Peter gets the hang of his new talents and sets out to defend the innocent against their natural predators, things begin to move even faster. An unspoken love bursts from a lifelong restraint.  A super villain appears to challenge the dashing adventurer.  Koepp even manages to explore a few relationships, not easy in a slam-bang slugfest.  Peter and his surrogate parents; Peter and his would be paramour; and hero and bad-guy all make connections as we watch gleefully from aside.<br/><br/>As in most tales of this nature, the first act is by far the best part.  The introduction of the characters, the set-up of the plot and the establishment of conflict are bound to be more interesting than a lot of smashing and crashing.  To see this movie is to witness the best example of comic book table setting available.  <br/><br/>The action scenes are entertaining, such as they are.  It has been said that they happen too fast.  That Spidey's web swinging should be a notch slower so we can follow more successfully.  I deny neither the point nor that it occurred to me once or twice while viewing.  But nothing was ambiguous. Nothing was overlooked.  It was handled so much better than most offerings in this venue that I can't complain in good conscience.<br/><br/>Quirky Tobey Maguire is a natural fit as the misunderstood hero.  The rest of the players are equally well cast.  Sam Raimi's staging reveals not only skilled filmmaking but an admirable reverence for the materiel.  No other movie of this type has so efficiently captured the 1960's comic book flavor and format.<br/><br/>With the tragic events of last year forever stamped on the national consciousness, it is a little creepy to see New York City terrorized by the maniacal Green Goblin.  But that reservation is quickly alleviated by Raimi's respect for the situation.  Besides, what better time for a fantasy about a modern day knight in red and blue armor who protects us from all things evil?<br/><br/>Who am I?  Sure you want to know?"

","Spiderman: a true comic book hero brought alive. A movie that delivers the action but does not take itself too seriously while it's at it. Where cheesy love lines and predictable action sequences are enjoyable and awaited rather then shunned. One problem I have with many modern superhero movies is that they totally lose the idea of `kid entertainment brought to life' and instead try to pull off some sort of Matrix. This is one of the problems I found in X Men. It took itself excessively seriously. There was absolutely no hummer in the movie what so ever. Where humor was to be expected one found heavy drama. Spiderman, on the other hand, felt like a cartoon, just with real people. The fake look of the Green Goblin was amusing, as was the swing of the Spiderman from building to towering building. This is for those Spiderman fans out there, the new and the old, this is NOT for someone in love with Blade II; they would probably do better with The Scorpion King. Know who you are and do not complain about this movie if you not be caught dead watching the cartoon or reading the comics. The one comment I have is that it failed to explain what powers the Green Goblin had, other then that, the movie satisfied me perfectly. Wonderful acting."

","Well, after my two year wait for the release of this movie, I finally got my chance to see the final product. Although there was a bit of modernization of the original origin, that is consistent with the trend in comics. What was true was the plight of Peter Parker as a person upon whom herohood was unwittingly thrust. I would have cast MJ with a different actress, but Toby was Peter! The special effects were all that I expected and more. More than any previous attempt, I felt like an actual comic book saga had come to life. Kudos!

","Went to the movie with high expectations and the movie gave me what I wanted and more! The unfolding of the plot was somewhat true to the comic although it was very much watered down. Yet, this is expected since the comic was multi-faceted and it would be unreasonable to expect the scriptwriters to include every single sub-plot and detail. The adaptation was just apt.<br/><br/>
Getting Tobey Maguire to play the part of the unassuming dorky Peter Parker was a good choice. He was excellent in his acting. However, William Dafoe's talents were under-utilised. His great calibre in acting was not fully developed in the film since his facial expressions were not visible under the green goblin's mask. Yet, these two actors did a fantastic job! It was a pity that Kirsten Dunst with her talent played a somewhat minor role in the movie.<br/><br/>The visuals were eye candy with swift spidey swinging action!

"The_Wood","6","0","0","3 May 2002"," Disappointing start to a promising franchise 6/10
","The summer movie season officially starts.....with a THUD.<br/><br/>It seemed like a brilliant choice in picking director Sam Raimi to helm the long awaited Spider-Man, but after viewing the film it seems that he may have not been the right man for the job.  It's not that Spider-Man is a terrible film, it just seems like there was so much potential that was wasted.  The film is missing that frantic energy that should be required of this type of film.  Raimi knows how to deliver this energy, see some of his previous films (The Evil Deads, Darkman).  <br/><br/>Spider-Man is the only film I can think of in recent memory that cost 100+ million dollars yet it looks like it was made for considerably less.  The CGI in this film is absolutely atrocious.  These effects look like they came right out of the early 90's.  For a summer popcorn flick Spider-Man commits cardinal sin #1: it looks cheap.<br/><br/>Other major problems: 1 - Laughable costume design for the Goblin. 2 - Dialogue that makes the ""yippy"" from Episode 1 sound ingenious. 3 - Plot holes: how did Parker go from his Human Spider costume, into his official Spiderman costume?  We should have seen him make it. 4 - The same old thing.  Do we really need to watch Spider-Man saving children from fires?  How many times do we need to see him stop the same bland street muggers?  Couldn't the writers think of more unique ways to showcase Spidey's powers? 5 - Takes way too long to develop the dual between the Green Goblin and Spider-Man. 6 - Speaking of the Green Goblin, everything about this character needed to be expanded on.  Why is it he wants to destroy the innocents.  The most interesting relationship in the entire film, The Goblin and his son, is barely even focussed on.<br/><br/>There were things I liked as well.  I thought all the casting choices were superb.  Thought the final battle could have used some work, but overall it had the goods.  I just wanted more from this film, much  more.  Here's hoping the sequel can correct on some of the areas this film failed.<br/><br/>One thing is for certain, there has only been one true Marvel superhero this year, and that's Blade!  Give this franchise to Guillermo Del Toro and let him show Raimi how to do a comic book film."

","Peter Parker is in the midst of adolescent angst when something strange happens.  He turns into a spider.  Instead of finding this fact worrisome, he sews himself a costume and starts to swing.   <br/><br/>Tobey McGuire is about the only actor around who could pull off this high-wire act.  He's got the right amount of boyish charm and childish enthusiasm.  He looks just dorky enough in glasses and without them he looks like a 1950's All-American boy.  His crush on M.J.(Kirsten Dunst) is palpable, even if Dunst lacks charisma, McGuire takes moondog to a new level. <br/><br/>The first half of this film is interesting as Peter discovers, and masters his powers.  But what follows, with Spiderman battling The Green Goblin is stilted and uninspiring.  Willam Defoe, a fine actor, was a bit too intense as Spiderman's arch nemesis.  He needed to have a little less of a problem embracing his evil side. It would have made it a lot more fun, if he just let loose, and played it more for laughs.  James Franco, so wonderful as James Dean, is positively enervated as Parker's wealthy friend.  The special effects were cheesy and cartoonish, which suited the subject matter, but with each new film of this sort a certain amount of computer magic is expected.  It was passable, but if you notice it, chances are that it isn't doing the job. <br/><br/> There were some funny moments as Peter enters a wrestling match, seemingly outmatched by Bone Saw McGraw (Randy Poffo).  But it is J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the cigar-chomping editor, who steals every scene he's in. The words comic book implies humor, but more often than not there isn't much that is comical about these films.  J. K. Simmons, shedding his Nazi persona from ""Oz"", looked like he was having a bit of fun.  So did I."

I was afraid it would be another horrible comic-book movie that was dark and full of inside references that only devout fans of the comic would get.  However, I'm glad that he did.  It was great!<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the fact that a lot of the movie revolved around Peter Parker's wonder and enjoyment of his new skills and also of the relationship between him and M.J.

I would definitely recommend this movie for a date.<br/><br/>Like many of the other reviewers, I noticed that some of the special effects were not up to par with many recent films.  I commented on this to my husband who said that he thought they did that on purpose to give it more of that ""comic book"" feel.  After thinking about it, I agree.  Also, many people have spoken about some of the cheesy, over-the-top dialog.

","It was a long time coming, but the long overdue Spiderman movie just may be a success. The plot is not what I expected, though, I pictured something a bit more darker and set closer to the real world as the first Batman movie. The film sets up Peter as the comic book did, as a social outcast constantly demeaned and embarrassed by his peers. Do we need to be reminded of how horrible high school was for all of us ? the origins could have been summed up in a few flashback sequences in a dream. As it is, the movie has a long set-up and once it gets started, it becomes a bit dizzying from the acrobatic sequences, but the viewer does get used to them. The computer imaging seamlessly works excellantly that soon it becomes hard to tell what is done real and what was done on computer. Tobey McGuire does a great job playing Peter, but his Spiderman is a little distant, not so much on the wise-cracking hero from the comics. Kirsten Dunst is titillating as MJ Watson (personally, I saw Kate Winslet in the role), but she does provide more substance and character than seen in the comics. Willem DaFoe out-Jokers Nicholson as the Green Goblin and out-Psychos Anthony Perkins as Norman Osborn. James Franco also gives a wonderful performance as does Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris (I thought Aunt May looked more like Cheers' Frances Sternhagen). Kudos to JK Simmons for actually looking like JJJ and giving the role a comic edge. The direction is excellant and the photography is superb. This movies deserves nothing less than a ten from anyone who has never seen the comic."

The graphics in the film were spectacular, and the effects were, to be honest, quite amazing.  They effectively pulled the comic from the pages of a book and put it in a feature film.<br/><br/>The disappointing aspect of the movie, though, is the dialogue.  Granted, Peter Parker is a bit of a geek, and the Green Goblin is insane, but the dialogue for these characters is way over the top.  They've exaggerated the stereotype, and I'm not quite sure if it works for this type of movie! You can't really compare it to Batman, even if that would be your first inclination - they are hardly related.  The darkness of the Batman movies is a stark contrast to the light-heartedness of Spider-Man.<br/><br/>

","It's really too bad. You'd think the stage would have been set for an outstanding comic book romp. Good, solid cast; direction of Sam Raimi, all brought together by the everlasting appeal of Spider Man; the fearlessly cheesy, noble alter-ego of nice guy geek Peter Parker. But for some reason, it hasn't gelled.<br/><br/>  The basic story covers Spider-Man's origin and his first battle with his first big super evil bad guy. Oh, and he falls in love too. `Spider-Man's' problem isn't the story. A movie is never so much about its story as it is how it tells its story. And this movie tells its story with cheesy dialogue, one heap of clichés and some sketchy effects.<br/><br/> When the side effects of the gas that transforms Willem Dafoe into the Green Goblin are being described, the list terminates with an `iSaNiTy!' so ominous that Adam West would be jealous. And, my God, who the Hell had the idea that they should start calling May Jane' M.J.' (Forgive me if that's what they call her in the comic book.) My name is Alastair, and there are only certain people who can get away with calling me Al. Very few, at that. Peter Parker, being the shy geek that he is, wouldn't be one of them. He should call Mary Jane `Mary Jane' because he's polite and timid and that's just what he'd call her. Plus, they aren't on colloquial enough terms for that. It just sounds phony. As it did whenever anyone else said it, with the exception of a carload of Mary Jane's friends. The intense confrontations between Spiderman and the Green Goblin produce some pretty hard-hitting lines. `Goblin, what have you done!?'; and the Green Goblin's rendition of `The Itsy-Bitsy Spider' are just a few bites of cheese you'll find. Oh, and after Harry thinks Spider-Man has ruthlessly killed his father, not realizing his father was the Green Goblin, `Spider-Man will pay' he assures repeatedly. Geeze. There's more than all of this. Much, much more. I should have taken a notebook to the theater.<br/><br/>
 The script may be a downer, but it's the clichés that kill it. For example, Peter goes back to meet uncle Ben after he's been to the `library.' How many times have we seen someone in a movie instantly force their way to the front of a crowd surrounding a crime scene? Then, shocking tragedy awaits... well, maybe not all that shocking. Earlier on, there's the scene where dude in charge of the wrestling match refuses to give Peter his money promised for the victor. `It's not my problem,' he tells him. (That's not an exact quote. I don't remember the line, perhaps because the line wasn't as great as it thought it was.) So a few minutes later, a burglar steals the money, runs down the hall and Peter doesn't stop him. Buddy from the desk asks Peter why he didn't stop him. Peter repeats the same line. Oh, the poetic justice of it all!  And the whole `With great power comes great responsibility.' Ok, we get it. You don't have to keep ramming it down our throats. There are a lot of things in `Spider-Man' that could go unsaid. Not a lot of innovation went into this movie. The story could have been dealt with more originally.<br/><br/>  We haven't seen anything like the Green Goblin's death before, have we? Peter's revelation that the Goblin is business tycoon and father of his best friend and roommate Harry, Norman Orbson sure hits home (right.) And then his hand grasps upwards through that wall and they share a poignant final moment. It's just sooooooooooo dramatic. Not a lot of innovation went into this movie. The story could have been dealt with MUCH more originally.<br/><br/>  I didn't have a lot of complaints about the performances. Tobey Maguire was perfect for the lead roll, much better than, shutter, Freddie Prinze Junior would have been. Parker is a geek and so is Maguire. But they're both cool geeks. I usually like Willem Dafoe, here is no exception, even if he wasn't always able to render the insane bantering of his surprisingly two-dimensional character plausible (one situation, however, where he coped especially well were the difficult scenes of his dueling personalities.) Dunst was very pleasing and dealt with the script the best of all (maybe because she didn't have to say M.J.) And J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson seems to have flown in straight from the campy cartoon, in a good way. It's too bad that with all of these characters in the right place, the rest of the movie couldn't have been better.<br/><br/>  `Spider-Man' couldn't decide whether to be totally cornball or to go for the drama. `X-Men' was shamelessly cheesy, and for that I enjoyed it a lot more. <br/><br/>  The special effects are, if anything, a little rough around the edges. He might be a super-hero, but Spider-Man isn't in outer space. As a consequence, there's still gravity. Then why does it seem like he's flying half of the time? Maybe it's some aerodynamic mystery like the bumblebee. Other effects are, well, all to obviously effects. <br/><br/>  But the thing that bothers me the most is that they could have done something really great with this movie, and it would have made just as much money, so why not bother?<br/><br/>  But who cares what I think, really? I've never really read the comic book much. I just watched the cartoon and looked at some of the cards when I was a kid. If the fans of the book like it, that's what really matters. Although it doesn't sound like some of them are too pleased. I gave this movie a zero. In actuality, I'd give it a four; but a lot more people gave it a ten than should have and now it's in the top 250. Come on, this movie is not better than `The French Connection.'"
"The_Core","6","0","0","9 May 2002"," All the subtlety of a sledgehammer...
","... but that's OK in a comic book film.  Perhaps unfortunately, this has all been done before in the first couple ""Batman"" films, and the first couple ""Superman"" films.  The entire movie carried a weight of ""haven't I seen this scene before?"" over and over again.<br/><br/>I'm a great fan of the original ""Spiderman"" series of comic books (which I read avidly as a kid), but I have to agree with Ebert on this one -- the action just looks unrealistic.  A physical body cannot move that quickly or smoothly, defying the laws of space, time and gravity.  That took a lot of fun out of the action sequences for me.<br/><br/>The plot itself is interesting and involving, but *very* rehashed from a number of other superhero-type movies.  Nary an original moment in the entire running-time of the film... nothing genuinely creative at all. ""Spiderman cereal"" will probably leave a sweeter taste in your mouth.<br/><br/>My conclusion is that I can't recommend you pay US$7.50 to see this one in the theater, unless you honestly loved the recent ""Planet of the Apes"" remake and the two ""Mummy"" films.  Wait for the DVD release (rumored to be in November 2002 I think), the film will look just as good (if not better) on the small screen.  <br/><br/>This movie is NOT a blockbuster... see the 1978 version of ""Superman"" if you want superhero action, it out-does this film in every conceivable aspect (even the special effects category).<br/><br/>6/10"
"RolloTomasi","7","0","0","9 May 2002"," Green Goblin: ""What's my motivation?""
","The first half of ""Spider-Man"" really is perfect. It's everything you could hope for in a comic book movie. It's lighthearted, yet dramatic, as well as exciting. It is the reason to go see it. <br/><br/>The film also has problems that any this huge, with this much at stake, is likely to have. Some are merely inconsistencies with the comic, which I can't argue with. For one, Peter fires the webbing out of his wrists, which he never did in the comic. In the comic, he fits his costume with web-shooters that fire super strong webbing. But having the webs fire from his own wrists in the film creates some nice comic moments and is more economical, story-wise, than having manufactured web shooters. So this is easily excused.<br/><br/>In true comic-book fashion, the hero and the villain are created nearly simultaneously, in completely unrelated events. I was able to shun this aside as well. That's just a Hollywood coincidence and is consistent with comic storytelling.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the comic that the film misses is Spider-Man's sarcastic sense of humor. In the comic, in even the most dire situations, Spider-Man always found some wise-crack, which was sometimes just to hide his own fear. It's like trash talk, of the NBA variety. This is one of the most appealing and unique aspects about the Spider-Man character and the film barely touches on it.  <br/><br/>The film runs into real problems, though, with the Green Goblin (and I don't mean the problems he causes Spider-Man). Norman Osborn's mental breakdown, triggered by his business failings, is well represented by Willem Dafoe. The performance is great, but it doesn't look like he was allowed to have any fun, the way Jack Nicholson was as the Joker, Michelle Pfiefer as Cat Woman, and Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor. Even Ian McKellen as Magneto (in ""X-Men"") looked like he savored every moment of that role. But the Goblin of ""Spider-Man"" is just an extreme version of every character Dafoe's ever played (I had this flashback of ""Shadow of the Vampire"" when Osborn gasps upon seeing the blood on Peter's arm in the Thanksgiving scene). There's nothing surprising about the character, nor any moments that let you know the film isn't taking itself too seriously. A film like this needs to show that it is aware of its own triviality, something usually done through the villain. Sam Raimi doesn't get this. <br/><br/>That isn't even the film's biggest flaw. This flaw could have been fixed with one or two small changes and would have made a huge difference. The Goblin's motivation for wanting to kill Spider Man-what is it? The film never gives a convincing one. Even a comic book movie needs this. For some reason, writer David Koepp has the Goblin decide that Spider-Man can't be beat (he's ""virtually invincible""), so he asks the hero to join him to do what, exactly? When Spider-Man refuses, the Goblin gets angry and tries to kill him. He goes after his family and friends just to bait him. This concept is just, well, dumb. For one thing, the whole appeal of the Spider-Man character as a superhero is that he IS vulnerable. He does have superhuman strength, but bullets can hurt him. He can be killed by things that would kill normal people, like bullets and fire. All he has going for him is his spider-sense, his strength, his agility. <br/><br/>Another point: this vendetta of the Goblin's isn't even consistent with the Norman Osborn character Koepp had built up to that point. Osborn is a guy who blames other people, homicidally, for his own failings. He doesn't get the DOD contract and kills the men who said no to him. Spider-Man saying no didn't make any difference one way or the other. It didn't cause any failing on Osborn's part. Now, if Spider-Man had caused the Goblin to fail in some way, or stood in his way and created the perception that it was Spider-Man's fault, well, that would have been a different story. As it is, though, this lack of motivation leaves a huge hole through the middle of the movie. At least for me.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"

","WOW!  I mean freakin' WOW!<br/><br/>It's not very often I pay twice to see a movie in the theater (or know<br/><br/>for sure I'll buy the DVD on the day it's released), but I have to tell<br/><br/>you, Spider-Man was just about the best, most fun movie I've seen<br/><br/>in a long time.  The film is just about 2 hours that feels like 15<br/><br/>minutes.  It's full of action, has a great plot, some good gushy<br/><br/>scenes for the sentimental, and an outstanding performance by<br/><br/>the entire cast.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire plays the webbed wonder and does a great job.  I<br/><br/>wasn't a big fan of his, but I am now.  My daughters also have a<br/><br/>new heartthrob.  For the guys, Kirsten Dunst is beautiful and puts<br/><br/>on a great performance.  The most outstanding (and I mean Oscar<br/><br/>quality) performance has to go to Willem Dafoe.  He portrays the<br/><br/>Green Goblin and is so creepy, he made my blood run cold a few<br/><br/>times.  He literally steals every scene he's in.  For those who<br/><br/>remember the 60's cartoon series will get a huge kick out of J.<br/><br/>Jonah Jameson.  J.K Simmons plays him just like the cartoon.<br/><br/>If you're a Spidey fan like me or you have kids that like super<br/><br/>heroes, you have to go see this movie.  It was loads of fun and has<br/><br/>to be seen in the theater."

","Now here's a very fun, action-packed and enjoyable flick, start to finish. Based on the Marvel comic by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, ""Spider-Man"" spins the tale of geeky high schooler, Peter Parker (sweetly played by Maguire) who is bitten by a rare species of spider, and becomes the titled action hero. He sets out to rid the world (okay, at least New York) of evil, when he is challenged by nemesis, The Green Goblin, (Dafoe, in a wonderfully wicked performance) who unbeknownst to Spidey, is really his best friend's father. The movie is face paced, funny and filled with so much action, that you don't dare leave your seat to get more popcorn for fear of missing out on the fun. The movie is not without its flaws, however. For instance, the computer generated characters seem, well, ..obviously computer generated, which disrupts the action and is distracting. Also, some of the dialogue is unintentionally laughable, most notably in a later scene where M.J. (Peter's girlfriend) pours her heart out to him. Despite these minor problems, however, this movie is worth the wait you'll have standing in line to see it!"
"caamich","9","0","0","9 May 2002"," Nice Cameos in a Great Movie
","I got a lot more emotional spectrum out of this movie than I expected. That alone impressed me. I felt sorrow, glee, anger, fear, humor, and even shocked enough to jump at one point.<br/><br/>There were some great cameos (one of which I missed, darnit!) by former cohorts of Sam Raimi's from his Xena and Hercules days. Some were more obvious than others, which explains why I missed the one person I would have really liked to see.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm told by my comic-fan friends that this movie did a really good job of honoring those who told the tale of Spiderman before it. I wouldn't know--I was more of an Archie, Pink Panther, Peanuts sort of kid.<br/><br/>All I know is, even without being a comic fan, I really enjoyed the movie. It's always a plus when a film works on all your emotional strings.<br/><br/>Oh, and did I mention how good the special effects were? SEAMLESS."
"Jack the Ripper1888","5","0","0","9 May 2002"," Sad, really.
","This movie was a good example of how badly people can adapt things. David Koepp did a great job writing PANIC ROOM and STIR OF ECHOES and even JURASSIC PARK. But, what the hell was he thinking here? This is not a very good movie. And even if no one reads this review, be warned. Sam Raimi, the director of THE EVIL DEAD, was stupid to take this film into his hands. Or, maybe it was smart of him to do. Because so many people have seen this film. Most of them are probably little toddlers under the age of ten. That is the crowd this film mainly aims to please.<br/><br/>This whole thing is like one, long, stupid, dull episode of Power Rangers. Some of the dialogue just made me want to die laughing. EX. Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) says to Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) ""This isn't over yet, we'll meet again Spider-Man"". Now, tell me what kind of villain would say that in a film. The earlier X-MEN did a far better job of adapting a Marvel comic onto the screen, aiming to please audiences that weren't just ten and younger. David Koepp may be a great writer at coming up with original and creative ideas, but he should never adapt another comic.<br/><br/>
The movie just got worse from then on. The only thing that saved this film was Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson and the dramatic and exciting action sequences (which is mainly when the cheesy dialogue is spoken). My other complaint is some of the unbelievable parts. (Read no further if you haven't seen the film) One part is when Spider-Man is holding on to a trolley car filled with little kids with just one arm while hanging onto a bridge with the other. Even if he is super-human and stuff, If he can get cut and start to bleed, then I would think that he wouldn't be as strong enough as to be able to hold up an entire trolley. And then there were the special effects. You could always tell that Spider-Man and the Green Goblin both were almost always computer animated. And it is so sad. It looks like they try to make them look computer animated here. They don't even want them to look real. What, is that the 'cooler' thing nowadays? If so, when did that happen?<br/><br/>I'll bet you fifty bucks that we're going to be seeing a trillion movies that try to rip-off the success of this one. I have already heard that a sequel is in the works. As if the first one wasn't bad enough, what's the second one gonna be about?<br/><br/>I just want to vomit at the thought of this movie being #95 on the best-picture list in the database. Surely you jest. Maybe the bottom films of all time. Now, the best thing that this movie has going for it is the fact that you will jump at one part. Some of the action sequences were okay too. Just a lot of bad dialogue and stupid acting. SPIDER-MAN: 2/5.<br/><br/>
Oh, me and my friend died laughing at Willem Dafoe's two lines ""I brought a fruitcake"" and ""I hope you enjoy the fruitcake""."

","Let me start by saying that X-Men, another Marvel comic switched into a movie, would lose terribly in a fight with Spider-Man.  I was alarmed when I saw that Tobey Maguire was cast as Peter Parker, but I thought he was perfect for the role.  On the other hand, when I saw Willem Dafoe cast as Norman Osborn, I was anxiously awaiting his performance, but I felt that he was extremely fake when donning the armor of the Green Goblin ***Spoiler, sort of***(although he was good in the schizophrenia scenes).  The characters were well developed and the acting was of a better caliber than what I expected.  This was an extremely fun movie and well worth the PACKED theater (not to mention the annoying people who clapped practically every time when Spidey said something)."
"philip-1","Null","0","0","9 May 2002"," tedious
","This is one of the worst of the superhero genre movies.  Here are the reasons:<br/><br/>1. The script is terrible; infantile and predictable.<br/><br/>2. Tobey Maguire is no different here than in The Cider House Rules. I'm frankly tired of his subtle, introverted imp act. This actor seems the same in every role.<br/><br/>3. The special effects are all computer generated. They look impressive but don't allow Spiderman to have a character in costume.<br/><br/>4. James Franco as Parker's friend is too similar an actor to Maguire; namely an expressionless face and an introvert.<br/><br/>5. Kirsten Dunst is great but can barely overcome the vacuous character.<br/><br/>6. Parker's aunt and uncle are played by beloved verteran actors. Too bad the script makes them so corny and superficial.   <br/><br/> 7. Dafoe's villain is so cliche ridden that he's a bore. Nothing compared to Nicholson's Joker and Carey's Riddler.<br/><br/>8. The production design is devoid of any creativity. Where's the comicbook imagination.  <br/><br/>The movie is certainly a pleasant enough diversion. There are some enjoyable sequences especially when Parker is discovering his powers in a high school cafateria. Perhaps movie goers are dazzled by the effects. However, considering high expectations, it is a MAJOR disappointment."

They tried setting us up to believe the scene with events happening in the movie, but it just doesn't fly.  I would say the movie is a 'must see' for the summer, just close your ears at the end of the movie so you don't hear the lousy dialog in the 'tender moment' at the end.

"jugrin","7","0","0","9 May 2002"," The special effects were excellent but it was too violent
","The movie was very good but I only rated it as a 7 because of the violence. I realize that the whole idea of the movie is good versus evil and good triumphs over evil, but the kind of violence it portrays is the kind that I believe causes young people to become insensitive to the feelings of others and to the idea of death and suffering as being the ultimate bad ending.  I will not take my 10 year old son to see it because of the violence.  It is the kind where the villain laughs while he visits his evil on innocent people.  Movies like Jurassic Park where the violence is another species attacking man is different.  It is kind of the survival on mankind, man against nature.  But violence by man against man is a whole different kind and the kind that I think is bad for young minds.<br/><br/>I would like to see more movies where man is seen as good.  Where the conflict is directed in a more positive way; not just kill or be killed. Not just retaliate against violence with more violence."

"Allen-31","5","0","0","9 May 2002"," the star of the movie is the special effects (sigh...)
","A feel-good superhero action flick. The chief selling point is, of course, the special effects and relentless pace of the action that completely overwhelm the thin script and reduces much of the film to being something like a ride at a major studio theme park.<br/><br/>Luckily we are treated to some wonderful acting moments by Tobey Maguire, but there is no acting at all when he's replaced by a CGI Spiderman. It's a shame, really. Christopher Reeve and Micahel Keaton at least got to act when in costume.<br/><br/>William Dafoe is always a great actor to watch. (I initially had hoped that he would play The Joker in the original Batman film -- and I stand by my opinion that he would have done as good or better job than Nicholson.) The problem here, of course, is not a CGI issue, it's that you can't see his face behind the Goblin's rigid mask.<br/><br/>The woman who played Aunt May was very good. Uncle Ben's part was way too syrup-y with heavy implications. I didn't know the story, and yet I could tell almost instantly that their conversation in the car was the ""fateful last conversation they'll ever have which shall cause emotional angst for Peter."" Other performances ranged from good to mediocre.<br/><br/>It's my personal opinion that the superhero genre is being milked by the studios because of their instant revenue via eye-popping effects, not because they make outstanding films.  ""Superman"" is still the best example of a superhero film that actually had a really good *story* to tell... but that was made back in the days when actors didn't have to compete with special effects.  If ""Superman"" had been made today, it would probably would have featured acting and writing on the scale of the ""Lois & Clark"" TV series with CGI battles and effects making up more than 50% of the film.  I suspect we won't see any more good superhero films until some studio has the balls to do ""Watchmen"".  But hey, maybe that's why ""Watchmen"" hasn't been made yet -- so much story that it's hard to condense properly into a 2-hour film.<br/><br/>Forget the standard 4-star ratings systems these days.  That doesn't provide any useful context in today's movie-going reality.  Here's a better system:<br/><br/>Worth seeing at full price, worth seeing at matinee price, wait for video/DVD, or don't bother even renting it.<br/><br/>This movie rates between matinee price and wait for video."

","By far among the two or three best films the genre has ever produced.  It was entertaining throughout, and the action - while visually innovative - was campy enough to allow fans of the old mag to reminisce a bit as the scenes played out.  Just sitting there, I could picture the old tattered mags I carried around as a kid, what each scene looked like in print... all that was missing was the yellow box in the corner with ""MEANWHILE..."" carefully scrawled inside.  Sure, they fiddled with a couple details here and there, but you got the sense that it was strictly in an effort to modernize the story.  The plot had just the right pace to it, and character development was based on dialogue and decision - meaning that Raimi has the license to go full-throttle in the next installment.  Just like you'd have to see the original Star Wars to appreciate the change-of-pace in Empire Strikes Back, the same goes here.  I would recommend this film to anybody, in anticipation that the sequel(s) will be ungodly."
"suzythedigbum","4","0","0","8 May 2002"," Maybe they should have titled this one ""The Peter Parker Story""
","Let me preface this review by stating that I have been a huge Tobey Macquire fan since ""The Ice Storm"" and was quite shocked that one of my favorite actors (whose work I admired for its delicacy) was cast to play a superhero. I must admit that his doe-eyed innocent charm is perfect for playing a pre-augmented Spider Man and this is the aspect of Spider-Man that works really well.  Where this movie falls flat on its face are the horrendously rendered action scenes, which looked like they were produced on computers bought at a RadioShack clearance sale.  Even more dissappointing were the scenes between the Green Goblin and Spiderman.  Did Sam Raimi totally forget that when in full costume you can't see either actor speak?  These scenes could have been dubbed over in Wolof for all the impact they had.<br/><br/>In general, this movie is great for getting to know Peter Parker as the awkward kid, but not for understanding how the whole Spiderman altar-ego thing came about.  Maybe if they had some scenes of Parker reading Nieztche to figure out what to do with his new-found powers it would be a bit more interesting and relevant, rather than turning the second half of this movie into a technicolor yawn-fest."

Great performances all around.  Drop whatever you're doing right now and go and see it."

","The writers of the film did an excellent job of taking decades of Spider-Man lore and putting it into a one-film package. The comic love interests of Gwen Stacey (who the Green Goblin killed in the comic book) and Mary Jane Watson are combined into one character. Updating the original tale from the '60s to the '00s is done seamlessly. Willem Dafoe takes the same energy he put into his Oscar-deserving role in Shadow of the Vampire and transforms the Green Goblin into the best comic-book-turned-movie villain ever.<br/><br/>	But the most important feature, and what made Spider-Man stand above all other comic creation, is the portrayal of the superpowers as a curse; that Parker is, in the end, a tragic hero. Parker is real, unlike the playboy Bruce Wayne or the why-is-it-that-no ono-recognizes-me-with-glasses Clark Kent. We relate to his regrets, his unrequited love and his loyalties. And that's far more important than any special effect or action shot."

I wanted to soar effortlessly through the air; I wanted to cast webs. The truth is, for those couple of hours there was nothing I wanted more than to be a spider. This is where the movie succeeded.<br/><br/>For a while, I had no clue of where I was - but I knew exactly where I wanted to be. When the ending credits carried back my unfortunate human reality, I couldn't help but to smile at truly such a great job done. If you haven't seen Spider-Man - drive to your favorite theater now.

","You know going into this movie, I thought about a lot of things.  First what came to my mind was that Sam Raimi is an awesome director but can he handle such a huge blockbuster like Spiderman?  The answer is he not only handled it, he man handled it.  Secondly I thought could Tobey Maguire even fit in the role of Spider-man?  The answer it he didn't only fit in it, he looked like he's been wearing it for 40 years now.  I would have to say that this movie beat the hell out of X-Men and it comes close enough to the original Batman to say it beat it by an inch of its life.  I had an open mind going into the movie with the computer animations and everything involved and I came out wanting more.  I cannot even wait for the sequel to come out next year around the same time as the original.  This movie was beautiful to say the least.  Great job!  I've heard a lot going on about it being too much of a cheesy love story and in all hoensty, i'd like to spit in the face of the person who thinks it because it is probably one of the most innocent love stories left out there.

","Wow people, I'm just shocked that some people not only didn't enjoy this movie, but are just hell-bent on smashing it to pieces. Now, I already posted another review of this movie that infact praises Spider-Man. I gave it a 10 out of 10 rating, and I recommended it to everyone who hadn't seen it yet. I am a true child of the movies, I love going to them, I love Hollywood, and I will love it until the day I die.<br/><br/>First off, I'm not trying to come down on anyone in this post, I'm posting a general statement to people who nitpick about movies (but with references to Spider-Man). I'm not an employee of any movie studio, nor am I some marketing exec trying to brainwash you guys. I am nothing more than a movie buff who was pleasantly surprised at what turned out to be a very well crafted movie.<br/><br/>Ok, the action left something to be desired, I wish I could have seen some more hand-to-hand combat between Spidey and The Green Goblin. I wish I could have seen some more scenes of Peter Parker discovering his new skills. But as I type this, I am reminded that what makes good movies is the fact that you are left wanting more. Spiderman is a comic that has as many dramatic and heartfelt elements as it does action elements. Sam Raimi did a great job of capturing the motivations of the characters, choosing to develop them rather than have them be pawns being moved from one action scene to the next. Sam Raimi does a similar thing with his classic ""Darkman"", where our hero is a tortured sole caught between two worlds and must hide his true self away from his loved ones. Tobey Maguire plays the part perfectly, putting just the right amount of geekiness in his character. But even before he gets bitten, there is a twinkle in his eye, I could see something about Peter Parker that was more than just the geek exterior, and it prevented his character from becoming a stereotypical nerd (which a lesser actor would have done easily). Kirsten Dunst is cute, but her wet t-shirt/sweater/dress/whole body scene was purely gratuitous (remember Halle Berry in Swordfish?). I hate her a lot less in this movie than in her other movies, and she was actually convincing as Mary Jane, right down to the hair color. James Franco as Harry Osborn is very good, and looks like he could be Willem Dafoe's son in real life (it's the cheekbones). I'm sure we will see more of Franco's Osborn in the sequel. Which moves us to Willem Dafoe...yes, the mask is a bit halloweenish, but it's a realistic twist on an otherwise unrealistic character. His portrayal of The Green Goblin was dead on, even the voice was good. His performance was multi-layered and very intoxicating. Even as he is going crazy, the scenes with his son are very interesting and even believable. The ""talking to the mask"" scene was pretty silly, but Dafoe does the best he can, and that's all I ask.<br/><br/>All in all, Sam Raimi's Spiderman is a great film. It is one of my all time favorites (along with a laundry list of others)and deserves to be part of the ranks of Batman and Superman. I believe it captured the spirit of the comic book perfectly, and without a ""re-imagined"" feel to it, it feels authentic and even a little 50's-ish. Finally a summer blockbuster with some substance to it, and a over hyped movie that delivers on its hype (at least in my opinion).<br/><br/>Frankly I'm just tired of the nitpickers who insist that everything has to be perfectly adapted from the book. Look people, it's a MOVIE. Our physical representations of feelings we all get from reading the book are not going to be exactly the same as the filmmakers', nor should they be. Let's face it, the movie will almost never be as good as the book, so don't ask it to be. I'm a big reader, and when they turn books into movies, I have certain doubts about the adaptation, but I just sit back and remember that a movie cannot capture everything a book has to offer. As for the people who saw it and didn't like the lack of action...well...I can sympathize, but go see it again, you might appreciate the story more when you see it a second time.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that people who viciously nitpick about stuff that they can't do any better themselves are missing out on the good stuff about Spider-Man, and I think that it pays to be a little more realistic when it comes to movies. Let the books be books, and let the movies be movies, and we'll all get along better that way."

","Go Spidey! I anticipated this movie with dread and excitement, being a tremendous fan of just about everything Stan Lee created. The problem with most Comic-based movies is that comics are not movies and they do not necessarily translate well. Spider-man found that perfect balance; keeping true to the original Spider-man mythology, but introducing enough to keep the plot and characters interesting. Lets face it, many Comic book characters are, well, two dimensional. To see them make invocative characters made my day."

","What can I say? I saw the movie and liked it so much I HAD to see it again as soon as I could. And I did.<br/><br/>Toby Maguire is awesome as Peter Parker. I had never seen his work before but I was so impressed, I have to. I was also worried that Kyrsten Dunst didn't have the chops to do a believable Mary Jane Watson. I was dead wrong. Not only was she incredibly good as an actor in the movie, she was excruciatingly hot, too (who didn't love her in the wet shirt?).<br/><br/> The special effects made the action sequences some of the best I've ever seen. Any problems with the fx can be chalked up to the relatively primitive level of computer Graphics.<br/><br/> One of the main reasons I loved this movie is that it has a comic book ending instead of a Hollywood ending. Peter Parker could have the girl of his dreams but instead of just grabbing for her, he decides that he does not want her to be placed at risk again as a consequence of what he does as an extracurricular activity. The ending was gutsy and true to the kind of life a man like Peter Parker or Bruce Wayne would have to live."

I thought the effects added to the story, which was strong enough with the tension that is formed from his birth as ""The Human Spider"".

","After enduring such painful flops the likes of Superman IV: The Quest For Peace and Batman & Robin, then seeing the trail towards redemption with X-Men and Unbreakable, it is my pleasure to say this:  Hollywood has finally gotten it right.  Spider-Man excels in all ways possible.  Sam Raimi (Evil Dead) pulled a Tim Burton on us by treating the characters and story with respect and realism.  From the smile brought to my face from seeing Peter realize his power; to his shattered realization of who the burglar is; to the final confrontation with the Green Goblin, Spider-Man is the best film of it's kind to come out of Hollywood in a long time. Let's talk Tobey:  Much like Michael Keaton, Tobey is an odd choice at first, but decidedly the only choice in the end.  He IS Peter Parker/Spider-Man.  He pulls off sweet and awkward as Peter and cool and confident as Spider-Man.  The emotional rollercoaster he goes through in this film is quite demanding.  I cannot imagine seeing Leo or Prinze, Jr. in this part at all.  Tobey Maguire's performance is the biggest and most pleasing surprise in Spider-Man. Dafoe, the foe:  Joker, who?  Luthor, who?  Willem Dafoe throws away the comic coda stating a villain must be played over the top and settles into a much more quiet, menacing performance as the ambitious Norman Osborn and murderous Green Goblin.  His Jekyll & Hyde performance brings a much more complex air to this character which could have easily been diminished in the hands of a much less talented actor. Dunst:  Again, another pleasant surprise.  The role of Mary-Jane is not an easy one to fill.  Kirsten Dunst brings a general sweetness and sincereness to a character that was somewhat underwritten.  Her scenes with Tobey make the audience fall in love with her as well.  Bravo, Kirsten. The rest of the actors did splendidly as well.  James Franco brought angst and vulnerability to Harry Osborn; Rosemary Harris is the grandmother everyone loved as Aunt May; J.K. Simmons is hilarious as the arachnid hating J. Jonah Jameson; and Cliff Robertson is excellent as Peter's hero, Uncle Ben. The special effects were excellent and Danny Elfman gives us an excellent, if familiar, score.  Spider-Man is a film that will last decades and reassures us that Hollywood can dish out a summer movie while keeping in touch with it's human side as well."

His style is aptly suited for comic book movies, and I like to think that no one could have done it better.  The script was fantastic (it's refreshing to have something seemingly so faithful to its origins) and the players were perfect.

","I have never read the Spiderman comics, but I can easily say that this movie is one of the best movies of the year, if not of the 90's.  The acting is great, the special effects are fantastic, the length is just right, even the opening credits are fun to watch.  The story is set up very well, supported by the talents of Tobey McGuire, Willem Dafoe, and Kirsten Dunst.  It is one of those movies, like The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings, where it is a special-effects filled actioner where the movie lived up to its hype.  The ONLY complaint I have about the movie is that it does follow the usual superhero cliche basic structure storyline.  However, to compensate for that, the way the storyline and actions are carried out is done very well. At first, I would say that the love story  was done poorly, however, the way it turned out made room for a sequal.  Actually, the way everything turned out made room for a sequal.  I would HIGHLY recommend this. It will soon be added to my DVD collection.  It IS worth the 8-9 dollars to see at the theatre."
"Chris-332","10","0","0","3 May 2002"," Spidey as he's meant to be onscreen.
","Not since 1989's Batman has there been such a brilliant, fun, and hyperactive comic-book adaptation. Evil Dead and Darkman helmer Sam Raimi has gone back to his roots to deliver an over-the-top and energetic extravaganza that hits all the right levels of campiness and seriousness. There have been many comic-book movies in the past few years, but all of them have had a fatal flaw to keep it from true greatness. Batman Returns (a sequel I feel is better than the original) can really only be enjoyed by Tim Burton fans. Blade, although it was extremely entertaining, was FAR too over-the-top and cheesy to be anything more than a popcorn and eye-candy movie. X-Men, still one of the most ambitious comic-book movies to be brought to screen, had the flaw of taking itself TOO seriously, therefore the campy sequences felt strange and unmatched with the rest of the film. Batman + Robin, well, let's just not go there. Spider-Man gets it all right. Tobey Maguire's brilliant performance of Peter Parker, as well as the death of Uncle Ben, perfectly parallel the hyper kinetic and exxagerated style of filming (a trait from Raimi's earlier films) and the cheese wiz performance by Willem Dafoe, who seems to be having even MORE fun with his performance than in Shadow of the Vampire.<br/><br/>     Aside from the comic-book justice, Raimi also will please fans of the cult classic Evil Dead and Darkman films. Taking a step away from his more drama-driven career turn, he returns to his unique style of filmmaking, where almost EVERY shot of film is moving fiercely or spinning around violently. The fact that the CGI is a bit cartoony fits his wacky vision very nicely. After 13 years, the long-awaited Spider-Man matches the group of classic comic-films along with Burton's Batman and Richard Donner's Superman and shows us the way comic-book movies SHOULD be."

","Okay.. lame title but after all the trailers and adverts surrounding this movie in the tv and cinema and newspaper, it's hard not to think about not watching it when it opens. Fortunately, this movie opens on Wednesday during Labour Day here so I have a chance to watch it early.<br/><br/>I am a fan of Spiderman since the early years in print so I have a slightly higher expectation of this movie since it was announced.<br/><br/>The main question is.. how well will Tobey Maguire represent the Peter Parker we all know from the comics? The answer is a yes and no. He has his moments in certain scenes but some scenes with Mary Jane or M.J. stumped me. Perhaps I didn't read his character well in this movie.. or they want to show his obsession with M.J. through facial expression - but I find his silent and grim smile slightly disturbing. Maybe that's just me..<br/><br/>The other actors did their parts well especially J.K. Simmons as JJJ. And Aunt May is bigger than I imagine her to be..<br/><br/>As for the overall feel of the movie, it's fun and heart stopping everytime he climbs the walls and swinging over skyscrapers. It is certainly a better watch in comparison with a certain other ""insect movie"" currently showing.<br/><br/>The story follows well with the comics except for one thing.. how he got his web ability. It was artificial and scientifically created in the comics but in this movie, they made it a natural side effect of the spider bite. Oh well.. they can't fit everything into a 2 hours movie - look at LOTR but it's understandable.<br/><br/>As a last note, the pace is okay and some 'look at my face to guess what I am supposed to be feeling' scenes could be omitted. All in all, a great and wholesome fun movie."

","For your average comic book turned movie genre, this film was well above average. Although some scenes in the film used to explain certain powers and abilities of Spider-man were slow, they were necessary to include the mass of people that did not have much acquintance w/ the web-slinger. It also managed to stay true to the story of the original much closer than any film of it's kind. It may have been a bit sappy at points but if you actually took the time to read the comics instead of just staring blankly at the drawings you would see that this fits right into the character. Tobey Maquire does a fine job showing the turmoil that is inherit in the character of Peter Parker/Spider-man. And it did a commendable job portraying the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane. And those that boo the film for a lack of action need to review their comics and see how many pages there are in each one w/ Spidey just swinging around or hanging out w/ miles of monologue interposed or the pages spent on his relationship w/ Mary Jane, Aunt May, and Harry Osbourn. This is one of the few films that ever did the comic book any justice."

Although I now heard that original full ending was to have taken place on top of the World Trade Center and Sam had to take it out and re-do the ending scenes. The final scene was fine for my taste.

Ms. Kirsten was already making mince-meat out of actors such as Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise... and she was only eleven-years-old at the time that 'Vampire' movie was first released a decade ago.  One might ask Raimi himself ""Who are you?"" and then say ""Kirsten Dunst"" is already legend.<br/><br/>Now about the movie ""Spider-man""...<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this actioner/romancer.  There is plenty for boys, girls and adults.  Of course, the violence sometimes reaches intense proportions and levels, but then what are we paying for movies nowadays? Do we want to spend $9.50 for a trip to our backyards?  The answer is a resounding ""NO!""<br/><br/>The actors playing Spidey/Peter Parker, Mary Jane, and all the rest, do their best at what they do best.  Even Wilem Dafoe as the green villain is totally right on up there with other cinematic baddies, and deserves the respect and proper credit very few, stuck-up critics are willing to give.<br/><br/>Fantastic special-effects, but we all know that film-makers nowadays have got to focus more on story, and less on cyber-magic (Let's face it, sometimes these fx artists get a bit carried away!).<br/><br/>Watch this one with people who don't like talking to you while you're trying to pay attention to the movie."

Filled with genuine emotions, thrills and great fx (some of the shots of Spidey swinging from skyscraper to skyscraper are almost awe-inspiring in their choreographed beauty) this is a bona-fide hit, one that not only avoids insulting its audience but manages to treat it to what a real adventure movie is supposed to be like."

","If you're expecting to see a classic action comic book come to life, then you won't be disappointed in Director Sam Raimi's Spider-Man. I was doubtful when I heard Tobey Maguire was cast as the creepy crawler, but he is totally the part and is exactly as Peter Parker has been depicted for so many years in the comic books.<br/><br/>This is definitely the Batman Machine of the 2000's. Easily set for Spidie 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, as long as Tobey can fit in his suit. Raimi pulls the film to the edge of today's style of strong graphics, especially in the battle with the Green Goblin, yet he doesn't lose touch with the older audiences' memories of when Spider Man first appeared on the mag racks. He balances the two and plays the shy, withdrawn, protective Peter - caught between his unrequited love interest M.J. (Kirsten Dunst) and his sense of responsibility - in a pleasing (although perhaps somewhat stretched) way. A sideline character - the newspaper publisher played by J.K. Simmons - was a hoot and if you watch carefully, you'll see Lucy Lawless sneak in a cameo. Okay, I suppose I have to mention Special Effects - for once they didn't overpower the storyline - hallelujah. Some were hokey, most of them terrific.<br/><br/>I had a fun time with this one and am glad to see the demise of Spidie's green nemesis played convincingly by Willem Dafoe.

"TomStrange","10","0","0","7 May 2002"," A terrific film with only a few MINOR problems.
","A very engrossing and entertaining film with as much to offer long time spidey fans as it offers to action movie fans. What makes it great is the story of one Peter Parker who is well known to many comic book fans but may or may not be known to action movie fans. This was a task long in the making and very much worth the wait. I remember being very disappointed with the late seventies television attempt at presenting the story of Spiderman(even though I had only recently become acquainted with the character at the time).<br/><br/>Please be advised that I intend to make direct references to the movie concerning plot and if you have not seen this movie do not read any further.<br/><br/>I will start with what I consider to be a problem in the way Peter stands by while his Uncle's murderer falls to his death.  In the comic book this guy lives and is left for the police to find but for the movie Peter gets to watch him die. He obviously has the power to prevent his death and yet does not. Where is the great power/ great responsibility in this? If he had captured him instead or saved his life I would not even mention this but this scene is tragicly flawed.<br/><br/>My next problem with the story is the obvious way that Peter announces his transformation to his entire high school. He beats the crap out of the school bully in an ""I have been genetically altered"" manner. I guess people believe that public high school students are really stupid. There was a real opportunity to be clever here but alas chance missed.<br/><br/>I think the entire idea of having spikes protrude from Peter's fingers(like fine hair)is incredibly moronic. This is supposed to explain how Spiderman wallcrawls? How are they on glass? metal forks?<br/><br/>QUIT TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHAT DOES NOT NEED EXPLANATION!<br/><br/>All of this talk about the Green Goblin's costume and nobody thinks to throw some purple paint on the suit? It's not that difficult to at least try to recognize a color scheme. I am sure the Hulk would have approved. Speaking of suits, was I the only one who was not certain if Osborn/Green Goblin was really killed as seen? I thought at first that he wasn't. I believe that this is a flaw in the scene and should not have been done in this manner.<br/><br/>I did very much like the ""Wizard of OZ"" approach to the arrival of the Green Goblin. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst did a fantastic job with the characters. The enhanced Spider man costume with silver still looks silly. One of the best scenes in the movie is when Peter and MJ have a talk about the future in the backyard. There are very few times during the movie where anyone is comfortable using the nickname ""MJ"".<br/><br/>My chief complaint about the late 70's Spiderman concerned the webshooters. No complaints now;)"

It had the original theme, as well as one covered by Aerosmith, and some great rock tracks!  This is definitely a must-see movie, and I urge you all to see it.  This is spideychick, signing off!"

First, if I'm right, Lucy lawless was a Woman in the street, then, the Ring Announcer seemed to be Autolycus, and finally, I recognized Ted Raimi.

","There is no other word to describe the feeling you get after watching this movie.  This movie was truly a labor of love for Sam Raimi and his whole crew.  Tobey Maguire was an excellent Peter Parker, and a very fine Spider-Man.  I never thought much of him when he was cast, but now I am eating my words.  Willem Dafoe was very convincing as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, he was really scary in a surreal sort of way.  Kirsten Dunst was a good choice for MJ too.  JK Simmons was absolutely brilliant as J. Jonah Jameson, never laughed that hard in a while.  Bruce Campbell as ring announcer at the wrestling match was great too.  James Franco was good as Harry, also.  Some scenes looked CGI really bad as opposed to others, but other than that, a fine film."

","It was said that it took Hollywood 18 years to bring Spider-Man to the silver screen, and I'm glad that it did.  With the exception of a few quirks concerning the CGI effects, this is by far the best comic-book adaptation ever.  I didn't believe it myself when I first heard that Tobey Maguire was to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man, but then, before and after watching the film, it made good sense.  It just didn't seem plausible for someone like Ben Affleck, for example, to play a bookish, nerdy teenager transformed into a ""marvel"" superhero (although he does gets his chance with Daredevil, so I'm told). All the other actors were first-rate: Willem Dafoe, James Franco, Kirsten Dunst and Rosemary Harris...but for me, the standout performer was J.K. Simmons (Schillenger in HBO's ""Oz"") as J. Jonah Jamison.  He was so crabby there should have been more of him!  Let's hope he gets more screen time in the sequel! I loved seeing Spidey swing his way through New York...and we're with him for the ride!  If you should see this movie again (and I'm going to), stick around during the closing credits...you'll hear the original theme song from the '60's cartoon playing!"
"Siper2","Null","0","0","7 May 2002"," A long wait well worth it for Spidey fans!
","Good afternoon, true believers!  Sorry, couldn't resist... Stan Lee (Spidey creator) would say that if he could welcome viewers to each theatre, I'm sure.  Hopefully Stan the Man would repeat those words over and again with an undying smile too, because the movie made from his creation was nothing short of spectacular.<br/><br/>This review I actually wrote last night (May 6), but I had some PC troubles and apparently it didn't take.  I'm a die-hard comics fan, and I have to say that Sam Raimi did a wonderful job.  I can understand a few of the things people perhaps complain about:  Green Goblin's outfit was rather cheap, Mr. Dafoe was an unexpected fit for that character, and a few overly-comic one-liners put small dents in an otherwise great film.  But they're blemishes easily overlooked by a package that's otherwise simply perfect.<br/><br/>SUSPEND DISBELIEF.  That's what film tells you to before sitting down in that chair, popcorn in-arm.  Let go and just enjoy the movie.  For those two hours, just accept that a man can stick to walls and enjoy the show.  If you're a rational human being, not overly-anal and so completely bored that you can do nothing better with your time than nitpick a fabulous piece of art, you'll love Spider-Man from the opening credits.  Don't listen to those who say that the film isn't convincing--not to name any names of course.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was great, by the way.  Danny Elfman on-board as the composer for the main themes was, of course, a great choice.  His work on Batman was terrific, as were just about all of his scores... and his Spidey theme is no variation from greatness.  I bought the DVD one day post-viewing of the movie, and it's great.  Elfman, Alien Ant Farm, Aerosmith, Sum 41 and a handful of others for a total of 19 tracks. (Elfman's scores appear on #17 and 18.)<br/><br/>Mr. Elfman's music is of course best complemented by the film itself, but anyone intimate with Spider-Man's character, with his human connection and tortured life, can hear whispers of ""With great power comes great responsibility"" beneath every chorus.  Wonderful.  Though I have to admit that at a few points, it echoes a few flashbacks to the Batman theme song. I guess your work shows up everywhere you go, though!  When John Williams did the Superman theme, you could hear a little Star Wars in there too, which was from just a year prior, 1977.<br/><br/>The special effects in Spider-Man were the kind that made every person who allowed themself to smile, feel like they were eight years old again.  Some say that the CGI went a little overboard at times--and perhaps that's true. I'm also a fan of the old-fashioned, of smoke-and-mirrors versus computer magic.  But short of finding someone willing to defy physics, sign a waiver and swing about New York City on high-tensile line, this is as good as it gets.  In another couple years I'm sure the technology to blow this away will be there, but hey... there WILL be two sequels.  ;)<br/><br/>Following Spidey through the streets at mach speed was thrilling, to say the least.  His first appearances in costume were enough to make a guy cheer, and if the theatre were full, I bet there would've been a lot of that.  (I saw it in a matinee viewing on opening day, May 3, in Davenport, IA.)  The action, the resemblance to the true-comic book Spidey's lanky but muscular stature, his Yoga-like stringy but athletic movements were all kept true to form on the big screen.  He's never been a big guy, and wasn't portrayed that way.  Perfect!<br/><br/>Which brings me to Tobey Maguire.  I'll be honest:  I think he was a perfect pick to play Peter Parker.  (Sidebar:  Interesting tidbit.  His last name was Parker in ""Pleasantville"" too, when he acts as Bud in the black and white world.)  There are of course naysayers, but the heck with them.  He's an unlikely choice for a superhero movie, which makes it all the better--Spider-Man is the unlikely hero.  A high school kid, who takes a multi-tiered journey into unexpected greatness.  And the movie does an excellent job of nailing his history down perfectly.  The actors who play Aunt May and Uncle Ben are great, particularly May of course, as she's a constant positive force in Peter's life further down the road at all times.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst was good, she was pretty and fun (and yes, looked very good in the rain), but... I saw an interview with her I believe on Jay Leno a night or two before seeing the movie, and she just didn't seem ""in"" to it all. More like she got accepted in the role, but she never really loved her character, or at least didn't take the time to become intimate.  Though maybe that was just a first impression.  Tobey, like Chris Reeve did with Superman, treated the opportunity and the character with respect and admiration, and it showed on screen.  I guess I didn't get that feel with Dunst.<br/><br/>But like I said, just small blemishes.  Nothing takes away from Spider-Man being a knockout movie, hands-down blowing away most movies I've seen in the recent past.  It's good to see Marvel Comics back on their feet, after filing for bankruptcy a few years ago.  The movies should help a lot. X-Men was terrific, and a big hit, and now Spidey has his own franchise.  Plus there was a trailer for The Hulk, and I know through comicbook magazines and such that DareDevil: The Man Without Fear is up for production too.  All should be terrific if the same great admiration is paid to them as were for Spidey.<br/><br/>As a bit of a last-minute edit, now that some new comments are present, there's a comment one or two behind mine addressing some ""mistakes"" made by the film(makers).  One was asking how Spider-Man didn't obliterate Flash when they got in the fistfight in school, if he's so strong.  For the same reason Superman doesn't kill Lois Lane when he kisses her--control.  Not that hard.<br/><br/>Anyway, way to go, Web Head.  It's been a long time waiting, but well, well worth it.<br/><br/>-Chris"

","Before I get to the disection of this movie, I must begin with the background of course. When I was young, Spiderman comics were the best. I used to read it all the time. When I heard Sam Raimi and Spiderman, I thought it would be nothing shy of greatness. The Evil Dead series, Darkman, the Gift, and a Simple Plan have all been great. He has had his strikes (For Love of the Game and Quick and the Dead), but so has pretty much every director. Onward with the review. I know a friend who works at a theater so I had my own private showing. At about 12:00 am, the event began. A little over two hours later, I was horrified.<br/><br/>The Good: For one, the story was really good. Take note I said ""story"". Another huge plus was the cameo of all cameos by the immortal Bruce Campbell. Where is his supporting actor nom? Two thumbs up Bruce.<br/><br/>Now, without too many spoilers, the Bad: Where should I start? Hmm. Ok. First off, when Pete starts using his powers, he climbs up a building and runs across rooftops jumping. Let me just say, when he is running across the rooftop the effects were so AWFUL that it looked like Woody from Toy Story was doing the stunt work. After that, it was all down hill. The world of cinema must learn: At least attempt to make it look real. But why would they have to with a $114 million dollar opening. And if you can't make look real, try a different attmept. Usually with bad CG, you can ignore it. Not in this film. This movie made Blade 2 (another awful example of CG from hell) look like the Matrix. Now, remember when I said it had a good story? Please, do not confuse that with the dialog. The dialog between Parker and MJ was so awkwardly aweful, it actually made me feel awkward. It was terrible. I know that the comic had better dialog. If they did, why would you read it? Hmm. David Koepp is the man, but not with this web of filth. Now to the finish. Green Goblin. Not so much the charactar am I complaining about, but the HIDEOUS costume. It looked like it came from the clearance bin in your local halloween supplier.<br/><br/>All in all, 3 out of 10. And you can keep my spelling mistakes."

","This post may have spoilers in it, so please be careful when reading.<br/><br/>I went into the movie not expecting much. I am not a big fan of Toby McGuire (Spiderman) nor of Willem Dafoe (Green Goblin), so my expectations were low.<br/><br/>However, I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. The story was good, and the action was well done. I was able to suspend my disbelief for most of the movie, which is rare with action movies. In other words, no superhuman feats were thrown about recklessly, beyond what we are expected to take for granted (Spiderman's incredible strength and agility).<br/><br/>There are a few (rather small) problems that I encountered. First, although movies tend to stray from the original (a comic in this case), I am a little surprised at how they modified how Peter became Spiderman. He was bit by a spider - nothing more. Yes, I know the spider was genetically altered, but what happens if others are bitten by the spider? Will there be dozens of Spidermen out there? It just would have been nice if the event was truly unique.<br/><br/>Second, the romance was a bit overdone. This could have been trimmed a bit with no real loss. Third, I still can't get over the actors they chose for the role.<br/><br/>Outside of that, however, was a movie which featured some great action sequences, a good blend of comedy, and a not so subtle hint at a sequel. I'm sure to catch the next one."

Seeing this movie as an impartial viewer, I thought that is was entertaining as a fluff piece, but lacked originality.  Those who have seen the Superman and Batman series of movies will have already seen practically every element of this movie.  I was hoping that Spiderman would provide something original, but was disappointed.  And I must add that many of the CGI effects appeared rather fake, quite a drawback for a movie with such a high budget.  However, the ending leaves it wide open for a sequel, and I can only hope that the second installment in this series will be better done."
"TheVid","Null","0","0","7 May 2002"," Hollywood couldn't have made a better decision than to put Sam Raimi in charge of this costly comic-book movie.
","Raimi proved he had the stuff to make a great comic-book movie when he wowed audiences with his diabolically delightful DARKMAN.  Now with a budget of over a hundred-million dollars, he gets to wow comic afficionados and suburban PG-13'ers with SPIDERMAN.  He succeeds, although SPIDERMAN doesn't have the daring intensity or originality that DARKMAN had, nor does it offer a highlight like Jack Nicholson's performance in BATMAN.  I'm sure the studio-committee dictated some demigraphic preferences to Raimi with a project this big because it shows.  It's strictly state-of-the-art CGI, which is getting pretty routine lately, particularly after LORD OF THE RINGS and before ATTACK OF THE CLONES, but with a nicely-done screenplay and some passable performances.  I think everyone will accept the miscast, limp-wristed McGuire as Spiderman because he does a decent job here with what he's given.  DaFoe is fine as usual, but the Green Goblin (and to a lesser degree, the Spiderman action pieces) have the hokey look that was evident in the preview trailers.  SPIDERMAN is about as entertaining as a summer blockbuster currently gets."

The story telling was supperb, and including the wrestling, along all the little details of his discovering his spider powers was done perfectly.  While some changes were made to keep the film modern, like the spider being geneticly enginered instead of radioactive, and removing his first girl friend who does get killed by the Green Goblin which was done for the sake of time.

"aftiel","9","0","0","7 May 2002"," mostly excellent
","I loved this movie - 9 of 10.  It's the best comic-book-originated movie I've seen, including the original Batman.  And I am *not* usually a Marvel fan!  ""Spider-Man"" is a huge, honking, major exception to my usual prejudices.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is fabulous - the right mix of soulful, cheerful, and heroic. I didn't mind the modifications from the original comic book character (genetically enhanced vs. radioactive spider bite, as well as the web-glands thing) because Tobey stuck so faithfully to the idea of Petey P as a nerd's nerd.<br/><br/>What I didn't like was the Green Goblin - Dafoe was completely overblown, and the character was so totally unnecessary.  I was really disappointed because Dafoe is so great elsewhere, and he was completely wasted here.<br/><br/>
The best part of the movie for me, more than anything anything else, was seeing Petey P get used to his alter-ego - the idea of his superhero-side as a signifier for puberty and other weird changes is MUCH more interesting to me than a big technobaddie who laughs menacingly an awful lot.  We could have used more of the teen angst and confusion that Maguire does so well (even though he's only 3 years younger than me...).<br/><br/>There were some nice nods to NYC as well - remember the brouhaha that was made over the trailer that contained a web strung between the WTC towers? The writers seemed to compensate well for that - mentioning ""the bombing"" in passing in a boardroom scene, making it a reality as it is here in NYC today (I work downtown, and I used to work in Tower 1, so this really matters to me).  Also, the one building that gets beat up in a fight scene doesn't really exist in NYC, sparing us the heartache of seeing another site get destroyed.  Thirdly, of course, is a scene on the Queensboro Bridge, which I won't ruin for everyone except to say that it's a nice feel-good NYC moment - a little hokey, but much appreciated and very sorely needed.  Folks in the Chelsea cinema where I saw the film cheered loudly at this bit, which was cool - we all really needed to cheer.<br/><br/>Something else I liked was that the movie was not blatantly sexy, and was therefore VERY sexy.  The upside-down kiss in the rain is worth the price of admission alone.  Both Maguire and Dunst have a fresh-faced appeal that makes it *nice*, which is rather novel.  I've been a fan of Maguire's since ""Pleasantville"", and of Dunst's since ""Drop Dead Gorgeous"", so it's nice to see them reacting off each other.  The only adult moment happens when Dunst's dress gets awwwwful sheer in the rain - but all things considered, that's really not so bad.<br/><br/>In short, go see it, but keep in mind that it may be scary for young kids. At the same time, it may be great for older kids who need to see a normal-nerd-as-superhero with morals and genuine charm.<br/><br/>Now, where can I find Tobey Maguire?  And convince him that 30 isn't so very old at all?"
"montbrilliant","Null","0","0","7 May 2002"," DaFoe truly was wonderful
","I thought this movie was quite effective, and was certainly far better than I expected. This film proves that by combining enough talent to make a decent film, along with an uber-agressive marketing campaign and a character that already has mounds of fans from many different generations, not only can a film be highly successful on opening weekend, but it can continue to do well (as I'm sure it will) because the audience is given just what they want and deserve.<br/><br/>This film has been well received by those critics who understand how wide a demographic this film had to please. Therefore, the film had to serve many roles for many people. Firstly, the film couldn't be overly complicated, which is wasn't. This was perfect for the smaller kids, who would love the quick action(which some say were too quick, but I'm sure the producers didn't want to scare children with gratuitous violence) and the borderline cartoony flavor of the film.<br/><br/>For teens, there is the ability to identify with Peter Parker's flaws and vicariously delight in his new found superpowers and his overcoming of the school bully. For the girls, there was the romance between Mary Jane and Parker, which was effective.<br/><br/>For adults, there is William DaFoe, who gave a SORELY underrated performance. I have heard so many critics say he did a horrible job, and I am so disappointed in this. Would they have rather ARNOLD play the character? Jesus, if anyone else had played the character of Norman Osborn, it would have been a disaster. He played it off so well that he was far more realistic than any other character. They blame DaFoe for the shortcomings of the character, but the character was true to the comic. I have heard critics insulting the ""insanity scenes"" where Norman talks to himself in a mirror, but it was supposed to be dramatic, and he did a job that few could match. Hearing him laugh near the ending when his son arrived was hysterical.<br/><br/>Older folks taking their grandkids will love Ben and Aunt May, who were a bit hokey, but I'm sure they wouldn't appear that way to loving grandparents.<br/><br/>Of course, J.Jonah Jameson was terrific (""Mr. Jameson, your wife is on the phone, she wants to know..."" ::CLICK::) and one of my favorites was BONE SAW, the wrestler ""Three minutes of PLAYTIME."" Even the criminal who killed Uncle Ben was well played. Wonderful casting ALL AROUND.<br/><br/>Yeah, I guess you could say I liked it =) The only disappointments were the full fledged CG in the action scenes... a few more Bruce Lee type scenes would have been far better (and cheaper) than the computer animated scenes (it is just hard to identify with ""sprites"") and the corniness of some of the lines, as well as the arbitrary tagline, and the ""American Flag"" ending, which was bordering ""Independence Day"" corniness... but once again, this was supposed to be a comic book like film, so I understand that any of the hokey parts were probably done on purpose, as well as the ""thank God for this, thank God for that..."" and ""Peter, you said asked 'Aunt May, Aunt May, is that an ANGEL?'"" which were aimed towards the 'ignorant, blindly patriotic and Christian American masses' demographic.<br/><br/>So maybe it wasn't the greatest action film in history, but it was certainly the best of the best when it comes to comic book adaptations."
"freenachos","8","0","0","8 May 2002"," Swinging Fun
","I've never left a movie saying ""I sure would like more explosions and punching!""  but the action was very appealing in this movie and I actually thought there could be more.<br/><br/>I remember Batman coming out in 1989 and the way it made a superhero fresh, new and exciting.  I'm not a comic book fan but I was glad to see Spider-Man getting the same treatment.<br/><br/>With what little I know, this movie did do the comic justice.  Now that effects allow more superhuman powers for the actors, Spider-Man's jumping and swinging come off very well done.  Think about it, Spider-Man isn't just flying straight ahead.  You can't put some guy on a table in front of a blue screen to pull off the dramatic arcing motions of swinging from building to building 20 stories off the ground.  The effects here were well done.  It was especially impressive that the movie's action often took place in broad daylight with no dark shadows available to hide wires or distract the viewer from mediocre tricks. <br/><br/>The story was clear from the start when Peter Parker said it's about a girl. This is a love story and it doesn't suck like the love story that bogged down Independence Day and other Hollywood ""blockbusters"".  The plot is full of soap opera like twists and triangles (though ""soap opera"" is not a fair term).  Tobey MacGuire is convincing as a superhero because he's convincing as the alter ego, Parker, from the start.  Willem Dafoe is a great villain. His hard features and gravely voice are perfect for a comic book bad-guy.<br/><br/>Hey, I liked the action scenes and the overall look of this film.  It's a very pretty movie with a cool story!"

","As a movie lover, I thought that I had missed out on something big because I didn't go to see ""Spider-Man"" during opening weekend, considering that this movie broke box office records and all. I went to see this movie today, and I realized that this movie was average at best, and I didn't miss out on anything. The fact that droves of people went to see this movie this past weekend proves that this movie was marketed very well. The previews had made this movie seem like it was going to be larger-than-life. I remember seeing the first preview for it last December, when I went to see ""Lord of the Rings"". At that moment, I couldn't wait to see ""Spider-Man"". Now that I've seen it, I can only wish that this had been a better movie. I was expecting so much more. I remember that I used to love watching the Spiderman cartoon on tv when I was a little kid back in the early eighties. In fact, when I walked into the movie theater today the theme song from that cartoon played in my mind: ""Spiderman, Spiderman...your friendly neighborhood Spiderman..."" I was truly hoping that the ""Spider-Man"" movie would be as enjoyable as the cartoon had been. Yet, I was let down with what I saw. Willem Dafoe (who already has a weird appearance) spent most of his screen time making all sorts of unusual facial expressions, as he struggled with his inner beast...and the Green Goblin costume was just too fake-looking, too unrealistic. Tobey Maguire was a good choice to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man, but he and Kirsten Dunst had no chemistry. And, the special effects were a bit too much. In a lot of the scenes, the special effects made this movie look like if it were a movie made on a computer, rather than a movie filmed with a camera. Anyway, by seeing this movie, I gained peace of mind. I wanted to see just how good of a movie this was, and if it was worth the hype. Fortunately, I only paid $3.50 for the ticket, since I went to the twilight show. Needless to say, I was disappointed. One thing I did find appealing was the preview for ""The Hulk"", and the fact that it is being directed by Ang Lee, of all people. I surely look forward to seeing how that movie is going to turn out."

But Sam Raimi is such a god I decided I would go and give it a chance. I was thrilled I did, I am definitely a fan of THIS Spiderman. Which is odd because part of the charm is that they followed the comic storyline so closely that it really did justice to its origins, in fact somehow was better than the comic ever was. I never liked Spiderman, I think because Peter Parker always seemed like such a pansy, he had these great abilities but never seemed to overcome being an annoying geek. Don't get me wrong, I love the geek turns cool' storyline, or geek gets superpowers' but Parker always came up short in my opinion, he never made me care about him. Luckily for me THIS version of Spiderman captured the nature of Peter's geekiness without making him obnoxious. I actually LIKED Peter Parker, and I cared about his character. The film's actors were well worth watching and incredibly engaging. I was thrilled beyond words to see Bruce Campbell and Ted Raimi in their respective roles. I walked out of the theater listening to a myriad of voices saying, `That was great.. ` and even though I had walked in with the opinion I probably wouldn't like it; I had to agree. If you want to see a great film about a superhero, check out Spiderman, its well worth your time and money.

Let's face it -- Superman may be well-nigh invincible, and Batman was richer than God, but Spidey was the superhero we all wished we could be.  Peter Parker was one of US.  That sense is well presented in the film; Tobey Maguire is excellent, and hopefully he will be reprising the role in the future.  In fact, there isn't a bad performance in the film.  Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst (with a bad dye job), and Cliff Robertson and the rest of the cast do a great job.<br/><br/>** SPOILERS **<br/><br/>However, there are some drawbacks.  This is most definitely a formula film; some of the reviewers mention the parallels to Superman, especially Cliff Robertson/Glenn Ford, but there are also parallels to Batman, such as the parent(s)' murder prompting the crime-fighting.  The problem is that we can all see these clichés coming a mile away.  When the movie tries new material, such as the wrestling match and his first costume (hilarious!), it works so much better.  Especially good was Spidey's realization that his spiteful inaction was directly responsible for a tragic event.  On the other hand, I don't know why every one of these films has to include at least one dark-alley butt kicking, and Spider-Man has more than one.  Can't we get one in a mall once in a while?  Or doesn't crime strike the suburbs?  At least this movie was shot in a real city, instead of a Tim Burton monstrosity -- a very nice touch, since Spidey was always more about reality than Batman or Superman.<br/><br/>The special effects are great, and in fact may be a little TOO good.  Our hero begins to look and move more like a video game -- a really GOOD video game, but it still looks fake.  Other than that small quibble, the money they spent was well used.<br/><br/>Overall, a great popcorn movie and it certainly will fulfill moviegoer's expectations.  Maybe this one will make enough money so that the sequel can do better at moving past the clichés.  My vote is an 8 out of ten.  Spidey rules!"

","This movie was quite a disappointment. I obviously wasn't expecting Shakespeare, but this movie was just corny and cartoonish. The performance of Willem Dafoe was over-the-top overdramatic and laughable. Many people in the packed theater that I saw the movie in with laughed at many of his supposed intense scenes. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst were just boring, flat, and lifeless. I suppose I was expecting a ""cooler"" movie, in the vain of Batman. Then again, Tim Burton directed that movie, and this one had Sam Raimi at the helm. Obviously, these are two very different directors, but even so, I wasn't expecting the heavy-handed cheesiness that Spider-Man delivered. Sam Raimi is quite overrated in my opinion, directing such terrible movies as, The Gift, For Love of the Game, and The Quick and the Dead. He was definitely no better here. I have no problem with Spider-Man raking in the record-breaking bucks that it has so far and will seemingly continue to for a while (and I have NO problem with ANY movie breaking the all time record of Titanic), but that does not make this a good, or even entertaining, movie. Overall, just a lot of talented actors in a bad blockbuster. (Not the first time)."

What better person than Raimi to bring it to life.<br/><br/>This truly is up there with the greats like The Matrix of recent times.<br/><br/>Even my wife said...""Wow cool I wanna be like that""....<br/><br/>So can we please have Spiderwomen in the next movie?  You never know it could turn into a fantasy!  Now, I wonder if they still sell spiderman costumes?<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour, relex let go and watch the movie.  It's cool.<br/><br/>Great Casting, Great Direction, Great Atmosphere, Classic story.<br/><br/>I just can't believe Comic Book are still so cool today.  The start of the Movie had a HULK advert, looks like we are in for a bunch of great comic book movies!!<br/><br/>
Note: other comments about the Green Goblin Dressup - it's supposed to be a power costume!  That's explained earler in the film, what you really wanted two superheros in tights fighting it out? It's 2002 for God's sake - wake up!  William Dafoe does a great job here.... as always..."
"mgchainsaw","10","0","0","8 May 2002"," I thought it was great
","All right, I'm a Spider-Man fan.  Have been since I was little.  Too lazy to read the Comics, I did see all the cartoons and do remember running around the house screaming ""I'm Spider-Man"" and pretending to<br/><br/>fire webs by pressing the button on my hand and jumping around the house much to my mother's chagrin.  What I was hoping for most was that this movie would bring back that joy and inflated sense of self-esteem, and it did all that.  I was truly jazzed watching the guy swing around the city (and it did look amazingly believable).  <br/><br/>The story was pretty much as expected with a few changes here and there.  I can roll with that.  I do wish that the Goblin wasn't wearing a mask the whole time, but it didn't really do any harm.  The movie was just pure escapism, and it was just what I was hoping for.  I do wish that some of the scenes in the movie weren't quite as frightening cuz I wish I could bring my 7 year old boy, but I fear nightmare repercussions.  If he was 9 I would be happy with the movie the way it is, though.  Call me selfish.<br/><br/>So, if you're more than 9, go see the movie.  I'd be really surprised if you don't like it, unless you really put an effort toward not liking it.<br/><br/>Oh, one more thing.  I thought Tobey MacGuire was great, and the guy who played Jamison.  Kirsten Dunst was pretty good (although I don't really see all the hubbub about her)."
"kgprophet","7","0","0","8 May 2002"," Anyone reading this?
","This movie will probably set a record for the number of reviews posted.  So why waste your time reading mine?<br/><br/>Ok,  my review.  I didn't follow Spidey too much when I was young.  I was however,  struck by how the whole story resembled Superman.  I mean, sure, the comic books needed to follow certain staples on super-hero lore,  but come on.  (SPOILERS!!) - Cliff Robertson is a dead ringer for Glenn Ford in Superman,  he even looks like him! - Peter goes to the big city and gets a job on the newspaper- hmmm,  bump into Klark Kent working there?  The editor spits out lines exactly like Jackie Cooper. -Peter gets all bent out of shape when his uncle/dad dies.  Prompting him to use his powers to help the people he's close to. - As much as Peter loves his sweetheart,  he eventually breaks it off to fight crime. - The Bad Guy kidnaps his sweetheart to lure him into a confrontation. - A big flying battle on the streets of Manhattan.<br/><br/>Having said that,  I did not have high expectations for yet another comic book hero movie.  I was actually very pleased with the results.  The movie provided a story that didn't try to rush through plot points.  Although it very conveniently puts all the characters in the right place at them right time for the story to go where it does. Such as how the bad guy discovers the identity of Spiderman.  One of the best things about the film is Tobey Maguire.  He is pitch perfect as Peter, and has a good handle on the emotions.  You can feel the anger build in him.  I also applaud the screenplay for trying it's best to avoid the cliches, kudos to David Koepp. Even Sam Raimi, who is great with comic book imagery,  shows more depth than any film he's ever done.  He definitely knocks Tim Burton and his bad Batflicks out of the water.  <br/><br/>So I believe I am like the 547th person to post a review.   I hope there is someone reading this.  Most of the other reviews are like carbon copies with the same word,  like ""Awesome"".   My suggestion to you other guys,  if you want to give some helpful advice about the movie you saw,  find some other words to use besides 'good'.  (""The story was good,  the acting was good, the special effects were good,  all in all a good film"").  A review like that really has nothing to offer anyone else reading it.  Get in touch with your feelings!  Find something unique to say!  <br/><br/>6 out of 10"
"konover","10","0","0","8 May 2002"," Best super-hero movie since Superman II
","Spiderman is the best super-hero film since 1980's Superman II. A lot of people here compare Spiderman to the Batman movies, but in actuality, Spiderman is very close in tone to Superman II and the second-half of Superman: The Movie, (although Superman II BADLY needs a special edition since it looks a bit aged). <br/><br/>In fact, it seems to me that Sam Raimi (allegedly a fan of the Superman movies) gave a nod to Superman when he had Peter Parker running, and opening his shirt to reveal the Spiderman costume, which Reeve did in the opening moments of Superman II and in his first ""transition"" in Superman: The Movie.<br/><br/>My only complaints about the movie was that the special effects were,  at times, somewhat unconvincing and the musical score lacked the majesty of the Superman and Batman themes. However, the creators of the films were able to emphasize their energy on equally, if not, more important details.<br/><br/>I agree entirely with film critics who said Raimi and the writers were able to find the right dosage of action, drama, sympathy and humor in the story. And the result is a satisfying movie with good performances to match and mostly very good special effects to culminate with one of the best films to be based on a mainstream action-oriented character.<br/><br/>Tobey McGuire is to Spiderman what Christopher Reeve was to Superman. McGuire BECAME Spiderman. His transformation from a picked-on teenager to superhero was wonderful acting, and I'll be looking forward to his next outing as the wall-crawler. <br/><br/>Willem DaFoe was outstanding, as usual. I'd rank his crazed-interpretation of the Green Goblin to be up there with Jack Nicholson's The Joker. There are no lame performances in the film. Kirsten Dunst, although some say she didn't have a lot to work with, was wonderful as Mary Jane. Contrary to critics who preferred the second half of the film, I was more intrigued with Peter's growth and relationship with Mary Jane than when he engaged the Green Goblin in obligatory battle. Don't get me wrong, I also enjoyed the action, but we all know what super-hero movies are predictably about: good vs. evil. What makes them special and what sets some comic/action films apart from others are the characterizations between the kicking ass. It's the stuff that the very best super-hero films are made of: Superman I, Superman II, Batman Returns, X-Men and Spiderman are all examples of comic films that delivered the action, but also had interesting character relationships in between to bring us closer to the characters we like.<br/><br/>No doubt the iconoclastic film buffs will come out of the woodwork in droves and look for any reason to bash Spiderman, but make no mistake. If you're even a casual fan of characters like Spiderman and don't get too caught up in the hype, you should be in for a great time."

","I love Toby McGuire, and as Peter Parker he was perfect.  But I just never was able to believe he was in the Spider-man costume.  Kirsten Dunst seemed very stiff and flat in the role of Mary Jane. The special effects were good, but I don't go to a movie to see special effects.  Also, far too often it was very easy to tell where the live action ended the animation began. All in all I was very disappointed in the movie."

Every day since then I looked for information and 2 years ago I read the script by James Cameron.<br/><br/>I am so greatfull that this movie really goes into the backstory of Peter Parker. How he became Spider-Man, what mistakes he made before he became a hero, his affection for Mary-Jane. Also I'm actually glad Sam Raimi decided to go for mutation in stead of invention when we take a look to the webshooting. I also believed that Peter Parker couldn't make those webshooters. (I actually tried to make them myself using soap and bubblegum when I was 11 :) )<br/><br/>To conclude: This movie really is good.

Now a days, it's hard to get wowed by a movie, cause you seen this, saw that....mostly everything has been seen or done. Matrix was awsome, cause it gave us something new, and the last movies that wowed me was Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings. Now, Spidy was just a great movie, and the Goblin was a cool villian. Basicly we see how Peter Parker deals with the new found powers, but also deal with everyday problems, and the guilt that has fallen upon him. When X-Men topped Batman for superhero movies, setting the bar of what to expect...Spidy did the same to that movie. We have a new champ folks."
"Robert_duder","9","0","0","8 May 2002"," Amazing Spiderman!!
","I was anxiously awaiting this movie. I expected high flying action, good fun, and a decent movie. What met me was three times that!! Sam Raimi blew me away with what is probably the best Super Hero film ever made. It wasn't dark, but it wasn't light-hearted, the phenomenal thing about this movie was that it was real. The world around Peter Parker and Spiderman was our world. Raimi did not ""Comic Book-ize"" the world like they did for Batman or Superman movies. It was our world, it was like looking right out our front windows. <br/><br/>Tobey Maquire was the ideal choice for the run of the mill kid, who is picked on and misunderstood and pining for the beautiful popular girl. The popular girl is played by Kirsten Dunst who we know can look like a goddess or in this case, truly, actually look like the girl next door. Raimi is brilliant...this movie was filmed in what I call real-life. He took a fantasy about a kid bit by a spider and brought Spiderman into the real world. Maguire and Dunst both look like the average kid and I don't think a lot of make up was used to cover their imperfections and blemishes. Instead Raimi allowed them to look like human beings. The story for Spiderman follows true to the comics. Peter Parker, while on a school trip is bit by a genetically altered Spider and wakes up the next morning, stronger, faster, healthier, with enhanced...well everything. Immediately thinking of his own personal gain, Parker uses his powers to take on a wrestler and when he's cheated by the wrestling promoter he gets even by allowing a crook to rob the Promoter. Moments later Parker discovers that by letting that crook get away his beloved Uncle Ben (who is like Peter's father) is murdered by that crook. From that moment on Peter Parker vows to fight injustice with the words of Uncle Ben ringing in his ears...""with great power, comes great responsibility."" This movie spans the course of several years in Peter's life and Raimi covers that whole time without making us feel rushed or crammed together...instead it flows together, and leaves us riveted to the screen. Franco and Dafoe play Father and Son, and Dafoe during a experiment loses his mind and his personality is split into the Green Goblin who uses top secret Military technology to destroy the city. Dafoe is just brilliant as the evil Green Goblin and his alter ego, the suave Dr. Osbourn. Franco who plays Harry Osbourn, Peter Parker's best friend looks and acts so much like Dafoe that they are the most believable father and son in movies in years. The story is so depthy and full of emotion and action. <br/><br/>The computer generated effects at times are almost cartoonish which I always HATE but Raimi uses enough effects mixed with live action that it flows well and you don't notice the computerized Spiderman nearly as much. Spiderman himself is also amazing as he should be. The costume and Maquire playing him make him the greatest hero on screen in years. This movie is so fantastic because it is so SIMPLISTIC!! It's like you're watching right down town Hometown. I honestly don't know if Raimi could pull off a sequel with the same quite subtlty and simplicity but I would love to see him try. I would pay the 10 bucks to not only see a sequel but I would even love to see Spiderman again. The running time was the better part of two hours and it was the perfect length. Everything about this movie was just enough of everything. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!! This is the great Blockbuster for the summer!!! 9/10"
"DaDrill","8","0","0","8 May 2002"," A Bit Too Much Violence...
","The casting was top notch, the special effects very good, although a bit suspect in a few swinging cases when Spidey seemed a bit out of proportion to his surroundings. The violence was aimed at teenagers who have been weaned on WWF baloney, and if Spidey can get easily cut, how does he live through a fire and getting slammed through numerous walls?  I realize it's basically a cartoon, but even the kids with me commented on that aspect.  There was a lot of random violence which minimized the value of human life, but that's how you make a bad guy bad these days. Not as good as the original Superman or Batman, although they are now very out of date due to our increased technology, but good enough that I will go see the sequel."

","Being a semi-retired comic fan, I highly anticipated this movie.  When it was first announced I was skeptical, but as I heard more I became excited. Sam ""Evil Dead"" Raimi was the perfect director for the material.  Tobey Maguire seemed to be the perfect Parker and Willem Dafoe was near the top of my list for favorite candidates for the Green Goblin.  I became quite excited for it, but not TOO excited.<br/><br/>
Did the movie meet me expectations?  Yes.  It was very good, but not fantastic.  The movie was very true to the comic with a few exceptions (no web shooters, skipping Gwen Stacey).  The acting was quite strong from everyone involved, especially James Franco who manages to make Harry an incredibly likable guy without much screen time.  The characters FELT like they did in the comic which was very important.  The effects were completely ""buyable"" despite some complaints I've heard about them around the web. Danny Elfman's score, while not as good as his previous comic book efforts on ""Batman"" was strong support, if not memorable.  The final fight sequence was also a little disappointingly a ""I beat you until you look beaten, you beat me until I look beaten"" affair.  Given the level of style and the fact that these characters can soar through the air and all the agility at Spidey's disposal, this was a bit anticlimactic.<br/><br/>One problem I had with the movie was the some of the dialogue, was REALLY awful.  Some of Mary Jane and Peter's lines to each other felt like pre-written gushy letters rather than lines that people are speaking at the spur of the moment.  Spidey didn't make as many witty comments as he did in the book either.  The highlight of the writing definitely has to be the way that Harry Osborn was written.  In some ways he was the most likable character in the movie, and if the movie series goes the same way as the comics do with his character, well I won't reveal what might happen for those who didn't read the comic in the early 1990s.  <br/><br/>All in all a fun effort and a great success by Raimi and all involved.<br/><br/>8/10"

Nonetheless, this movie marked the first time since the Matrix came out in which I thoroughly enjoyed a movie from start to finish.  I actually left the theatre still excited about it, dreaming of whatever sequel will come of it.<br/><br/>The effects were great, but they weren't overly intrusive; there was still a movie going on at the same time as the effects.  So many movies will more or less put the story on hold to squeeze in some worthless special effect, but Spider Man actually used the special effects to complement the story and not BE the story.  It was also wonderfully written, like a direct animation from the Marvel pages themselves.  I could almost feel myself turning the pages as the movie went from scene to scene.<br/><br/>I rank this movie a 9...great, but not immortal.  Its simply what every comicbook based movie SHOULD be."
"The_Sun_Toucher","8","0","0","6 May 2002"," I Can Live With This......
","It's finally here.  Most of us hardcore fans have already  seen it at least twice.  We've spent the last two years visiting our favorite movie sites daily, devouring all of the latest ""updates"".  We've debated even the most minute details in chat rooms and on message boards like these.<br/><br/> But after the credits roll, after we come down from the initial high of seeing our favorite web-slinger finally swing across the silver screen, How does ""Spider-Man"" measure up?  Is it the great comic book adaption we've been waiting for?<br/><br/> ""Spider-Man"" is quite enjoyable, to be sure.  One of the more enjoyable ""summer blockbusters"" I've seen in sometime.  While it delivers quite well in terms of sheer entertainment value, it's not without it's flaws.  I'm guessing it will be about as popular as the first ""Batman"" at the Box-office, and will probably inspire just as much debate.<br/><br/> In Sam Riami, we have a director who is not only Knowledgeable about the mythology of the title character, but who is more than suited for this type of material.<br/><br/> Sam directs from a script by David Keopp that is surprisingly faithful to the origins of the character.  Sam and David make an interesting choice in that they don't take the subject matter deadly seriously, as Tim Burton did with Batman.  They approach spidey with a sense of the absurd, allowing moments of slapstick to find their way into some of the films key action set-pieces (Peter's outrageous wrestling costume was a particularly nice touch).  This is sometimes to the detriment of the fight scenes in terms of believability.  Sam brings a 50's B-movie sensibility to the material that makes the proceedings a little more fun than they might have been, had Sam and company taken the ever-trendy ""Dark"" approach that is so prevelent with films of this type.<br/><br/> It is obvious that this is a film crafted by people who adore this character.  During the scenes where spidey swings through the canyon's of Manhatten, the film itself seems almost in awe of him.  If the films CGI effects weren't so obvious, maybe that feeling would've translated a little better, but no matter.  The scenes are basically what they should be.<br/><br/> We also get a very sympathetic Peter Parker in Tobey Maguire.  Could someone else have done better?  Maybe, but I'm more than content with the version of Peter presented here.  I only wish that Spidey himself were a little more interesting.  We never get any insight as to the change Peter undergoes when he puts on the mask.<br/><br/> One of the more disappointing aspects of the film is that it has no distinct visual look of it's own.  Compared to ""Blade 2"", ""Spider-Man"" feels rather subdued and generic.  Even more so when you consider that this was directed by the same man who made ""The Evil Dead"" films.<br/><br/> As an adaption, Spider-Man gets an 8 out of 10.  As a film, I give it a 7. Is it what we've been waiting for?  Yes and no.  Is it that best adaption ever? No.  Richard Donner's Superman still holds that distinction, but's a damn sight better than any of the Batman films."

","If you are a Spider Man fan, or if you don't know who Spider Man is, this movie is for you.  It is a great example of translating a comic book into a movie while retaining the ""spirit"" of the original story without being bound to it.<br/><br/>The origins of Spider Man the comic book hero are different than those of Spider Man the movie hero.  Yet I felt that the story was appropriate for today's technology and for the big screen.<br/><br/>The sequence of scenes where Peter discovers his super powers made the movie worth while by itself.  The character development that turned him into a super hero however, made the movie excellent.<br/><br/>The casting of Toby Maguire as Peter Parker/Spidey, worked well.  The actor who played JJ Jameson, JK Simmons, was over the top enough to portray the character without being so exaggerated as to be useless.  Willem Dafoe did ok as the Green Goblin, but I think the writing (or editing?) let him down where there could have been a bit more done with that character.  Kirsten Dunst played the anguished Mary Jane with aplomb.<br/><br/>The CG enhancements looked better on the big screen than in some of the earlier commercials, IMHO. And gave Spidey the ""super hero"" ability that ""plain ol' acting"" just can't do.<br/><br/>All in all I give the movie two thumbs up.  More praise would I give it, had I but more thumbs."

","I don't go to movies very often (once a month or so), and following a series of disappointments this year, I didn't have high hopes for Spider-Man either. Let me say, this movie blew me away. From the opening until the closing credits began to roll, I felt enchanted. It really felt like the collective dream movies are supposed to be. The casting was excellent, the music was perfect, the writing was seamless, the special effects were impressive. The acting was natural and fantastic at once. It was really just a good story that flowed naturally and quickly from beginning until end. I didn't notice the time passing. I didn't wonder how much was left. It was just great, the perfect mingling of heroism and angst. I was so pleased with the entire experience. The audience I was with was perfect- we laughed together, we cheered together. I realize how hokey this sounds about what NPR described as 'us paying nine dollars for the director's therapy,' but it was really just great. The best movie I have seen in quite a while."

","This is an excellent adaptation of the comic. I hope they can get the same cast to return for the sequels. The FX are impressive, and they really did a good job of showing how Parker adapts to his new-found powers. I hope they make the Hulk and the next X-Men in the same way. Marvel is finally making the movies from their bread and butter series, and from the look s of this one, they should keep doing it. Will absolutely see this one again."

","Whether you're a die-hard long time fan of Spidey like me, or you don't even know who Peter Parker is, you will enjoy this movie. That's because while this is an incredibly accurate adaptation of the classic Marvel comic, it is also just a very well made movie. The characters all interact beautifully, which is in part due to the spectacular performances by Maguire, Dafoe and Dunst. Also, although his part was small, J.K. Simmons did a hilariously wonderful job of portraying the pig-headed J. Jonah Jameson.<br/><br/>
In addition, there is something for everyone in this movie. It's not overloaded with action scenes, as some may fear, and it has enough to satisfy those who desire such. The special effects were amazing, despite a few obvious instances of a CGI Spidey, and the fight scenes were very fun to watch. The only thing I wished there had been more of were Spidey's wise cracks. Nothing is more enjoyable than his sarcastic banter with the super-villains. However, there was enough to keep me happy.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a great movie no matter what kind of movies you like. I've seen it twice already in just the first three days, and I plan on seeing it again."
"ztkl40a","8","0","0","6 May 2002"," Pretty good movie, especially for a comic book
","I gave this movie an 8 out of 10.  Out of the comic book movies I've seen (all the Batmans, all the Supermans, X-men, Spawn, and a few others that I can't think of right now), this ranks at the top along with the first Batman.  Out of all the movies I've ever seen, it's good, but not the greatest.<br/><br/>Let me start out by saying that I never read the comic, but followed the latest incarnation of the cartoon and watched the 80's version when I was a kid.  So I'm not the most die-hard fan, but I know the basics of the story. There were a few changes to condense the storyline into a two hour movie, but the movie stayed very faithful to the spirit of Spider-Man.  The fact that Stan Lee was an executive producer must have helped with this.<br/><br/>The casting of the main characters was good.  I thought Willem Defoe as the Green Goblin/Norman Osbourne and J.K. Simmons as Jonah Jameson did the best, although Simmons appeared in a dissapointingly small amount of the movie. Tobey Maguire did an excellent job as Peter Parker.  I was a bit worried about seeing Kirsten Dunst as a red-head, but after the first five minutes, it was no longer distracting, and she did a good job as Mary Jane.  James Franco performed well for the character he had.<br/><br/>The story was pretty good, but not great (it's based on a comic, after all). It's not the typical good vs. evil (although it's close), it's a bit deeper.  Harry Osbourne is not portrayed as a completely evil person.  He's a business exec trying to save his company and his place in it.  Once he becomes the Green Goblin, there's still the distress he has over the actions he commits as the Goblin.  And Peter Parker is not all good.  He eventually becomes a hero, but not after his initial apathy towards the people of the city.  And in keeping with the spirit of Spider-Man, he has problems in his personal life both related and unrelated to his superpowers.<br/><br/>The special effects were also good but not great.  This is not so much a fault of the creators, but of the technology itself.  It is some of the most convincing animation of a human form in action yet created, but the images still look a bit cartoonish.  Hopefully the technology will be better by the sequel.<br/><br/>Anyway, to sum it up, I only make it out to the big screen about four or five times a year, but I'm going to try to watch this movie in the theatres again.  I'll get the DVD as soon as it comes out, and I'm looking forward to the sequel.  As long as you don't expect this movie to be the next Godfather or Casablanca, and you're not too tied to the exact letter of the comic, you'll probably enjoy this movie."

","(WARNING: THIS COMMENT CONTAINS SPOILERS)<br/><br/>Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is somewhat of your typical high-school nerd.  He is a borderline genius who can't handle a simple conversation with the girl next door who he has loved for years, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  He works on the school paper, has coke-bottle thick glasses, and is spindly at best.  No wonder he is the point of all cruel jokes.  One day when the school is touring a science lab they go through an exhibit where scientists are trying to genetically mutate spiders combine all the individual powerful attributes of spiders into one ""super-spider."" Unfortunately they don't know that one is missing.  Parker finds it as it bites him on the hand.  The rest of the day is a blur as he feels himself getting more and more sick.  When he returns to his Aunt and Uncle's house that night he passes out and has strange dreams involving the spider. The next day things are different.  Peter finds he doesn't need his glasses and he appears to have gone from scrawny to having the body of a gymnist as he slept.  Stranger things are beginning to happen as his hands stick to things and a weird web-like substance is coming out of his wrist. After he defeates the school bully in a joke of a fight he finds himself running in panic into an alley.  When he remembers the bite on his hand he begins to have an idea and, being the scientist that he hopes to be, he tries an experiment.  Before he knows it he is crawling up the side of a building and jumping the roof tops.  He is even learning how to shoot the webs from his wrist. Like most teen-agers who suddenly have power he decides that with a lot of money would come the girl of his dreams.  Parker enters a professional wrestling ring for an exhibition bout dressed as ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" and promptly destroys the giant of a man.  Unfortunately things begin going to his head and he lets a robber get away from him with devestating consequences.  Suddenly he learns to his horror that, ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility.""  Parker uses a newly designed costume as well as increased skill with his powers to help the citizens of New York. Unfortunately Parker is not your average super-hero.  He isn't rich and doesn't have a trust fund so while battling crime on the side, he also has to find a place to live, get a job, see about getting into college, take care of his Aunt, and oh yeah...dare we forget that with the rise of a super-hero and villain is bound to appear? Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) is the father of Parker's best friend. He is rich, a brilliant inventor, and after ingesting a super-soldier type formula, quite insane.  Osborn dons the exo-skelton he had been designed for the military as well as stealing a glider and is quickly dubbed The Green Goblin by the press.  As we all know, the two will eventually battle.  The real question is how Parker is going to handle battling a villain who he frequently hangs out with for dinner when Norman drops by to see his son, Harry. This was really well-worth the wait.  Fans of the comic will really not have too many complaints.  Sure they have changed some things for simple continuity but nothing great has been changed.  People who haven't read the comic will also be able to follow this introductory story (since there will most certaintly be a sequel). Sam Raimi directs this with much of the style that he has done similar features previously with the Evil Dead series.  This has many dark tones but is also infused with the humor that helps move the story along.  There were a few slow moments but overall nothing that would cause the fans to lose interest.  The special effects are worth every penny that has been paid. Certainly many things do look computer generated but it is done in such as style as to closely mimic the drawings that would appear in the comic. Casting was always a major worry in this movie.  Many people, such as myself, were worried to hear that Tobey Maguire had been cast.  Sure he had done a wonderful job in The Cider-House Rules and certainly he had held his own in the idiotic Wonder Boys, but casting him as Spider-Man???  Well, I have to apologize to Mr. Maguire because he certainly did a wonderful job hear.  He definitely was able to handle the dramatic moments and also carried more than a certain sly charm that allowed him to do the trade-mark quips that fans of Spider-Man have come to expect.  He also has spent an incredible amount of time with the personal trainers and that showed.  I for one will willingly back him for the sequels and hope that we don't have a fiasco similar to Batman with the actor changing each film. Willem Dafoe is probably ""the weakest link"" in the movie and that is more from the writing of his character than how he does.  I think that at times they made his acting a tad too comic-bookish if you will but that really wouldn't be his fault. I approached this movie with a certain amount of trepidation and yet enthusiastically.  Spider-Man is a comic-book hero that many can identify with since he seems to have the most human problems of them all. Thankfully the writers and direction of the movie all worked exceptionally well."

","One thing I appreciated was the honest treatment of the original tale. If you are looking for a vast departure and a new-wave perspective on Spider-Man (tho I can't think of why) don't see this film. Although the scenery is contemporary the concept of Spider-Man is totally consistent with Stan Lee's original story. Maybe I am gushing too much but I think that Raimi did an outstanding job and made a tale as familiar as Spider-Man exciting to see.<br/><br/>The casting was perfect and the movie is extremely efficient with no absurd scenes made-up to display some new effect or director's fancy. Two hours seem like one.<br/><br/>I have noticed that movie critics while praising the film also have reservations about lauding it completely and they may be correct in their view. One critic stated that while it is a fun movie and a great ride it does not have the epic feel that Superman had. I would agree with that since that isn't what the story is about. Spider-Man has always centered on one guys dilemma and the tough choices he will make. The story is a morality-play with action and adventure.<br/><br/>Anyone familiar with the tale of Spider-Man will rejoice in its faithful adherence to the story and be wowed by the action and the performances. Make no misconception this film has been made by fans of Spider-Man but holds universal appeal to all audiences.<br/><br/>Spider-Man, of course, has sequel written all over it by introducing characters that the fans will recognize and leaving enough plot lines dangling to be taken up by the sequels. However that is not news to anyone familiar with this film project and sequels are already in the works. What I meant to intimate and what I hope is true that from what I saw Friday night is the outlook for the web-slinger is exceptionally strong and I don't think I have to worry about them Batman-izing the Spider-Man Saga. You know what I mean...Remember Batman and how strong the original movie was...well the concept of the series and the plotlines degenerated into a cheesy franchise that became painful to watch. I think the powers behind Spider-Man acknowledged that and left PLENTY of room for growth and are not going to rely on how impressive the effects and how cool looking the Spider-mobile (joke...there is no such thing) is to carry the movie."

","This movie was pretty good. It is not what I would call a good movie. It had a great plot line, but the movie seemed to be made very cheaply. The graphics sucked, terribly. For an example when Pete was running on the buildings, that was some of the worst CGIs I have ever seen.<br/><br/>It takes place when Peter Parker is in High School, and while at a field trip to a local science center, where they are doing experiments on spiders one ends up missing. The spider bites Pete on the hand. The next morning he wakes up with powers. "" With great powers comes great responsibilities.""<br/><br/>Peter eventually moves to the city with his best friend and gets a job taking pictures of spider man. Peter ends up running into his old friend Mary Jane.

","Latetly, I've been worrying dearly about the movie trailers as they tend to take out the best punch lines, the best instantaneous actions scenes and anything that might draw the crowd to the big screen. So it's not hard to see why they do such things, but let me say this. It was as if I already had watched the movie, since every time I went to a movie for the past 2 months, they have been showing the trailer to Spider-Man and it came to the point when I was watching the real movie, that I knew what was coming. Some of the things said were supposed to be very funny, but again whoever, decides to do the trailers did it wrong. Actually I remember the trailer for this movie about 6 months ago or so, where the trailer starts off with bank robbers fleeing with a chopper and the chopper gets stuck on a web. I don't know what ther deal was as that scene never made it to the movie (or it could have been bad quality, and it just might have looked ok to me at that time), but I want to see something of that sort. Not some trailer that spoils the whole movie. And if you consider the fact that the movie sucked in the last scene, then unfortunately, there wasn't much left for me to think of or share with my friends when I left the movie theater. I'm really p***ed off and sad about this. I just hope they don't keep up the same trend."

","This wonderful film adaptation of Marvel comic Spiderman (duh)was just what the dr. ordered.  With a perfect balance of fun, action, drama and fantasy, I was overwhelmed with joy.  The fact that there hasn't been a worthy film with comic book origins in decades...the last one being Superman, left me with expectations lower than usual about a movie that I was so excited to see.  I mean, FINALLY they got it to the big screen.  The general public has not earthly idea how long it took to get this out of the corporate politics and into a good directors hands.  This movie was shockingly stunning in photography and they took the time on every scene to make it what it should be.  The result is tragically beautiful.  If this film was a rose, it has just bloomed.  I would not hesitate to take children to see it, my son being 4 and he has no problems.  Thankfully there were no cusswords, especially unnecesary ones (The word B*tch in The Grinch, as if that was needed AT ALL, especially since mostly children went to see it)and the only thing I would worry about is one scene in particular where the Green Goblin (William DeFoe) seems especially creepy.  The casting was perfect.  I cannot think of anyone better to play the main characters.  That they brought Spiderman back to humanity (I mean his behavior) was wonderful and much needed.  He makes mistakes just like we do.  He has downfalls...failures and it makes his character all the more charming.

The action sequences go by too quickly, seem more unrealistic than they should, and never let us get a feel for Spider-Man himself. Where are his smart-a** wisecracks? Tobey Maguire does a good enough job with Parker, but the only person (I thought) who had the potential to save the movie was Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin. And what's up with the whole Peter's been in love with Mary Jane since he was 6? Parker didn't even meet MJ until college. The whole ""love plot"" was too sappy, too Hollywood...they made Spider-Man a chick flick! And I'm a chick, and I still hated it! What happened, Raimi??? That's the basic problem with all of the movie-- it was too ""Hollywood."" It was like any other action movie. It's like Raimi just took parts from all the good action movies and put them together. There was nothing new, nothing creative, nothing to get into. During the movie, I never cared about Parker, Aunt May, Uncle Ben, MJ, Harry, and barely cared about Norman. And I really wanted to care about them, b/c I had high expectations for the movie. It turned out to be the biggest theatrical disappoint of my life. Well, besides ""Woo."""

Out of these three cartoons that eventually became movies, Spider-man is by far my favorite.  While I don't remember much about the storyline from the cartoon, the specials I have seen on television about the making of Spider-man say they tried to make it as accurate of a depiction as they possibly could.  It showed.  It did a great job of telling the story of how Spider-man came into being and why he became the crime-fighter he is (and for those who are like me who weren't a big comic-book follower, I'm not spilling it).  The action sequences and computer generated effects were also amazing. The casting was very good as well.  My roommate and I actually had an argument over how he couldn't believe they would cast a ""dork"" like Tobey McGuire as Spider-man, but I actually had to remind him that Peter Parker WAS a dork.  I don't know if I'll ever convince my roommate that Tobey McGuire was the perfect role, but he is.  And it's incredible how much time he put into getting into shape in order to be Spider-man.  Word is he spent sometimes more than 4 hours a day getting 'ripped.'  Kirsten Dunst (who is my on-again-off-again favorite actress) was also perfect in her role as MJ. She has played similar role types in the past (such as Torrance in Bring It On), and I must say she is SO attractive in red hair! :) So, yes, I would recommend this movie to anyone who is up for a good action movie, regardless of whether they had a detailed comic book following or not"

Toby Maguire emerges in the character of Peter Parker/ Spiderman. Before watching the movie, I would have chosen Maguire as the last person to play this part. Indeed, he extend beyond all of my expectations when I say this is certainly a break out role for the young actor. Not only will Maguire be immortalized as a comic book hero (e.g Harrison Ford/ Indiana Jones), He will grow as an accomplished and up and coming persona in Holleywood. The Movie, couldn't have been any better than it was without Toby. Toby made the character believeable, even if Spiderman only is a comic book superhero. Final Result. Spiderman is the Most Amazing Superhero film to be made so far (previously it was Batman 1989). I give it a subtle *** 1/2 - **** stars.

","Finally, a hero saga that is true to the spirit of the original!  This was a welcome surprise after a long, arduous development period with many high-profile directors attached to the project, including James Cameron. After seeing the great job that Cameron did with the character development in `Titanic', I had great hopes for this move, but became very concerned when he bowed out.  I'm glad to say that Sam Raimi struck the right balance between action and character.  He demonstrated that he `gets' why The Amazing Spider-Man comic book was so popular and why Stan Lee's and Steve Ditko's creation ushered in the second Golden Age of comics. It centered on a very relatable Peter Parker - who struggled with real issues - not some unreachable super hero.   Raimi allows just enough Stan `The Man' Lee corny dialogue to satisfy any long-standing Marvel Comics True Believer, such as when Green Goblin taunts Spidey with, `I could crush you like a bug!' This is a truly satisfying movie, recommended to True Believers and Spidey novices alike.

"w_bushnell82","10","0","0","6 May 2002"," Awesome doesn't begin to describe it!
","The first installment of a hopefully prosperous franchise of Spider-Man movies did not disappoint anyone who saw it.  Some high budget action movies are just made but this one was created and loved by all involved with it. The key I believe was having Stan Lee as the Executive Producer.  He had the final say in what would and would not go into the movie allowing him to have the creative control which made the Spider-Man so successful in the first place.  As I was not a fan of the comic book myself I am now after seeing this movie. To start with, the casting agent for this movie should be given much praise. The casting job of Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Willem Dafoe, and James Franco was amazing.  Maguire is the excellent Peter Parker.  A person who is recognizable as a part of all of us, while at the same time strong enough to stop those who must be stopped.  Dunst as the beautiful Mary Jane who is not just a damsel in distress.  She is strong willed and has some punch of her own.  Dafoe is magnificent as the evil Dr. Osborn who you come to despise and empathize with at the same time.  Finally, Franco was a surprising delight in this movie.  An awesome young actor Franco gives a great performance as the son of Dafoe who is caught between trying to make his father proud and living down his life of a rich kid.  With an awesome cast and a great idea brought to life Stan Lee and Sam Raimi have created a ""Marvel""ous masterpiece that will live on for generations to come.  If you have not seen this movie, don't tell anyone, go to the movie theater and I guarantee you that it is worth the price of admission and popcorn. Spider-Man tells the story of young Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire).  A high school senior who gets bitten by a genetically altered spider while on a field trip that gives him super human abilities.  Then after a horrible disaster in his life he vows to live his life fighting crime.  Staying true to the comic book through and through, we follow young Peter graduate high school, move to the city and struggle in juggling the aspects of what his life has now become.  Like all other boys his age Peter is interested in girls.  One in particular, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), whom he has loved since grade school.  But, as if his world wasn't messed up enough, it gets flipped upside down when the evil Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) gets into terrorizing the city and only Spider-Man can stop him.  With great power comes great responsibility."

","Spiderman was a great movie. It wasn't the best movie ever made, but for what I expected and what I wanted, it was perfect. The soliloquies by Kirsten Dunst were a little too long (she should just stick to wearing t-shirts in the rain), but the movie was overall very fun to watch."

"DannyBoy-17","Null","0","0","6 May 2002"," Parker's awesome, but where's Spidey?
","Spider Man's origin is told really well in this story, ending in an awesome chase as Spidey discovers his ability to weave between buildings and chases down his uncle's killer.  Somehow, the Green Goblin battle doesn't quite mesh with that story, though it's got the right performances from Willem Dafoe and Tobey Maguire, as well as an innocent but sexy Kirsten Dunst.<br/><br/>One thing's missing.  I, like many, was a huge Spider Man fan growing up for two reasons.  On the one hand, Peter Parker was a nerd, like myself, who had to figure out what to do with an incredible gift, how to take advantage of it and use it wisely.  Sam Raimi and Koepp get this down.<br/><br/>But the other reason Spider Man was awesome is his sense of humor: SPIDEY IS THE MUHAMMAD ALI OF SUPERHEROES.  This is a guy who when he was dodging Doc Ock's tentacles, Electro's bolts, the Lizard's bites, or the Sandman's traps, was constantly ripping on them.  He was full of pop references, and would sing as he swung.  (Actually, maybe it was also due to growing up in the 80s when New York was a far more interesting place to be a superhero/villain than 2002.)<br/><br/>Maguire gets at Spidey's playfulness, but there's a whole lot of wit to this character that goes untapped (it's part of his nerdiness!) But I can't remember one good insult that Spidey threw in the whole story.  The only real funny ""Spidey"" moment is when Tobey stands on the rooftop trying to figure out how the heck to get that web to start up again: ""FLY, WEB, FLY! SHAZAM!""  The rest -- sorry to say -- gives Spider Man the demeanor of Batman, when really it's in the tight spots that his mouth ought to run the best.<br/><br/>So, as the story of a beginning, a tale everyone should discover, Spider Man serves it up.  As for you avid Marvel fans, I agree with another reviewer: X Men was a far more thrilling emotional and special-effects movie.  Sam Raimi captures Peter Parker just fine, but until they get somebody like Jon Stewart writing the webslinger's 2003 dialogue, the world still hasn't met the real Spidey."

","this movie was awesome, every i hoped it was and more. it was indeed a love story, but it didnt hurt the action and adventurous side of the movie. 2hours is indeed the perfect running time for a movie to become great, so it was great to see this movie follow the concept of great family movies by lasting over 2hrs. all the great family adventure/action movies are about 2 hrs, great films include ""home alone"", ""goonies"", ""jurassic park"", ""indiana jones"" and even ""star wars"". by making the movie 2hrs it created enough time to combine story telling (his childhood => how he became spiderman), love (obvious), and last but not least the action and adventure. by the way, by family movies i am specifically talking about movies that are appropiate for the whole family, and this movie fits in preety well, but dont get me wrong a 2yr old would cry in the theater cause of the green goblin, but most kids would love him. the movie incorporated special effects very well unlike the recent ""blade II"" where the animation was too fast and unappropiate at times. $114,000,000.... wow! this movie is certainly gonna get a medal, and i think the gold is VERY vulnerable. i would actually love to see this movie win the gold as it deserves it and it would eliminate all the titanic contreversy on how titanic didnt deserve it, which to a point i disagree. titanic is probably the ""one-timer"" i ever saw, as in movies that are great for one viewing and thats all, but u know how tuff it is to sit down and watch it again, also considering its got no comedy, so its unfair, but thats the reason why its not my favorite. spider-man is a movie im probably gonna see next weekend on a date, and many other times when it comes out on tv."

","Although Maguire may have seemed like a horrible choice for a superhero, especially before any has actually seen the movie, Boy could we have been more wrong. Toby Maguire emerges in the character of Peter Parker/ Spiderman. Before watching the movie, I would have chosen Maguire as the last person to play this part. Indeed, he extend beyond all of my expectations when I say this is certainly a break out role for the young actor. Not only will Maguire be immortalized as a comic book hero (e.g Harrison Ford/ Indiana Jones), He will grow as an accomplished and up and coming persona in Hollywood. The movie, couldn't have been any better than it was without Toby. Toby made the character believable, even if Spiderman only is a comic book superhero. Final Result. Spiderman is the Most Amazing Superhero film to be made so far (previously it was Batman 1989). I give it a subtle *** 1/2 - **** stars.

","I have never before been so hyped to see a movie, being a longtime spidey-fan, and this movie delivered on all accounts. All the main actors played their parts perfectly, particularly Dafoe and Maguire. Dafoe delivered the best comic-villain performance since Jack Nicholson as the Joker, and personally i think that his Goblin surpassed Nicholson's joker. Still Maguire wasnt overshadowed, playing the perfect high-school nerd-turned hero. Also Kirsten Dunst was great as the object of parker's affections and J.K. Simmons was hilarious as J. Jonah Jameson. Particular credit should be given to Raimi who handled the project pefrectly. I enjoyed the way the movie still had that ""Raimi"" feel even though he was working with a budget that hes never been able to touch before. I think that the final battle scene had a particularly Raimi quality to it. Also bless him for putting Bruce ""the man the myth the legend"" Campbell in a cameo role, adding Campbell will always make any movie better.

","I still disagree with the script that depicts Spidey's web shooters as ""in-grown"" mutations. A Spider `spins' a web rather than shoots/squirts a web. The original marvel character not only had to concoct an adhesive for web spinning, but also engineer a high pressure squirt gun to deliver it: The web shooter.  Despite the omission, the film is great, and very nicely depicts the emotional struggle of MJ and Peter Parker."

","Have there been two different versions of Spider-Man released? Apparently, there's one out there that is fun, exciting, witty, brilliant, fantastic, perfect, and unforgettable. Man, I wish I'd seen that version, because the one I saw was filled with cringe-inducing dialogue, some great actors forced into some frightfully over-the-top acting, a villain that looked like a Power Rangers nemesis, and at least one fight scene wherein the violence seemed inappropriate for the target audience.<br/><br/>(***POTENTIAL SPOILER ALERT***) God bless Willem Dafoe. I think if Sam Raimi would have approached me with some of these scenes I would laughed in his face. After surviving the ridiculous scene where he fights with himself in the mirror, I thought I could relax. But, oh no, next we have witness him crawl across the floor, writhing in torment while The Green Goblin mask taunts him while hanging on the back of a chair. And what was the scene on the roof between The Green Goblin and Spider-Man? Did I actually witness The Green Goblin lean against a wall during the conversation and ""thump"" Spider-Man on the head with his finger? Also, (and before I say this, keep in mind I'm a fan of Fight Club) I felt the final battle crossed the line as far as violence considering it's a movie geared toward young people. I shouldn't be surprised given Sam Raimi's horror history, but I guess I expected (and wanted) the fight scenes to be a bit more cartoonish or, at least, not so brutal. Just seemed unnecessary. Finally, MJ's speech to Peter at the graveyard at the end was simply awful. Like reading a card that even Hallmark threw out because it was so schmaltzy. I'm a huge Kirsten Dunst fan but all I could think was ""Please, shut up!""<br/><br/>Perhaps the secret to enjoying a movie anymore is really low expectations. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't twisting in my seat, hawking spitballs at the screen and wishing I'd gone to a root canal instead. I just wasn't blown away like I expected to be. The visuals of Spider-Man sailing through skies in Manhattan and the inspired casting of Tobey Maguire were truly impressive. But that's just pretty pictures. That's not a movie.<br/><br/>Again, I wish I'd seen the same movie as all these people that thought it was so brilliant. Instead, I saw the one that was okay but, really, honestly, kind of sucked."

I thought the producers could have really done some cool things if they would have made him a little darker and more mysterious, not as far as batman, but just a little would have been perfect.

"johnnymonsarrat","7","0","0","3 May 2002"," Jon Monsarrat review: Better than X-Men, mix of good & cheesy
","Let me start by saying that I am not a crazy-eyed comic book fan. I acknowledge that Superman and the gang are pretty silly and due for an update and revamp. Audiences have gotten a lot more sophisticated since the 1950s.<br/><br/>Spider-Man has stood out as more modern and intelligent among comic heros. But so is Batman, and look what happened to his shtick-from-hell sub-intellectual movies. So, I was fearful but hopeful that Spider-Man would do better that the X-Men, which took a stab at deep characterization that didn't come off, and whose visuals and action were overly cheesy.<br/><br/>Spider-Man succeeded. The first half of the film is a real delight, being the origin of Spider-Man. Tobey Maguire, who I enjoyed in ""Cider House Rules"" and ""Wonder Boys"", carried the film, and is destined for an Academy Award at some point in my opinion. The filmmakers pass up numerous opportunities to be cheesy, making it solid and real and making Peter Parker out to be a regular guy who's just so well-meaning and so down-trodden. Believe it or not, it brought tears to my eyes, and I'm not an emotional film-goer (got through E.T. dry-eyed).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the second half of the film devolves into the X-Men style campiness. I think there was probably too much plotting, trying to cram in a lot of the Spider-Man story, and in the rush it didn't have the emotional impact of the first half. Bigger, bigger, yet bigger stunts, but sort of haphazardly thrown together (who's responsible for that, the cinematographer?). Flying around, computer graphics, even shouting cheezy lines back and forth between good guys and bad guys.<br/><br/>I was most disappointed in the acting by Kirsten Dunst, the silliness of the Green Goblin costume, and the city scenes which were obviously sets. Also, since there have been many Spider-Man enemies, it's a shame they chose the Green Goblin, one of the sillier baddies. I think they should have gone for the Octopus guy instead, or Kingpin.<br/><br/>Overall, it was certainly worth seeing for someone like me with an affinity for comics. I doubt it will win the ""golden prize"" which is being a big hit with the broader mainstream, however.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- Action film buffs who got through The X-Men; this one's better<br/><br/>and a whole lot better than any of the Batman films<br/><br/>-- Comic book fans -- a must-see<br/><br/>-- Tobey Maguire fans, but don't expect any deep romance.<br/><br/>I'll give this film a 7 out of 10, the average of a great first half and a so-so second half."

","I'd been waiting with gradually increasing expectations for Spiderman.  I am glad to say that I was not disappointed.  Very little was lost in the translation from the comic book to the movie.  Just enough time was spent describing Spiderman's origin.  Toby Maguire did an excellent job as the nerdy Peter Parker.  Watching Peter discover his powers was a lot of fun. And his tragic discovery about the best use of great power was very moving. Willem Dafoe was an excellent Green Goblin.  His conversations in the mirror were terrific and he was a very convincing Goblin.  Great climactic battle, little sad about the final Peter Parker scene.  Overall a great movie - I'm giving it a '9'."

","I was one of those kids who grew up in the 80's watching the spider-man cartoon show and reading the comic books. I guess you could call me a 'fanboy'. Anyway, here's what I think of the film.<br/><br/>The movie covers the origin of Spidey, fairly faithfully to the comic books. It was a little odd in some places, to see computers and other high-tech equipment in the scenery for things that happened in the comics in the 1960's. So, the film is set in the present day, presumably to hold the interest of a decidely younger audience.<br/><br/>*mild spoilers*<br/><br/>The story is the classic Spider-man tale. The lonely high school student, a little brainy for his own good and with a hopeless crush on the prettiest girl in school, is bitten by a radioactive spider. As a result, he is endowed with superhuman powers, the ability to climb walls, the proportionate strength and angility of a spider, and the trademark web-shooting. (in the comics, the web-shooters were a batman-esque tool he wore around his wrists, and har to be refilled with web cartriges sometimes; the web didn't just shoot out of his arm as it does in the film.) Even relatively minor characters, such as J. Jonah Jamison, the newspaper magnate who creates his own news, are faithfully represented and bring a familiar smile to the face of fans of the original books.<br/><br/>The story is the tried and true comic book concept. The hero has a nemesis, whom he endeavors to protect the innocent from, and in the end he conquers his for and saves the girl.<br/><br/>The film is entertaining, if a bit predictable and campy at times. The effects are nice, though occasionaly look too 'animated'. But, obviously this is a fantasy film, and one needs to suspend reality a bit. Overall, it's entertaining, and if you think you would enjoy the film I'll wager that you will. It's entertaining, very clean by today's standards, and has a couple of good laughs. Nothing really new or inventive, but a good time. 7 out of 10 stars."

","I saw this opening day and I must say this movie exceeded all my expectations.  It followed the story very well.  Tobey did an awesome job as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, and Kirsten Dunst was surprisingly fit for her role.  William Defoe portrayed the Green Goblin to complete perfection; he has a great wicked smirk that worked so well for his part.<br/><br/>When it came to CGI I have to sayÂ…  They pulled it off very well.  It wasn't overused (to a point where it got old.)  They used real people as often as possible it seemed.  Certain shots, of course could not be done without CGI. The models had a very lifelike movement to them; I'm guessing they used real actors for setup.  Although some shots seem impossible to use real actors for.  They all had fluid motion, worked well in the scene and didn't stand out at all.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 10/10!  Its great fun and a job well done.

"mcquestion","8","0","0","6 May 2002"," Marvel FINALLY gets it right
","I've read a lot of comments on the Spider-Man film, now I add my own. First and foremost, I deem this movie to be a complete success on almost every level. Toby Maguire as Peter Parker? But of course! I also laughed when I saw him introduced for the first time, but no more. What were we wanting? Christopher Reeve? Parker is thin and short. He's NOT 6 foot 4 and 200 pounds. He's a geek. The guy IS Peter Parker. Kirsten Dunst is fantastic and sexy as Mary Jane Watson. Willem Dafoe is one of my favorite actors since The Last Temptation Of Christ, and other than his the corny scenes where he has dialogue with himself he's completely believable as Norman Osborne. I've read comments on this very board that Sam Raimi ""failed on very level"" and ""betrayed everything the comics were about."" Did we see the same film? The movie is comprised of a storyline torn straight from the most classic comic storylines from the death of Uncle Ben to the finale on the Brooklyn Bridge where The Goblin drops MJ (rather than Gwen Stacy as it was in the comics). The effects were seamless except for in one shot where Spidey uses the slingshot, that's pretty rubbery and fake looking I admit, but otherwise you really get the idea that this guy is in freefall throughout the city before shooting out a web and zipping to another location almost faster than the eye can see. As for the human element of the story, check out the backyard talk between MJ and Peter late at night if you don't think it's not chalk full of character moments. After screwing up time and again at attempts to get their characters on the screen (see the Captain America movie or the Punisher film), Marvel FINALLY got it right. Congratulations, Spidey, it's great to have you back. On the minus side, the film's score sucked royally. Danny Elfman (of MIB and Batman fame) gives us a score devoid of identity and identifiable moments. Elfman is in an official slump after this film and Planet Of The Apes. no comic book to movie adaptation has been truer to the source material and IMO it even surpasses the original X-Men. Both Star Wars II and X-Men II have BIG shoes to fill when they come out."

","I went to Spiderman last night with my wife and some friends.  As the opening credits were playing, I was sitting there muttering to myself ""please don't suck... please don't suck...""  I went into the movie with VERY high hopes, but also with a foreboding feeling that I was going to be highly disappointed as I was with Dungeons & Dragons, LOTR and some other movie I went to see but don't remember what it was because it wasn't worth it.<br/><br/>Spiderman has ALWAYS been my #1 favorite superhero.  I had Spidey underoos as a kid, whatched the cartoon religiously, and collected all sorts of spidey stuff when I was old enough to afford it.<br/><br/>I've read a lot of comments on the movie here, and both sides bring out good points, but a lot of people just missed the whole point to the movie.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi is one of my favorite directors.  He does a really outstanding job on movies without having the budget that names like Ron Howard, Stephen Spielburg and George Lucas commands.  I saw an interview with Sam on TV last week and he was scared that true Spidey fans would despise him forever on doing a hack job, but was confident that the movie would work out well. Which it did.<br/><br/>Tobey who?  Never heard of him.  The first thing I ever saw him on was the Letterman show where he sat there and kept getting irritated at Dave for making fun of him and the movie.  Unfortunately, I had that distaste of him when I did go in, but I think he pulled it off quite well.  The only other person I could think of (and this was YEARS ago) who may have had a better run as Spiderman would have been the late Brandon Lee... but he was almost too much of a ""pretty boy"" to effectively play a nerdy type.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe is a great actor who was handed a cheesy role.  I just don't mean for the movie, but in general.  Jack Nicholson had to pull off the Joker, which he did.. Willem pulled off the GG.  I wasn't too wild about the ""biosuit"" and agree with another viewer comment that it made him look like a Power Rangers bad guy, but what the heck.<br/><br/>Kirsten was ""ok"" as MJ.  I love that she called him ""Tiger""... but just that once.  That was perfect.  The upside down kiss was perfect.  The gratuitous wet t-shirt shot was impressive.  I think she had more chemistry with Aunt May than Peter and uncle Ben, but unfortunately, Cliff and Tobey didn't have enough time to really do too much.<br/><br/>The special effects worried me... I loved the web-slinging shots.. for the most part they were impressive and really fed my acrophobia.  A few times some of the CG was... painful.<br/><br/>All in all... outstanding job.  The changes from movie to comic were minimal and allowed smooth transitions.  Back when spidey came out, radioactive everything was the huge news.  Nowadays, it's genetics.  Next movie, let's get some more wisecracks in there, and I would positively die if we get to see Venom and Carnage at some point... that was one of the most trying times in the life of Peter Parker, and contrary to what some of the people here think, Spiderman isn't about actionadventureshootemupandbeatupallthebadguys. Spiderman has a much more human element to it.<br/><br/>I hope Sam Raimi and the cast keep up the great work.  The sequel is going to have to be twice as good as the first, otherwise people will be even more critical than they are now.  Clean up the CG, a little bit more character development and interaction and let's let Spidey do a few more wisecracks. Good luck trying to make a Doc Oc or Rhino (especially one that doesn't look like a high school mascot).  And stay away from the Spidey/X-Men union stuff.  Yuck."

Through great acting, direction, and a carefully crafted script, the film lures you into the central character's head so that you experience almost firsthand his amused discovery of his powers, his awkwardness and tentativeness at learning to control them, his rage toward the criminal who murders his uncle, the pain of every punch and blow he receives, his tentativeness at assuming the responsibilities of a superhero, and his ultimate joy as he transcends gravity, leaping and swinging above the streets of New York. And then there's the romance: Kirsten Dunst is just right as your Queens girl-next-door. She never comes off as a movie star, as anything less than genuine. Tobey Maguire's eyes and silences speak volumes as he gazes at and tries to speak to her. I've never been in a movie theater before where the audience cheered and clapped when the boy and girl kiss.

Willem DeFoe's portrayal of the Green Goblin stands easily on the same shelf with Nicholson's Joker and Hackman's Lex Luther.  Stellar performances from the supporting cast, especially veteran Cliff Robertson and gem J.K. Simmons, add to the overall texture of a thrilling character-driven story.  It's so easy to be drawn into this story that you'll almost forget to watch for Stan Lee's cameo.<br/><br/>The story necessitates some heavy-duty visual effects, executed with typical precision by John Dykstra.  You have to intentionally want to see the flaws, and there aren't many.  Dykstra strikes a perfect balance, supporting the story without overshadowing it.  The sets and costumes are similarly well-appointed, but restrained.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman's score does for this film what he did for Tim Burton's ""Batman"".  The traditional Spider-Man theme is absent from the main title, but peeks in during the incidental music to remind you of the musical heritage.<br/><br/>All in all, this is an exciting film of high quality."

","I just watched it yesterday. I was really amazing for the human acting of the cartoon's SPIDER MAN. I've seen someof the SPIDER MAN's cartoons a few years ago. All came from the TV. The whole story was quite interesting. In the whole movie. I think it caught my eyes in every moment. Pretty girl--Kristin Dunst and a good looking guy--Tobey Maguire. Tobey Maguire seemed to be a kind of genius. Moreover, his acting was quite good when I discovered his talking with Kristin besides her aunt's patient bed. He just showed how much he loved her. And the most interesting point was that the spider man was a elastic man. He could fly freely.. even stronger than the comics. WORTH TO SEE IT! 9.5/10"

"Hoshi Sato","Null","0","0","6 May 2002"," How can anyone not like this movie?
","Spider-man is a terrific movie that has a little bit of everything. First, the acting was top notch and the actors really embraced their roles.  Big kudos to Tobey Maguire for his portrayal of Peter Parker.  Also Kirsten was great despite being mostly eye candy in this movie.  I hope she gets a bigger role in the sequel.  Secondly, the plot was simple enough for the viewers to follow but underlined with deep and emotional secondary storylines such Norman Osborn's relationship with his son and Peter Parker. Third, the action sequence and special effects were top notched. Spider-man relies on his superhuman reflexes and agility to defeat his opponent.  I am glad they didn't let Spidey start doing some kung fu or go Matrixest because that would had ruined the movie.  Fourth, the movie was very true to its comic book origins.  If you came in the theatre expecting Sam Raimi to make a serious movie like Batman or X-men, then you are mistaken.  It is not dark but it isn't cheesy like Superman was IMO.  This movie is kinda like Dick Tracy in the manner that it never pretended to be something other than a comic book/cartoon but it remained serious enough to be enjoyed by adults. The only thing weak about this movie is the theme music by Danny Elfman. It was just unspectacular and for a movie like this, that was unfortunate. Best scene was indeed the inverted kiss or in truth, Kirsten Dunst in a wet see-through pink sleaveless slip.  I can't wait to buy the DVD, if you know what I'm talking about.  :)<br/><br/>I don't understand how there could be any criticism about this movie.  To me, it just worked on so many different levels and exceeded so many expectations.  When I saw clips of it months ago, I was skeptical about the movie and the cast.  But it just seemed to all work and was well done.  If you can't like this movie, you simply can't be satisfy.  I can understand the purist who don't like the changes(ie the web-slinger).  I can understand those elitist who think this movie is too childest because it is cartoonish. I can understand the action-seekers who think this movie is too slow. And then there are the film grad students who like those deep but slow moving French noirs.  Well, put all your pre-dispositions aside and spend two hours on good entertainment.  If you go in the theatre looking for things to critique, then you need to get out more.  Films are made for entertainment. It is too entertain the mainstream audience and can't satisfy everyone. No movie can.  So go with a friend or family and have fun.  Like Ocean's Eleven, this movie won't win any awards except maybe MTV kiss of the year. But this movie is a well made movie for good entertainment value. Overall, I give it a A- or 3 out of 4 or 8 out of 10."

","Good movie.  This has a little for everyone. For anyone who does not know who spider-man is this movie will let them know every thing they need to know.  It crosses the line and lets all us spider freaks get our kicks and gives a good story to everyone else. The thing about this movie is that they made a really good movie, not a great spider-man comic, but a really good movie.  Great acting, great character development and a good love story. Don't listen to any of the nit pickers, As far as good entertainment goes, this movie is the best so far this year, hands down.  As far as the real spider-man, the only time we see him is at the end of the last fight scene when spider-man is giving it to the green goblin and you can finally see spider-man in the face of Mr.Maguire.  For Mr. Maguire to really work as spider-man he has to keep developing from that scene.  It was a good all around movie and can stand alone as one of the best movies made.  But if you really want to keep this going you will have to make Mr. Maguire develop into a real spider-man, no longer the wimp teenager full of questions, but a real super-hero.  The question is, is Mr. Maguire up to being the real spider-man?"

","Peter Parker is supposed to be -- at least pre-spider bite -- a nerdy wallflower with little personality. That being the case Tobey McGuire was casting genius.<br/><br/>I wanted very much to like the big-screen adaptation of the Marvel Comics hero `Spider-Man.' I'm not sure why but I was disappointed.<br/><br/>The score by Danny Elfman was good -- but only in places.<br/><br/>The script was entertaining -- but not consistently so.<br/><br/>The photography was sometimes great -- but again, only at times.<br/><br/>I believe that is why `Spider-Man' didn't win me over: It was inconsistent.<br/><br/>The action scenes -- particularly when Spidey was flying through the air with the help of his self-generated webs -- moved too fast, taking away some of the Gee-Whiz factor. <br/><br/>James Franco -- the son of the Green Goblin/Norman Osborn, played by Willem Dafoe -- though up to the part was probably cast because of his cheekbones, making him actually look like he could be Mr. Dafoe's progeny.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst was the best thing in the movie. Not to put too fine a point on things but especially for the scene in the rain and that sweater.<br/><br/>There was lots of violence with a message that violence, in and of itself, can solve problems; not something I would want to teach a child.<br/><br/>The movie seemed longer than its official run time of 121 minutes -- not a good sign.<br/><br/>Not everything about this movie was bad.  Watching Peter Parker discover his new body and how he fumbled with learning to use his new powers was entertaining and the nice update of a genetically enhanced spider (from a radioactive spider in the comic book) was a good touch. The animation sequences were wonderful with the touch of the genius that is Stan Lee.<br/><br/>If you are going to see this movie you should probably see it on the big screen -- or in the very least on a widescreen DVD -- the action is not going to fit on a small television set."
"Dark-Man","9","0","0","7 May 2002"," A movie that stays true to the comic books that inspired it.
","Well, the summer movie blockbuster season is upon us again and the first of them to come out (we won't count the dismal THE SCORPION KING as the first, okay?) is SPIDER-MAN.  Let me just say that SPIDER-MAN is one of the most enjoyable films so far this year and certainly will be one of the best movies of the summer season.  <br/><br/>     The film has an enjoyable mix of action and excitement.  The story is well developed and stays very true to the comic books.  The acting (for the most part) is well done.  And Sam Raimi's direction is right on.  He adds a lot to the comic book style of the film.<br/><br/>     Perhaps the only real letdown of the film is the performance of Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn / The Green Goblin.  Though he is usually a good actor, he just didn't seem to grasp the concept of the evil villain and looked, at times, bored by the material.  <br/><br/>     All in all, the filmmakers did a wonderful job with this film.  A lot of comic books adaptations don't live up to or stay true to their source material, but SPIDER-MAN does just that... and does it well.<br/><br/>     With great power comes great responsibility.  Spidey knows it, and apparently so did the filmmakers."
"bill_b4","7","0","0","7 May 2002"," OK, but...
","Be forewarned...Spoilers Ahead: As a big fan of the comic book, I definitely enjoyed the movie, but had some small bones to pick and thankfully, IMDB provides the skeletal material.<br/><br/>
Firstly, the movie, although good, is over-hyped. As of 7 May 02, the movie has a rating of 8.4, which is comparable to much better movies, such as The Matrix. Perhaps this could be indicative of the excitement of a well-done newly released movie and will level out to a more realistic, better-deserved rating as time goes by. However, this particular phenomenon sort of concerns me because it hints at the possibility that movie ratings may be, for whatever reason, over-hyped in the short term after an initial release. My main worry is that Hollywood has somehow figured out how to initially stack the deck, deceiving loyal IMDB participants, such as myself. I will definitely be more guarded about the IMDB rating of movies after initial releases, and this may mean I will have to wait a movie out after a couple of weeks and then see how the ratings fare.<br/><br/>My other thoughts about the movie, although trivial, add up to a small degree of disappointment, and, in my opinion, detracted from the overall enjoyability. For one, if the movie had spent an equal amount of time depicting Peter Parker's scientific ingenuity as they had showing his eye for design (such as when drawing up plans for his costume), the audience would have had no problem believing that he could create web shooters, such as he did for the comic book. I thought the spinerettes inside his wrists interesting and was thankful the writers opted for his wrists over the spider's preternatural ability to shoot silk out it's rear.<br/><br/>
Another point of contention was the look of the green goblin. It seemed in the comic book that the goblin's mask was of a more rubber material, and definitely not the rigid, molded plastic depicted in the film. The look of the goblin from the comic was much more menacing, and those of you who may doubt it only have to view Maximum Overdrive and tell me that the truck with the green goblin's face, taken directly from the comic, does not send chills up your spine.<br/><br/>Additionally, in the comic book, Peter Parker cleverly taunted his enemies while in battle, making it easy for fights to take a much more serious tone when Spider Man's wit would be replaced by less witty diatribe.<br/><br/>It's been years since reading spider-man comic books, but one of the more heartening plot twists from early on in the comic was Peter Parker's love interest with the daughter of a police captain...I think her name was Gwen. And I believe the green goblin tried to kill her in the comic by throwing her off of a bridge, similar to the plot line from the movie. However, unlike the movie, Gwen died while Spider-Man tried to rescue her. A female friend by the name of Mary Jane Watson tried to console him through his loss and Peter Parker ended up falling in love with her. Now I don't know if they could have included those much sadder plot twists for the movie, but as a fan of the comic book, these scenarios resulted in more deeply endearing the characters to me. If I remember correctly, another interesting plot development was when Gwen's father, the police captain, was also killed (I think much earlier than Gwen's demise) while Spidey battled Dr. Octopus. Is Hollywood afraid such loss would negatively impact ticket sales? They should look at Marvel's sales within said plot lines and I think they'd see that the tragic loss resulted in a more loyal fan base. If anyone doubts it, look what the death of Obi Wan did for the fans of Star Wars. One of the more saddening, but poignant points to the comic book series was how many of Peter Parker's closest friends and acquaintances, would die off. Uncle Ben, the police captain, and Gwen, among others.<br/><br/>Lastly, even though casting was for the most part dead-on, the choice of JK Simmons to play JJ Jameson left much to be desired. And I say that as a fan of Law & Order and his recurring role as the psychologist. Of course I'm arm-chair quaterbacking here, but I feel that there could have been a better choice, although I thought JK Simmons did exceptionally well.<br/><br/>Please don't let my comments prevent you from seeing the movie. Even though I believe an 8.4 rating is much too high for it, it is still a well-done, enjoyable movie, more along the lines of a 7 out of 10 rating. It was for the most part faithful to the plot lines of the comic book, and therefore, captivating and interesting."

","This is not the best comic book movie ever.  That honor still belongs to the first Superman.  I enjoyed the Peter Parker scenes, but felt let down by the action, and Danny Elfman's terrible score.  I didn't hate the film, there were moments that were quite good.  Like when Peter is first discovering his Spidey abilities.  But it didn't have that same mythic quality that the first Superman had.  The actors did there best with the script.  J.J Jameson was real good, but the story felt pedestrian.  The rivalry between the Goblin and Spider-Man wasn't developed enough.  I give the film a 7 because it was better than most of the summer blockbusters last year.  (Planet of the Apes anyone?)  But it was missing certain qualities that would have elevated it to classic status.  Go see it and decide for yourself though."
"tanis_38","8","0","0","7 May 2002"," Amazing.....
","I thought Spider-Man was awesome!  I think it is - without a doubt - the best comic book movie made so far.  Tobey McGuire was the perfect Peter Parker, I can't think of anybody else that could have been better suited for the role.  I liked the fact that the movie dedicated a lot of time to the human aspect of the story, building the characters and such.  It could have easily skimmed through the origin, had him become Spider-Man and filled the rest of the movie with straight action sequences, but it didn't.  I loved the parts when Peter was discovering his powers, I could have watched 30 more minutes of that.  Story wise, I have no complaints.  I felt the movie moved along well enough and the great performances kept the slower scenes from going too stale.  And aside from the organic web shooters it stayed pretty faithful to the comics.  I like the little reference to Dr. Connors (The Lizard) which they threw in for the fans.  As to the technical part of the film....well, first, I'm still not a fan of this Green Goblin outfit, even though it actually didn't bother me as much as I thought it would.  But in some of those close-ups the mask looked really, really cheap.  Like those plastic masks that you wear with a rubber-band.  It would be interesting to see some of the other costume designs which they went through, and why they decided to go with this one.  Now, Spider-Man's costume was freakin' awesome!  I couldn't have imagined it to look any cooler than it did.  I remember before this movie was being made I would wonder how they would make the costume in a live action movie without it looking ridiculous, 'cause in the comics it's really just a spandex skin-tight costume, and that would look really dorky in real life.  But man, they nailed it!  It looked great. As to the special effects, I felt they could have been better, but considering the complexity of the shots, I felt they more than got the job done.  Seeing Spidey swinging around, while it didn't photorealistic, it certainly looked as I've pictured it in my mind reading the comics.  Me - being the huge Spidey fan that I am - just had a huge smile on my face throughout the entire movie.  **possible spoiler ahead***  And once I saw the scene when he's chasing down Uncle Ben's killer in the car (the best sequence in the movie in my opinion) I just knew the movie was going to be alright. **end spoiler**   That scene just nailed it for me, and brought back so many memories of the comics.  I think Sam Raimi did an outstanding job.  This movie could have easily been a total mess, and I feel he brought the audience a great origin flick, with heart, solid performances, and great action sequences."
"tshodan","9","0","0","7 May 2002"," Wonderful portrayal of the Characters
","Spiderman was a well done comic to movie event. On the plus side, the characters were all but perfect.  Tobie Maguire pulls off Peter Parker extremely well and Wilhem Dafoe was born to play Norman Osbourne.  If this wasn't a movie based on a comic book, he would be up for an Oscar.  However, expect him to win the MTV Best Villain award (even though he will be competing against Christopher Lee 2X for that one. Sauraman from The Lord of the Rings and Darth Tyranus from Clones.) <br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst and the Director put a slightly new twist on MJ, but it's in the right direction.  Personally this is the first rendition cartoon, comic or movie were I enjoyed the Aunt May character.<br/><br/>On the down side (but not too far down) the special effects were<br/><br/>just OK.  The Computer animation was second rate by todays standards and somehow it lessoned the presence of Spiderman on the Screen.  The Green Goblins costume was a little too much like Jet jaguar from Godzilla fame for my liking. <br/><br/>The enjoyment from this movie comes mostly from the real life characters and aliases and not from when our hero and villain are suited up.<br/><br/>Despite this, I still gave it a 9.  I cant see were I can knock it any further than that."

","I saw SPIDER-MAN opening night with a capacity crowd.  I'm not sure how much they liked it, but I was really bored with it. When I first saw the infamous teaser trailer for this movie I must say I was intrigued.  I've been a fan of Spider-Man since I was a kid, therefore I was keeping my fingers crossed about the whole affair. For the most part Marvel comics hasn't really had a very impressive run with their movie properties. Most of that was due to the lack of F/X technology available in the past.  So after seeing the more recent trailers, I was getting more and more reved up to see this thing. So on Friday I bought my ticket early and waited to see what I hoped would be a ""high flying, rip-roaring time"" at the movies.  Instead I was treated to Peter Parker The Movie.  For a summer action movie, this movie is light on the action.  Normally Sam Raimi is able to keep things rolling when it comes to action pieces.  Granted he didn't write the script, but he also didn't direct it with his usual kinetic energy. *Spoilers* The movie opens with a really cool Animated Marvel Comics logo, but it's all downhill from there. In case you don't already know.  Peter Parker is a high-school science geek who, on a school field trip, is bitten by a genetically mutated ""super spider"".  This scene is one of the most annoying in the whole movie.  I'm not a purist and don't mind the fact that the means of mutating the spider were changed.  But man what's with that scientist rambling on about the various spiders to the high school class? ""This spider's reflexes border on precognition, you could almost say it has a ""spider sense"". Yipee, That was a laugh riot my friend! It was like one of those really bad 1950's horror movies. Where the doctor explains everything in a dumbed down fashion to other doctors who probably want to slap him for talking down to them. The scenes that follow are probably the best of the whole movie though. (Flash Thompson's slow-mo punch was pretty darn funny.)  When Peter discovers his super powers, he begins to experiment and have fun.  Even if he was a little less worried then I would be in such an instance.  It was fun. And just like the original comic book handled it in a nice way. Giving Peter moral challenges, some of which he fails. As any young kid given super powers would. But these scenes make up the bulk of the action sequences.  After this there are maybe fifteen minutes of Spider-Man. If you've seen the commercials you've seen it all, LITERALLY.  Most of this takes place in hokey montages of action, like in Superman. The rest was a talkie snore fest, the only time it got interesting was when J. Jonah Jameson was on screen, or Willem Dafoe was kickin it Jekyll and Hyde style.  Otherwise some of the monologues were just hard to listen to. And Tobey's voice coming from the costume was bad.  I know if I were a scrawny kid who had the duality of being a superhero I'd come up with th ebest darn superhero voice I could. I wouldn't go around doing my best imitation of the pimple faced teen from the Simpsons."

","I went to go see this movie simply hoping that it would be a couple hours of entertainment. I've neve read a spider man comic book, nor have I seen an episode from the tv series. I guess I'm not particularly a big spider man fan, but I like to give just about any movie a shot. After watching it, I've decided to give it a 5 out of 10. Here's why:<br/><br/>I knew it would be outrageous and over the top, like comic books are, but that is not why I rate it fairly low. This movie just wasn't ""cool"" enough for me. I'm not sure what it was I expected, but it didn't cut it. Don't get me wrong, there were some entertaining and ""oh yeah, that's awesome"" parts in this flick, but not nearly enough to make up for a weak story. I thought Tobey Maguire did a good enough job acting, as did William Dafoe in his fittingly over the top role as the Green Goblin. Kirsten Dunst also did a fine job with what she was given.<br/><br/>In the end, there was nothing particulary redeeming about the movie that would make me recommend it to anyone. I hate to say that nothing happened, because quite a bit of action took place in this movie, but the plot did not really advance very far. There was more style than substance you could say. Perhaps fans of Spider-Man would enjoy this more than I did. It certainly cannot compare to what I consider the best ""comic book"" movie: Batman. That movie had many more cool moments and a story that moved along and was interesting in a way this film lacked. Once again, I give this movie 5 on a scale of 10."

","Okay, here's what I was thinking when I went in, based on what I'd heard and from the previews:<br/><br/>1. Too much CGI.  It's too distracting for a whole person to suddenly become an effect.<br/><br/>2. Questionable casting.  Okay, I wasn't sure on this one.  I'm not familiar enough with the Peter Parker character to have known ahead of time if Tobey was an okay choice.<br/><br/>3. Great script.  I'd just heard that this was a really good story filled with rich characters who we'll really care about.<br/><br/>4. Sequel coming.  Warners screwed up Batman, so now there's room for a Marvel character... let's bleed this property dry!  Profits!  WOO HOO!<br/><br/>Now that I've seen the movie, let's examine these one at a time:<br/><br/>1. CGI: It wasn't that bad.  I was very surprised by how good it looked and how it added to the sense of wonder.  I found myself actually thinking ""that's ep]ing cool!""  So there's no worry here.  Spider-Man, while he never moves his mouth (even when yelling the requisite NOOOOOO!!) does swing through the city in a manner befitting a superhero.<br/><br/>2. Casting: I have absolutely no problem with any of the casting (even Randy Savage was good as Bone Saw).  Anyone who can't see Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man has missed the point.  You should only have to see him as Peter Parker.  That's been a real problem in super hero movies.  You should cast the secret identity, not the hero.  Christopher Reeve is Clark Kent first, and Superman second.  And I feel that I should mention JK Simmons (simply because everyone else has).  He was funny.  It would have been very easy to slip into Perry White mode, but he avoided that and came out as the anti-Chief.<br/><br/>3. Script: This is where it was lacking.  The whole movie is nothing but cliche after cliche.  We have to have MJ be a sweet wholesome girl who would only go for a nice guy.  She's the type of girl who would never waste her time with a jerk.  Oh, and she has to be dating the biggest jerk in the world.  Why?  Well, that's what you do in movies that take place in high school.  Now Spider Man makes his appearance.  The whole city thinks he might be a bad guy at first.  Why?  Well, that's what you do in super hero movies.  While the dialogue wasn't filled with little inside jokes that made you want to wretch, the characters weren't fleshed out enough.  I do see potential for the future.  Which brings us right to<br/><br/>4. Sequel: They're out to make money.  We all know that.  But there's a difference between something like this and something like X-Men.  Now I'm not going to pretend to know what went on behind the scenes of either of these movies.  But the feeling I got from watching them, was that X-Men was just trying it out.  If it worked well and made enough money, great.  Let's try it again.  With Spider-Man, I really got the feeling that they were just making sure that a sequel could be made, that this was nothing more than a money making machine to them.<br/><br/>I almost liked this movie.  I really wanted to.  But overall, it's not worth it.  I'll see the next one, and maybe it will have been improved.  But this is far from the best comic book movie ever made.

","Overall, not the best work from Sam Raimi (this should have been closer to Darkman in tone - much more compelling that way).  The CGI is not quite right, the suspension of disbelief required is a bit too much (what, no one could figure out that something might be up qith the sudden emergence of Spiderman and the kid at school who can suddenly do all sorts of things he couldn't before?), and the last act of the movie is just plastic.<br/><br/>However, it was an enjoyable ride - it isn't fulfilling, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a pleasure.  The first act in particular is great - establishment and discovery.  Those early scenes provide the greatest charms.<br/><br/>The action's pretty decent, if you can bring yourself to care about two CGI characters duking it out.  I think if there were more stunts and less computers, the mechanical feel of some of the set pieces would shed off, and I'd have been more excited by what I saw.<br/><br/>I'd see it again - it was fun!

","Have you seen the original Superman? How about Burton's first Batman? OK, didja catch Raimi's own Darkman? If you answered 'yes' to any of the above questions, you've no reason to catch Spiderman. You've seen it already. And if you saw the first two titles, you've seen BETTER!<br/><br/>Raimi apparently still wants to be thought of as a ""serious director,"" because the heavy-handed doses of melodrama drag this film so far down it makes Bette Midler's 'Beaches' look like an action-packed thrill-a-minute rollercoaster ride. The sappy dialogue and characterizations make for 'groaner' material from start to finish. There's too much talk and not enough webslinging. Too many teary eyes; yet no developed personalities you really care about. No actor could deliver those cumbersome scenes well, so the blame falls squarely upon the filmmakers, not the actors (who did their best for the most part).<br/><br/>The story is derivative of just about every comic-to-screen adaptation made in the last thirty years (especially Superman). The imagery is nothing new (remember those parade balloons from Batman? Hope you liked that scene -- it's 're-imagined' in Spiderman). The CGI is CGI -- to a degree where there is little or no suspension of disbelief. Again, nothing ground-breaking. Don't even expect Raimi's signature ingenious camera work, because with the exception of one scene, there's nothing special here.<br/><br/>The hype around this film is both stupefying and alarming. There's really nothing new to see here. Except maybe Dunst in a wet T-shirt. Which you can see in the trailer. When the hype whirligig subsides, Spiderman will prove as disposable as The Shadow. Or Mantis. Or even Darkman."

","Wow!!  This was a fairly faithful to the book movie of Spider-man and I loved it.   It was a fast-paced, action-packed and fun movie.   Most important, the kids loved it. SPOILER ALERT Having said all that, there was some things that should have been cut to add to the pace and be more true to the comic:<br/><br/>Cut 1)  Ben saying he was laid off and needed a job.  There was no mention of that in the comic, and besides a 68 year-old man and his wife are getting a nice SS check plus his small pension, with mortgage paid off.  So it didn't make sense and dragged the pace.  -cut that-<br/><br/>Cut 2)  Having Mary Jane as his next door neighbor and the mentioning of the drunk dad.  It wasn't so in the comic.  They usually got together about town.  That dragged the pace and made her less chic as she was in the comic. -cut that-<br/><br/>Cut 3)  At the end at Osbornes funeral, Peter's talk with Mary Jane was too somber.  Mary Jane was always more upbeat and flip with the gab.  -cut that and replace it with them having a lighter conversation in town.<br/><br/>Now listing the things I would have cut, here are things I would add.<br/><br/>Scene 1 to add)  In the comic book origin, when Peter headed home after been bit by the spider, he staggered out in the street and was almost hit by a car. As he leapt out the way, his body flew into a building and he stuck to the wall.  That would have been a more impactful scene instead of him 'gradually' noticing his powers.<br/><br/>Scene 2 to add)  In the movie, Peter seemed more confused and befuddled by the abuse he was taking from the other teens.  But in the book he was downright ANGRY!!  Notice what he says in the very first appearance of Spider-Man when they make fun of him.  ""Some day I'll show them.  Some day they'll be sorry!  Sorry that they laughed at me!""<br/><br/>Scene 3 to add)  I would have liked to see an intermediate scene where he shows HOW he would be a crime-fighter.  It seems like after the capture of Ben's killer, he jumps right into it.  I would have like it to be more gradual, like maybe some petty crimes of loud kids on the bus or subway messing with the passengers, while he was in his regular clothes.<br/><br/>Scene 4 to add)  Banter during the fights.  Spidey did it all all time and it was funny.  So I missed that.<br/><br/>But aside from that, I was happy with the film and felt that Raimi gave us a faithful adaptation."

","Fans of Spider-Man had been waiting for the webslinger to hit the big screen since 1985 when Cannon Films (the people responsible for MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE and SUPERMAN IV:  THE QUEST FOR PEACE) had the movie rights tot he character.  Then it looked as if 21ST Century Films (who gave us that truly awful adaptation of CAPTAIN AMERICA (1990) would make the movie.  Now, after all of the legal battles have been settled, SPIDER-MAN has finally hit the movies.  I'll confess, I'm more of a DC Comics fan, Batman in particular. But, hey, any film based off of a comic book superhero can only be a good thing, right?  And SPIDER-MAN IS a good thing. Even the most casual comic fan will know the story:  young Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is an orphaned high school student who is pushed around by practically everyone.  For years, he has had a crush on Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), the girl next door.  One day, on a school field trip, Parker is bitten by a genetically-altered (as opposed to radiation like in the comics) spider.  As a result, he begins to go through some SERIOUS changes:  His eyesight is improved where he no longer needs glasses, his physique is now buffed beyond belief, he has phenomenal strength and agility and can stick to walls and ceilings.  But there is the most important change:  he now can shoot webs from his wrists (unlike the mechanical webshooters from the comics).  I suppose they had to make the webbing come from his arms as opposed to where a spider's web REALLY comes from (let's just say it's why you see spiders hanging upside down when they dangle from the thread), it would be too embarrassing otherwise. At first, Parker tries to use his powers to become a pro wrestler (he squares off against none other than Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage), until those fateful events:  A robbery that Parker could have stopped.  The escaped crook pulls a carjacking, of whom the victim happens to be his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), who had earlier tried to tell Peter ""With great power also comes great responsibility"".  When Peter realizes that the man who killed his uncle is the same one he could have stopped earlier, that is when he decides to become a superhero.  Sam Raimi directs with an understated flair that isn't quite as over-the-top as his style on the EVIL DEAD movies, but you will still have a good time. The villainy of SPIDER-MAN is provided by businessman Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) who, after experimenting with equipment that was supposed to go to the military, goes insane and ends up becoming the Green Goblin. Dafoe's laugh rivals that of Jack Nicholson's Joker in BATMAN.  In fact, there are some scenes here that will remind you of Tim Burton's 1989 blockbuster (The parade with balloons, the hero and villain fighting over the heroine in a dilapidated, abandoned building in darkness) as well as the 1978 SUPERMAN (Parker running down the street, ripping open his shirt to reveal his costume underneath), especially in the scenes set at the Daily Bugle, the newspaper run by the ever-cranky J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) that will recall Perry White and the Daily Planet in the earlier movie. Also on hand are Sam Raimi regulars Bruce Campbell (as the wrestling ring announcer) and his younger brother Tim (as one of Jameson's assistants).  Needless to say, the movie ends with the possibility of a sequel, which probably would have materialized even if the movie didn't become the hit that everyone is predicting that it will be.  After all, with the probable exceptions of Batman and the Flash, Spider-Man has the most interesting and recognizable rogue's gallery of any superhero.  From the multi-armed Doctor Octopus, the ever-shifting Sandman or Spider-Man's evil doppleganger Venom (and his ""offspring"" Carnage), there are no ending to sequel tales.  Of which I, like millions other, am looking forward to."
"NeXTCube","Null","0","0","5 May 2002"," So, how strong *is* Spider Man, anyway?
","To provide a little background here, I've really only read Spider Man comics from the late 1960's, so I don't have much in the way of ""recent"" knowledge of the character.<br/><br/>That said, I was pleasantly relieved that this movie was much more human than was the X-Men film of a few years ago.  Sure,  I like Patrick Stewart as much as the next Star Trek fan, but let's face it - kids at this mutant school would have called each other by their real names when out of costume.  But I digress.<br/><br/>This film, at least, remembers that most super-heroes start out as real people (except, perhaps, for Kal-El) and I was relieved to see the director give them that respect.  Sam Raimi obviously has an affection for the character, and handles one of Stan Lee's finest creations with kid gloves.  Heck, he even gave the movie a storyline!  (Apparently optional; see X-Men.)<br/><br/>This brings me to the whining part.  Question one: How strong is Spider Man?  If he is strong enough to heft a 20-ton cable car one- handed (well beyond his abilities in the 60's), how in fact did he avoid making a nasty mess by putting his fist directly through ""Flash"" when he punched him?  Question two: Why is OsCorp, a ""major defense contractor"", sponsoring the balloon-infested ""World Unity Day?""  (When was the last time Lockheed-Martin threw a party for the public in Times Square?)  Question three: how did Osbone get so rich if he kills all of his best scientists?<br/><br/>Question four: how does the Green Goblin's ""glider"" support the 20-ton cable car? (I want one of those engines to put in my car!) Question five: why did they spent too much time on the Green Goblin (who was never anything more than a lame diversion in the comics) and not enough time on J. Jonah Jameson (Spidey's real enemy)?  Question six: How does Parker learn so quickly how to be a good spider? I think they could have spent more time on him learning how to use his spider abilities and had a lot of fun with it without having to play the ""super villian"" card.  (J. Jonah Jameson himself theorized that the existance of ""super heroes"" *caused* the advent of ""super villians"".)<br/><br/>That said, I don't wish to detract from Dafoe's performance - in fact, the Green Goblin in the film was at least twice as interesting as the comic book character (the sight of Dafoe trying to casually lean against the wall in that absurd body armor was priceless!) ever was.<br/><br/>All complaints aside, the film wasn't what I'd hoped it would be, but was much better than I feared it would be!"

In a world where the war on terror seems to dominate the headlines, it's good to have a movie where a normal guy can suddenly take charge and stand up for the weak. Tobey Maguire is an adequate Peter Parker and brings a serious and at times comical spin to Spidey's world. Kirsten Dunst is a little dry, but the upside down kiss is amazingly cool and she is a beautiful young woman. Despite some early bumps in the first effect shots of Peter learning to use his powers, the web-slinging sequences are amazing. The soundtrack is one of the best CD's and best soundtracks put together for a movie probably and this film sets up the path of the sequel. Can't complain here! You can relate to Peter and his troubles (especially if you are a teenager!) and he is a very realistic hero. The film is very deliberate- there are no unnessecary explosions or deaths- everything is planned. Goblin takes revenge on those who wronged him, Peter fights in the name of his uncle.

The story of Peter Parker's evolution into the human arachnid was told with simple humor and action packed scenes with a beautiful New York City backdrop.  Kirsten Dunst has an excellent chemistry with Maguire on screen.  If their luscious kiss in the rain-soaked alley doesn't get most sexy kiss next year at the MTV movie awards, I will be very disappointed! Willam Dafoe as Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin was just down right wicked!  I've forgotten how good of an actor he can be.  He may have even over acted a little, but sometimes the villain has to have a distorted personality in the comic book and the movie screen.  James Franco, I can't wait to see how he pulls off being Spidy's arch-nemesis in the next movie.  And the guy who plays JJ Jameson, JK Simmons, he's right on the nose playing the obnoxious editor. Can you tell I highly recommend this movie? The few things which urked me: some of the CG effects looked fake, not the fly-through scenes but some of the actual fight scenes.

"dkeeley","Null","0","0","5 May 2002"," Finally, a comic-to-movie that works!
","Most often the problem with movies based on comics is that the director focuses on action scenes and special effects, adding character development and subplot as an afterthought and resulting in messes like ""Spawn"".<br/><br/>With Spider-Man Sam Raimi has instead managed to stay true to the themes of the existing story, such as Peter Parker's guilt and frustration, and the burdens as well as the benefits that come with his new powers.  This is due in part to Toby Maguire's great performance in the title role, portraying geeky unrequited love as well as ass-kicking bravado.  The film works because it's not just about a superhero but the man behind the mask as well.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dafoe provide solid support with Dafoe admirably resisting the opportunity to ham it up.  One criticism is the costume of the Green Goblin - the mask is so rigid and blank it robs the character of some of the twisted evil Willem Dafoe is so good at projecting.  When Norman Osborn is arguing with himself in the mirror it's a worthy attempt to give some depth to the character but that vanishes as soon as the suit goes on.<br/><br/>The film moves along quite nicely after the basics are sorted out, with plenty of fast-paced action.  It's here that Raimi uses his trump card - Spider-Man's mode of transport.  Just like Superman made you believe that a man could fly, here you follow Spidey slinging down the street, sweeping over the traffic and brilliantly capturing the speed and exhilaration he feels.  Even the ""Woohoo!"", which should seem plain silly somehow works.<br/><br/>Apart from the odd slightly overdone piece of romance (Kirsten Dunst's speech at the end in particular seems strained) the film has some great set-pieces and strong characters, making it a summer blockbuster that doesn't disappoint."

"jhclues","10","0","0","5 May 2002"," Raimi Delivers the Goods
","It may be a story lifted from the pages of a comic book, but with some strong performances, a focused story and some great F/X, director Sam Raimi puts blood in the veins of one of the best superheroes ever to hit the big screen.  And let's face it, right now the world needs just such a character; someone who can right wrongs, stave off injustice, assuage fears and give people a sense of security in a world seemingly gone amuck at times, and thanks to the magic of the movies we have him now.  His name is `Spider-Man.'<br/><br/>Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a normal, if not typical teenager; mature beyond his years, he would rather attend a science fair than go to a rave, he lives with his aunt and uncle (Rosemary Harris, Cliff Robertson) and has been in love with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), the girl who lives next door, since about the first grade.  `MJ,' however, doesn't even know he exists; except for an occasional `hello,' they barely know one another. But though Peter doesn't know it, all of that-- Peter's life-- is about to undergo a radical change.<br/><br/>On a field trip to a science lab, Peter is bitten by a spider-- not just any spider, but one that's been genetically altered.  And when he wakes up the next morning, he finds himself changed; it's not exactly Kafka's Metamorphosis, but he does have new life and new energy, and beginning with his vision (he suddenly can see clearly without his glasses), he gradually discovers that he has certain physical abilities that do not necessarily coincide with the kind of changes consistent with a young man of his age. Like being able to spin webs from his wrists and climb up the side of buildings.  And now all he has to do is learn how to control and use his newly found prowess, and decide what to do with it all.  Which he does very quickly, when circumstances provide him with a motive and a personal agenda that leads him to become, as Peter himself puts it, `Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.'<br/><br/>With this film, Raimi takes a page out of the Tim Burton Book and gives us a character that is convincing and real, because he shows us the man first, and then the superhero.  Like Burton did in the original `Batman,' in which Michael Keaton played to the man, rather than to the `bat,' Raimi takes Maguire down the same path, having him play to Peter, rather than the `spider.'  And it makes all the difference in the world.  Instead of merely thrusting a full-blown superhero onto the screen, Raimi first develops a plausible storyline (screenplay by David Koepp) complete with a central character to whom the audience can relate, and once that is established it enables the audience to suspend disbelief and go with the flow when Peter emerges as Spider-Man.  The F/X are incredible, and Raimi uses the stunning visual aspect of the film to great effect, but it would all be for naught without the solid core of believable characters he puts into place and then uses as a foundation upon which to build the spectacular.  It's reality based, but imaginatively presented-- Raimi definitely knows what works and how to entertain and involve his audience, which he certainly does here. And this is arguably Raimi's best work yet.<br/><br/>When it was announced that Tobey Maguire had landed the role of Spider-Man, you could almost hear the collective audible gasp of fans everywhere. Tobey Maguire?  Spider-Man?  !!!  But-- as it turns out-- it was inspired casting, as Maguire is perfect as everybody's favorite web-slinger.  In fact, hopefully he's been signed to a multi-picture deal, because now it is impossible to imagine anyone else in the role.  Without question, Maguire IS Spider-Man.  His appearance, the way he carries himself-- his entire countenance-- combined with his attitude and the subtle way he expresses himself, are all part and parcel of what brings Peter Parker and Spider-Man to life.  Maguire, as he has demonstrated previously in such films as `The Ice Storm' and `The Cider House Rules,' has a naturally pleasing and accessible personality that serves him so well in the characters he creates, and none more so than with his portrayal of Peter.  He has the talent and ability to aptly convey that `ordinary person under extraordinary circumstances' scenario and make it believable, which is exactly what was needed to make this film successful; and Maguire nails it with a performance that is introspective and affecting, and it makes the character-- as well as the film-- work.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe also contributes to the film's appeal with his portrayal of Norman Osborn, aka, the `Green Goblin.'  Not since the Joker sparred with Batman has the screen had such a memorable villain; and again, Dafoe first plays to the man-- to Osborn-- and then to the `Goblin,' which puts a real face on Evil and gives the character the depth that makes him more than just superficially `bad.'  Defoe goes that extra mile to make a Osborn real, and deserves credit for giving him real substance, rather than being satisfied with a one dimensional character that has nothing going on beneath the surface.  The Goblin is a complex character, and Dafoe plays him perfectly.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst had something of a challenge with her role of Mary Jane, as the character is somewhat ambiguous; on one hand, she plays a pivotal role in motivating Spider-Man, while her own part in the grand scheme of things remains uncertain until the end.  And only then are we given a glimpse of the direction in which MJ may go, and it will be interesting to see how the character develops in the next installment, now that the groundwork has been ably laid by Dunst.  In the final analysis, `Spider-Man' is a winner that is going to attract a huge following; this is one film that definitely has legs.  10/10."

Toby Maguire is the perfect Peter Parker with his small frame and intelligent looks, Kirsten Dunst simply does a good job acting and of course her sweet looks adds a nice touch and as for Dafoe, he is a villain that gets very close to Jack Nicholson's Joker, if only the Green Goblin's mask would show more of his facial expressions. The one actor which really made his character shine was J.K. Simmons as Daily Bugal Chief J. Jonah Jameson...he had it down all the way.

","Good show! Raimi's not a blockbuster director, but then ""Spiderman"" isn't a blockbuster film, no matter what the release date implies. It is, however, a great *comic book* film and a model for other directors (who often equate comic book films with stuff that blows up real good) to follow.<br/><br/>BTW, if you're the type of ""film""-goer who wants to see stuff blow up real good to a Mystikal soundtrack, skip ""Spiderman"" and wait for the next excretion from Michael Bay. This film's virtues will be lost on you.<br/><br/>I agree with NY Times' A.O. Scott that the most interesting parts of the movie are the intimate ones. ""Spiderman"" is an oddball insofar as the human drama is often more thrilling than the action setpieces. The special effect feel a little detached from the main story, which is really a tug of war between Ben and Norman for guardianship status with Peter and a tug of war between Peter and Harry for boyfriend status with Mary Jane. It's a neat interpersonal setup; the dialog is clunky, but Raimi and his actors do a fantastic job of selling it. The resolution between MJ and Parker at the end was both inspired and appropriate; it's a great counterpoint to his earlier selfishness (""You forgot to mention the part where I care"") to have him turn his back on the thing he wants the most to answer the call of duty.<br/><br/>The performances are excellent all around. No one here is counting his or her paycheck. Maguire is perfectly cast and really works as a vehicle for the wish fulfillment of everyone's inner geeky teen. Willem Dafoe adopts an effective less-is-more approach to Norman Osborne; there are moments when you cringe in anticipation of him suddenly lashing out. (The Green Goblin perf, though, is what you'd expect: a comic book caricature.) James Franco, as Norman Osborn's troubled son, is also in great form.<br/><br/>I liked the Raimi-isms, too (the montage sequences and neat screen wipes). Anyone worried about Evil Dead-ish camera freakouts should come away pleased. They're infrequent and tastefully deployed.<br/><br/>My grade: a solid A. Looks like 2002 is the year Marvel finally gets its act together."

","I have always been a big fan of the Spider-Man comics, and with a few exceptions, the movie follows the comic very accurately.  In the movie, his webbing comes directly from his wrist rather than from an invention of Peter's.  I for one felt that this actually added to the film rather then detracted from it.  It seems more plausible to me that with all the characteristics of the spider Peter inherited, he would get a power to make his own webbing.  His ""organic webshooters"" create a few funny scenes that could not be done otherwise.<br/><br/>For anyone that is familiar with Amazing Fantasy #15, the beginning of the movie is very predictable.  Green Goblin makes an excellent supervillian, however, his costume is a letdown.  Although it makes sense that it would be a flight suit to go with the glider, why would the helmet look like that? The helmet seems like a good way to go, but It looks very different from the original mask.  Green Goblin looks more like a robot from a Rob Zombie video than the Green Goblin in the comic book.  The classic look of the pumpkin bombs is gone and replaced with futuristic bombs.  And Gwenn Stacey has been replaced with M.J.  Other than the Green Goblin's appearance, these things really don't detract from the quality of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie has some of the best fight scenes ever, accurately portrays the comic, and has some incredible acting.  Sam Raimi is a genius and I have complete confidence in him that the other movies will be just as good."

You may not like it as much if your a big horror fan, but you may like the Green Goblin. Willem Dafoe is extrodinary as Norman Osborn turned Green Goblin. His cackle is just as I imagined, and he is excellent as a brilliant scientist gone insane. Tobey Maguire is also  good as the hero of the film. He makes a good science nerd turned superhero.

","Peter's narration at the beginning sets the stage for the tale of high-school woes... of the little guy being picked on... of the woman he loves and the people he fears.  This movie makes you care about Peter Parker before you ever give two hoots about Spider-Man. I laughed with the audience at the awkward way Peter handled his web-slinging, early on.  I genuinely cried when Uncle Ben died.  This movie, though seemingly fast-paced (in story), makes you feel for so many of the characters... even Harry, who just wants someone to love him.  The story isn't Amazing Fantasy #15 (the original tale), it's an amazing fantasy about a science geek, a pretty girl next-door, a controlling business man gone mad, and his lonely son, and the loss of loved ones. While I love the action, the effects, and Spider-Man himself--this movie succeeds in the simple tale of the hero we'd all be if we had the super-powers and the spandex.

Unlike most superhero films, Spider-Man makes you care about the characters involved, sympathize with Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), and feel every single twist and turn in this roller coaster ride of excitement.

","First of all, I want to say that I'm a HUGE Spider-Man fan. Been a fan of Marvel comics in general since I was a kid. I like the fact that the Marvel superheroes have super-powers but are also human and have human weaknesses. I love the Spider-Man saga and have been waiting for a Spider-Man movie since the 60s cartoon and late 70s TV show. That being said, I thoroughly ENJOYED this movie. I came in with little expectations since I didn't particularly like the trailers for the movie. I love Sam Raimi's direction in the movie. Tobey Macguire and Wilem Dafoe do excellent acting jobs as Spider-Man and his arch menesis The Green Goblin. I also enjoyed the early special effects scenes that showed Peter Parker learning to use his new Spider-powers. My only critism was the wack Green Goblin mask(one critic called it an Ultraman mask) and the anti-climatic ending. The cheesy dialogue was tolerable because it was true to the comic book feel of the movie. I will say that I saw it on May 3 when it came out and saw it twice already. The audience was enthralled with the movie, laughing and eating up every minute of it. The CGI/computer digital effects were cool for the most part. This bodes well for other Marvel movies coming out in 2003 such as ""The Hulk"" and ""Daredvevil"" which should also be good. I can't wait to for Spider-Man II & III to see the other great villains; Doctor Octopus, Electro, Mysterio, the Lizard, Sandman, Kingpin and Dr. Doom come to life. Kudos to Sam Raimi, Tobey Macguire, Wilem Dafoe and Kirsten Durst for a great movie and comic book adaptation. ""Spider-Man"" will make 200-300 million easy..."

"Thalya","10","0","0","5 May 2002"," I've never had so many thrills at a movie before..
","There's so much I could say about this movie and it wouldn't be enough. Let me put it to you this way. After seeing it last night I wanna see Spiderman 4 (after seeing this one 10 more times). And I thought XMen was a well made comic book movie, but this one had an amazing comic book feel to it, requisite episodes and all, and not just had the feel, but felt like you were inside the comic world and seeing more than the blocks would show you. You saw the meaning of ZOOM and KABLAM. The story was an excellent coming of age as you saw Peter evolve into the hero that is Spidey. Something I particularly liked was how Peter was Peter, but once in Spidey's suit, had Peter's voice but which felt exactly right as Spidey's too (kudos to Tobey Maguire). I had only seen a bit of the Spiderman cartoons when I was a kid in the 80s, but the villains had always seemed stupid and too whimsical/fantastical to really care about. Not so here. Willem Dafoe was superb at creating a real menace, A REAL MENACE! Something that was unpredictable and could snap at any moment, adding tons of suspense to any scene where Norman was in control, especially the one where he hugged Harry. In superhero movies you always know that the hero will beat the villain and that there's usually an Achilles heel, but not so here. Here the villain was clearly the stronger of the two, and while our hero has spider-strength and all, he's still human and less armored. It makes you appreciate the victory all the more. As for the score, it was generic (no themes). In a good way. Compared to something like FOTR where most of the emotion came from the score, the score stayed in the background save for some Green Goblin touches, letting the emotional quality of the story take center stage. I came to the movie needing a respite from life stresses, and heavy as they were, I got sucked in by the story. Not to mention it may have been formulaic, but I couldn't tell. I'm not up to snuff on the whole Green Goblin mythos, but it was great to see the chaotic villain calling the shots in a wild and fastpaced world where anything could happen. Even when things were predictable and you could tell what was going to be said, something that followed brought the cliche back into reality (the scene where MJ & Peter talk outside their houses for instance).<br/><br/>Here is the cultural mythology we've been lacking for some time, and while we're living in a golden age when comic book movies are all the rage (with some Marvel-icious stuff like The Hulk and Daredevil coming soon to a theater near you), it's a shame that only now are all these wonderful stories coming out of the ghetto. Heroes with a solid moral code instead of all the Stallone/Schwarzenegger/Willis/Gibson crap that we've been fed the last 20 or so many years. I'm also thankful that studios are getting great directors like Raimi with real respect for the material instead of hacks like Schumacher.<br/><br/>In summation, I loved everything and the details made it come alive. To quote my favorite line: Woooohooooooo!!!!"

","Stan and the rest of the Guys/Gals at Marvel... I am impressed. With this film, I do believe that you guys whooped DC's butt in Hollywood. I have never had so much fun watching a movie in my lifetime, so far. That fun was to the extent of the first hour and 20 minutes seemed only like the 20 minutes, because I was so into the film. Of course I still did not like Green Goblin not looking like his comic book counter-part along with Aunt May/Uncle Ben being the only characters (AND the most unlikely ones, at that) to cuss. By the way, why did you guys edit out Peter telling Norman Osborn that his parents were killed when he was 4? A lot of people in the theater, who didn't know Spidey, were really confused as to why Pete lived with his Aunt/Uncle. All-in-all, I had to rate this film a definite 9/10. If not for what I described as the faults, I would've given it a perfect 10 on the spot. Hopefully, Spider-man 2 will have some other characters in it...I'm thinking the Venom, Carnage and Separation Anxiety series (with Black Cat involved) would be a GREAT sequel, ending up as it's own film story.

"fumanstan","10","0","0","5 May 2002"," A Perfect Comic Book Adaptaion
","This movie succeeds on many levels by doing what other comic book movies of late fail to do (X-Men, Blade, Blade 2, Batman and Robin).  Spider-Man establishes a certain charm to each of its characters that actually makes you feel for the plight of Peter Parker, Mary Jane, Norman Osborn, and Harry Osborn.  X-Men was constrained by its short running time, failing to establish the segregation between humans and mutants as well the emotions of the individual X-Men (except Wolvernie and possibly Rogue).  Blade swereved toward the direction of an outright action flick, with fight scenes to overcome the lack of personality in Wesley Snipes character.  Spider-Man however provides what these other movies lack, a combination of character development and action that allows it to please a wide range of movie-goers. While Tobey Maguire often lacks emotion in his speeches (both his outburst against Uncle Ben and the final scene with Mary Jane), the awkwardness he displays works surprisingly well as Parker.  Willem Dafoe played the psychological aspects of Norman Osborne/Green Goblin to perfection, and his rant to himself infront of the mirror shows not only his range as an actor, but the complexity of a comic book character.  Spider-Man did not attempt to overwhelm the audience with a myriad of special effects and action sequences, it built up to them for just the right climax accompanied by emotion.  This movie is a 10, and no question as to why it broke box office records."

","***SLIGHT SPOILER*** The 1980's had Superman, the 90's had Batman, and regardless of how much people liked X-men, the new millenium belongs to Spiderman. From it's opening voice-over by Peter Parker, played convincingly by Tobey Maguire, to the long awaited kiss and surprising ""rejection"" of Mary Jane at the end, this movie gave the audience a feel good aura when they left the theatre. In the movie, we meet Peter Parker, a younger, more nerdy Clark Kent. However, there is one reason why Petey is a better character than Clark. Many of us can relate to Parker.  You can't tell me there was never one person you liked or loved in high school, but could never have. We truly believe Peter Parker and his fellow friends are as real to us as our next door neighbor. We honestly cheered the good guy on.  We felt good when Spidey kissed MJ, felt even better when we see Peter Parker rip apart his shirt to reveal the Spidey costume underneath (eat your heart out Clark Kent), let out a big ""yeah"" when Peter Parker kissed MJ. Even the way it ended left you wanting more, when Peter says to MJ they can only be friends, and we get this slight hint that MJ knows he is Spiderman.

","When I left this movie I was a little angry and frustrated.  If I had written this review the second I had stepped out of the theatre, I probably would of ranked it a 6.  I was angry and frustrated because of two stupid things.<br/><br/>The first stupid thing was an action on my part - going to the 1pm Saturday matinee.  Why was this stupid?  - Because I should have foreseen the second stupid thing, PARENTS!<br/><br/>I don't know, but I'm thinking here that a movie doesn't get a PG-13 rating simply so that 5 year olds will have a baby-sitter at the movie.  Maybe, just maybe some things may not be appropriate for kids UNDER 13.  I won't pretend to be a parenting expert, but is it a stretch of common sense to think that parents may do a little investigation before bringing their young ones to the movie?  Maybe it was the kid crying on and off behind me, or the one to my left somewhere asking 'why?' or 'how come?' every 5 minutes, or the one immediately to my right that would duck down behind the seat in front of her every scary/action scene until her mom said it was OK to look again...  Needless to say, this atmosphere took something away from the ambiance.<br/><br/>The Movie:<br/><br/>Now, the day after, I've had some time to think about the movie and I would rate it 7 or 8.  It was fun and I thought the comic feeling was adapted well.  The change from nerd to superhero kept the first half or more of the show moving along nicely.  Peter discovering his abilities, and testing the limits of those abilities provided many memorable scenes and quite a few chuckles throughout the theatre (and a bunch of 'how come?' questions from my left- grin).  Through all this Peter still came across as a 'typical teen'.  Also, I thought the irony of the, ""I fail to see how this is my problem"" sequence was so true to life...How often have we not done something we could of, or not done something as well as possible only to have it later cause us problems (or grief)?<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, I liked the way all the loose ends weren't neatly tied off, and I liked the fact that some things didn't turn out as good as you could hope for Spider-man.<br/><br/>On the negative side, I thought the movie dragged a bit in the second half building up to the final battle.  Maybe not so much that it dragged, but I got the feeling they had emptied there bag of superhero tricks and surprises and were treading water for a while.<br/><br/>Overall, atmosphere aside, I enjoyed the movie, and would say Spider-man was successful in his leap to the big screen."

"DMcD-2","7","0","0","5 May 2002"," Catches the feel of the comic, but where's Gwen Stacy?
","I saw ""Spider-Man"" yesterday with my wife, who is not a comics reader. Both of us enjoyed the movie, which we can best describe as ""fun."" The acting is passable, largely because the script is only passable.  The only outstanding performance is by J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson; he makes the most of a small role and hits the comics character's tone dead-on. While Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe sometimes walk through the movie (except in big dramatic scenes), their performances are satisfying, if not spectacular. Kirsten Dunst, however, is atypically flat as Mary Jane Watson.<br/><br/>Dunst was miscast, in my opinion. M.J. is a stunner, a true knockout, the girl who told Peter Parker, upon their first meeting in the comics,""Face it, Tiger! You just hit the jackpot!"" She needs to be gorgeous and sexy, and Dunst is pretty and sympathetic. With her round face and sweet demeanor, Dunst would have been well cast as Gwen Stacy, the first true love of Peter's life.<br/><br/>***SPOILER WARNING***<br/><br/>The love of Peter's life, that is, until Spider-Man failed to save her from the Green Goblin, who knocked the unconscious Gwen off the George Washington bridge. Spidey caught her with a webline, but the whiplash of the sudden stop broke her neck.<br/><br/>This sequence is more or less recreated during the movie when Mary Jane is dropped off the bridge by the Goblin as Peter faces a ""Sophie's Choice"" situation -- save M.J. or the tram full of kids. The movie cheats by having Spider-Man defy the law of gravity. By pushing off the bridge with his powerful legs, he manages to accelerate faster than the already falling objects, something which is impossible without artificial propulsion. Peter does this twice in the film, the first time during the World Unity Day battle when he dives past the falling M.J. to catch her and ""bungie-web"" them both to the ground. I guess love is a powerful motivator.<br/><br/>***END SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Despite this, despite the obvious use of CGI in many of the action sequences, and despite the fact that Spider-Man's mask clearly is a separate piece of cloth when necessary but is connected to the rest of the INCREDIBLE costume most of the time (a problem also seen in the comics), I enjoyed the film a great deal. I do wish Peter had been canny enough to pitch his voice differently when suited up (a basic superhero point that both the Superman and Batman movies have used to good effect). People you know well can recognize your voice, even through a cloth mask!<br/><br/>""Spider-Man"" is a good, enjoyable movie-movie. It's more fun than ""X-Men,"" certainly more interesting than ""Blade,"" but not quite up there with ""Batman Returns"" and ""Superman."" Take a friend, take your spouse if he or she can get into some outrageous action that's more plausible than what you see in the average Schwarzenegger picture.<br/><br/>One caveat: During the show I attended, a child no more than five sat down the aisle from me. He seemed to enjoy the show immensely (at least from his smiles when the credits rolled), but my wife and I both thought the picture was too intense for young children during Osborne's tortured multiple personality discussions and the fight scenes -- the brutal final battle most of all. This movie is rated PG-13 with good reason. I know people drag kids no older than 10 to R-rated films, but the MPAA usually isn't kidding when it says ""Parents Strongly Cautioned"" and ""No One Under 17 Admitted Without Parent or Guardian."""

For you who have never read the comic, and don't know diddily-squat about Spider~Man, have no fear.<br/><br/>
This movies is fit for Spider~Man comic book readers, and non-Spider~Man comic book readers. The movie is in my opinion, in depth, realistic, and just too cool. Yet it strictly stays to the plots, so it doesn't bore you. Instead of having a man in black spandex, a cap, and pointy bat ears who's naturally and physically capable of kicking anyone's tail in (with the help of a high-tech vehicle)we have Peter Parker. A soon-to-be Highschool graduate, nerd, and lowdown in the faces of his peers(for the exception of a couple). He's small in frame, but has a big mind. Peter Parker loves the girl next door, and has a rich boy for a best friend. It seems all of us can relate to Peter in some way, yet look to him like a real hero.<br/><br/>
When Peter Parker becomes ""Your friendly neighborhood Spider~Man"" or the ""Amazing Spider~Man"" his personal life as a ""normal"" young man doesn't change his social status.<br/><br/>Even though it carries a PG-13 rating, I'd say this movie is slightly suitable for nearly all ages. Towards the end when Spider~Man fights the Green Goblin, it'll probably terrify a 6 year old. The younger ones might hate the kissing scenes, but anyone can love Spider~Man's heroic moments.<br/><br/>This movie was definitely worth my time, and I plan to see it 1,000 more times in theaters, and watch it more than 1,000 times when it comes on video. If you've been dying to see this movie, you'll go home satisfied. If you hate comics, hate super-heroes, and just don't care to see Spider~Man, hopefully you'll have a change of heart. But you've wasted your time if you go home grumpy.<br/><br/>I've given this movie a 10 out of 10. To me, this is the best film I've seen! I can't wait for the future Spider~Man films. Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire were the perfect picks. The graphics were amazing, the acrobatics and form of Spider~Man were perfect to the comic, and the acting was AMAZING!!! You couldn't pick a better cast.<br/><br/>!!!!!!!!!!!!!SPIDER~MAN RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

","I loved the movie, I thought the specail effects where great, the characters where great, and the story was true to the comics. This movie left you wanting more of the ""Friendly Neighborhood Spider"". I have been a Spider fan for a long time and I feel that this move adds a new look for the new generation of comic readers. I believe that we all need a hero like this to look up to in this time of need and Spider-man has always been a symbol of juctice, freedom, and hope. I hope this movie has given you the same hope it has given me.<br/><br/>Thanks you, Dentonco81"

","what can't i say about this movie.  as a big spider-man buff, i was almost brought to tears by how well this movie matched the comic book.  as a movie buff, i was captivated by how brilliant the film was as a whole.  it was purposely cheesy at parts (i.e. goblin screaming ""WE'LL MEET AGAIN!""), had a strong wit, and was vibrant and full of color.  tobey maguire has always been a favorite of mine, and he didn't disappoint, playing the perfect shy, calm character that peter parker is.  they couldn't have picked a better face than willem dafoe for the green goblin.  and i've always loved kirsten dunst for numerous reasons.  the only comic book movie that ever compared was the original batman.  but i think with batman, people blew it up because of the sheer star power of the movie.  taking nothing away from maguire, dafoe, and dunst, this movie didn't need a star-studded cast to capture the audience.  they just nailed every little detail that brought the comic book to life.  they didn't try to make it realistic like x-men, and they didn't try to make it overly-dramatic like superman.  where all other comic book movies tried to be movies first, and capture the essense of the comic book second, this movie took everything right from the pages and put them onto the screen.  i can't wait for the sequel (there will so be one) where he takes on the lizard (he mentioned dr. connors in the movie), venom, doc octopus, or whoever.  it will be great."
"rongreelfilms","10","0","0","5 May 2002"," Had been caught in a web of low expectations...
","Well, to be honest, I had been caught in a web of low expectations from the moment that I heard Peter Parker would be played by Toby Maguire.  What a relief to see that his boyish qualities played into the role of Peter Parker so well!  I loved watching as Peter Parker, with his newly found powers, swing from building to building in such an inexperienced quality to it. Arms and leg flailing, while screaming at the top of his lungs.  All in all, I give Toby Maguire two thumbs up for the proportion of the character that he filled with such ease.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst, a beautiful young actress who portrayed the never forgotten comic book character Mary Jane Watson, also did a superb job playing her character.  I felt that with Toby Maguire playing Peter Parker, who I felt he did not resemble at all until I saw him acting the part, Kirsten Dunst can certainly pass as Mary Jane Watson, who I had originally felt also failed to resemble the character all that much.  I now feel she played the role well and just hope that her character is not changed in the sequel, like in the majority of past movie sequels.<br/><br/>William Dafoe, although seemingly old and withered, was the one actor who I knew would fill the shoes of Green Goblin with ease!  Through great voices and great movement, this character was complete.  There is always one problem with every character, though, and this did not deal with the actor at all.  I was so thrilled to see Dafoe as Green Goblin due to the simple fact that I thought his face actually looked quite similar to how the comic book character would look in real life footage.  The costume was simply horrendous, although it did work in with the character seeing how he worked in a company that revolved around science and mechanics, such as the hover board.  Dafoe played the part with excellence.<br/><br/>All of the characters, from J.K. Simmons role of J. Jonah Jameson to the mere part of the burglar played by Michael Papajohn, were remarkable through great acting, as well as great directing by Sam Raimi.<br/><br/>SPOILER (in some aspects) - One last problem, in my opinion, is the simple fact that Harry Osborn, James Franco, now holds a severe grudge against Spider-Man!  I pray to God that he is not going to be the next villain, yet if the next villain or any in the future are to be Harry Osborn, he should play the part!  Never change actors in sequels no matter how small the part!<br/><br/>Rob Ron gives this movie two big thumbs up!  Big thumbs due to the simple fact that I was so into the movie I actually began sucking at them for the whole length of the movie..."

","Marvel is starting to make some decent movies. Blade and Blade 2 were both good and Spider-Man is.. well.. amazing. I was a little skeptical when I heard Sam Raimi was directing it, but I was wrong. This is a great film.<br/><br/>
Mind you, its not going to please the purists. I heard a couple of them as I walked out of the theater whining about how it didnt follow the plotline of the comic or ""Where was Gwen Stacy?"" Personally, I don't give a rat's @$$ about Gwen Stacy or how they changed the storyline from the comics. You can't please purists, so why bother trying. This is definitely a movie for the true-believers. Sam Raimi should be proud of this achievement as should Stan Lee. I only hope that they learn from the mistakes of the Batman series and keep it one villain per movie and that they dont use the Green Goblin again until Spider-Man 3. If they are done right (and given proper funding), Spider-Man could easily last for 6-7 movies.<br/><br/>My only complaint about the movie is that I wish Stan Lee had a better cameo."

I don't think many actors or actresses could capture the roles of Mary Jane, Spider Man, and the Green Goblin better than Kirsten Dunst, Tobey Maguire, and Willem Dafoe.<br/><br/>Overall this movie deserves a B+."
"KMM","9","0","0","5 May 2002"," Greatest Comic Book Adaptation since Superman: The Movie
","It has been a long time since I went to the movies to watch a comic book adaptation and come away so completely and utterly satisfied. I drove 65 miles to an AMC Theatre in Overland Park because the theaters in Topeka are relics that should be condemned. It was worth the trip out there!!<br/><br/>Sam Raimi hit a bull's-eye with Spiderman sticking closely to the comic book's central theme. He also succeeds in having a good balance between the drama and the humor in the film as well as presenting a lot of storyline detail in a movie that is just over 2 hours long. I have quickly become a huge fan of his over the last few years, and after seeing Spiderman, I enjoy his work even more than before. There are some minor problems and changes with Spiderman compared to the comic book, but they are just that...minor.<br/><br/>
Tobey Maguire made a believer out of me as Peter Parker. I was quite skeptical when I first heard the announcement he was going to play this role. He turned out to be a great pick proving me wrong. I felt he did a good job carrying out the transformation his character goes through from high school nerd to an individual presented with great gifts who, through various trials and tribulations, quickly learns that with great power comes great responsibility.  Willem Dafoe pulled off Norman Osborne beyond my expectations playing him and his evil alter ego, The Green Goblin, with diabolical delight. I liked the fact that the director allowed the movie to be dark in tone when it needed to be and also to be violent in its portrayal of The Green Goblin as he wreaks havoc and carnage towards his enemies and in the finale as he meets his demise.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't necessarily have an upbeat ending, but rather nicely sets up for the upcoming sequel. It showed the viewer that the abilities Peter Parker now possesses are not just a gift, but are also a curse because of occurrences that took place due partly in fact to his being Spiderman. For example, the events that took place with Mary Jane and his Aunt Mae. When his enemy learned who the man behind the mask really was, those closest to him were tormented. There is also great tragedy in the fact that Peter Parker is between a rock and a hard place as his alter ego, Spiderman, when it comes to his best friend Harry Osborne. As the movie winds down, Harry has animosity and bitterness toward Spiderman because he thinks he murdered his father, but at the same time considers Peter Parker the only real family he has left.<br/><br/>It was also very cool to see Bruce Campbell have a cameo as the ring announcer during the wrestling scene. Although brief, it is a memorable scene for Bruce Campbell fans. I will definitely see this one again. Just a wonderful 2 hours of movie making that gives me hope knowing there are still moviemakers out there that know how to bring superhero flicks to the big screen with major success. This movie was meant to do nothing more than entertain its audience and it goes above and beyond that. Go and watch Spiderman today!!!<br/><br/>9/10"

","This film left me dumbstruck, and afterwards I just kept visualizing myself leaping over the theater seats and swinging over some balcony barriers. No, I did not want to become a monkey, but watching a live-action Spider-Man on-screen coaxed me into suspending disbelief for a short while; if you'd told me immediately after I saw it that you'd seen someone swinging across the skyline, I'd have believed you in a second. I wanted to be the wall-crawling superhero, but I also wanted to be Mary Jane as well!<br/><br/>
Tobey Maguire portrays the average guy who's suddenly blessed with extraordinary capabilities, and he shows how Peter Parker grows into the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man New York comes to love. Even though I initially thought that he wasn't fit for the role, he proved me wrong. Go see this movie."

"johnerickrubis","Null","0","0","5 May 2002"," Dynamically impressive; great, yet there are a few flaws.
","***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** Definitely box-office material. A rising actor (who's been mostly the supportive actor in movies) is waiting in the wings to take on a lead-through breaking role! A veteran director who has learned so much from his movie-making is getting the chance to embrace the audience again like he did with the 'Evil Dead' series, which launched a cult following. And you got a hot-babe actress who's been plastered into any magazine you can read in a Waldenbooks or even, a grocery store. In addition, you can get a top notch villain-looking actor who's starred in 'Streets of Fire' and that vampire-actor movie which he released like 2 years ago playing Nosferatu with John Malkovich. And legendary great actor, Cliff Robertson, himself. Good for the moral advice. To sum it up, put in America's Web-headed Hero in comic books for almost 40 years now which has catapulted a great following spewing webs back and forth on buildings and kicking major a** on the antagonists, and what do you have? A great movie all in itself. These are some really cool ingredients put altogether. You can't say anything bad about it ... except, there's some portions you can tell like knowing the CGI Spidey from the costumed Maguire. But hey, it beats the T.V. Series from the 70's which didn't even came, not even close to Spidey's freeflow movements here. The same for Green Goblin. I did spotted some more bad things like a license plate on a car which looked different somewhat. I don't know if it is a NY one or not. And about the Spider that bit Parker, if he stung more people, everyone would be having the powers too. That mutated Spider should've been caught later. Also with Parker obtaining these powers, any one in the high school should know by now (because Parker showed it) that HE is Spider-Man. I'm sure anyone would figure that right off the bat ... Going back to praise the movie, Maguire is awesome. Kirsten Dunst is too. Good to know a sequel is in the works. Good job director Sam Raimi. I loved everything totally just about. Looks very comic-book like just as it should be!  9.0/ out of 10. Kudos to Stan Lee for accepting this movie. Your dream came true! Excelsior!"
"ef2001","Null","0","0","5 May 2002"," ""Amazing"" Spider-Man hardly amazing
","Spider-Man has a new arch-nemesis, and it isn't a goblin, octopus, or crime boss.  It's Screenwriter David Koepp, who has botched more movies than I can recall.  Overall, I enjoyed the movie, however there are a few things which I wish my spider sense had warned me about. I have to give Koepp credit for developing the character of Peter Parker. He did so throughout the movie so by the end I connected with the character, and Tobey Maguire did an excellent job portraying the web-slinger and his alter ego.  But that is the extent of credit I can allow myself to give to Koepp. I had to draw the line at the Green Goblin.  While Dafoe played an excellent Norman Osborn, he wasn't given much to work with in regards to the Green Goblin.  The character's lines were stereotypical, underdeveloped and down-right boring.  The same went for Mary Jane(Kirsten Dunst); Harry Osborn (James Franco), and the rest of the cast. My final verdict?  It's worth seeing once in the theater, but this spdiey-fan will wait for the movie to swing into video stores before watching it again."

","I got to see this at a sneak as well.  Maybe if I had read the comics when I was younger I would appreciate the film more.  No, I don't think so. Granted, Spider-Man was my favorite superhero when I was a kid.  I had an action figure with a motorcycle, helicopter, etc. and Dr. Octopus.  Now, I'd like to see Dr. Octopus in a movie.  This movie, I feel, did not live up to its billing.  I enjoyed and even laughed during the scenes where Parker is just learning the ropes of his new powers (""Go web go!"").  But once he, or should I say a CGI, started swinging around I lost interest.  It was too fake.  I guess if the movie had come out about five years ago, the images would have wowed me, but it just didn't flow together.  It did seem a little anti-climactic as well.  Willem Dafoe was not used to his fullest potential. His Goblin was too impersonal (perhaps it was the ridiculously robotic outfit).  Anyway, it's not a Top 250 film, but I guess the comic book geeks have spoken."
"Doddi","10","0","0","7 May 2002"," Comic adventures don't get any better!!
","Since early childhood my vague memory of seeing actual Spiderman film has troubled me since the talks of this big screen version began. Not until now did I wanna check fully out why I felt so sure about seeing a movie before. My answer was: Movie made for TV - The Amazing Spider-man. So, relieved and sure I wasn't crazy I went with an open mind on the first big screen version of Spiderman and boy oh boy: it was everything I would have wanted from a comic book adventure put onto screen. One fault (better to deal with that first!): The soundtrack didn't capture me right away but maybe it will later. Danny Elfman is of course the master of tunes and his score for Batman and Batman Returns and his best Edward Scissorhands (along with Men in Black) made him for me the best choice for Spider-Man. Thank God, he was chosen.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi was not very known to me but when I heard James Cameron might do it, I got interested since I loved Titanic so much. Again, Raimi didn't interest me much but that surely paid off when I saw the picture because I don't believe James Cameron or anybody could have done it better. Sam Raimi, for what it's worth: Thank you for the best comic book adventure put on screen!<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst and Willem Dafoe were great choices. Two great actors with great movies behind them. Tobey Maguire has been a light favourite after seeing him in Pleasantville but as Spider-Man ...??? I never would have guessed - and again it pays off because it is so credible. I couldn't imagine any other doing the same perfect justice to the Peter Parker/Spider-Man double life.<br/><br/>For me, though, this first Spider-Man movie, is an offer first and foremest for what is about to come. The character development, esp. for Spiderman/Peter Parker was necessary here and Mary Jane as well. So I look forward for the future. Somehow I also find Spider-man to be the most believable of all these cartoon heroes - why? Don't know!<br/><br/>To sum it up: special effects, sets, cinematography... so brilliant. Storyline: great, but some side-characters weren't great enough...if you know what I mean. Acting: great, perfect in Tobey's case. Music: great. Directing: I'm just sorry for doubting Sam Raimi so much - no one could have done it better. Well, it doesn't get much better than this. - Doddi"

After seeing the movie I'm still not sure that Maguire was the right actor for the job, but I am sure that this movie was excellent.<br/><br/>As the opening credits begin the first thing I thought was ""Ohh this has got to be Danny Elfman music.."" Sure enough it was. That is step #1 in the director's guide to having a successful action movie: You must have Danny Elfman provide the music (Well, Elfman or Alan Silvestri). The music throughout is excellent. Willem Dafoe is good as the Green Goblin. The movie has very few slow points, but most of them involve sappy love scenes between Maguire and the poorly-casted Kirsten Dunst. There are 3000 other redheads who could have played MJ better. Cliff Robertson plays a surprisingly good role as Peter Parker's uncle, Ben.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is enjoyable. It definitely gets you psyched about the sequels. The coolest parts of this movie is the very last scene where Peter Parker asserts: I am Spiderman.  =)"

","Sam Raimi has done it! He's created a film based on a comic book that fans and non-fans alike can enjoy. It sticks close enough to the original source material, while introducing some new ideas to the Spider-man mythos. Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast as our favorite wall crawler. He is shy and clumsy as Peter Parker and exuberant as Spidey. The early scenes showing Pete learning how to use his newly acquired abilities are very well done and quite funny. The few scenes with his Uncle Ben are touching. Like Nicholson did when he played the Joker,  Willem Dafoe chews up the scenery, the furniture, the props and his fellow actors as the over-the-top Green Goblin. J.K. Simmons is pefect as J. Jonah Jameson. And Kirsten Dunst is good as Mary Jane Watson. The CG effects are just fine, even though I've read other's criticisms that the web-slinging scenes aren't convincing. As far as comic book movies go, I would rate this higher than the recent X-Men and Blade movies, but not quite up to the level of the original Superman movie with Chris Reeve. A solid three stars out of four."

"morinb4593","10","0","0","5 May 2002"," Best comic book movie made and I disagree about some flaws
","First, let me say that I have never posted my thoughts before but Spiderman blew me away and some of what the critics have said have frustrated me so much that I feel compelled to respond.<br/><br/>***Spoilers below****<br/><br/>ALL of the cast was perfect in this film, even Mr. Dafoe. I grew up on Spiderman comics and I have always felt that the Goblin was meant to be an ""Over the top"" character and Mr. Dafoe played it pitch perfect. Some have said that his motivations are unclear but not to me. Osbourne is losing his company so the Goblin wants to protect him so to speak by taking out the competition and the board of directors as well, then when the wall crawler gets in the way, take him out as well. I will admit that the Goblin armour looks a bit strange but it did not bother me at all, since I read that they were going to use latex masks at first.  The cheesiness of that idea scares me to death!<br/><br/>Next, Spiderman has always been my favorite hero because of his vulnerability and human side.  I was so glad to see that Mr. Raimi spent time developing the characters instead of taking the easy way out with constant action. Also, yes the CGI had a few flaws but I thought that added to the comic book feel and enhanced the film.<br/><br/>****Major Spoilers***<br/><br/>I thought the ending was super because it could be interpreted either way. I think MJ knows who Peter is by comparing the two kisses.  I also did not miss Spidey's witty remarks because in this film, Peter is just learning his powers and has lost his uncle, so his seriousness makes perfect sense. Wittiness will come with time and confidence in his abilities. (i.e. sequels).  This is by far the best comic book movie ever made!  It has it all and can be enjoyed by everyone! Cant wait for the DVD!"
"mightyt2k","Null","0","0","5 May 2002"," Truly disappointing and I'm not afraid to say it!
","Possible spoilers below:  Ok, folks, I'm gonna break this down.  Don't jump down my back immediately.  Listen to what I say and you may even agree. First, let's talk about super hero/comic book movies in general.  I still have yet to see a film get it right the way the original Superman did. Christopher Reeve brought so much charisma to The Man Of Steel as well as Clark Kent, that BOTH personas were enjoyable.  And as far as his nemesis Lex Luther, Hackman was superb.  Where Batman missed was in the portrayal of the hero himself.  The Batman series always seemed to mainly focus on the villains.  Batman himself was always so flat and dull, that pretty much anyone could play him.  This is why when Batman was replaced, not once but twice, nobody really seemed to mind.  But every villain throughout the series was always played to perfection.  The Joker, Riddler, Two-Face and Mr. Freeze were all my favorite elements of the films.  Which brings us to Spider-Man.<br/><br/>I appreciate how much Raimi tried to stick with the comic book storyline, but I think his pacing was way off.  The movie dragged so much, at times it seemed to come to a complete halt.  The action scenes were far and few between, and when one actually occurred, it was never very exciting. Spider-Man's wrestling skills in the ring did not impress me one bit. Also, whenever he caught a ""baddie"" in the street, the scene was so quick, so uninspired and non-inventive that it played more like teaser trailer than the actual movie.  The acting by Uncle Ben and Aunt May was hilariously bad, and Uncle Ben's death seemed awful heavy handed.  The movie also had trouble finding its own tone and voice.  It couldn't decide if it wanted to be campy fun or have a realistic feel.  The film's attempt at adding a human element (Peter and Mary Jane's love affair) was a failed experiment; for the simple fact that J. Jonah Jamison (my favorite guy in the film) was played so campy and seemed right out of a comic book himself.  And I just happened to have some personal questions of my own that were never answered.  Why was Peter always late and chasing the bus?  To show he was a geek?  Hell, we could LOOK at him and see he was a geek.  If anything, always being late for school makes you ""cool"" because it shows a lack of discipline and defiance in your character.  How did Peter always have cameras set up to take photographs of Spider-Man in action?  I know he has ""Spidey Sense"" but does that tell him hours in advance where crime would occur?  Do people see him setting up these cameras?  What happened to the spider that bit Peter?  It was never killed.  Suppose it bites someone else?  And how did a geek like Peter become best friends with a millionaire like Harry anyway?<br/><br/>Spider-Man himself was played fairly well, but that's the easy part. Anybody could wear a costume and do some choreographed fight scenes-- it probably wasn't Tobey McGuire under the suit anyway.  But my biggest problem was with the costume of the Green Goblin.  Who decided to give him that metallic face?  I was hoping for make-up, a moving mask, or some Henson-like puppetry.  Instead we get a mask that hides his expressions; his lips don't even move.  It's bad enough we have to look at Spider-Man behind a mask, but now his enemy as well?  Come on!  I also thought they went overboard with the CGI graphics.  Many scenes resembled a video game instead of a movie. And did anyone else notice the lack of music in this movie?  Many scenes were dead silent for long periods of time and when music did arrive, it was downright lousy.<br/><br/>Overall the film just didn't have enough attitude to me.  It played things too safe.  It didn't have the ""oompf"" of Batman, nor the charm of Superman. And what about that ending??  Parker tells Mary Jane he can not be with her. Why?  He gave no reason.  I thought he loved this woman.  Instead he walks off and leaves her crying in the cemetery!!  What kind of hero doesn't get the girl at the end?  Lois Lane and Vicki Vale would not approve.<br/><br/>The only truly enjoyable scene in Spider-Man that I had no problem with was the parade scene.  Fast paced, exciting and very good action.  Oh wait...I did have one problem with that scene. They didn't kill Macy Gray."
"jclinard","Null","0","0","5 May 2002"," A Worthy Adaptation
","Spider-Man produced a film that was highly faithful to the spirit of the comic books and the evolution of the character.  He was initially selfish with his powers, learning about them and neglecting his chores, and then using them to beat the bullying Flash Thompson in a fight.  The wrestling match was a part of comic lore, but it was nicely condensed into both his desire to impress M.J. (getting money to buy a car), and refusing to stop the burgler that killed his uncle after he was cheated out of his rightful winnings.  After that, he used his powers unselfishly; fighting crime and protecting the innocent.<br/><br/>On the flip side, we have Norman Osborn, and his evolution into the Green Goblin.  He also gained great power, but used them to defeat his business rivals and murder the board of directors who were going to sell out his company and fire him.  Granted, he was insane, but it was the risk he took to further his own agenda.  Predictably, it put him at odds with Spider-Man, and as in tradition, learned Peter's secret, and used it against the people he loved best.<br/><br/>To round out the cast, we have Harry Osborn, Peter's best friend, who wrongly blames Spider-Man for his father's death (and sets the stage for his eventual decent into madness and the role of the second Green Goblin), and Mary Jane Watson.  A confused girl from an abusive household, she eventually realized she'd had crushes on the wrong men her entire life.  Flash was a bully, Harry wouldn't stand up for her, and even in the end, the heroic Spider-Man wasn't the right man for her.  She realized it was Peter, who didn't care if she was poor and waiting tables, who truly cared for her, and she for him.  In the closing scene, she almost certainly guessed his secret (from both Peter's words to her, and her expression and the way she felt her lips... she'd been kissed like that before).<br/><br/>Other fun features were the short appearances of the Daily Bugle staff, the crime scene notes (compliments of your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man), and even a reference to Dr. Conners (a scientist who eventually becomes the villain The Lizard).<br/><br/>What would I like to see in a sequel?  MJ confessing her knowledge of Peter's secret to him, more of the Daily Bugle staff, and a single villain (unlike most super-hero sequels, which tend to feature villain team-ups); preferably Doctor Octopus.  Doc Ock is probably Spidey's foremost nemesis, and it would be nice to see how that megalomaniac tries to turn four extra arms into world dominiation."

","Big Hype, big promises, delayed release, Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker in a huge miscast...<br/><br/>I wanted it to be good, but didn't have great expectations.<br/><br/>Then two words like a beacon in the fog:<br/><br/>Sam Raimi.<br/><br/>In the best comic book adaptation to date, Raimi dispels every qualm I had about this film.

Congratulations to Sam and to Don Burgess and everyone on the cast and crew on a job well done.  Your film reaches audiences on a level far more sophisticated than any other Marvel (or DC) adaptation to date.  Your accolades are well deserved.

","Let me just start with that I am not a big comic book fan. I read a couple but they never grew on me. I went to see this movie because I am a real big Sam Raimi(the director)fan. I loved his early work such as the EVIL DEAD trilogy,& DARKMAN. they are great films, but with SPIDER-MAN, Sam Raimi and crew delivers, big time. With a mix of stunning special effects, great costuming, wonderful actors,and a great story line, this film makes other super hero films look like kareokee at your local bar, sure it would be fun to participate, but when its time to watch, you can't help but cringe. I love the way this movie is shot. somehow they were able to film this in such a way, that when Spidey is swinging, it feels like your right there swinging with him. With all of those things I mentioned and a Danny Elfman score, this movie is a very fun experience. I give it a 10!!!!"

","The greatest(arguably) comic hero of all time was desecrated by this pathetic attempt at a film. Everything surrounding Spider-Man's character ---- viz his relationship with the Osbournes, Mary Jane etc was given way too much importance and time. The fact that this was supposed to be an action movie, not a glossed up love story eluded Director Sam Raimi.The introduction to Spider-Man, who he was,how he came into existence, who he cared for, admired etc should have been done and over with in 20-25 minutes , with the rest being devoted to something more sinister than a love-struck guy saving and re-saving his love from the clutches of a maniac. The action scenes, specially the parts where he experiments with his new found powers were mostly ""Matrix"" rip-offs. The fight scenes were like taken directly out of a Jet Li film. This movie had no style whatsoever. I cant understand how you can take one of the coolest characters of all time and churn out a totally run of the mill movie like this one. The only impressive thing about the movie was Tobey MaGuire...who was pitch perfect. Kirsten Dunst was cute as hell. William Dafoe when out of the stupid/cheap green suit was fine. And about that Green Goblin Mask.....when are directors going to realize that not everything translates well from the Comic Pages to the screen. It was a fixed Mask....!!!!! You look stupid when you have more than a half dozen closeups of a bad guy with a fixed Mask.....It worked for Star Wars but that was the late seventies/early eighties....and now it just  looks cheap.  Perhaps the only cool action shot was the one where Spider-Man lands on a flagpole, but it came only as an after-thought right at the end. And what can I say about the ending....corny as hell. There was not an ounce of sophistication in this movie.<br/><br/>I, for one, have no idea where they spent the $125+ Million on. They should have taken a clue from X-Men who inspite of working within a budget just over half of this film provided excellent entertainment without overdoing either the character development/introduction or the action/story. I like Bryan Singer's X-men more than I liked it before I saw this. I feel cheated...disappointed. Damn it...!!!  ."

","The only weak part of this film was the ham-handed romantic dialogue, delivered in rather flat affect (mainly by Dunst). Blame this on Koepp, I suppose. This weakness, however, is more than made up for by the incredible CGI work. It is not flawless in quality (certainly Star Wars will do better), but it is flawless in energy, concept and sheer fun. Spider-Man moves with such grace and speed and he is light in the air just as he should be (and if Roger Ebert didn't like the weightlessness, then clearly he's never read the comic book). Spider-Man makes New York City look fun. The final scene alone, ending atop the flagpole, was worth the price of admission."

","Wow. Sam ""Evil Dead"" Raimi has crafted, what may be, the greatest film adaptation of a comic book to date.  Tobey Maguire does an absolute perfect job of presenting Peter in a form that is fairly accurate to the comic books (sadly, Peter's sharp quips are almost completely absent).  Willem Dafoe's performance as the Green Goblin truly captured the image I saw in the comic - a completely mad genius manifesting as pure evil... the perfect villain. Kirsten Dunst provides a decent representation of Mary Jane. Although she was not exactly as I pictured her when I read the comics, she does a great job with the material.  J.K. Simmons was perfect as Jameson. The yelling, high strung, was conveyed perfectly exactly as I had pictured him.  The cameo by long-time Raimi associate, Bruce Campbell, was a nice addition and garnered some applause during the film.  The CG effects were a tad too fluid in some parts, but it fit perfect for the picture.  It was almost as if you were going frame-by-frame through an old comic book.  The action scenes were engrossing and very fun to watch. This combined with a perfect digital sound mix (Dolby Digital), made for a very entertaining experience. I have two grips with the film, one the blatant marketing shot (you will know it when you see it), and the theme by Danny Elfman. The theme was almost completely forgettable.   The direction from Sam Raimi was great.  Lots of decent shots and it fit perfect.  It was nice to see a nod to Superman and a couple Evil-Dead style camera moves as well.  Despite my two minor grips, I am giving the film a 10.  I think this movie is easily the greatest comic book film to date.  Thank you Sam.  I know many other long time Spider-Man fans will be greatly appreciated.  Nuff said."

","Ahh Spiderman.  Could this movie live up to it's potential?  Well in my opinion sort of.  One of the stronger points in the movie, which you don't see in many comic book/fantasy text to theater translations is the emphasis on the on the background of the charecters.  That was not so in this film. Im not going to get into specifics, but the transition was well done. On acting.  I believe Toby Maguire did an excellent  job portraying Peter Parker, perfect for that role.  Then on the other hand as spiderman you are probably wondering if he would suit that position. Well in my opinion he really didnt need to.  The role of spiderman was more of stunts and computer generated sequences, so in the end it works out for his part.  William Dafoe, couldn't have picked a better person to play green goblin,  his voice, his facial expressions. Perfect. Now Kirsten Dunst, I didn't really picture her as the MJ type, and I'm still not really sure if she was really the best one for the job.  She did, on the other hand, do a decent job.<br/><br/>The action scenes were alright.  Just alright.  At times the enviorment was so visibly computer generated, it felt as if I was watching a cartoon and really took away from the feeling of the scene. This isn't the most detailed review because it's intended for people that haven't seen the movie and want to get a general idea of what it's like. I wouldn't go there expectiong the world, but it's definitely worth seeing. 7/10"

","I've became a Spidey fan as a kid in the early '70's and stayed a fan through the mid '80's.  Spidey has long been my favorite super-hero. Although I tried to not get my hopes up, with all the hype about this movie, I couldn't help it.  It usually seems that getting my hopes up for a film only leaves me disappointed.  Not so with this one!  The movie was true enough to the original comic that I barely noticed the differences.  And although there were differences, the changes did not appreciably affect the storyline.<br/><br/>Spiderman is not only the best super-hero film I've ever seen, it is one of the best of any films I've seen in a long time!  Of course, I'm kinda partial to the web-slinger, but the movie shows his humanity very well, which is one of the biggest attractions to Spidey.<br/><br/>Spiderman has taken me back to my youth - I again found myself dreaming that I was the webhead!

I wasn't expecting much, seeing as other supposedly promising superhero films had let me down (Spawn, Batman Returns-Forever-And Robin) in the past.  Thankfully, the good people at Sony put Sam Raimi at the helm.  The movie is very well-crafted. From high school drama to love story to tragedy to action movie and back, this movie covers pretty much all bases, and with a finesse rarely seen these days in huge-franchise movies.  The computer animation can at times be a little hokey, I know, but at least it looks better than some guy in a suit crawling across a floor designed like a wall with the camera tilted to make it look like he's going up a building!  At any rate, if you're one of the five people yet to see Spider-Man, by all means DO!  That's not peer-pressure.  Not at all.  See it.  Love it.  Go.  Now."
"DJKorban","10","0","0","4 May 2002"," Incredible doesn't begin to describe this action/comic movie
","I was a bit skeptical about this movie at first.  I've seen quite a few attempts to bring comic book heros to the big screen only to become sub par attempts at what might have been a great movie.  Technology might have had a part in that.  Computers weren't very widely used until 1994, a year after Jurassic Park showed the true capabilities of 3D Animation.  But it wasn't the effects that made movies like Mystery Men and Batman & Robin come up short.  It was terrible writing.  A lack-luster storyline.  Without that, the movie goes nowhere.  Granted, Batman and Batman Returns were good movies, but they still lacked and weren't very true to the comic. Spider-man, thankfully, was made by a man that had actually read the comic when he was younger.  That could be why it's such a great movie.<br/><br/>The effects where incredible and really did ""wow"" me every so often. There were a few shots where you could tell it was a CG Spider-man, but they filmed it in such a way that it went by very quickly and very smooth.  I was highly impressed with the swinging.  The life-like animations were flawless and definitely exciting.<br/><br/>As for the story, I'll be the first to admit, I got a bit misty eyed when Uncle Ben died.  The acting surpassed every expectation I had.  Tobey showed that he was MADE to be Peter Parker and William Dafoe played his part EXTREMELY well.  The story stayed true to the comic book and really had me on the edge of my seat all the way through.  Even the ending was very good. Some say it was a bit lacking, but I really enjoyed it.  It made me proud to be a New Yorker, and when you see it, you'll know why I say that.<br/><br/>I highly recommend running out and seeing this movie.  It really is the best action movie so far this year."
"PerpetualHaze","9","0","0","4 May 2002"," Spider-Man tells a deep, entertaining story while doing the comic justice...
","I was blown away by Spider-Man. It is,by far, my favorite movie so far this year. I was more anticipated to see this film than any other in a long while. I read the comic book and followed the animated series in the 90's and this movie portrays the storyline so very thoroughly. It was the little things that made this movie great to me, i.e. when newspaper publisher J. Jonah Jameson mentions Peter Parker beating another photographer Eddie to the scoop on the Spider-Man photos. Those of you who follow Spider-Man know what I'm talking about. The dialogue of Norman Osborn with his inner demon, or should I say ""goblin,"" was tremendous. This is very similar to that of the comic book and animated series. The pace, however, made the film for me. They gave the plot plenty of time to develop along with the character. Nothing was rushed like having Osborn transform into the Green Goblin in the first five minutes of the film. I walked away very satisfied. I even dug out my old comics and toys. This film meant a lot to me as a comic book fan. Spawn, X-Men, and Spider-Man were my three favorite comics during the 90's and I liked all the movies based on them, but even though X-Men was a very good movie, it didn't intrigue me as much as Spider-Man's deep yet simple journey into becoming a hero. No film based on a comic has done it as much justice as this one. ****1/2 This may be my new favorite movie."

Tobey played a great Peter Parker, Willem did a great job as Osborne and JK was perfect as Jameson. The film did a great job of capturing Parkers sense of responsibility and his nerdiness. The only real problems was that it got a little too mushy with the love scenes and the supporting characters just didn't seem too well developed. But they did cram in a whole lot for a 2hour movie.

"divaclv","Null","0","0","4 May 2002"," Swing Time
","In my limited experience with the comic book superhero genre, Spider-Man has always struck me as one of the more human characters of the breed.  Rather than a near-perfect muscleman from a distant world or a brooding bachelor with enough money to buy half the eastern seaboard, Peter Parker is a gawky, geeky teenager who still gets tongue-tied in the presence of the girl next door.  His manner as a masked vigilante is touched with a pleasing balance of pathos, anger, and humor.  Thankfully, Sam Raimi has managed to translate that into a pleasing film that proves to be one of the better comic-book films since Tim Burton relinquished the Batman series.<br/><br/>The first part of ""Spider-Man"" is an origin story, setting up the universe for the uninitiated and for future films (which, if the opening weekend audience is any indication, are a certainty): On a class trip, Peter (Tobey Maguire) gets bitten by a genetically-enhanced spider that injects genetic coding instead of venom.  Suddenly Peter's eyesight is perfect, his body is buff, his wrists shoot webbing at inopportune times and he can dodge a bully's punches like Keanu Reeves limboing with bullets.  At first Peter's mystified (although, oddly enough, not alarmed) by the change.  Then he embraces it, leaping across the rooftops of New York with an awkward joy that's almost infectuous.<br/><br/>It takes a tragedy to get Peter to turn his newfound powers to crime fighting.  Maguire is best in these moments, filled with the sorrow and self-reproach that guides his crusade.  And crusade Spider-Man does, foiling petty thugs and taking New York by surprise.  In between, Peter attempts to make headway with his crush Mary-Jane (the very charming Kirsten Dunst) and gets cash by selling photos of his alter-ego to a local tabloid (JK Simmons, as the editor of the rag, steals every scene he's in).<br/><br/>Every superhero needs a supervillian; Spider-Man's is an airboard-flying meanace known as the Green Goblin.  The Goblin is the Hyde personality of Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe), a wealthy mogul who's only slightly less embittered and mean-spirited when he's not wearing a mask.  Osborne's son is Peter's best friend and Mary-Jane's current boyfriend, creating some very interesting dynamics in the main characters.<br/><br/>The special effects have a slightly campy feel to them, yet this serves the movie well, giving it a surreal aura that looks and feels like a comic-book drawing come to life.  And thankfully, although both major participants are wearing full-face masks, Raimi manages for the most part to avoid having the major fight scenes come off like something out of a Power Rangers episode. There's also some good chemistry between Maguire and Dunst, particularly in the much-publicized kiss in the rain.  Overall, this fun time at the cinema gets the summer off to a good start."

If your a True Believer however, you may find a FEW, and I do mean a few, problems. #1 for me was the Web Shooters. As we all know, Parker built his web-shooters, and mixed his own ""web fluid"". Not so in the movie, now they're part of his genetic enhancement. #2 ""With Great Power comes Great Responsibility"" Great line, but I feel that the director's REALLY wanted it in a specific part at a specific time.

The special effects are not really astonishing (although I probably should have been astonished; perhaps I'm just jaded), but they were good enough to not detract from the story (I didn't feel the vertiginous rush during the movie that you get from ""Soaring over California"" at Disneyland, and the scenes of Spider-Man swinging down the street look like a really good cartoon to me).<br/><br/>The movie is good looking and so is the cast (and you get to see a lot of Dunst's cleavage, which I certainly enjoyed). It's a perfect summer movie, a little ahead of the summer.

","""Spider-Man"" is probably the most entertaining film that I have seen for the Summer holiday movie season.I like to look at it as the film that would knock ""X-Men"" off the ground.""X-Men"" was entertaining also and I also enjoyed it for its style and action.But ""Spider-Man"" has so much humor and it also does a good job explaining Spider-Man's origin.The film was nearly made a decade ago by James Cameron.But there was some trouble with some legal issues.There was no telling what James Cameron's vision of ""Spider-Man"" would have been like.The character has been around for fourty years and has been featured in comics and even had its own television show by CBS.That show was campy and wasn't even exciting.Only an eight year old would enjoy it.The theatrical version of ""Spider-Man"" is fun for everyone and is alot more faithful to the comic than the television show.Among the film's highlights are its cast.Tobey Maguire was perfectly cast as Peter Parker and Spider-Man.Among the other actors who were up for the role was Freddie Prinze,Jr,Heath Ledger and James Franco who played James Dean in ""James Dean"".The filmmakers chose Tobey Maguire which I think is the best casting for this film since Christopher Reeve for his ""Superman"" films.Tobey is just right for the role and provides alot of humor throughout the film.I don't think anyone else would have been great for the role of The Green Goblin but Willem Dafoe.He doesn't play The Green Goblin.He is The Green Goblin.His performance reminds me of Jack Nicholson's performance of The Joker in ""Batman"".The film also is delivered the goods with its casting of Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. She's more like Lois Lane from the ""Superman"" films.The special effects are among the best that I have seen and the direction by Sam Raimi keeps the film true to it's comic book.""Spider-Man"" is a film that was meant to entertain and it does a pretty good job at doing that.I had a talk with my brother over the phone who is also a member of this site.Out of respect for him,I will not mention his name.But I will explain that we both had seen the film and that I explained that ""Superman:The Movie"" was better.I looked at ""Superman:The Movie"" as the bible of comic book adaptations.I look at ""Spider-Man"" as a film that was brought to the screen with great accuracy.I have seen this film twice and I am going to see it over and over again.""Spider-Man"" could have been made at anytime during it's fourty year existense.But thankfully,it was on the waiting list until the time was right.""Spider-Man"" is probably one of the best films of 2002."

Sam Raimi on direction, John Dykstra on special effects and Danny Elfman on music score are all the best at what they do and it shows on screen.  Even minor starpower actors like Tobey McGuire and Kirsten Dunst come through, along side sich solid performers as Willem Defoe and Cliff Robertson.  I'll keep my comments here short (you can get all the technical and Marvel info in other reviews and web sites) --- let me just say that you may have trouble driving your car away from the theater after seeing this movie.... you'll have the strongest urge to fly and swoop through traffic.

","So far the silliest thing I'm read from a professional critic is, ""The dialogue is too cartoon-ish.""<br/><br/>A close second is (another critic) Roger Ebert's idea that the movie doesn't explore enough the horror of Peter Parker's metamorphosis.  Like a Fly-style approach directed by David Cronenberg would have really hit the spot.  Maybe a version where Toby has pinchers on his face and spends the movies screaming ""Why, God, why!!!!!  There must be no Godddddddd!""<br/><br/>But I think too big a deal is being made about opening grosses.  I loved the movie, but opening grosses only show that there is a huge want-to-see factor.

","I went to the theater expecting to see something entertaining, yet silly. And that's exactly what I got (Actually the entertainment value was above my expectation).<br/><br/>As you probably know, film starts with this nerdy, interested in photography, obviously in love with his next door neighbor student, Peter. Tobey Maguire did an amazing job portraying Peter Parker/Spider-Man throughout the entire movie. Peter then gets bitten by a genetically engineered spider, which matches perfectly with Peter's DNA (or something like that) to create the supernatural powerful creature of spider-man.<br/><br/>Now Peter needs to get used to his newly acquired powers. This part of the movie is spectacular (first 30 mins). It's pretty amusing seeing someone going from a nerdy student to a super-natural human being in one night. The school fight scene was the one I enjoyed most.<br/><br/>After the first 30 mins, then movie gets ,kind of, repetitive and not as interesting (still good, just not as good). Not to forget the cheesy dialogue thrown here and there. Willem Dafoe was simplyÂ….. not appropriate for the role of Green Goblin (which you heard enough about his ridiculous custom). <br/><br/>Still the movie was overall enjoyable. Worth the admission price. I recommend it for the genre fans, and anyone whos looking to have some good time. 6.5/10"

"2blackcats","Null","0","0","4 May 2002"," Awesome responsibility handled with great power
","""With great power comes great responsibility."" Every Spider-Man fan knows well Ben Parker's words of wisdom to his nephew Peter; they are the very motivation that drives the gawky teen to become the superhero Spider-Man (and here you thought it was a radioactive spider!).<br/><br/>Well, apparently, director Sam Raimi and his crew also heeded Ben Parker's words. Good thing for us moviegoers that they did, as the awesome responsibility of bringing this American pop culture icon to the big screen is here handled, fortunately, with great power.<br/><br/>Sure, the spectacular CGI action sequences are sometimes a bit plastic - just like Tobey Maguire's too frequent tears and oft ill-timed delivery - but Spider-Man is nonetheless (excuse the pun) a marvel. The story is faithful in spirit to Stan Lee's and Steve Ditko's vision (the naysayers out there really need to get out more); the fight scenes are truly amazing; and excellent supporting performances are given by a menacing Willem Defoe as the main heavy (Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin), and a hilarious J.K. Simmons (yes, Law & Order fans, that's Dr. Skoda!) as Daily Bugle Editor J. Jonah Jameson. Seriously, Skoda, I mean Simmons steals the show!<br/><br/>If the film can be faulted, it is in the overwrought soap-operatic love triangle that exists among Peter/Spidey, the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and his best friend/roommate Harry Osborn (James Franco). Yes, this conflict is taken, for the most part, straight from the comics, but what took years to develop in print appears forced and subsequently rushed when compressed into the confined space of a single film. Unlike Brian Singer's brilliant (and superior) X-Men from two-years ago, Spider-Man fails to develop its characters' conflicts very well. When we do get glimpses into Peter's sense of guilt, Mary Jane's self-esteem issues or Harry's love/hate relationship with his father, the attempts at pathos are a little silly.<br/><br/>For any filmmaker, it's a tremendous responsibility to have to compress that kind of character history into what is supposed to be an action movie; if Spider-Man ultimately falls somewhat short, it's not for lack of trying. Then again, this ain't Shakespeare, and poor Peter Parker's life should, perhaps, be presented as a soap opera - with emotions heightened just like those of any teenager. Maybe the conflicts are genuine enough, when judged through the bug-eyed lenses worn by a nerdy boy becoming a man.<br/><br/>Perhaps that's what has made Spider-Man an icon for so many years to so many generations of kids and kids at heart; it's the story of an awkward teenager finding in himself not only the spider, but the man.<br/><br/>Maybe it's something as simple as this: Spider-Man appeals to that part of us that wants to be a hero, but feels like a nerd, an outsider. We can never be Superman (the guy's an alien), and Batman is pretty much out of the average man's reach (who has the cash?). But Spider-Man? More than the accident that made him, this hero is the product of courage and sacrifice. That could be me. That could be you. We identify with poor Peter Parker, because we've all been him at one time or another.<br/><br/>Or maybe this guy's popularity is even simpler than that: you see, Spidey's just plain cool. And, for this reason alone, Spider-Man is sure to be a hit with audiences."

","This film, based on the comic books, is absolutely one of the best film versions of a comic book superhero. Sam Raimi's style and his casting choices match the tone of the early Stan Lee/Steve Ditko comics perfectly. Tobey Maguire is an excellent choice to play gawky teenager Peter Parker and Kirsten Dunst as the ""crush"" next door is also a perfect casting choice. I'm a little less enthusiastic about Willem Dafoe's stint as the lunatic Green Goblin, but it works well enough to give Spidey a foe worth facing. The script follows the comic book origin story fairly closely, and certainly more closely than most other comics to film adaptions. While the effects work is somewhat shaky at times, it still works because we are, after all, looking at a big screen comic book. Definitely a fun film that is worth viewing. GRADE: A-"

","I have two words for this movie.... teen flick.  Regardless of whether I'm speaking as a fan or as a movie-goer, these two words sum up exactly what this movie is.  The impression I got from the movie was this...it's a teenage love story between a geek and a slut, oh...and by the way, the geek has super powers...the end.<br/><br/>I think they should've saved us all a lot of money and a lot of grief by calling the movie what it is... ""The Life of Peter Parker"" because Spiderman actually appeared in less than 20% of the movie.  The Spiderman component was so small; it was almost like an after thought that the producers squeezed in later.  This movie seems to have started as an old fashion kiddies love story, but since that idea doesn't sell tickets anymore, someone decides to throw in the Spiderman bit.  The title is really misleading because I truly felt we're looking at this backwards.  The truth is, it's a teenybopper story that used the superpower idea as an excuse to show off their fancy computer work.<br/><br/>This movie did not deliver as a Spiderman Movie; in fact, it didn't even deliver as a movie.  The plotline was childishly simple and unbelievably inconsistent; action sequence was nothing but bad knock-offs of expensive camera tricks seen in ""The Matrix"", ""X-Men"", ""Swordfish"", etc.  The entire movie looked like it was shot in Queens, NY and the rest was mediocre 3D rendered environments where we see a computer-generated Spiderman swinging from building to building.  I'm going to guess that that's where all the money went, because it sure didn't go to the casting of good actors.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire was a perfect Peter Parker, but a horrible Spiderman.  The only real actor that made up for this colossal casting mistake was the performance by William Dafoe as the Green Goblin.  He seems to be the only one who actually knew what he was doing, and was performing ""in character"". Everyone else was merely regurgitating long run-on sentences in corny scenes that were completely irrelevant to the overall plot.<br/><br/>This 2002 version was no better than the 1970's mini movies and the cartoon show.  It still looks like some guy wearing a Halloween costume running around the city of Queens.  You never wondered why Batman didn't look silly popping out gadgets from the rooftops of Gotham City, or how a group of mutants in tight black costumes wouldn't look odd running through New York. Why?  In both ""Batman"" and ""X-Men"", the scenery, location, props, characters and dialogue were all created around the superhero, not vice versa.  Anyone can just shoot a movie about a guy in a skin-tight outfit who catches poorly themed villains, but not everyone can do it so it doesn't look like one big costume party in your backyard.  Once again, this movie is reminiscent of last year's ""Tomb Raider"", a movie composed of mainly photographic images of Angelina Jolie in her cool poses and badly choreographed fighting sequence, but no substance.<br/><br/>So, if you haven't seen this movie.  I suggest you save yourself some money, and just watch the trailers, which, like all movie trailers have spoiled it by showing you all the best parts of the movie.  Then basically, leaving you high and dry and unsatisfied with your jumbo popcorn on your lap.  I can honestly tell you, it's not going to get any better than what you see in those trailers.  Other than this 30-second clip of high tech computer generated images, everything else are fillers."

","With Hollywood fully embracing CGI special-effects, and the audiences eating it up like the Twizzlers from the concession stand, the stage was definitely set for one of the most visually challenging comic book interpretations in film history.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is not an easy character to put on screen. He doesn't simply fly through the air to his destination. He swings from one web to another, sticking to walls, jumping towards open windows, and grabbing whatever he has to grab in the mean time. The Green Goblin himself is difficult, riding on a jet-coaster that hovers and shoots off at great speeds, as well as fire a large arsenal of weapons.<br/><br/>With this said, the special effects were impressive. Sure, they looked kind of cartoon-y at times, but hey, after-all it's a comic-book interpretation, right ?<br/><br/>It wasn't the special effects that disappointed me in this movie. It was other elements. When I first heard that Willem Dafoe would be playing the role of the Norman Osborn\Green Goblin, I was excited. Here was an actor who had the talent to pull off the role, and the sinister grin to keep it consistent with the comic-book character. <br/><br/>However, and this is important, there's a plot alteration in the movie that makes it different from the comic-book. Because Norman Osborn is trying for a military contract for body armor, the Green Goblin ends up wearing this armor and a helmet\mask throughout the movie. This ends up making him look like a Power Ranger on a gliding coaster ! Worst, it doesn't allow us to see that sinister grin that Willem Defoe has. The same grin that initially got me excited about him getting the part ends up being molded on the front of a plastic mask - and the viewer doesn't get to see Dafoe as the Green Goblin, only Harry Osborn. Dafoe's Green Goblin had potential to be better than Nicholson's Joker, before they put a mask on the Green Goblin. Even worst, it introduces a very bad plot hole : Wouldn't you think the military would know the true identity of the Green Goblin upon sight, if he is flying around in recently military-demonstrated body armor ? That is a VERY big flaw in the script !!<br/><br/>One of the pleasant surprises in the movie was J.K. Simmons' performance as J. Jonah Jameson. He played the role perfectly, right down to the toupee."

1. Opens with a bunch of semi drunk guys tearing up a grave yard in a car at night. Spidey stops them and let's them flee in terror. He notices uncle ben's grave. He talks to and says the ""Who am i?"" speech to him. the movie is basically him telling his life story to his dead uncle as Spiderman. Ends with the same local.<br/><br/>2. After the open, it move to 4 year old Peter moving in with Uncle Ben & Aunt May. Ben explains to Peter his parents are gone. He crys up in his room. Also pete hates the plastic on all the furniture and Ben makes May take it off. Peter notices a spider in the corner of the ceiling and stares at it for hours. Ben comes up and gives peter a journal so he can write to his parents. He tells Peter that the spider is lucky. Peter goes to eat May's cookies but she get's rid of the spider (not knowing peter likes it) which sends little Peter into histerics.<br/><br/>3. The chasing after the bus goes on a lot longer in the book.<br/><br/>4. When he is Spiderman, he rushes to the Science dept. As Peter to get to his job. Dr. Curt Conners bumps into Peter and tells him he has to let him go. He fires Peter for being late all the time. The funny thing is Curt is carring a little iguana. After Curt leaves, Peter mutters a line about he hopes the lizard gets radioactive and bites him so Conners will know how hard it is for Peter to deal with the powers.<br/><br/>5. Uncle Ben is watching the wrestling on TV at home as Peter is facing Bonesaw.<br/><br/>Overall I'd still give the film a 9.8/10. You will believe a man can web swing."

","I got to see spiderman on opening day and must admit I was impressed.<br/><br/>I won't go through the story line as there are hundreds of sites doing so. Here are my thoughts (I'm assuming you know the characters):<br/><br/>1) I did not like Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. 2) Tobey Macguire was excellent and very believalbe as Spiderman. When I first heard of him playing the role I was sort of disappointed, but now I know the people at the studio have done a great job casting him.<br/><br/>3) J.J.J was dead on! I wish he had more screen time. He was portraid perfectly.<br/><br/>4) Spiderman's suit (unlike Batman's) was excellent and looked exactly the way it does in the comic books.<br/><br/>5) Green Goblin was a disappointment on 2-3 levels; first of all his suit looks like a green Robocop! As far as I remember he didn't look anything like his Comic book version, why was he so shiny? Where did he come from? ,lastly Willem Dafoe sucked. I never liked him to begin with, but he couldn't do the same thing Jack Nicholson did as Joker. Dafoe was the only person you could tell he was ""Acting""! I know, you have to see it to see what I mean. Everyone else was 100% genuine, except him. Anyways, that's what I think!<br/><br/>6) The special effects were great, but in some shots it did look fake. Some scenes were a giveaways as far as the effects go. ---------------<br/><br/>All in all I liked the movie and plan to see it at least one more time before the end of summer. I do recommend it. It's fun."

See Spiderman, and see it in the theaters.  If you do not, then you will regret it for the rest of your life.  And if you're one of those wacko's that has a really big TV and surround sound and try to convince yourself that it will be just as good, or even better then seeing it in the theaters, then you are wrong, retarded, and should be committed.  The only way that you will convince me that you will get the full effect is if you own your own projector, 100 ft screen, and stadium seating.  All I have to say is thank goodness this movie waited...thank goodness there were conflicting parties who claimed ownership...because of this, the movie was delayed and then made at a time where CG is at its peak and there are no cheesy strings or obvious scenes where the wall is actually the ground (i.e.. Batman and Robin walking up the buildings...blah).<br/><br/>Yeah, I liked this movie."

With a cast as talented as Toby McGuire,Rosemary Harris,Cliff Robertson,Williem Dafoe,Kirsten Dunst and J.K.Simmons and a screenplay that was not afraid to be touching,""Spiderman"" becomes more than just a superhero film.The relationship between Peter and his Aunt and Uncle are especially well developed. Tony winner Harris and Oscar winner Robertson were the perfect pair to bring Aunt May and Uncle Ben to life.Dafoe gives us a villian that is so much more tormented than the standard scenery chewing maniac,and Dunst gets to show us the honest acting talent that we have known her capable of when given a well written script.<br/><br/> While others have comented on the special effects and the action sequences,this is not what I left the theatre thinking of.I came away thinking of the bonds between family and the struggle to keep going in a changing world."

","*Spider-Man* rocked. There's my two-word review. Details to follow.<br/><br/>I saw *X-Men*, and I thought pretty highly of *that* comic book movie too. I was familiar with it only through the animated series, and the same thing held for *Spider-Man*. How would this compare?<br/><br/>I've decided I can't really make that comparison, because one movie is about a group of superheroes and one is about one particular superhero. Yeah, I'm copping out. Well, they're different approaches...and well, I'm not going to get into that, because I'm not comparing the two movies, I'm reviewing the one.<br/><br/>Oh, where to begin?<br/><br/>So we were all wary about Tobey Maguire. Cause, like, Tobey Maguire? As Spider-Man? Suuuure.<br/><br/>Dude. He kicked web. He gets put through all kinds of emotions in this movie, and if you don't believe me, apparently even the critics are praising his performance.<br/><br/>The thing with Spider-Man is that he's not Spider-Man, he's Peter Parker, the nerdy high school kid that everyone picked on. I don't think I realized how much I had in common with Spidey until I saw this movie.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst with red hair. Kirsten Dunst with any hair. I have no complaints. At least David Koepp (yon screenwriter) gave MJ a decent amount of character. And she called Peter ""tiger""! (I was all about the yelping at things like that.)<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn...well, the guy looks creepy enough. I wasn't so much a fan of the way they handled the split-personality thing with Norman and the Green Goblin. It didn't translate so well to film. Plus, he sounds like Wario. He was a fair villain, and he was a good choice for the first film because of the way they integrated his son Harry into the MJ romance, but I can't wait for the other, more fun villains.<br/><br/>Doc Oc and the Lizard in the sequel!<br/><br/>I want to see Venom! God, I want to see Venom...there, the split-personality thing might come off better...maybe. And Mysterio! Mysterio rules. Chameleon! Maybe not. Scorpion! Rhino! All the other ones!<br/><br/>The origin story takes quite a while; Raimi doesn't rush it too much. (The movie's amazingly well paced. Never a dull moment.) And, well, it's just something else to see it on the big screen. It packs so much power. I don't know how many of you are familiar with it, so I won't go into too much detail, but...really. I can't imagine having to live with that.<br/><br/>The Peter-MJ romance is so damn cute. Koepp writes him an amazingly sweetly beautiful declaration of love. And they of course dance around how much they love each other, and when she finally tells him...<br/><br/>*sigh* Yeah.<br/><br/>Ooh, upside-down kiss! I wouldn't mind upside-down kissing Kirsten Dunst. Of course, I wouldn't mind right-side up kissing her, either.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure whether the CGI webslinger was going to work or not, but it *really* did. It looked like what it would look like if someone actually moved like him. Oh, the webslinging was awesome. God, it was cool. There was some fun cinematography. Nothing really phenomenal, but still great.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman does a great job with the music. Very superhero-y.<br/><br/>What else, what else...corny one-liners! My favorite:<br/><br/>""You're the one whose out, Gobby. Out of your *mind*!""<br/><br/>Really, they look fine in comic books, but when you actually *say* them...hee hee hee.<br/><br/>The movie has a more comic book feel to it than *X-Men*. The opening and closing narrations sound exactly like ones you'd find in an issue. Also, Raimi sometimes overdoes the voiceovers or flashes or the whatever you call it when you fade an image in on half the screen.<br/><br/>But the way he does the Spider Sense is pretty damn slick, though.<br/><br/>Oh! I have to mention J. Jonah Jameson, because he looks *exactly* like he's drawn, and he's hilarious.<br/><br/>I'm informed that they do play the original Spidey theme at the end, so stick around.<br/><br/>All in all, Sam Raimi and David Koepp have delivered one *hell* of a movie, complete with all the angst of being a teenage superhero. Romance. Secret identities. Fighting. Explosions. Upside-down kissing. Webslinging. New York pride. Dr. Pepper.<br/><br/>I can't *wait* for the next one."

","Spider-Man has accomplished the impossible.  It has managed to rise above the crushing weight of its own hype and actually deliver more than promised.<br/><br/>Big screen adaptations rarely mine a fraction of the potential of comic book heroes.  Superman was wooden, hopelessly saccharine and lighter than air. Batman was overshadowed by his villians, which may have been the point, but we were left with a thin two-dimensional costume-character and a series of poorly cast portrayals.  Even Unbreakable was a plotless and forgettable story that was built around its cast instead of the other way around. X-Men was closer, but was weighed down by its sheer number of characters.<br/><br/>Enter Spiderman.  Go ahead.  You know you want to say it.  It's AMAZING! Let's start from the infrastructure.  Rosemary Harris (Blow Dry), was virtually unknown despite her long distinguished career in movies, television and the theatre, where she was nominated for a Best Actress Tony (she lost to her daughter).  She is perfect as Aunt May, conveying a interior strength and complexity that coexists gracefully with her soft-spoken exterior.  Add in J. K. Simmons, whom we have all loved to hate for years as the unctuous Vern Shillinger on HBO's Oz, but may be better known as Dr. Emil Skoda on television's Law and Order.  Again, he was exactly the way I pictured J. Jonah Jameson. Randy ""The Macho Man"" Poffo as Bonesaw McGraw, Larry Joshua [uncredited] (Cop Rock, For Love of the Game) as the unscrupulous fight promoter, and even Cliff Robertson as the ill-fated Uncle Ben, all add to the remarkable synergy that never misses a beat.<br/><br/>Now the first string.  The sheer genius of selecting Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man was the best way possible to provide an axis for all the other talent to revolve around.  He is far and away the best young actor out there, and his understated yet always larger than life presence completely occupies the superhero persona. Stan Lee and Steve Ditko much have been chanelling Maguire forty years ago when they created Spiderman.  He is vulnerable, not in the hapless and ultimately hollow Clark Kent way, nor in the damaged and empty Bruce Wayne manner, but in a human and sympathetic way that allows us to empathize and identify with him unlike any other comic book to silver screen alter ego.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Maguire and Kisrten Dunst is breathtaking, and the beauty of their star-crossed romance is tragic in the best literary sense, carried off to perfection under the surprisingly mature performances of Dunst and Maguire.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe is the ultimate comic book villian.  He is diabolical, and wears his thinly-vieled alter ego as transparently as a mist.  He is unrepentant and remorseless as all true villians must be.  Dafoe is one of the many casting coups that make this masterpiece work.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi, who has had his greatest success as a producer, directs Spider-Man with the skill of a maestro, and delivers an instant classic that works frame to frame from beginning to end in seamless perfection.<br/><br/>It was worth all the anticipation, worthy of all the hype, and satisfying in every way.  Absolute perfection.  My Spider Sense is already tingling for the sequel."

","I was very pleased with this adaption of Stan Lee's classic The Amazing Spider-man. The movies was very well produced exhibiting a fine balance action and drama never overemphasizing one over the other. Some people as they were walking out of the movie (guys mainly of course) were commenting on how the whole romance aspect needed to be ditched and have more butt kicking. These people don't have taste in quality movies; a movie needs to have a point, some plot and theme more than just random mindless violence and Sam Riami did very well in bringing most of the characters to life. Peter Parker is displayed as a regular person, not as some perfect unreal hollywood creation, but just as someone as human as the rest of us making his teenage conversion to superhero status very convincing. My only problem is I don't like Tobey Maguire, I've never been a fan of his. Tobey, while he did a competent job to make his role satisfactory, did make Peter Parker seem too childish at times. Other times when he had to be dramatic his performances would seem a bit corny and contrived. Besides that Tobey Maguire doesn't personify the image or the look of Peter Parker from the comic books. I thought this was a very bad casting choice and I hope when production of the sequel commences he gets scrubbed to be replaced by someone else. Other than that performances from other cast members was simply astounding. Kirsten Dunst was an excellent choice for Mary Jane Watson and really excelled not only making her character beautiful, but a normal teenage girl as well. She really did well in creating the ""girl next door"" image too. The most notable performance is without a doubt that of Willem Dafoe's as the Green Goblin. I've been a fan of Dafoe since his movie, Boondock Saints, and he really shines in his role in this movie. Dafoe is quite energetic and entertaining masterfully portraying his villainous character and he will stand out more than Maguire."

","Spiderman is truely the greatest movie I have ever seen. The visual effects are some of the most amazing that I have ever seen. I must admit that I had my doubts about Tobey Maguire as Spiderman, but he came through, big time. The fact that the movie spent so much time of the Mary Jane story line did nothing to slow the incredible pace of this movie. The effects at times looked more like an incredible video game than a live-action movie, which only made it even better.<br/><br/>I see incredible sequal potentials for this movie. The movie's end with Harry's vow for revenge and MJ's confession of love are only the beginning. There are literally dozens of villains that would make incredible movies. For example: Scorpion, VENOM AND CARNAGE, Vulture, Doctor Octopus, VENOM AND CARNAGE, Kingpin, Electo, Mysterio, VENOM AND CARNAGE.<br/><br/>The introduction of Eddie Brock at the Daily Bugle indicates that the film's creator intend to use Venom in one movie, possibly the next one coming out next year. The Venom and Carnage story lines could be used in several movies.<br/><br/>I was amazed by Spiderman despite the deviations for the original story line, such as the origin of the spider that bit peter, his first use of his powers, THE WEBBING COMING NATURALLY FROM HIS WRIST rather than being an invention, and the Green Goblin originating before the Hobgoblin.<br/><br/>I did like the little phrases that were casually thrown into the conversation (ie ""The Amazing Spiderman"", ""Friendly Neighborhood Spiderman"" and ""Tiger"")<br/><br/>Overall: 10 out of 10.

","_Spider Man_ was great--everything I hoped it would be and more.  I was worried, especially after reading reviews in Time magazine and Roger Ebert's review of the film.  Neither was on-target.  This was a very good movie, easily on a par with the original Batman and, perhaps, even better than the first X-Men film.  Tobey Maguire was the perfect choice for Spider Man and the rest of the cast is equally-well chosen, particularly Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/the Green Goblin.  The movie has a sense of fun and excitement to it that were infectious.  Sure, the ""origin"" story may not have been the most exciting plot, but someone's got to do it and Sam Raimi was a great choice.  He's really matured as a filmmaker with _A Simple Plan_ and _The Gift_, but don't forget, this is also the director who gave us _Darkman_, essentially a superhero story.  Having grown up with the comics, I could not have wished for more--Stan Lee must be proud to finally see his vision on screen.  The only possible downside to the film is the 2-3 year wait for the next installment.  Glad to see Raimi's been nailed down as director for part 2."

This film meets all what a Spider-Man fan could ask for. Director Sam Raimi, Stan Lee and all the people that worked together to bring this comic to life really worked hard to accomplish this task.<br/><br/>I had a smile in my face as I watched Spidey swing and bounce through the buildings.  The way he moved arms and legs, his yells as he hold to the spider-web, the way he sat on top of the buildings, even when he grabbed to the flag pole, it was as if I was living the comic again!  All his moves were so well coordinated to resemble the comic book.  Even when the cops want to catch him and Jameson hating him...it is all part of the comic...that is what Spider-Man is: a misunderstood hero.<br/><br/>The ending is just great, not what many people would have want or the typical Hollywood ending.

Also, the plot is kind of trite, I mean, Mary Jane nearly gets killed 3 times yet she still has a sunny outlook on things.<br/><br/>The special effects are awesome, and if you see Spiderman in a theater with DTS, when Norman Osborn is talking to his evil alter ego, the whispering is very lifelike.

What is remarkable about these three talented people is how their signature direction/performance pieces enhance this well known story so well. Sam: His ability to string together rapid camera movements created an action scene flow absent from film sense The Matrix.  Signature touches like Bruce Cambell's mockery as the birth of the Spider-Man name, Dafoe's scenes with himself in the mirror, and an ability to make every person in the theater want to be in that hero's shoes. (Think Ash kicking the dead with the shotgun/chainsaw combo) Tobey: The ultimate everyman, people don't act like actors, they act like Tobey.  The look on his face after knocking Flash (the bully) across the hall was in my opinion one of the greatest expressions in recent film history.  His chemistry with not only Durst but his aunt and Dafoe made the film as intersting when Parker was on screen as when Spidey was swinging about. Kirsten: She is the ultimate girl next door.  She gave a predictable character (that in another production would have gone to a WB star) human depth.  We don't like MJ because she is that gorgeous girl Spider-Man saves, we like her because of her compassion and we know she is Parker's soul-mate. In closing I would like to add that I know sequels are coming and that makes me nervous, this one will be hard to top."

","This movie is a decent comic book adaptation.  All the elements of the Spider-man story are there.  I only wish more time had been spent making the digital effects more realistic.  It is not difficult to tell where the digital effects come in, and to me, that was distracting.  I felt it took away from the story in as much as I found myself pulled out of it by noticing the effect more than the action at times.<br/><br/>Perhaps in the sequel, more care will be taken to weave the real and digital action more seamlessly."

","Finally, an adaptation with some punch.  Yes, there are a few details that have been changed, but all in all, excellent work.  There are plenty of hilarious, surprising, and audience-jumping-in-their-seats moments.  Lots of good set up: check the credits, Eddie Brock is there.  J.K Simmons is the standout as Jameson, finally the man gets a good role.  Willem Dafoe was the only person who could have played the Green Goblin, an excellent villain to chose.  I was skeptical about Tobey Maguire, but he was an excellent Peter Parker, Kirsten Dunst looked great, good as MJ.  The best part of the film? For Sam Raimi fans, it will be Mr. Bruce Campbell as the ring announcer, Ted Raimi filling in at Jameson's office, and Lucy Lawless virtually unrecognizable as the punk rock chick.  For Spider-man fans, look to the great story set-up, and the scenes with his hokey costume.  For action fans, the scene during the festival and the one on the bridge will prove amazing. The New Yorkers, throwing stones at Goblin, saying ""you mess with one of us, you mess with all of us"" is easily one of the best lines in the movie.  Go see this movie!

","Due to legal battles over copyright ownership, Marvel's bankruptcy, and other issues, it seemed like my dream movie would never get me. After hoping and waiting for more than a decade, Columbia Pictures finally resolved the legal issues and announced that they were going to bring the beloved `Spiderman' to the big screen. Usually I don't get too excited over new movie projects, but this one I really got into the hype. The trailers ran the gambit from being terrible to awesome with each new version.<br/><br/>It seemed to have all the elements in place to be a really good, if not great superhero movie. So why, oh why, didn't I like it? What went wrong?<br/><br/>I can't remember the last time I left a theater feeling as let down and disappointed in a film as I was in this. I was pretty speechless when folks asked me what I thought, I couldn't quite verbalize why I didn't like it or how I felt. Now after thinking about it for a few days, I now know why.<br/><br/>Let me say `Spiderman' wasn't a `bad' movie. But it certainly wasn't great or even above average; it was a perfectly `pedestrian', run of the mil ho-hum movie, that didn't have a single moment in it that makes you go `wow'! Most of the movie's ""wow"" moments are in the trailers, which have been shown hundreds of times. It plays it safe and doesn't take any chances to be great or push any boundaries, which is what great movies do and what `Spiderman' should have aspired to do.<br/><br/>For those who have lived under a rock and don't know, `Spiderman' is based on the beloved Marvel Character created four decades ago by the `infamous' and creative genius Stan Lee and Marvel Character designer Steve Ditko.<br/><br/>`Spiderman' tells the story of Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), a teenager who was raised by his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson). He's an awkward kid, who typifies the standard nerd `cliché', he's poor, he's bullied by the school jock, Flash Thompson (Joe Manganiello), ignored by the girl of his dreams, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and are best friends with the local rich kid, Harry Osborn (James Franco), whom he befriended during tutoring sessions.<br/><br/>During a class school trip to a hi-tech genetics research facility, Peter is bitten by a radioactive spider and his life suddenly changes. He gains all the `proportional' abilities of a spider; which includes superhuman strength, the ability to spin webs, superhuman reflexes, the ability to cling to any surface, and a nifty thing known as `spider senses'  which warns our hero of impending danger. Can someone answer a question for me? If spiders have all of these abilities why are they so damn slow and easy to kill?<br/><br/>At first Peter doesn't realize what is happening to him until he finds himself involved in yet another fight with Flash. When he is able to effortlessly dodge all of Flash's punches and knock him out with one punch, he's just as surprised as everyone else. Imbued with excitement over his newfound powers he wants to turn use his `gift' to make money by becoming a wrestler. After being stiffed by the wrestler promoter, (Lying wrestling promoters? I'm shocked! Shocked!), he let's a thief who robbed the promoter escape.<br/><br/>Later that night, that very same thief shoots and kills his beloved Uncle Ben. In anguish Peter remembers something his uncle told him `With great powers, come great responsibility.' At that moment he vows to help the helpless and `blah, blah, blah'<br/><br/>While all of this is going on, Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), Harry's domineering and `distant' industrialist father is having some ""issues"" at work, he's about to lose a major military contract to a rival company if they cannot deliver a `super-soldier' serum to the government in a few days. His chief scientist tells them that in all their lab tests, the subject's where genetically enhanced to display superhuman strength, hearing, etc.but the side effect is, all the mice went insane (How do you know a mouse is insane?) and displayed a marked increase in aggressive behavior. Well of course, never having watched an evil scientist movie, and being desperate, Norman decides to test the serum on himself with the standard results. The experiment goes bad and he becomes an insane madman known as the Green Goblin (more on this later).<br/><br/>The movie does a pretty good job of telling Spiderman's origin, although it should have and could have done it in a lot less time than the 20 or 30 minutes it takes. It bogs the movie down. The `back story' seemed empty and stilted. Maguire's acting was ok, but he didn't quite have the raw star power or presence that was needed to anchor this film. But then, in the comic book (which I collected for 10 years) the Peter Parker `character' was never really all that interesting. He was only interesting because he was Spiderman. He used Spiderman to show an alternate side of himself - a confident, `fun loving' superhero, who would have a ton of zingers and funny quips that would drive the bad guys crazy. The character and personality of Spiderman was totally lost in this film. This Spiderman was more like `Batman', than the comic book Spiderman.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst was fabulous as Mary Jane Watson and the chemistry between the two were good as well. Unfortantely the rest of the cast is nowhere near as good as Dunst and Maguire are, with the notable exception of J.K. Simmons dead on `impersonation' of the cigar chomping gruff, blowhard, J. Jonah Jameson  publisher of `The Daily Bugle'. Who uses his newspaper as a soap box to trash and discredit `Spiderman'.<br/><br/>What was director Sam Raimi thinking when he horribly miscast Joe Manganiello as Flash Thompson, but his worst sin was James Franco as Harry Osborn. Franco looked as if he ate bad cabbage, or tasted sour milk and that was the only expression that he displayed throughout the entire film. Why was he picked? Was it his resemblance to Harry Osborne?<br/><br/>On paper, Willem Dafoe was perfectly cast as `The Green Goblin'. But there is but so much you can do with a villain who was never that great to begin with. The Green Goblin was a ridiculous villain in the comic book, and he's even more so on the big screen. The goblin suit, had to be the worst, cheesiest looking monstrosity that I've ever seen on a big screen. It supposed to inspire fear, a sense of danger, instead it inspired fits of hysterical laughter whenever the goblin put in an appearance. It looked klunky, fake, and just totally ridiculous.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the special effects, the night time sequences look fantastic, and the up close stunt work look fabulous and realistic, unfortunately the CGI in the movie looked really fake, especially the web swinging shots, which were plentiful, and some of the more `far away' shots. The heavy reliance on CGI is what robs Spiderman of his character, his humanity, and ultimately makes the film feel `hollow' and dare I say `cheap'.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman's music score was tame, borring, and non-inspiring. It was the same recycled, derivitive, crap that he's done every since he did the excellent score for Batman.<br/><br/>While watching `Spiderman' I kept feeling like I was watching the old `Spiderman' series from the 70s, just blown up to the big screen, and I kept thinking how cool this would be on television. Something you should never be thinking during a summer blockbuster, especially a superhero film. `Spiderman' is the perfect cookie cutter, carefully `packaged' corporate product."
"Donny_Stay","Null","0","0","4 May 2002"," review from a non-comic book geek.
","I've noticed that most of the reviewers below have wildly diverging concerns about this movie.  I will divide my comments point by point, thereby preventing you from having to wade through comments that don't interest you. You're welcome.<br/><br/>1)  Faithfulness to the comic:  The film does a good job of capturing the mythos of Spider-Man while adapting the story to the 21st Century.  I seem to recall Spider-Man having a much smarmier wit, but otherwise the story is faithful to the comics.  The filmmakers were very liberal about changing biographical details, but only the most rabid comic book fans will care. (Besides, we all know that the hardcore fans are going to see it no matter how awful people say it is.)  Grade: A<br/><br/>2)  The acting:  Tobey Maguire is a perfect Peter Parker.  He plays the geek-cum-superhero perfectly; the role is henceforth his alone.  Kirsten Dunst is very charming as his love interest, but Willem Dafoe's cackling Green Goblin is tiresomely cartoonish, even for a comic book character.  A+ for Maguire and Dunst, C for Dafoe.<br/><br/>3)  The script/story:  The script focuses on the genesis of Spider-Man.  As the movie rehashes Peter Parker's oft-told story, the script predictably has a very mechanical, cookie-cutter feel.  It's a superhero movie; what did you expect?  The script is serviceable, and that's probably enough for this movie.  C+<br/><br/>4)  The effects:  Spider-Man is probably the most difficult comic book character to render digitally.  Hey, it's easy to make a woman call lightning or a gay Englishman control metal; Spider-Man's body must constantly bend the laws of physics and human physiology.  The Green Goblin, for instance, looks perfectly fine.  Still, the effects are very distracting.  B for effort, C- for results<br/><br/>5)  The romance:  ...is easily the most charming love story ever found in a comic book movie.  Maguire and Dunst are adorable as a potential couple, and their romance was handled more carefully than in Raimi's earlier film, -For Love of the Game-.  B+<br/><br/>6)  The action:  Often seems incidental, and never feels exciting.  There is never any doubt who will win any of the battles, and some sequences are almost boring.  C<br/><br/>7)  Overall:  Film adaptations of comic books don't require much to succeed. Stay faithful to the spirit of the character, include the requisite effects and action, and voila!  Instant blockbuster.  -Spider-Man- accomplishes this, but succeeds further with a very charming romance between Spider-Man and Mary Jane, both of whom are portrayed brilliantly by Maguire and Dunst. B+"

","First off, i was never a huge fan, but i always loved spidey.  I watched the saturday morning cartoon show, and played the video games, but never really read the comics.  I went into this movie thinking that it would be all action, and just fighting the  green goblin.  I got my fight scenes, along w/ a really good story.  It gave those a chance who hadnt been big fans, to see how he came to be, and why spiderman isnt like other superheroes.  He didnt ask for his powers, and he sees it as his gift, and curse.  He still is human, and if you cut him, he will bleed.  Tobey did a great job portraying the shy and nerdy aspect of peter parker, while having charisma and courage when spidey.  I thought that the story would suffer, and it would be like tomb raider movie, and be like watching a video game, but it flowed really well, and was realistic.  The love triangle of peter, mj, and harry also creates a lot of tension in the plot, and really helps connect this movie, and leaves room for a sequel.  Overall, i would say this is the best movie i have seen in a few years.  And one last thing, you get so engulfed in the movie, the 2 hours fly by.<br/><br/>P.S. - Sit in one of the first 5 rows, its more fun... lots more fun."

","I saw Spiderman last night and was thoroughly impressed.  This is not a typical Sam Raimi production. It is much better. It doesn't sacrifice the plot to take advantage of every opportunity to tell a joke.  Having said that, it DOES have a number of great lines.  Spiderman is funny---just like in the comic book.  J. Jonah Jameson is hysterical in the same way he has been in the comic book.  NY has the same relationship with Spidey that it does in the comic.  But the movie isn't slavish to the comic book.  It doesn't feel like a tired rehashing. Everything is fresh about it.<br/><br/>I was unprepared for the quality of the script and the acting. (I knew Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe would be fantastic, but I was shocked by how good Kirsten Dunst was as Mary Jane.  Dunst was totally engaging an loveable in Drop Dead Gorgeous, but I didn't think she could pull off the role of the sexpot model MJ Watson. They tweaked it a bit and made her an actor---she was credible as that and suprisingly sexy.  As soon as I heard ""wig"", I thought she was a bad cast, but she more than held up her part of the movie. J.K. Simmons stole the show as JJJ though.  He makes you wish he had more scenes.) My only complaints were minor. Cliff Robertson (Uncle Ben) seemed a cut below the rest of the cast. I didn't feel any bond between him and Maguire, but luckily he won't be in the sequel. :)<br/><br/>Good scripts make good actors, and the script is borderline great (with the exception of the last 10 minutes, which seem a bit hamfisted.).<br/><br/>I worried about the special effects after watching the credits.  I thought that the webswinging scenes might be unwatchable, but they were great. Really fast and slick.<br/><br/>It is a very well done movie. It may be the best movie based off of a comic so far. Probably as good as MIB, and will retain it's freshness better than X-Men or the first Batman did on subsequent viewings."

","Overall, I was disappointed.  Special effects were nice, the acting at times was distractingly poor, but to be fair, there were some good scenes as well. By the 90 minute mark I actually started to get bored. Raimi had a good cast and a good script but I felt he didn't give enough buildup....and the climax was unrewarding for me....the film was just flat and the score didn't help it any.  I like Raimi a lot, but I think Raimi failed to give his actors, script, and Spiderman the direction they needed."

","Nothing was more satisfying than seeing this masterpiece before my friends did.<br/><br/>The movie grabs a hold of you and doesn't let go until the ending credits. Danny Elfman once again pulls off a magnificent musical score.<br/><br/>Although I personally think Tobey Maguire isn't exactly the best looking guy, but you can't really give the part of a science nut to a jock either. He fits the part nicely, although his odd smile will give me nightmares for weeks.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe is just the kind of villain that the big-name movie series need. He fits the role excellently. Perhaps the Bond series should invest in his talents at some point.<br/><br/>I don't really think of Kirsten Dunst as much of an MJ. I think her days of acting teenagers are over, but it was a lovely performance none the less.<br/><br/>Although one element I never expected to be included was - Amateur wrestling. God that sequence was funny. ^_^<br/><br/>One of the best movie theatre experiences I can say I ever had. Ranks up there with Resident Evil."

","This movie was for the most part short of amazing. I had a chance to see a pre-screening of this movie and it was a blast from beginning to the end. The story, plot and characters were as if the pages of the comic were placed on the screen. the spider-sense visual was reminiscent of the bullet time scene in the matrix, but done very well and didn't look like it was trying to copy, Sam (Raimi) did an excellent job of making it it's own visual. and as for the action simply amazing. hard-hitting action and web-slinging. Maguire and Dafoe were the perfect hero and villian, and Dafoe played the duality to a tee. It didn't seem cheesy or fake. the only complaint would have to be Mary Jane, it didn't seem to me that Kirsten Dunst pulled it off the way that Raimi would liked to have. Although the kiss scene was memorable, I think that MJ would have been better cast, some say Alicia Witt, or even angelica bridges would've been better. But our only hope is that Kirsten can grow into the role for the next two sequels. All in all was the movie worth your 7.50? absolutely, is it worth seeing more than once? if your like me and hate going to the theaters to see the same movie more than once, I saw it twice and will probably see it one more time. Will it be worth the price of the soon to be DVD? Well if the DVD only had the movie with no special features it would be worth it. This is a movie that should be enjoyed by all."

"Scarlet-22","9","0","0","4 May 2002"," The New Superhero Movie Gold Standard
","A while back, I wrote a review of 1989's BATMAN, where I called it ""The Gold Standard of Superhero Movies"".<br/><br/>I now have a new Gold Standard.<br/><br/>SPIDER-MAN, last of the big name superheroes to get his own movie, had an 18-year struggle to reach the big screen.  Accordingly, this movie had almost impossible expectations to live up to--yet amazingly, the film not only lives up to them but surpasses them all.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is dead-on perfect as Peter Parker, and we watch his transformation from geek to freak to superhero with wonder and joy and heartbreak.  Sam Raimi fought Sony tooth-and-nail for Maguire as his first choice, and like Tim Burton fighting for Michael Keaton 13 years ago, we the viewer in viewing the final result now understand the director's loyalty. Maguire's performance is subtle yet commanding.  He takes hold of Peter and immerses himself thoroughly into the role.  It would have been a huge mistake to cast Spider-Man and retrofit him into the Peter Parker role; by casting Peter Parker and having him grow into Spider-Man, the complexities of Stan Lee's groundbreaking hero shine through Maguire's magnificently expressive blue eyes.<br/><br/>Right up there with him is Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborne, ambitious Dr. Jeckyl-esque scientist driven mad by his lust for power in the Defense contracting industry and truly driven mad by his performance enhancement chemicals, which bring out the Mr. Hyde within him.  At no point do you detect that Dafoe is in danger of going over the top with this performance; in fact, just the opposite occurs.  Dafoe is so tightly controlled with his performance that we hang on the edges of our seats waiting for him to snap, and snap he does.  His conversation with the mirror in his study is perfectly done, a snapshot of the entire range of complexity and subtlety and rage and fear in his performance.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst is beautiful and talented as MJ, but one wishes some of the scenes showing her own growth and transformation from abused teen to trophy girlfriend to independent thinker that were in earlier cuts had been kept. But Dunst makes up for it with her spunk and zest, and that upside down kiss with Spidey in the rain may be the hottest thing ever put on screen.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is first-rate--Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben, the catalyst for Peter's life work; Rosemary Harris as doting Aunt May; James Franco as Harry Osborne, whose strained relationship with his father forms one of the many complex triangles in this film; J.K. Simmons stealing every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson, who'll make Spiderman famous (or infamous).<br/><br/>Raimi's direction is fast-paced and furious, and borrows extensively from much of his earlier work (the entire Peter-designs-his-costume sequence came almost straight from DARKMAN, a much underappreciated film), and manages a strange balancing act:  We know we're watching a comic book come to life, but never once do we forget that the comic book that has come to life is one of Marvel's most groundbreaking and complex works, with characters who are real and lives that are full of anguish and pain.<br/><br/>One scene in particular crystalizes the movie's power:  As the Parker and Osborne families gather in Peter and Harry's Manhattan loft to celebrate Thanksgiving, everyone there--Peter, Harry, Norman, Aunt May, and MJ--has an agenda.  Everyone's agenda is hidden at the beginning of the meal.  But by its end, in onion-skin layers peeling away to reveal raw, acidic, damaging underlayers, everyone's agenda is exposed, and no one is what they seemed when the scene started.  The exposition in this one scene drives the entire last half-hour of the film.<br/><br/>The film isn't perfect--there are moments when the pace drags a bit; the inevitable ""join me"" confrontation between villain Green Goblin and Spider-Man is not up to what it could be; some scenes cut from the film's final version really needed to be there and will hopefully be there on DVD--but it blows away every other comic book film I've ever seen.  Go see it."

The choice of Toby Maguire was an excellent one.  He added just the right flare to the role.  And Willem Dafoe makes for such a wicked bad guy.<br/><br/>My only complaint was that some of the special effects were a bit too much.  They used a CG Spiderman a bit too often.  Other than that, it had a terrific story line.  It was told very effectively.  And, having heard through interviews that Toby Maguire has already signed to do two more Spiderman movies, the lead-in to the next movie was blatantly obvious.<br/><br/>In short, the movie's well worth the time and money.  I especially liked the ending.  I had heard that they had to rework a few scenes following 9/11.

","This movie was everything you could want when going to see a movie as an escape from reality. I've seen the Supermans and the Batmans, but this movie was truly fun. There wasn't a second where I lost interest. The casting was brilliant and the transfer from comic book to screen only had a few small holes. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to have a fun evening at the theatre. p.s. Kirsten Dunst is gorgeous."
"kluvlaw","10","0","0","4 May 2002"," 10 Stars. The best action movie since The Matrix!
","I gave this movie ten stars because it is as good as movies like Crouching Tiger or Traffic, in that it captures what it intends to capture.  Those stories were brilliantly acted pieces dealing with simple peoples lives and the movies showed those stories extremely well within the style of their own genre.  Likewise, this movie captures what the action movie genre is supposed to capture(the audience's attention from start to finish).  There is continuous action, but never at the expense of developed characters and good storytelling.  These character's depth can be attributed to the script which clearly wants to make this movie have mass appeal, (which, for once is a good thing).  What I mean by this, is that the script includes background and important facts about each person (much better than x-men for example), so this isn't just a movie that appeals to the die hard Spiderman fan. Once the characters have depth and are continually forced to deal with tragic situations they become easy to care about in this VERY WELL acted film. It separates itself from most other action movies (which I generally dislike) because it is more than a medium to feed an audience special effects. ""Spiderman"" is actual storytelling, was incredibly humorous (in keeping with the comic book's style of storytelling), and refreshing.  There is no need to be a 16 year old comic book collector to enjoy this film.  The whole audience was clapping and cheering by the films credits.  It exceeded all my expectations!! P.S.- My wife, who knew nothing Spiderman's history, was very impressed by the character development and solid acting because both made her care about the lives of these people."
"AbeStreet","Null","0","0","4 May 2002"," Rare to find film that's true to original story!!!!
","This review will be easier for fans of the comic book to identify with more than casual fans that know little of Spiderman.  In order to comment on this movie I need to explain my approach to viewing Spider-Man (SM).<br/><br/>
Marvel Comics (MC) have almost always done better at providing the reader with a good backstory, a backstory that readers could identify  with. Unfortunately MC has not been able to translate their good story telling into film productions.  Films such as Captain America, Spider-Man (1970's), The Fantastic Four, Doctor Strange and Howard the Duck cemented the idea that MC could and should not do film work.  For me all this changed with the First Blade movie.  Blade was at the time of the movie release a little known comic book hero.  Only consistent readers of MC would even  have an inkling of who this character was.  Even so more attention to detail was paid to this film than any other MC film.  The action scenes were top notch and I like the sets used to film the movie.  I hate Batman The Movie type sets.  Blade used many real location scenes for that film and it made the movie feel much more real.  Superman the Movie did this also.  Primarily the city shots were in many cases shot in real cities and not on sets.  SM also feels as though it takes place in the real world and not some Gothem set type location.  For me this is a real plus.<br/><br/>I read & collected SM comic books as a grade schooler in the 70's and as a teenager in the 80's.  I could really relate to Peter Parker and his everyday life problems.  I remember the horrible attempt at making a SM movie and television show in the 70's.  SM's costume was fine but he wore his web shooter (he only had one) on the outside of his costume as he did his web cartridge belt.  This ruined the overall appearance of SM.  Also, he fired webs that were as thick as 1 inch rope.  I never did understand how he could manipulate the web shooter to fire a line of web or make a net of web.  Actually, I never understood this in comic form either.  SM would fire these artificial webs in such variety and size that it just seemed impossible that he could carry enough web fluid in his cartridges to spin as much web as he did or make such complex and various web creations.  This movie rectified all this by allowing SM to create his own webbing internally.  This makes so much more sense.  Kudos to the movie writers for making this change.<br/><br/>Next, (Spoilers Ahead) this SM movie has followed the origin of SM to the letter.  Uncle Ben's death at the hand of criminal Peter Parker allowed to escape previously.  This part of the origin of SM is critical to how his views are shaped.  In the comics Peter Parker did live with Harry Osborn and after the Green Goblin, who is Norman Osborn, Harry Osborn's father, dies almost identically to the way he died in this movie Harry discovers his friend Peter is SM and becomes the new Green Goblin.  The way this movie ended it left that door open.  Also, Peter Parker doted on MJ for years and was never able to reconcile his feelings for her.  Eventually they did get married but not after years of off again on again dating.  I liked the way this movie did not take the easy way out and have Peter & MJ getting together.  The obvious pain they both felt after Peter, who wants nothing more than to be with MJ, turns her down because of his alter ego, sense of duty & fear of danger to MJ is palpable.  By ending the film here leaves the audience feeling saddened even if they can understand Peter's reasons.<br/><br/>
As for the casting, excellent!!!!!  When I originally heard that Kirsten Dunst (KD) was going to play MJ I was disappointed.  She seemed just a little too perky for me.  In the comics MJ was perky but it seemed like a front that was being put on to hide other issues.  KD was able to capture that aspect of her character better than I ever suspected.  Also, the chemistry between KD and Tobey Maguire was great.  I am a big fan of Cliff (Three Days of the Condor) Robertson and it was good to see him playing Uncle Ben.  William DaFoe was right on the money with his Green Goblin role.<br/><br/>
Lastly, Sam Raimi has obviously done his homework.  This movie was better than The X-Men and at least as good as or better than Blade.  SM is just as good as Superman the movie was when it was originally released.  SM makes use of the current CG effects without overkill and provides an excellent storyline with characters the viewer can grow to appreciate.  I hope MC is able to keep up the good work.  I have my doubts though.  I have read reviews for the upcoming Hulk film and it appears that they are really going to screw with the origin of that character.  Hopefully Daredevil will stick to the true origins.  For now I'm going to enjoy this work of art."
"imdb-507","10","0","0","4 May 2002"," Worthwhile effort -- see it twice
","Plot, character development, action, cinematography, casting, special effects - these are some of the elements, when done right, that are traditionally associated with an entertaining movie.  Spiderman comes to the theaters with high expectations from old-school comic book Spider Man fans, and for the rest of us, it comes with that same baggage.  The story has most of the elements that make the best movies tick, character development sufficient to make you identify with the main characters, a love story that goes achingly unrealized for much of the movie, a story line that while starting somewhat implausibly soon has enough drive to keep your disbelief suspended, and finally action and special effects sequences that were eye-popping, eye-candy, turbo-charged - in short, state of the art, and done in a way that looked real in a way that many pictures have been unable to capture.  The movie had very few spots that dragged, and had me totally absorbed for the vast majority of time.  It was also not as violent as you might expect, and used violence to propel the story forward, and never without reason or relevance to the storyline.  In the end, it followed a typical comic book ending in that the setup is perfect for a sequel.  On the other hand, the ending was rewarding and tied up most of the loose ends created during the rest of the movie.  In short, this movie is extremely good, 9 stars.  I predict that this movie will gross in the top 5 movies of all time!  See it and see it again.  A great show."
"wharrison51","Null","0","0","4 May 2002"," Fantastic job across the board
","This is the first screen adaptation of ANYTHING that I can remember where every single actor flat out NAILED their characters.  Tobey Maguire is Peter Parker, right down to the forlorn stare every time Mary Jane leaves him behind.  Kirsten Dunst is, as always, excellent.  Willem Defoe was the most pleasant surprise, though.  Some great one-liners in costume are overshadowed by his perfect portrayal of Norman Osborn, a miserable man who has gained the whole world but forfeited his soul.<br/><br/>Big thumbs up to Sam Raimi, who in retrospect is the only one who could have done this film justice.  His trademark kinetic camerawork captures Spider-Man's web swinging perfectly, and his obvious affection for the character is contagious.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, was it me, or did J.K. Simmons have a blast playing J.Jonah Jameson?  Come to think of it, the whole cast and crew looked like they were having a blast making this movie.  Must be why it turned out as great as it did."

","It delivers as expected and was completely worth the wait-25 years in my case.  An enjoyment for Spidey fans, newcomers, and skeptics alike.  The film had a couple variations from the comic history, but nothing to take away from the enjoyment of the story or characters.  Special effects were on the money.  Willem Defoe comes through big time as Norman Osborne about to lose his mind from his own genetic enhacement serum/gas.  Maguire and Dunst have a great chemistry together as well.  The only thing that takes getting used to for hardcore fans is the new look of Green Goblin, but after seeing the movie 3 times, it works for me.  Bring on Spider-Man 2 and hurry!!!"

","I would like to start out by saying that I am a BIG-time Spider-Man comic book fan.  I have collected and read every issue he has appeared in. However, other than the characters themselves, this review is not about the comic book, but the movie. ***By the way, possible spoilers ahead*** Starting with the characters, I believe Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker was excellent and portrayed the true Peter Parker perfectly.  Also, the Norman and Harry Osborn characters were well written and acted.  However, the best character of the movie was by far J Jonah Jameson.  The movie was worth the price of admission alone to see the scenes with him in it.  The problem I had was with how Mary Jane Watson was depicted.  She is not the shy, damsel-in-distress, oh woe-is-me character that was shown in the movie. She is a fiery young lady to match her Red hair who is full of spunk and gusto. She is brash and outspoken and wild and fun and at this point in her life she is a little self-centered and aloof.  They missed the boat completely with her character....but a true Spider-Man comic fan can look past that, because this should be about a stand-alone movie and not the comic. So what about the movie.  It started out with great emotion, which is what a movie (any type, but especially and action movie) should bring out.  A wry smile and a quiet cheer came up as the geek boy beat on the school bully. Tears were shed at the passing of Uncle Ben.  There was a lump in the throat and a quickened pulse during the first fight scene with the Green Goblin. But....for all the emotion that came about throughout most of the movie, there was absolutely none for the final fight scene.  This is where the problem was in the movie.  There needed to be web and flows, back and forth, hero is down, hero is up, hero is back down and out, hero finds a way, everybody cheers.  Instead we got a one-sided fight for the villain for a few minutes, than a one-sided fight for the hero, and then it was over. The way the final battle ultimately ended was very anti-climatic and, I might add, stolen straight out of the comic book, which also made it very predictable and very disappointing.  And I haven't even mentioned the final scene yet, which was very sappy, extremely out of place, and seemed forced upon us almost as if they had to hurry up and finish the movie before they could figure out how to properly end it.  I gave this movie a 7 as the 3 for the last 1/4 was offset by the 10 for the first 3/4.  It's still worth seeing, but for all the hype, and for such a promising beginning, be prepared to be disappointed somewhat when you walk out of the theater."

","I will start by saying that I have never been a Spiderman fan, I have always been partial to Superman and Batman. But I'm always open to a comic book hero brought to the big screen. Sam Raimi has made a movie that I feel will appeal to most people, it is fun, brisk, and never takes itself too seriously. Toby Maguire is good as Peter Parker/Spiderman. He brings the appropriate sensibility to his role, Willem Dafoe does what he can with what he is given as the Green Goblin, but it is too little, I wish they would have fleshed out his villainous  character. The special effects are good, but I believe that they are  intentionally cheesy. The action scenes are done well, but nothing that hasn't been seen before.If there is a problem is exactly that, the action is not particularly unique, the scenes are done well but there isn't really any memorable shots or things that the audience would be wowed by. I would say that the non action stuff in the movie is more entertaining. The first hour when Peter is discovering his powers is especially entertaining. So a slightly above average warm up to the summer season, a good warm up for Episode II.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"
"kemboja","8","0","0","2 May 2002"," The Superhero of this Century!
","Whoever doubted Sam Raimi for choosing Toby Maguire ought to be ashamed! He is the holding glue for this movie.  He is indeed Peter Parker in flesh! Toby fits the character like a glove, adequately mysterious and nerdy at times.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi has made several changes to the original comic character, to fit the big screen i.e. the slight costume change, the wristweb (he changed it to be a genetic mutation instead of a manmade).  But instead of destroying it, he endears the character to us mortals by being so human.  The transition period when Parker discover his newfound powers was nice too - the euphoric building jumps, the wall scaling, the web dispensing techniques and the wrestling match was really great fun! With the other great actors, Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson and William Dafoe as the Green Goblin(he is always great at playing evil), this show is really tight.<br/><br/>Overall, Sam has managed to satiate the hunger of the long anticipating fans of Spiderman and also make it pleasurable for non-fans to watch.  In fact, this movie might win legions more fans for Spidey!<br/><br/>P/S : Watch for Lucy Lawless as a punk and Bruce Campbell (of the Evil Dead Series) as the ringmaster at the wrestling match."

","Yes, it's only May, and I know that many other blockbusters are coming out over the course of the year.  I'll tell you what.  Go watch Spider-Man. Then go ahead and see all the other movies that were released.  You might just find yourself saying as you leave the theater, ""That was a great movie, but it wasn't Spider-Man.""  And with excellent reason.<br/><br/>The best casting move made was Tobey Maguire as our friendly neighborhood wall-crawler.  And that was because the people involved in casting did so with the target audience in mind, rather than trying to attract a new one. And Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson was perfect.  I found myself wish that was me hanging upside down in the rain.<br/><br/>And don't get me started on Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin.  I don't think anyone else would have been able to pull that off, unless the producers picked Jack Nicholson and told him to pretend he was Joker in body armor.  My only real beef with the movie (as was with many fans) was that Spidey's webbing was organic instead of mechanical like in the comics.  But hey, you can't have everything.<br/><br/>And I very much enjoyed Jim Norton's appearance, even if it only was for 3 seconds or so.  I was the only one in the theater that laughed when he came on.  And I also seemed to be the only one to spot Stan Lee's 2 second cameo as an elderly gentleman that pulls a child away from danger in Goblin's attack on the balcony.<br/><br/>If you haven't done so, GO SEE THIS MOVIE!

","I first heard this movie was coming out some time back in 2000 or maybe even 1999 and instantly got excited about it.  Since then I've tried VERY hard not to OVER-HYPE the movie as not to set myself up for disappointment, and let me tell you, it was TOUGH!  Anyhow, so I went and saw the movie on opening night (as I always do with movies of this caliber) and I must say that I WAS NOT let down.  I was VERY happy with the movie.  I wouldn't dare say it flawless, but it was very, very good.<br/><br/>I'm no expert on Spider-man, but I think I know a good amount about the comic.  I was surprised that the movie seemed to follow the comic's story very closely.  There were a few things that I KNOW were changed, but otherwise, it was pretty much the same story as the comic.  ...And if I didn't mention it, that is a good thing.  I thought the story was great!<br/><br/>I must admit that when I heard that Tobey Maquire was going to play Peter Parker/Spider-man, I was quite sceptical.  I just had to hope that he could pull it off.  In the end, I was VERY pleased with his performance.  He played the perfect Peter Parker and really worked out to get the physical look of Spider-man.  So, I have to give a ""thumbs up"" to Tobey, he pulled it off and did a great job.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast, I thought they were pretty good as well. Willem Dafoe did a good job with Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin, but I didn't really have any doubt that he could pull it off.  Kirsten Dunst was definitely a great addition to the film.  She did an EXCELLENT job as Mary Jane, and definitely looked the part.  I give her a ""thumbs up"" too.  The rest of the cast were pretty much unknown to me, but I'll give them good props too.  As for the director, Sam Raimi, I have to say that I was also a bit sceptical of him taking on this project.  Don't get me wrong, I loved his other work, (Army Of Darkness, The Gift, For Love Of The Game, Darkman, etc), but I was still unsure if he could pull it off.  Well, in my opinion, he did it, Sam did a fantastic job and I gotta give him props too.  Oh, and I also loved that Sam threw in a cameo for his buddy Bruce Campbell (also knows as Ash from the ""Evil Dead"" Series).  If you didn't catch him in the film, he was the ring announcer near the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have about the movie was SOME of the special effects. Sometimes they just looked incredible, but other times they looked VERY cartoon-ish.  But, I definitely wouldn't let something like that influence my overall liking of the film.<br/><br/>All in all, I thought the film was great, and well worth the wait and the money I spent for the ticket.  I think I may just have to go see this one in the theater again before it's gone.  This movie is pretty much for everyone, I can definitely see kids liking it and grown-ups can appreciate it too. There wasn't anything in the movie that was overly kiddy.  Anyhow, I hope you like the movie as much as I did, and thanks for reading.<br/><br/>-Chris"

","Having read the first issue of Spider Man when it first came out, when I was a kid, I was more than a little interested in seeing how modern movie making would treat this hero from long ago. For the most part, it wasn't disappointing. First the good:<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire was an inspiration to cast in the part, he seemed absolutely perfect. He gave the character just the right blend of believability in the two faceted hero, the public nerd and his secret alter hero. I loved the scenes of his early discovery of his newfound prowess and his experimentations with them and his attire.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst was lovely and similarly well cast as Peter Parker's heartthrob, maybe too good. It was very hard to swallow Spidy's response to her at the end. I found myself wanting to slap him back to his senses, ""It's Kirsten Dunst you dork ..."".<br/><br/>Other actors did superb jobs in their parts, especially the veteran Cliff Robertson. The big disappointment and semi-pleasure all rolled into one was Willem Dafoe. The best part was the quality and execution he brought to a difficult role. It was probably the best performance of that type of character I've ever seen. That leads to the not so good stuff: His character should have been canned entirely. Not that Dafoe wasn't good, he certainly was. I just hated the character in that movie. I felt like it nearly ruined what is probably the best comic book brought to the screen I've ever seen. I get the unmistakable impression form this and many other films that movie folks feel that ordinary evil is somehow mundane. It's not. I could not invest any degree of personal fear in this kind of character. The real bad guys, yes, we all have some degree of fear of real bad guys, the robbers, murderers, rapists and the like seen earlier in the movie. Those villains I can appreciate being saved from. The ""Green Goblin"" just left me shrugging a ""so what"".<br/><br/>But, even with the burden of the goblin, I'd still recommend this to fantasy lovers everywhere."

","I was expecting to enjoy the action sequences more than anything else, but it turned out that I enjoyed Toby McQuire's reactions as Peter Parker more . He genuinely seems to be in awe of his new found powers. The scene where he tries to shoot more webbing was a particular favourite. I totally believed that he was in love with Mary Jane ( which considering that Kirsten Dunst was playing her I can't really blame him. She is a cutie!) I can forgive the differences from the comic, ie: webs coming from his body rather than him making the device himself but I enjoyed the fact that they used so much material from the comics. That is one thing I have always disliked about the Batman films the story for those were never to my knowledge in a comic. The wrestling sequence was in the premiere issue as was the thief and the outcome of Peter's allowing him to escape. If I have one complaint about this film it was the fact that Sam Raimi dropped the ball in the portrayal of the Green Goblin. Willem Dafoe is an excellent choice to play him, but his costume gave him no freedom to look menacing and as the story goes...insane. The action was good, but like so much of todays action films it looked a little to CG for me. The battle between Spidey and the Goblin was again taken from a comic which I loved. The fact that Osborne finds out who Spider-man really is was written in the comics of old and the fact thet they get unmasked in front of each other was particularly refreshing. On one hand I thought that the way Spidey was swinging through the streets looked unnatural at times. I can view it as he is still getting used to doing it. I hope that in the sequel (you know it is coming) he will have gotten the hang of it a bit more. Overall I would rank this about the same as I would the first two Superman films starring Christopher Reeve. Fun for the whole family. Action. Excitment. A Few Laughs. While setting up the character for further adventures. I can't wait."

As a 30+ Year reader of the series of Spider-Man comics, it was nice to see that they were pretty much true to the storyline.

","Spoilers!<br/><br/>Spiderman is a a breakthrough in the world of modern movies, yet it still maintains a traditional atmosphere which will appeal everyone.  It's almost a perfect movie.<br/><br/>First off, the casting is excellent.  The actors are superb, putting on a realistic, extremely believable performance in their characters that they become real.  The CGI, however, is only believable once Spidey puts on his traditional suit.  When we see a CGI double of Maguire, it's kind of TOO smooth, yet it still fits in with its surroundings.<br/><br/>The conflict between Spiderman and the Green Goblin is fantastic, absolutely brilliant.  Good vs. Evil with a hint of Good, and young boy pitted against best friend's father is almost mind-boggling because so much emotion is involved, as well as suspense, intrigue, and mystery.<br/><br/>My father, my brother and I went to see the movie today, the fifth of May, and my father was impressed.  He told us how every morning he would go and get the paper so he could see Spiderman in the comics, and he would be excited to see the newest comic book.  He then told us how nostalgic this movie was... it was so much like the comics.  However, it was scientifically modernized, as in the explanations for superhuman powers was much, much better.  It's no longer simply a radioactive spider (which I found somewhat hogwash anyway), now it's a ""superspider"" with spliced genes and a manipulated DNA and RNA.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman proves to be a great composer yet again.  With his recent work of Planet of the Apes, he just tops it off with another enthralling score that matches the movie and makes it that much more intense.  His opening titles, as usual, is absolutely terrific.<br/><br/>Spiderman is a classic clash of Good vs. Evil, The Right Choice vs. The Wrong Choice, and friend vs. friend.  It is no longer just a comic strip... it is much, much more.  It is a great movie that will thrill you (and keep you laughing as you sit on the edge of your seat) from start to finish.  It is a must see."

Kirsten Dunst also did suprisingly well, considering her last few movies were teen flicks.  And William Defoe was exceptional as The Green Goblin.

","Over here in Malaysia we have had the privilege to see the movies a few days earlier before the US. (probably a move to avoid the competition with pirated VCD which comes in very quickly after the movies starts showing somewhere else). My local cinema (the only one in town)which normally hardly get admission beyond 30% was fully packed yesterday afternoon. Everyone seemed to enjoy the movies very much. I must say I enjoyed the movies too.The special effect makes spider man moves just like the way we see him in the cartoon series. The character development of Peter Parker, as well as his nemesis, the green globlin is good. It is interesting to see the green goblin as an ordinary man slowly taken over by the evil of his heart (or the green gas?)instead of just being a bad ass to start with.The brief appearance of the bold and arrogant newspaper boss (don't know his name) is impressive. Hope to see more of him in the sequal. Without doubt the ideas of making a sequal is already in their mind when they were making this film. It will be interesting to see how Harry Osborne will deal with spider man in the sequal.(I hope they keep him in the sequal) I can't help but keep comparing this movies with the first Batman movies (by Tim Burton). Sam Raimi seems to makes this movies with a bit of  darkness so that we can feel that it is not just fun and glory to becomes the spiderman.

","Spider-man has been anxiously awaited by many people, including myself. And, although the cinematography in this film is superb, I think that this movie was not lived up to my expectations.  The acting was pretty good, and, like I said, the cinematography was excellent, but I felt that the plot was not very good.  The whole ""Green Goblin"" character was too much of the typical villian.  They could have gotten more creative in the script, and they could have put a few twists into the movie.  To me, this was the typical superhero movie, and I did not see anything that makes it unique among other superhero movies.  And, I completely disagree with this movie being in the top 250 (as it is at this point in time).  For what it's worth, this movie was partially entertaining and vastly overrated.   RATING: 5/10"

Spider-Man is at time frenetically paced but never loses track that there is a person behind the mask, a person who is a human being. Toby MaGuire is so perfect as Peter Parker/Spider-man it's almost like he walked off the comic book himself. The film stays 99% faithful to the origin and the lesson that with Great Power Comes Great Responsibility.  It's just an awesome film of superb craftsmanship. Sam Raimi (who fit his brother Ted as well as Lucy Lawless there in cameos) did one helluva job. I can hardly wait to see Spider-Man 2!"
"sandgnats","Null","0","0","3 May 2002"," Good, but Ultimately Forgettable
","Having had so many movies hyped beyond belief, I was expecting this movie to be ""Manos: The Hands of Fate."" Instead, we got a brighter, but more neurotic ""Batman."" Where Tim Burton took Frank Miller's Dark Knight concept and translated it well into a new cinema/hero genre, Sam Ramini tries to re-invent Stan Lee's classic comic. The result is a mixed bag.<br/><br/>While Tobey McGuire makes for the perfect ""everyman (boy)"", he fails to give a believeable performance as the angst ridden Peter Parker. While many people may like his type of acting, I found it to be a bit too stiff for my liking.<br/><br/>All of the elements needed for a good super-hero movie are present, but the movie sometimes forgets to follow the rules they outlined in the character development. (One good example is how Spiderman's Spider Sense works sometimes, and when needed for cinematic development seems to disappear.)<br/><br/>The resolution of the film gets to be a bit drawn out. It's almost as if they wanted to add another act to the movie because they forgot to resolve some issues during the finale. Overall this movie merits a good solid C to C+.  One can only hope the next Spiderman movie will achieve the title of ""Amazing"" like the title of his comic book."

As a kid, I was a collector of Marvel comics, with Spiderman being my favorite, followed by Daredevil and then the X-Men. Before seeing the movie, I wasn't sure if I was going to like the changes they made from the comic book to the movie, like the webbing he shots being organic in nature, or the armor body suit of the Green Goblin, but man, did it work! -The effects, as well as the acting and action were great!  I'll be seeing this movie again in the theaters again real soon!  Oh, and one last thing, in reference to a post before mine...  I had little kids sitting around me, between the ages of 5-15 with their parents.  Two of the kids left the movie, the other it looked like he kept his head turned into his dads side for most of the movie.  Willem Dafoe was a terrific choice for the Green Goblin.

","Pardon my language, but it does rock. It rules. It's beyond what I had imagined. After seeing a movie that fulfills almost impossible expectations, a little teenage language can be forgiven, I think. Let's not forget that Spidy is a hero with a cult following, so, naturally, there will always be those who see sacrilege in the few (good! necessary! favourable!) changes the creators of the movie made with respect to the original comic. To those: Come off it! This is a great film; it has the perfect balance of action, drama, laughs and the mandatory romantic element. And, of course, in this kind of event cinema, everything hinges on the right choice of a leading man, and in this aspect, Tobey Maguire is absolutely perfect (am I overusing this word?) as the slightly nerdish Peter Parker. As Auntie May rightly points out, Spiderman is not Superman; Peter's process of discovering and learning to control his powers are among the most hilarious scenes in the film (that spider web thing isn't as easy as it looks). Kirsten Dunst is as lovely as always, and Willem Dafoe would make a good Goblin even without the mask on. Speaking of the villain, not only are we given one whose motivations are understandable, but being who he is, he even opens the door to the sequel.<br/><br/>All I can say, if the rest of the movie summer comes on as strong as this film, then we're in for a memorable year indeed. Not to mention the possibility of multiple sequels. 9 out of 10."
"LaHaine77","Null","0","0","3 May 2002"," Entertaining but far from perfect
","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man spins a good-looking web that holds the audience in place for the film's two-hour duration, but what I missed was the bite from the ol' arachnid that you'll be feeling for a few days after the experience. The movie was certainly entertaining, but somewhat lacking in atmosphere.<br/><br/>I have few complaints about the first half of the movie, as Peter Parker's transformation was portrayed quite well with a light humorous touch. Laughs all around the theatre. However, it was quite obvious that Raimi and the writers had a tough task in trying to cram a lot of content into a limited time, so despite the warm depiction of Peter Parker's relationship to his aunt & uncle, it was all a bit shallow. Just barely enough to justify why Peter comes to use his powers for good rather than bad.<br/><br/>After the amusing and entertaining part where PP comes to terms with his new self, the movie unfortunately becomes quite ordinary. None of the action scenes are particularly inspiring - I personally liked the action in Blade II a lot better, for example - and the plot twists are very predictable. Not that a movie like this is expected to have surprising plot twists, but anyway. And then there's the Green Goblin, who seems to divide opinions on this board. I didn't see anything groundbreaking in Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Osborn/Goblin, in fact the twin-personae scenes where he is talking to his other self through the mirror were quite childish. And as a super-villain, the Green Goblin just doesn't cut it. Not dark enough, silly gadgets, shallow motivation, no great masterplan (in fact he was no more evil than your average Enron board member) and a costume that ranks right down there with Arnold Schwarzenegger's in the second Batman sequel.<br/><br/>On the whole, Spider-Man is an entertaining movie and a decent-enough comic book adaptation, but I was hoping for something a bit darker and atmospheric. Three stars out of five, or a 6 on the imdb scale."
"ashspicefilms","Null","0","0","5 May 2002"," Great superhero film
","Let me start out by stating that I am not an avid reader of comic books and I don't especially care for most superhero movies (Xmen seemed like a choppy mess made just to please comic readers and kids, Superman was too childish, and the batman films just don't do anything for me). I also wasn't expecting anything better than Xmen to come from Hollywood. However, Raimi's crafting of the spider-man story was, for me, the most engrossing and adventerous movie I've seen in years. The way Peter Parker (Maguire)'s character is played out in the early film really sets up for his character's dynamic and evolving mind set. And Dafoe's Goblin, aside from the character's minor setbacks (which I will mention later), was really one of those villains that you really hate yet somehow feel bad for at the same time. And the portrayal of Mary Jane, Parker's love interest to whom he cannot profess his true feelings, perfectly captures the essence the teenage romance which Parker feels. My favorite aspect of the film is its sense of time. The first part of the film focuses on a young Parker, and the early events which led to him emotionally and physically becoming the spiderman character, while giving a slight introduction to the villain character. After a particuarly poignant incident, the film cuts ahead an unset amount of time, into a time where spiderman is in full costume, understanding more of his powers, and the villain is ready to begin his maniacal plans. What I liked about this transition into a later time period in the film is that it allows the film to show us both the back story on the characters and the more important later conflict. Most superhero films these days stay in the back story part, making the whole film seem like a setup and leave the film lacking a real conclusion, with the hero only truly present (i.e. in costume and right mindset) for only the last portion of the film. ""Spider Man""'s unique sense of time elevates it above such films. I also feel I must point out that this film is much more dramatic than most superhero films. Unlike ""X-men"" or ""Batman and Robin"" type films, ""Spider Man"", which remaining fun, has a slight air of reality which the latter films lacked, which may cost it some of its appeal to the viewers who wish only to see their childhood cartoon shows in live action. This slight sense of reality, however, is completely gone in a few distinct parts. And on to my complaints: Well for one thing, the central villain in the film, the Green Goblin, is armed with weapons which were supposedly being invented for the US military (Don't worry, I'm not spoiling anything you don't find out early in the film). But his outfit just begs the question why, if it were being developed for the military, would a suit contain built-in, metallic green muscles like those of a super villain? I can see why his suit wasn't made more realistic (and if it was he probably wouldn't have been as super of a super villain anyway) but it is still off-putting and it's introduction momentarily deducts from the realism. The other part in which I felt this was when Parker's character instinctively does a quadruple back flip to avoid a punch early in the film. Wouldn't it be extraordinary enough for him to just double, or even single backflip away? It's not a major complaint, it's just that when it happens the scene loses the realism. But despite these lapses in the sense of reality, the film manages to be entirely convincing. On another note I would just like to mention that the Goblin's voice could have sounded a little less like that of the Joker in ""Batman"", I mean, the films are going to be compared enough anyway. In the end, I must recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a good adventure and experience an engrossing story, and if you are bringing a child make sure they can handle some of the scarier scenes with the Green Goblin. And hats off to director Sam Raimi- I can't wait for the sequel, I just hope it doesn't detract from the original."

""Spider-Man"" succeeds on so many levels because it convincingly creates feelings that ring so genuinely, that emotionally viewers are captivated by this film.<br/><br/>I know that I was.

","Raimi, more than any other director, has almost perfectly captured the style and grace of Spider Man, especially when he swings around on his web going from building to building.  He also does a great job of capturing his grace of motion while doing gymnastics and fighting--but that is about it!  He does almost nothing to capture the youth angst that the original SpiderMan conveyed in the comic books.  <br/><br/>This may mostly be because the three main characters just seem to be phoning in the lines.  After seeing Jonah Jameson, I prayed for the time when he would be back on screen (this character was captured perfectly!).  Hopefully in future installments, the movie will take place more at the Bugle and we can see more of him.  I hope Aunt May doesn't die soon, as she also did a fairly competent job of capturing the sweetness of the comic book character.<br/><br/>Except for the web slinging and Kirsten Dunst in her occasional short skirts, there is not much else here.

Her dramatic work in ""Crazy/Beautiful,"" as well as her extensive and marvelous comedy work prior to that (""Drop Dead Gorgeous,"" and ""Dick"" are two under-appreciated modern classics)have proven her to be a major talent. She is definitely the Real Deal--- not just some poof-in-the-pan passing fad. In ""Spiderman"" she does the obligatory ""Oooing"" and ""aaahing"" at the hero--- but funnily, she also brings a realness to her role that goes beyond what previous comic-book-movie actresses have done. She brings an innocence and an excitement to her on-screen behaviors that is disarming and engaging for the audience. Yaay Kirsten!<br/><br/>Toby McGuire is well matched for the role--- ""Spiderman"" comic have always been a bit on the underdog side. The movie is no exception. But I was very happy to see that this movie avoided (mostly) the bizarre and depressing ""dark side"" vibe that somehow seduced the makers of the tedious and self-absorbed ""Batman,"" the pretty good ""Mask,"" and even the horrid ""Monkey Bone"" (from an otherwise brilliant Brendan Fraser. What happened with THAT, dood?). Spidie's world seemed virtually normal, and the sci-fi overkill was only hinted at with Willem DeFoe's space-scooter thingy that could evidently run around the sky forever on a single, invisible, tank of gas.<br/><br/>Over all, much more good hearted than previous movie-cartoons of comic books.

The only error I could REALLY point out is that in one scene, near the start when he's fighting crime, a spider spun its orb web on a light post. I'm a spider afficionado and I'd like to point out this is NOT an orb weaving spider. And I love the fact that they got all the anatomical details right!! Effin' awesome!!"

","Its so rare to find a movie where everything works.  Especially when it comes to comic book films, but Spider-Man nails it dead on.  The quiet scenes really hammered home the weight of the responsibility Peter feels, especially at the end.  There's a kind of infectious joy when Peter's discovering his powers that stays with you whenever he's swinging through the city. Superman, Batman, X-Men are all very good superhero movies, Spider-Man is better.  Can't wait to see it again, nor can I wait for the inevitable sequels.  I just hope they stay away from the ""mulitple villains are better"" theory."
"brendonm","5","0","0","4 May 2002"," simply adequate when it should have been great (No spoilers)
","The first thirty minutes had me smiling, but after the initial setup the movie falls apart and feels very episodic. Why?  Because the villain had no plan to carry off, so the hero had no goal to reach.  The climax was lame as well -- not enough at stake. The production design was cool, but the lighting overall was flat:  it looked like a TV movie.  And what was up with all that _graininess_ during some of the CGI-heavy sequences? Were they re-rendering frames up until the last minute?<br/><br/>I have other gripes as well, but the overall crime here is that what should have been a great movie turned out to be simply mediocre. The Spiderman I know and love still lives in the 1967 animated TV series. Tobey Maguire, however, was well cast as Peter Parker -- he inhabited the role well as he usually does (rent WONDER BOYS for another great performance of his).  And Kirsten Dunst has grown up to be a real hottie."
"F. Poole","4","0","0","4 May 2002"," Derivative Super Heroics
","Before I start citing better super-hero movies (there are several), I would just like to say that while I found this film to be highly derivative of its counterparts (as well as of other genres), I must say that I was totally impressed that the entire audience applauded when the picture ended. Of course, this was an afternoon matinee on a Saturday so seven tenths of the audience was under the age of ten which means that most people there were not old enough to remember how good Batman was (let alone Superman).<br/><br/>
On only his third attempt to sell out, and even following a Kevin Costner vehicle, Sam Raimi has finally hit his crowd pleaser. Hell, if Ron Howard can go from Grinch to Oscar in just two pictures then just about anything you can imagine should be possible. <br/><br/>I'm going to keep this simple. I didn't hate this movie. At times I found myself enjoying it, thinking that things could be much worse. In fact, for all of its shortcomings (which follow) I must confess that the filmmakers did a fine job of establishing a mood and aesthetic for this super-hero movie that is all-together much brighter than most other super-hero movies. But after the picture let out, I couldn't think of one thing that I really liked about the film. <br/><br/>So what's wrong? A lot of the acting was bad though. Raimi's charm as a character director seemed absent save for Bruce Campbell's wrestling emcee. To any Raimi fan, this would come as no surprise. Dunst, who was brilliant in Jordan's Interview with the Vampire, was flat and managed to salvage nothing of an already terrible (and empty-headed) female character, Mary Jane. (Rachel True's Mary Jane was superior in the 1998's pot comedy, Half-Baked.) Tobey McGuire, and Willem Defoe are capable of much, much more. I shouldn't need to cite references here. Semi-newcomer James Franco's performance was probably the least disappointing of the lot, though his character was likely the weakest.<br/><br/>(WARNING *** SOME MINOR SPOILING AHEAD ****)<br/><br/>Several narrative elements seem to be drawing on and owing their success to other better movies with similar ideas. For example, Peter Parkers metamorphosis process may remind some viewers of David Cronenberg's most commercial picture, The Fly. In another sequence, Franco comes home to the sound of his father screaming upstairs in their cavernous home; a moment reminiscent of Kubrick's film, The Shining, when Wendy hears Jack screaming in the main hall.<br/><br/>(NO MORE SPOILING)<br/><br/>Then there's Elfman's score. Boy howdy! It was probably the most derivative element of the entire film! It sounded pretty much like EVERY OTHER Danny Elfman score, except for the ones where he rips off John Williams, like Good Will Hunting.<br/><br/>Lastly, there was simply too much CG. Hollywood action movies seem to have degraded to an intellectual level that sinks beneath 3-D light shows and firework ceremonies. The cynics will feel that this has always been true...but I contend that the richness of characters, performance, and story lines in Superman and Batman will forever be far superior to the CG smoke and mirrors that make attractions like Spider-man earn $41 million dollars on their respective opening weekends.<br/><br/>Enough said on Spider-man. Decide for yourselves...and before you take issue with my point of view on this piece, watch Superman."

","Spiderman is a superb comic book adaptation. Tobey Maguire is perfectly cast as Peter Parker and Willem Dafoe is brilliant as the Green Goblin. While some have criticized it's cartoonish fight sequences, I feel that they were wonderfully done in such a way that makes them slightly inconceivable. After all, this is a film based on a comic book that has a premise which is a little bit out there. Another great casting choice was that of James Franco as Harry. He and Willem Dafoe look so much like father and son it's astounding. Kirsten Dunst gives another great performance to her resume, I'm a big fan of hers. She plays her roles beautifully with great charm. She really is the girl next door, having looks that aren't spectacularily drop-dead gorgeous and a smile that will melt your heart. The plot is delightful, my favorite line of the film being ""We'll meet again, Spiderman!"" It's so deliciously cheesy and yet it works so well. All in all, I had fun at this film and that's exactly what it should be, an exciting night out that leaves you with a smile on your face."

","The long and tumultuous wait for Spider-Man's journey to the silver screen has paid off in the most satisfying way since perhaps Richard Donner's Superman in 1978.<br/><br/>Peter Parker has always had a rough ride in both of his alter egos, and his path to cinematic success is no different.  But, as a lifelong Spidey fan from the 60s cartoons to the 80s Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends to over a decade of reading the Marvel Comics, I must say it was well worth the wait.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is Sam Raimi's homage to a beloved childhood idol, and brings home the message that with the right talent, an actually good film based of comic book material can be made.<br/><br/>Nearly a decade of Stan Lee, Steve Ditko, and John Romita, Sr.'s work is condensed into a taut, well-paced two hours of action, suspense, and a real romance.  Tobey Maguire, no one's first choice, IS Peter Parker and his web-slinging secret identity, and will no doubt, for good or bad, be forever defined and associated with Spider-Man.  He fleshes out an already realistic character in a wonderful, sometimes tearful, way.  We feel Peter's pain and are overjoyed by his triumphs in and out of Spidey's colorful costume.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe, of course, does a spectacular job as science mogul Norman Osborn, and his fractured, insane alter ego, the Green Goblin.  Dafoe brings a brutal physicality to the Goblin that makes him awesome and terrifying at the same time.  Dafoe's Green Goblin is a true super-villain, willing and pleased to do his own dirty work, and not hiding behind henchmen like Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor or Jack Nicholson's Joker.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst is excellent as Mary Jane Watson, the object of Peter's affection, and while on display for her physical assets, brings a great deal of depth to another tortured character.  The supporting cast all perform remarkably despite miniscule screen time, particularly James Franco as Harry Osborn, Rosemary Harris as the frail but dutiful Aunt May, the legendary Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben, and J.K. Simmons, who steals the show as Daily Bugle publisher, J. Jonah Jameson, Peter's boss and Spider-Man's constant pain in the neck.  Cliff Robertson's Uncle Ben evokes Glenn Ford's Jonathan Kent in Superman, instilling in his pseudo-son the immortal lesson ""With great power comes great responsibility.""<br/><br/>It was hard not to get misty when seeing Spidey finally swing across the skyline on the screen.  For many of Spider-Man's long time fans, this film is a triumph for a character long deserving of wider acclaim.  I can only say, Thank you Mr. Raimi, Sony, and Marvel Comics.  Keep 'em coming!<br/><br/>Highest recommendation!"

","Can Sam Raimi do no wrong?  I left the theatre thinking that.  Spiderman is a stunning adaptation of the classic Spiderman comic series I remember as a kid (who collected them).  There's a lot of moving, human interaction and feeling here.  The dialogue isn't complex but it doesn't have to be.  This is the world of the comic book, the touch of camp, the surreal lighting, and the very human (flawed) side of Spiderman that runs parallel with his greatness.  The dual hero-boy innocence comes through in every scene and it really works.  This is a very well made movie and not pure summer blockbuster eye-candy with a story sandwiched in between (somewhere)."

","""Spider-Man,"" directed by the great Sam Raimi, is so good that I have a loss of words.  Here's what I'm gonna say.  It's alot better than ""X-Men.""  But, it's in the same area with ""The Crow"" series, the ""Blade"" series, the ""Superman"" series, and the ""Batman"" series.  This is Sam Raimi's best film to date (his best was the ""Evil Dead"" series).  Tobey Macguire was the perfect choice to play Peter Parker.  David Koepp, who recently wrote the hit ""Panic Room,"" did such a good job staying very faithful to the comic books and Sam also did a good job not dissappointing the ""Spider-Man"" fans. Also, my favorite composer, Danny Elfman, did an excellent job orchestrating the music to this movie.  William Dafoe was wonderful as Norman Osborn (a.k.a. ""The Green Goblin).  But, the best thing about the movie was Kirsten Dunst.  My all-time favorite actress who I admired watching from being a girl (""Interview With The Vampire,"" ""Little Women,"" ""Jumanji,"" etc.), to being all grown up (""Crazy/Beautiful,"" ""Drop Dead Gorgeous,"" ""The Crow: Salvation,"" ""Bring It On,"" ""The Virgin Suicides,"" etc.) did such a marvelous, marvelous job playing Peter's love interest, Mary Jane Watson, I wanna see what she's gonna do next.  If you wanna start the summer off with a big bang before ""Star Wars"" opens, then I'd reccommend you guys to see ""Spider-Man.""

"zacky902","7","0","0","4 May 2002"," With great power (139 million) comes great responsibility (Raimi)
","Spiderman<br/><br/>There is a scene in director Sam Raimi's Spiderman which pays homage to a film of his past, Evil Dead II.  The scene I am describing is where Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) first tests out his powers, as he jumps from building to building in street clothes, inexperienced.  When he gets the hang of his powers, he designs his costume meticulously.  This scene is a spiritual homage to Evil Dead II's Ash, as he builds his chainsaw weapon and saws the barrel off of his shotgun.<br/><br/>And with this, Raimi and Maguire break free of constraints in the film. Maguire's Peter Parker is larger than the movie.  He seemingly lives in his own world, where he freely interacts with what goes on around him.  Young, in love, and going through a life-changing experience, Maguire fills Spiderman with wonder and excitement.  And many critics thought he would not be able to do it.<br/><br/>A film adaptation of Spiderman was long thought an impossible, daring feat. Although Superman, Batman, and X-Men have come before this film, Peter Parker was always the most human of all comic-book characters.  Bruce Wayne was a bloodthirsty vigilante.  Clark Kent was a larger-than-life man with very little weaknesses.  The X-Men were un-human characters who relied on each other for strength in battle.  Parker has no alliance, only a sense of duty and responsibility.  Raimi's Spiderman (which cost roughly 139 million to produce, plus marketing) is a film that shows the struggle of a young man, tackling many responsibilities with an actual concern for his family, friends, and even the strangers he protects.<br/><br/>After being bitten by a genetically altered spider during a class field trip, Parker begins changing.  He goes to bed sick and wakes up healthy.  He no longer needs his glasses.  He has muscles.  But what sets him physically apart from other healthy people are his strange abilities: he sprouts small hairs on his hands with allow him to climb walls and his wrists have mutated into web-spinning devices.  His new powers not only allow him the chance to make some money for himself, whether through wrestling or taking photos of himself, but they also offer the chance to win Mary Jane over, which he will try to do several times throughout the movie.<br/><br/>When Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) dies, Peter must re-evaluate his life. Some of Ben's last words to Peter were `With great power comes great responsibility.'  This becomes Peter's mantra.  It defines what kind of a hero he will become and how he will treat those around him.  Saddened by his uncle's death, Peter Parker does indeed become a hero.  The people of New York grow to love him.  Crooks, criminals, and enemies fear him.<br/><br/>While all of this happens to Peter Parker, filthy-rich businessman Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe) is facing some harsh realities.  If Oscorp, his company, loses a military contract from the government, the he will be finished.  Determined not to let this happen, he experiments his company's new serum on himself.  A horrible accident ensues, which leaves Osborne as the multi-personalitied Green Goblin.  The Green Goblin is set on destroying the competition, and does just that.<br/><br/>Osborne's son Harry (James Franco) is Parker's best friend.  And when the Green Goblin learns that Parker may be Spiderman, a game of cat-and-mouse ensues.  The Goblin cheezily terrorizes New York.  He destroys J. Jonah Jameson's (J.K. Simmons) offices, hospitalizes Parker's aunt May (), and takes Mary Jane hostage.  But instead of coming off as a twisted villain with clear goals, Dafoe's Goblin soon degrades into a cheesy, poor man's Jack Nicholson as the Joker.  The Green Goblin is neither scary, nor menacing.  He's cheesy.  As cheesy as the skeleton army in Raimi's Army of Darkness, even.  Dafoe as the human Osborne is good, but as the mutant Green Goblin, he's bad.  Quite possibly, the Green Goblin is what keeps Spider-man from being a great movie.  While Tobey Maguire is very believable in his role, Willem Dafoe is not.  Dafoe gets considerably less screen time, but his tongue-in-cheek insults and varied actions come off as second-rate and hold the movie back.<br/><br/>Still, the movie has its share of positive moments.  The entire first half is great.  Maguire flawlessly transforms into the wall-crawler.  The supporting cast, particularly J.K. Simmons as media mogul J. Jonah Jameson and Dunst as Mary Jane are very good as well.  The second half, while not degrading into a cheese-fest entirely, has some great moments.  Spidey, as he swings through his urban jungle, is portrayed exhilaratingly.  Good money was spent on decent special effects, most of which take place in the second half.  Unfortunately, though, the film does not contain its magic throughout the entire movie.  And in the end, Parker is the only character to learn a lesson and then live it: with great power comes great responsibility. <br/><br/>

","Wonderful, colorful, and extremely well made, Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" undertaking has proved its worth and some. It is a very satisfying vision of the comic book that stays very true to the source material. The story, characters, and overall feel of an actual comic book have never really been faithfully adapted to a motion picture until now. The acting is pitch-perfect as well, from Tobey Maguire's nearly heartbreaking portrayal of Peter Parker, to Kirsten Dunst giving Mary Jane a very insecure persona. And Willem Dafoe, of course, hams it up appropriately as Norman Osborn, whose hidden agenda is Spider-Man's arch-nemesis, the Green Goblin. The special effects sequences are truly a spectacle. They are thunderous, stunning races through Manhattan's concrete jungles that blur the line between CG images and reality. My only gripe about the movie is that it moves at a cheetah's pace, sometimes at the sacrifice of some of the movie's dramatic punch. But hey, that's excusable due to the fact that the film is based on  comic book, and shouldn't pretend it is based on Shakespeare. Another lame bit is the presence of Macy Gray, which for reasons I can't quite put my finger on, kind of detracts from the movie (though only in a small way). If she's gonna be in films she should stick to the stuff she did in ""Training Day"". But even with these two barely significant quirks, ""Spider-Man"" is an exciting, and fantastic movie with awesome acting, characters, music, and special effects. Go se it, even if you just go for J.K. Simmons' hiarious performance as the liberal media tyrant J. Jonah Jameson. The movie is a thrilling experience and we can only hope that Raimi and company reunite for a sequel in the future. 10/10"
"Spoonmonitor","10","0","0","4 May 2002"," Finally, a summer blockbuster that has some substance.
","I think that Spiderman, much like Lord Of The Rings, is one hyped movie that actually delivers on its hype and then some. As everyone has said, Tobey Maguire is perfect as Peter Parker. His Peter Parker has a lot of depth and anguish to it, and it made me care about what happens to him. I usually don't like Kirsten Dunst much, but I thought she nailed the character of Mary Jane. And I give credit to the filmmakers for not casting a supermodel actress to play Mary Jane, because they have done so in the past (Rebecca Romjin-Stamos as Mystique in ""X-Men"") and they could have very easily done it in this movie. I'm really happy that Sam Raimi was chosen to direct, because he has the campy background (Evil Dead...enough said) in order to pull off some of the more implausible scenes without breaking a sweat. He also knows how to portray superheroes with emotion and poise, no matter who they are (see Darkman). This movie has quite a few similarities to Darkman (in a good way). The action was very cool, and I'm sure they will have more in the sequel, but I'm glad they didn't overload on it. It kept the movie from being shallow, because too many action movies rely on action than on story. The humorous subtext is there, the costume is there, the performances are there, and the great special effects are there. All in all, it was a very entertaining movie not just because of the action, but because it had a story that a viewer could identify with, and it had a love story that people can believe. It is the best movie about a superhero since Batman, it's a great movie to take the kids to, and it's full of old wisdom and glory that many modern actioners are devoid of. The sequel cannot come fast enough. Overall, an entertaining and fulfulling time at the movies.<br/><br/>I give it a 9.5 out of 10 (I deducted half a point because I wanted more action)."

Toby Mcguire's Peter Parker/Spider-Man is very likeable and it is great fun watching Spidey swing through the caverns of New York City. And, as usual, Willem Defoe becomes totally absorbed in his Jeckle/Hyde role as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. As with all his roles, Defoe appears to be having so much fun with his character that he makes himself fun to watch. But alas, the parts are better than the whole. While colorful CGI images of the Green Goblin flying through the air, tossing bombs and tackling Spider-Man, (who looks so cool) fed my appetite  for enjoyment, the plot never quite got off to a solid roll or pace, bouncing between the story of Parker's tragic love for MJ (Kirsten Dunst), his own coming of age angst, and the Goblin's quest for revenge. But by the end, Parker has accepted his lot in life and the Goblin's hate for Spider-Man is passed to Osborn's son (Parkers best friend) so the story can continue in a sequel.

Funny cameos, great puns (Dr. Connors) as well as great direction/special effects ,plus lots more, made this an enjoyable film for Spider-Man fans. For time sake, I will not go in-depth but it's a very fun movie overall."

","I went expecting a great movie with an accurate depiction from the comic book. I can honestly say it remained very true to the comic. Although the romance scenes are a bit cheesy, Tobey Maguire played an excellent Spiderman and even a better Peter Parker. Willem Dafoe plays Green Goblin to perfection, everything that a maniacal twisted evil villain should be. This is a great film and I'm hoping for many more Spiderfilms to come!"

","Wow, today I along with millions of others, saw Spider-Man today (opening day) and all I can say is wow. Every good once in awhile, a movie succeeds my expectations. I didn't think Spider-Man would, mine were pretty high, but guess what, I was blown away by the sheer fun of this movie!<br/><br/>Is it the thinking man's movie, no, but is it what entertainment is all about? Yep, and that's why I gave this a rating of ten, course I'd really give it a 9.6 (more on that later.)<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire must really be a nerd in real life because he captured of the essence of Peter Parker beautifully, and his Spider-Man? He got that in a big way too. His Parker simply shines though, as a very believable hero.<br/><br/>William Dafoe, man what a great actor, shame the Oscar's will snub this film, because Dafoe simply scares me with his sheer ability to play an insane man. His reason in becoming the Goblin is very believable and well this villain is evil. Flat-out evil. Innocent lives? The Goblin sure doesn't care.<br/><br/>Kirstin Dunst, she looks good, and she acts pretty good, course my only complaint is her scenes while good and give the film depth just kinda drag due to her. She's slow in delivering lines...She's the reason  knock this film down to 9.6<br/><br/>The rest of the cast; Aunt May and Uncle Ben were great and especially J. Jonah Jameson, this guy shines throughout the entire film. And of course, Bruce Campbell, wow I love this guy, I also love the fact that he's integral to Spidey's name. You'll understand after watching the film.<br/><br/>And finally for the comic fan, can you find all the homages? hehe, there everywhere and they were great.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was excellent entertainment and kept me entertained the whole way throughout. Go see it ASAP!"

","Story, SFX, character development: all nicely done. It also had some really amusing scenes like the wrestle-match with Bonesaw McGraw & when PP first tests out his spider-powers. The scene on the Old Glory flagpole at the end had a classic ""arachnid"" pose & was in my mind the killer shot of the movie. Overall very high on the cool-factor, and a great underplayed & nuanced performance from Tobey."
"snakeman64","10","0","0","3 May 2002"," All I can say is, hell yeah!
","I had the opportunity to see Spider-Man in an advanced screening.  All i could say after the movie ended was, hell yeah!  I am a film student at the University of Oklahoma, and you can ask my friends of how picky and critical I am of the films I watch. Needless to say, it takes a lot to impress me. Well, my hat goes off to Sam Raimi on this one.  I am a big fan of the Evil Dead series and of the Spider-Man comics, so I had a feeling I was in for an awesome ride.  Indeed I was. I've heard many people complaining about the CGI in this film, but I'd like to see them come up with a better way of doing it.  I mean, I usually am critical of the use of CGI being a film student, but then again I was thinking that to recreate the agility and superhuman skills of Spider-Man, you almost have to.  Also, (the CGI)was done very well and very stylish. Many other aspects made this a great flick.  Danny Elfman's (Batman, Edward Scissorhands) score was nothing short of fantastic, and the casting was high caliber all the way around.  Tobey Maguire was perfect as the nerdy high-school student/turned superhero, Kirsten Dunst was great as the extremely sultry yet almost innocent Mary Jane, and Willem Dafoe's portrayal of the psychotic super-villain the Green Goblin was almost so believable it was scary.  This is one of the most stylisticly done superhero movies done since Burton's Batman.  Give it a look, you won't be disappointed.  Trust me."

","The effects are amazing, mostly because they look so real and blend in seamlessly with the real world.  You really do get the sense that this is happening in the real New York City, not some half-hearted rip-off of it. The story is right out of the comic books, but plays well.  The cast were excellent.  Tobey Maguire nails the part of Peter Parker, Willem Dafoe brings great depth and a little sympathy to the confused Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, and Kirsten Dunst brings Mary Jane to life much better than I thought she would.  Some of the supporting players are also great, especially J.K. Simmons' J. Jonah Jameson.  Perfect casting.  They waste no time getting right into the story, and the origin sequence is as good as any you'll find in a comic book.  The only changes made to the various minutiae of the comic world are for the better or hardly noticeable.  Sam Raimi is not only a huge Spider-man fan, but a smart one as well.  This is clearly a labor of love for him, and he makes it look cool, too.  If he directs the sequels, I can't wait for more!  This ranks up there as the best superhero movie yet.  Nuff said."

","I have been a fan of Spider-Man for more than 20 years, so watching this film while not being too critical over every detail meeting my expectations, was quite a challenge. To me, it was a roller coaster ride of kudos and de-merit points. Kudos on his costume, J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the special effects of his webbing, the parade scene, and keeping somewhat true to the original story. Major de-merit points for the Green Goblin. He is my #1 Spidey villian and they made an atrocity out of him. Not only does his costume design bore ZERO resemblance to the original, it's also missing it's signature two-tone color combination of green AND purple.(For shame on you!) And Defoe's casting, along with Dunst, Franco, and especially Manganiello will always be a mystery to me. They look NOTHING like their characters. (That is, if you're like me, coming from the original Ditko/Romita Sr. versions)  As for bringing these comic book characters ""to life"", I can't say they bowled me over with their performances. On the other hand, there actually were times were Maguire would look a certain way and I thought ""Wow! That really IS Peter Parker!"" For someone who could care less about these details, this is an exciting movie to watch, and I must give them credit for taking it seriously, instead of approaching it as a big summer blockbuster with no plot or meaning. The only sad thing is, is that it wasn't ""special"". Like when you watch Star Wars. Spider-man is a very special character, with a special story to tell, and this movie, although it gets a A for trying, just didn't hit that ""special"" mark."

I would have liked to have seen more biting wit and sarcasm from Spidey, and the CGI effects were pretty obvious, but didn't detract too bad. The web shooting wasn't exactly how it was in the comics either, coming straight out of his wrists instead from a web-shooter Parker invented. I'll go back and seE 6. again.

","If you are anything of a Spider-Man fan, you should love this movie!  Raimi did a wonderful job of telling the story of Peter Parker and the origin of Spider-Man while keeping the action fresh and the characters alive and believable.  Tobey Maguire really shined as Petey, that boy can cry on a dime!  Kirsten Dunst was solid, of course, and Willem Dafoe is such a good actor, he played off the madness of the Green Goblin without ever sounding hokey.  The casting of J.K. Simmons as J.J. Jameson was pure perfection.  I had a lot of expectations going into the movie, but it met and exceeded every one.  I haven't enjoyed the entire length of a movie in a theater since I saw ""The Matrix"".  And some of the fight scenes in Spider-Man were reminiscent of that movie, but I guess that's the direction movie fight scenes are going.  I'm glad.  I like that look.  Robbie Robertson was in the movie too, albeit a small role.  And a couple other small details from the comic were peppered around the movie, making me smile to remember something that was so long ago, but still sweet, to mix my metaphors.  It was like watching some of my childhood's favorite comic book characters come alive on the screen.  The webbing looked and moved exactly as I had imagined it, and the acrobatic fight scenes were choreographed and shot extremely well. When Peter was discovering his powers, I felt like I was right there with him, scared and excited at the same time.  I was truly pumped when I walked out of the movie.  One thing I did miss, tho, was the ""snappy-patter"" that was a trademark of spidey's battles.  I guess I'm not a huge David Koepp fan then....I thought the script on Panic Room was week, too.  But he did surprise me with a few zingers, and of course there was the famous ""With great power comes great responsibility"" line...that was my mantra for a while as a kid.  Anyway, if you've read this far, thanks, and if you're a Spider-Man fan, I think you'll like this movie.  If you're not, I think you should still enjoy this fast-paced, well-acted, well-directed, ride of a two hours movie.  What's two hours, anyway?"
"marz1966","10","0","0","3 May 2002"," The AMAZING spider-man!'Nuff SAID!
","I have just seen one of THE best comic book adaptation movie...ever! That's right. I said it. Sam Raimi and company have sucessfully translated the 40 year old comic super-hero,Spider-Man,into what I hope to be the STANDARD of comic adaptation films. Raimi balances drama,action,humor,and romance perfectly in this film. Tobey Maguire was the best choice as Peter Parker. He is excellent. He doesn't over or underplay this part. This role will forever be his and no one elses.EVER. Kristen Dunst? With what they gave her,once again,she delivers. We see Mary Jane's fears and insecurites..but in the end how she learns that she doesn't need a man to give her an identity. Willem Dafoe as Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin gives us a deliciously evil schizo villian. There is one scene when he and the ""Goblin"" are having a discussion...chillingly convincing. The special effects were good,but yes,there are times where you can tell it's total CGI. Yet, the story,the action(some of the best and kind of brutal fight sequences I've seen in a comic book flick.) and,listen up you hollywood big shots,CHARACTER DEVELOPEMENT, made it forgivable. Elfman's score was good,but what is kind of distrubing,is that it sounds like the REST of his stuff.(Unlike the music he did for a Simple Plan.) Spidey fans,for the most part, will love this movie. Yes, there are a few things that could have been better..but hey, it could have been a lot worst too. I can't wait for the sequel.

","This movie is a wonderful and faithful adaptation of the original comic book series. It is great to finally see Spider-Man on the ""big"" screen with all of the bells and whistles that current technology can provide.

However, now that the ""introduction"" has been given, I am already eagerly anticipating the sequel.<br/><br/>The one other recommendation that I would make, and this won't be for everyone, is to read the novel adaptation of the movie first. Peter David did an awesome job of transferring this movie into print form. However, there is so much more in the novel that explains some of the scenes in the movie and how they ""got to that point"".

"giancarlorocks","9","0","0","3 May 2002"," Raimi immortalizes Spider-Man...
","The transcendence of a world renowned super hero into the immortalization of a silver screen icon is a difficult task. Yet Sam Raimi's Spider-Man' is a cinematic piece of uber-Popcorn filmmaking that is a pure treat to experience. Not to watch, but to experience. Viewers will familiarize themselves with the delicate xenophobic genius of Norman Osborn and the fragile torrid innocence of a young Peter Parker destined for infamy. Sam Raimi directs a stylized and vast piece that will hold true to Spidey fans worldwide. A mediocre script by David Koepp is improved upon by the visceral imprint Director Sam Raimi creates upon his key sequences. An astonishing trait lifted from the film is an incredibly surprising pervasive sense of dualistic symbolism. This profound characteristic seeps through the film.  Before we go into detail, one can assume that I really enjoyed the film. That is a fact. Yet many will disagree with me due to the film's modest approach to such a beloved icon. And yet that is where I find the brilliance within the film. Raimi sculpts a fun piece of film that can not be simply brushed off as a brainless, summer piece of moviemaking. It is a certainty that the Summer Movie Season has officially commenced. It is a strong possibility that films to come will be mundane and recycled, yet Spider-Man' leaves its' mark as a new kind of Superhero film that many will attempt to imitate, yet will not succeed. Raimi's simplistic approach to such a huge undertaking must be admired because it works. Special effects are an added bonus to this intricately weaved film that does not rely on the special effects to tell a story, but instead relies in the development of these inter-related personas. Tim Burtom was the first to immortalize an icon of comic books with his gothic and darkly entertaining 1989 feature Batman'. In Burton's film, our opening sequence introduces us to this mythical being that has already made a name for him through the rumblings of crooks in the Gotham streets. In this film, Raimi takes a step back and gives us a concise and detailed account into the origin of this masked legend who is cursed with a powerful gift. Upon anticipation for the film's release, I questioned how Raimi would sustain the interest of the audience when Peter Parker was not Spider-Man. Could Raimi show us Parker going from zero to hero in an entertaining and cohesive fashion? Those worries were quickly disregarded as the opening credits rolled and Danny Elfman's pounding score tricked its' way through the digital sound. This film paces itself beautifully and provides a healthy balance between the hero and the man behind the hero. We come to sympathize with this young man as he struggles to counter the unexpected exuding powers he must come to terms with after a genetically enhanced spider bites him on a school trip. WITH GREAT POWER COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY' is a line frequently uttered in the film. That can also be applied to Raimi's demeanour as a filmmaker who knows will be single-handedly in charge of either creating a profitable studio franchise or tarnishing the immortality of a boyhood icon. The power Raimi has to create a great film is highly visible on screen as he amalgamates all great levels of cinema to bring us a thoroughly enjoyable film. Raimi incorporates sparkling visual imagery with a surprisingly deep character enhancement of all our main characters. Mary Jane Watson is played with sexual zest by Kirsten Dunst who will be catapulted to stardom with this role. James Dean look-alike, James Franco; displays his inner anger at one of the film's final cataclysmic scenes as he proves he isn't just a pretty face. As for Tobey Maguire, his hypnotic blue eyes are enough at stating a stellar casting choice for our Peter Parker. While emitting anxiety and joyous boyhoodness while discovering his newly found powers, we can sympathize with a dorky high school nerd who is suddenly pounding his bullies and web slinging his way through the streets of New York.<br/><br/>Yet the film's greatest surprise is a scene stealing villain reminiscent of Jack Nicholson's Joker role in Burton's Batman'. Dafoe incarnates a new breed of evil as a schizophrenic scientist who evolves into the Green Goblin. Subtle humour and dark ferocity elicit a   thorough assessment from this larger than life villain who terrorizes and entices us with his demonic ways. Earlier I mentioned a duality of sorts between these two characters, those who have seen the film will understand this next analogy playing back the Thanksgiving scene in their mind. We all know Parker and Osborn are bitter enemies under the masks yet seem to have a kind relationship as their altar-egos. Yet upon the film's climax in an abandoned cemetery we can see the fate these two characters await. The duality of these two characters is unmistakably immense as we are guided through covert symbolism suggesting a grander scheme of destiny for these two characters. In a nutshell, these two characters are much more thought provoking than expected resulting in a solid two hours of masterful entertainment that is led by the characters and not the action. A solid example of this the duality of Osborn can be viewed as he encounters his innate evil in The Green Goblin. What I call the Mirror' scene displays this perfectly as Osborn falls prey to his own evil. Without giving too much away, Raimi is on the ball as he delivers a fun, entertaining and satisfying Spider-Man' film that will have them in droves at your multiplex. On a final note, make sure to stick around for the end credits as true Spidey Fans get a nostalgic treat during the final moments.<br/><br/>Giancarlo's Rating: ***"

It shows that a well written and well acted movie can make even the most implausible ideas a reality. I was disappointed to hear other ""fans"" panning the movie for not staying completely and utterly true to the comics. I have news for those people; if you want to see the comics, go buy one in the store. This is not two dimensional characters with word balloons over their mouths. These are living breathing people with thoughts and emotions in the realm of make-believe. No, it was not a radioactive spider. No, it was organic webshooters, and no, it is not the exact replica of the comics.

"eaglebtc00","9","0","0","3 May 2002"," Spiderrific!
","I thoroughly enjoyed this film!  This is the best film based on a comic strip character since Batman and Superman!  I was really anticipating it since the delays caused by the fall of the Twin Towers (which required some editing in the film, since they were prominently featured in some ""swinging"" shots and in the first trailer).  I must say the wait was worth it, but I would not have minded seeing the towers.  In fact, the WTC towers were used to catch some baddies in a helicopter (in the trailer) so I don't see how that is so devastating to the families and friends in NYC.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was excellent!  Character development is good throughout. I would like to have seen Spidey do something about M-J's abusive parents, but that would require a whole new (sub-)subplot.<br/><br/>I could tell in a few spots where some computer graphics work was done--for example, in the beginning of the film, Peter is leaping from rooftop to rooftop.  Here, the shadow looks *good* but still a little suspect.  It's fairly obvious they used a blue/green screen for this segment, especially when he leaps higher, closest to the camera's POV.<br/><br/>A few of the medical / scientific terms and explanations in the beginning of the film were slightly awkward (and possibly incorrect?)<br/><br/>Another thing; what about Willem Dafoe talking to the mirror?  His real-life jaw is moving, though the mirror image is talking to him, and not the other way around.  Does he have split-personality? Is he schizophrenic?  I wasn't quite sure if it was just voices/hallucinations, or a willful split-pers disorder.  They did say the green goblin formula would make the test subject insane, so I guess that covers it sufficiently.<br/><br/>GO SPIDEY!"

","I did have great expectations for Spiderman, ever since I saw the original trailer (with the twin towers); also because Spiderman has always been my favorite comic hero.  However, I feared that it would have some cheesy faults like other comic-movies (X-men, Captain America).  Surprisingly enough, director Sam Raimi did an excellent job of casting the roles and following the comic so well.  The only faults were how Spidey emmits his webs, the Gwen Stacy character being omitted, and that Oswald actually turned into a goblin creature, not wearing a costume.  But those few errors definitly did not stand in the way of my feelings for the film.  The Green Gobliin costume was actually very 21 century-like and updated the story. Also, I liked the fact that it wasn't JUST action; there was actually a story.  I thought Macho Man Randy Savage had a nice cameo as Bonesaw, as well as Bruce 'don't call me Ash' Campbell's role as the ring announcer. I normally don't do this, but since it was so well done and true to the classic comic, Spiderman gets a full 10!"

","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man ranks up there between Richard Donner's Superman and Tim Burton's Batman. What sets it apart from other superhero movies is it's heart. Raimi was a smart choice to direct because of his love for this character and his determination to make it more than just a two dimensional action movie. Spider-Man, (created in 1962 by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko) was the first comic book hero to have real problems and the movie centers that around all the action. He worrys about money, dates, and all the problems a normal teenager suffers, which is why the characters popularity rivals that of Superman or Batman. When Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire who was the right choice) becomes Spider-Man he uses his new found powers not to fight evil, but to make money. After being stiffed by the promoter of a wrestling match, he heads toward the elevator at the same moment a crook is running down the hall chased by a cop yelling at Peter to stop him..He does not, thinking it's not his problem. That same crook would then go on and kill his beloved Uncle Ben in a carjacking incident. Peter is beside himself with guilt knowing he could have stopped the crook, but did'nt. The movie then moves in a very fast pace which is typical of Raimi's movies, The action scenes are exciting to watch from the battles with Spider and the Green Goblin.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe is one of the best onscreen comic book villians since Jack Nicholson's Joker, his scenes alone are worth the price of admission, Kirsten Dunst also does a good job as Peter's love interest as Mary Jane Watson. The one problem I do have with the movie is the Green Goblin costume, It looks like something out of Power Rangers!! J.K. Simmons small part as Daily Bugle publisher J.Jonah Jameson is also hilarious. Spider-Man delivers big time!!"

","having been an avid spider-man reader in my younger days, i was looking forward to the theatrical adaptation ever since i heard it was in the making. i wasnt expecting much, i did not want to get my hopes up too high only to be let down. when i heard toby maguire was to play spidey i was apprehensive, i liked the idea of him as peter parker, but spider-man? when i heard kirsten dunst was to play mary jane watson i cursed from anger over what i thought was a bad casting decision. having seen the movie as earliest as i could i can honestly say i was wrong, and the movie was very entertaining. maguire was perfect as both teenage peter parker and wisecracking spider-man. and dunst was surprisingly good as mary jane (i just couldnt see it in the trailers). the plot is admittedly simple and not in depth in the least, but thats okay, as long as the movie is strong enough in other areas, and it is. character development is fairly strong throughout, especially with peter parker and mary jane. alot of emotions are expressed and dealt with, its not all flash and glitter. norman osborne (aka green goblin) isnt developed as much as one would hope, but he plays it very well, especially in scenes where hes losing his sanity. i had issues about the revamped metallic green goblin suit, i just didnt like it before, and im not crazy about it now, but that can be overlooked in the long run. the supporting cast was pretty goood, especially j jonah jameson, he nailed down the comic book spirit. the special effects are mostly well done. some scenes had me bubbling with excitement over how exact spider-mans moves matched the classic comic book poses. i loved the touches. at times the effects looked like digital effects, but what do you expect? this is not a movie to critique on believability (is that a word?). is this a perfect movie? nope, but for what it is, its very well made with nice touches of humanity added to the characters. and thats refreshing in this genre of film. is this an entertaining movie befitting the web slinger we all love?

The biggest changes I saw (possible spoilers, but not bad) were that, one, Peter Parker now has glands that he spins webs from, (as opposed  to inventing the web slingers and haveing to worry about runing out of web) and two, the spider was a genetically engineered spider.  No radiation or anything like that, just mankind trying to play god :-0 That said, the special effects were slightly obvious, lots of Matrix-esque look (espically the webing across the city scenes and when he's jumping from building to building.) Now for the good parts!  DaFoe is simply awesome as the goblin, espically one particular scene where Norman and Goblin are talking with each other in the mirror.  too bad we didn't get to see his face while he taunted spidey. I was anything but disappointed in the casting in this movie, though some of the lines do have a, shall we say, Comic book feel?<br/><br/>ok, I'll stop punning now."

","Jameson was well cast, Simmons did an excellent job.  The web slinging scenes in Gotham make it a must to see on the big screen.  I gave it an 8, upped a bit because it's spidey and well done, lowered somewhat because there was too much chick flick crap for a Marvel Comic big screen event, but only just."

","I was actually rather impressed with this movie.  Despite my misgivings of Kirsten Dunst playing MJ, I was pleasantly surprised.  Not only did they do a pretty good job casting the various characters, there was also some awesome eye candy included that I was definitely happy to see.  The CG was seemless in most scenes and very nonintrusive in others.  Tobey Maguire, though not as sarcastic as the comic book Spider-Man, was, nonetheless, a good choice for the part.  His expressions lent so much to the character that I could actually believe that it was Peter Parker.  Overall, I'd call this movie fun for the whole family."
"emc2f","Null","0","0","3 May 2002"," Excellent escape from reality
","Yep, I'm a former comic book nerd. Yes, I read Spider-Man and countless other Marvel Comics. Yes, I thought the movie was freakin' awesome! I can hear other people now: ""They used too many computer effects,"" ""That's not the way Spider-Man is in the comics,"" and other worthless statements designed to bring down the movie. Remember this people: MOVIES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FUN! I hate when people bash movies because the plot was bad, or the camera work was awful, because the point of movies is to watch them and escape from the real world for a while. You are supposed to identify with the characters as they go through their struggles, and this movie does that extremely well in its serious manner. No, wisecracks were not heard from Spider-Man, because this film is more serious than the cocky kid in the comics. Because this film is about struggles, and how we mature into the people we're supposed to be.<br/><br/>That said, I can get to the real meat and potatoes.  In my opinion, Tobey Maguire is the only person that could have pulled off both the geeky Peter Parker and the super-slick web-slinger  the way this film demands. I would not believe someone like Ben Affleck as Peter, because most other actors considered don't have the soul in their acting that Tobey does. Nor would I have believed another actress could play Mary Jane Watson as well as Kirsten Dunst. Any other redheads (Alyson Hannigan of Buffy fame comes to mind, for one) just wouldn't have been as good as showing emotion and making the part so believable. Yeah, anyone can scream, but it's the small scenes between the action that give this movie its good marks, and the actors selected did their jobs better than anyone else that I can imagine in those roles.<br/><br/>Yes, there is some humor in this serious flick. The typecasting of J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson was an extremely good choice. I could not stop laughing during these scenes, because they both portray the comic character so well and provide the needed breaks in seriousness. Every movie needs a little humor, and the few scenes Simmons did saw him stealing the show.<br/><br/>OK, so maybe you're skeptical. No, the plot wasn't straight out of the comic books. It wasn't supposed to be. Yes, they modified the story. But would you believe a high school science could make a web fluid from common materials that surpasses even our industrial technology forty years after the comic was written? No, don't delude yourself. And don't bash the movie because it may not live up to your expectations. It satisfies its purpose: it reaches the audience emotionally and teaches them a certain point: ""With great power comes great responsibility."""

","I admit to having only known the barest of details about the Spider-Man story before going into the theater, but I found myself drawn deeply into caring about the characters, even unexpected ones. I had been skeptical about Maguire, but he turned out to be completely perfect for the part, and Dunst was wonderful and muted at the same time. Kudos to Franco, as well, for making me really feel sorry about his character. It's rare to find yourself really caring about an aimless rich kid who's taking the hero's girl. :) Dafoe had a moment here or there, but I mostly found his performance lacking true pizzazz. Perhaps it was the comic-book dialogue that he had with his floor-to-ceiling mirror. In any case, there was very little wit in his performance, and he didn't really appear to be enjoying himself, just functioning as the requisite bad guy. All of the Peter Parker ""real-life"" stuff was well-written and wonderful. Loved the WWF sequence, and found the ending sequence bittersweet. I figured out what he was going to do about 30 seconds before he did it, which made the scene turn into a twist in my chest. They set up every domino for an awesome sequel. Computer animation sequences for Spider-Man sometimes left something to be desired, but Maguire's enthusiasm for the part made the live-action sequences a joy to behold. Mmmmm. I went into this film expecting some light superhero fun, some witty lines, a pretty girl and man in a spandex suit, and general SFX fluff-and-magic. It did have all those things, but on a very human level, it also had a great deal of weight and interaction that made the whole thing ring true from the bottom up. Great story!"

","This movie is in every way an average movie. The only thing done well is the casting of Tobey Macquire as Spiderman. He is excellent for the role and acts decently. The special effects are also decent. The one major flaw is the prolonged sappy scenes of Spiderman with MJ or his aunt and uncle. The movie would have been much better off without those sequences. The movie is overall very creative and fun."

","Sam Raimi and company have captured the essence of The Amazing Spider-Man comic I grew up with.  Everything was spot on and I haven't quit smiling from the time the opening credits rolled.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire was Peter Parker for me.  Everything was there:  the dorkiness, the shyness, and even the goofy one-liners (as Spider-Man) that were so prolific in the comic.  His longing for Mary Jane, who is always just out of reach, really took me back to the comics heyday.  Peter Parker has always been the character most teens who read comics felt in touch with because he had so many of the same problem as the rest of us, and again, it was laid out beautifully before my eyes today.<br/><br/>The relationship between Peter and the Osborns was laid out perfectly as well.  It was pretty much as a remember it from the comic and was done as well as could be while being crammed into a two hour movie.  Harry and Norman Osborn played a huge role in Parker's life throughout much of the comics history, so it's only fitting that they should be do predominant is the film.<br/><br/>As well, I was surprisingly touched by Uncle Ben and Aunt May who are such an essential part of who Peter Parker is.  Sam Raimi paid attention to character in this movie and it pays off in spades.<br/><br/>My thanks to all who were involved in the film for making me feel like a kid again."

Some may interpret that as cheesy, but i think in the context of a comic book movie, it was completely appropriate, and not at all poorly done.

"kirkster42","6","0","0","3 May 2002"," Good At Times, Bad At Times!
","All in all, I enjoyed the motion picture version of Spiderman.  It is good summer entertainment that is sure to dominate the box office  (at least until Episode II, Men In Black II, Minority Report, Goldmember, etc. are released).  Nonetheless, I have several complaints.  First, the filmmakers relied too much on special efx for the fight sequences.  Obviously, when Spiderman swings from skyscrapers special efx are completely necessary, and I have no problem with this.  But the scenes of Spiderman kicking anus on bad guys should be filmed with martial arts experts.  It would make them look much cooler in my opinion.  Besides, it would not be hard to put a Jet Li type under the costume.  In addition, maybe this is just me but I am sick of all action films trying to imitate The Matrix.  If I see another slow motion, back bending hero dodge bullets (or whatever) I think I'm going to throw-up.  Anyway, my second major complaint is the cheesiness of the dialogue.  The scenes between Mary Jane & Peter Parker are so slow and drawn out that their often painful.  Hint to the filmmakers: Don't force the sentimentality on the audience, it's not effective.  Pearl Harbor proved this last summer.  Also, the scene with the New Yorkers attacking the Green Goblin in defense of Spiderman is ridiculous.  I'm guessing the filmmakers completely reworked that scene after September 11 to show their support for New York.  Though it's a nice gesture, it is not needed in this film. After reading this review you probably think I hated the movie since most of my comments seem negative.  While I certainly did not hate it, I would be lying if I said I was not disappointed with Spiderman.  But I guess every comic book film can not be as good as the original Batman.  Not much can. Rating: 6 - 10"
"s10ace37","9","0","0","1 May 2002"," Best Comic Book Film Yet
","While I do like the film versions of X-Men, and the first of both the Batman and Superman films, I have to say that Spider-Man stands out above all the other comic based movies.  I caught a sneak preview of what I believe will be the biggest film of the year, and it delivered. Tons of fast paced explosive action, and the story is timeless, and teaches many an important lesson as well.  Tobey McGuire was a perfect choice for Peter Parker/Spider-Man, and now I can't picture anyone else in the role.  And while not as memorable as Jack Nicholson's Joker, Willem Defoe is a great Green Goblin (just wait till you hear him laugh...it'll freak you out). Sam Raimi has just made his best picture, which is hard to believe seeing as Evil Dead 2 is genius.  This is a great film that many will see over and over again, and it is DEFINETLY going to give Episode 2 a run for its money. 9 out of 10."

","I saw this movie last night at a preview, and I must say I was impressed. The acting of all the cast was good, especially William Dafoe. I must admit that I wans't quite sure about Tobey Maguire as Peter Paker, but after watching it, I cannot think of anyone who would be better suited to the role.<br/><br/>The only places where it changes the orginal comicbook story are when the comicbook is not very believable. So these changes don't harm the story in anyway, but might even make it better.<br/><br/>On the whole, I would have to say this movie is definately worth seeing, especially if you are a fan of the comic/cartoon series or just a general comic fan."

","For the first thirty minutes the movie was great, depicting the scene of the school 'geek' turn super hero learning how to use his new found powers. But I feel the so called responsibility was too much for the hero and the rest of the movie was highly predictable.  The arch enemy 'green goblin' felt like a villain from the 'power rangers' and no satisfying climax was reached.  In comparison with the first 'Batman' movie which conveyed the reality of savior and the mysterious path which the hero took was far more entertaining.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope the next installment or the spiderman meets superman spin off can take the super hero genre to the next level."

","There are multiple reasons why I do not believe that this is a very good movie:<br/><br/>1. Bad acting:  Honestly, the acting in this was quite sub-par.  They should have spent less time on digital backdrops and special effects and more time on teaching the actors how to act.<br/><br/>2. Too mushy: Spiderman is an action character.  This movie is based around love and mushy stuff, which is much different from the comics.<br/><br/>3. Bad acting in the mushy scenes:  The mushy scenes might have been alright if the actors had learned how to portray love a bit better.  They act awkward gradeschoolers in some parts. The ending fits this description well, in my opinion.<br/><br/>4. Copies other movie styles:  I thought it was a bit annoying how in a few scenes they used ""The matrix""-type sequences.  But that's just me.<br/><br/>Oh well...  It's too bad it turned out the way it did; it seems as if they could have spent a bit more time on it.

"sweetnlowdown2","1","3","8","7 May 2002"," Spider-Man: A Web Of Garbage?
","First I feel it's only fair that I start my review off by saying that I usually dislike the American public's taste in movies. I personally feel they are attracted to garbage. 9\10 whenever I know the American public gets beind a movie, I usually expect the worst. ""Spider-Man"" is a moronic, juvenile, tasteless, poorly acted excuse for a movie. Know, yes, yes I know people are going to say well, it's just a good ""popcorn flick"". It's a guilty pleasure. Okay, I can understand that way of thinking, but, ""Spider-Man"" isn't even a good ""popcorn flick"". I have guilty pleasures too. I like ""teen"" movies. I like films like ""Scream"", ""Can't Hardly Wait"", ""I Know What You Did Last Summer""...ect. But, there's a line that has to be drawn to seperate good and bad films. And ""Spider-Man"" is one of the year's worst films! I don't think I can fully express my sheer hatred for this movie. Is\was this movie actually worth all the attention it's getting? Absolutely not! There have been so many great films made over the years and this is the film that breaks all records! ""Spider-Man""! What does that say about us? Nothing good, I'll tell you that right now! I'm not really a fan of Tobey Maguie, though, I do admit he has been in some good films, ""The Ice Storm"", Woody Allen's ""Deconstructing Harry"", & ""Wonder Boys"". But, in this film, Maguire, is life-less. His performance is awful. He just seems to drone on & on. People who say he gave a good performance have no clue as to what they are talking about. He does a really bad job. Next Kirsten Dunst. Now, I have a lot of admiration of Dunst. I think she is a very good actress. She has a presence to her that reminds me of something that older actresses have had. She seems to make the screen come alive with her ""sunny disposition"". Here however, is another story. Not even she turns in a good performance. I don't understand how people could say the have chemistry together. THEY DON'T! William Dafoe, another great actor. One of the most under-rated actors of our time I feel, and he's bad in this too! Now, is the problem really the actors or the script. In Maguire's case, he's the problem. He didn't and still doesn't seem to me to be the right choice for the movie. He doesn't seem, ""heroic"" enough for the part. He doesn't seem like a ""leading man"" to me. In the case of Dunst and Dafoe, the script ruined them. Dunst doesn't have a good role. She doesn't really have anything to act with. There is nothing special about her part. I can only think that she accepted the role on two things. 1 - the pay was probably great and 2 - everyone involved probably knew this film would have mass appeal to it. The same goes for Dafoe. Another problem I had with the film was, for a movie who's budget was 139 million dollars, where did the money go? Many scenes looked cheap. Especially he scenes where we see Spider-Man fly. It looked much more impressive in ""Superman"" which was made back in 1978! I was really suprised to see how bad some scenes looked. I have many many more problem with this film, but, I won't get into it. Bottomline: ""Spider-Man"" is a tasteless, lifeless movies that stinks from beginning to end. One of the year's worst films!"

I definitely agree that it is an insult to great films everywhere that this film is on the top 200 list. I've never commented on a film before but saw that it was on the list and wondered what people are thinking when they vote. Everyone deserves a better Spidey film then this trash. I'd been waiting for a Spider-Man movie since I was about six years old, in the mid 80's, and was there on opening night. The film started off well but quickly went down hill. I almost left half way through but kept hoping it would get better. The CG effects were way over done. Film makers today treat this stuff like heroin. They start using it and can't seem stop. Enough with all the digital effects. Why don't film makers (especially George Lucas) realize half of this stuff doesn't look real at all and ruins these movies. The dialogue, story, and action were all terrible in this film. Peter Parker tells Mary Jane he'll always be there for her, and then leaves her standing alone...IN A GRAVEYARD! Why did Peter Parker turn into Bruce Wayne? I enjoy Super hero films (Batman, Superman etc)but they should still be decent flicks. This film was about as good as Batman and Robin, or the Mummy Returns. The casting of Willem Dafoe was great as the green goblin but why give him that terrible suite and what happened to his pumpkin bombs? Peter's Boss J.J sucked. Toby Maguire did a good job but is totally wrong for spider man. He's way too short to begin with. The old animated Peter Parker was way cooler. I'm a fan of Sam Raimi, and it was cool to see some Evil dead stuff in the film but Bruce Campbell's cameo was disappointing as he was almost unrecognizable. This movie didn't seem to know which way it was going. There were two or three cool scenes but over all this was the biggest film disappointment I've ever had. Couldn't they have stuck the Ramones Spider-Man theme in there somewhere? Couldn't Spider-man have mentioned his Spidey sence? Couldn't he have used a web net on someone? Was he a ninja? How come you never heard his web shoot when people looked away and then saw that he had disappeared? I wasn't expecting the cartoon but at least something as good. This movie hit the lowest point by using a Matrix rip off in a fight scene. This has been done a million times and it was insulting to see it again. Too bad this film was ever made. Kids deserve better films to grow up on. I think most Spider-man fans could have written a better screen play then this campy waste of time and money. Stay off the CG. Help is available."
"schomburg2002","1","2","5","5 May 2002"," BATMAN IS STILL BETTER
","I don't know why everyone is comparing Spider-Man to Batman.  There is a difference between Batman and Spider-Man; Batman is way better in character development, story, and motivation.<br/><br/>I will admit that Spider-Man was too much hype and not enough movie; it's just not one of those films that makes you want to go, unless you're a giant Spider-Man fan, then you're really going to be disappointed.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS* The first thing I would like to address on this film is, where is the character development in The Green Goblin?  The Green Goblin has no motivation in killing Spider-Man, so what is the sense in killing him? The only motivation I saw was The Green Goblin killing the executives of Osecorp that are trying to shut him down from the company, and he does kill them IN THE BEGINNING OF THE MOVIE!  Therefore, The Green Goblin doesn't need to be The Green Goblin anymore, but apparently he does.<br/><br/>Another loophole I noticed was the whole deal with people NOT KNOWING WHO SPIDER-MAN IS.  Come on, is New York really that stupid in not knowing who Spider-Man is? For example, in the wrestling match, the booker literally saw Peter Parker's face in his Spider-Man outfit.  Another example, when the balcony was being destroyed and Mary Jane was just laying at the edge of the falling balcony; Parker was stalking at the bottom unbuttoning his shirt and exposing his spider-man shirt with people running by him.  You would figure someone passing by would notice, but they don't.<br/><br/>Another Green Goblin FLOP I noticed, was Green Goblin didn't do anything that really had any ORIGINAL or memorable plans except for dropping a bunch of kids in a trolley and MJ at the same time, whoopie!  Damn, at least The Joker tried to kill everyone in Gotham City.<br/><br/>Other than that the movie was decent, but it is no Batman.<br/><br/>To make the comparison brief: Batman - more mysterious and more character development. Spider-Man - too many loop holes and lacking in character development.<br/><br/>The Green Goblin - no motivation, not convincing, and no real memorable plans. The Joker - memorable plans (Gassing Gotham City, Damn!) Very convincing (that he's crazy) motivation toward his plans and lots of character development.<br/><br/>So, basically what I'm saying is; if everyone is comparing Batman to Spider-Man, then they are just Spider-Man fans.  It's like comparing Xbox to Playstation 2.  You just can't beat what came out first."

After the first 45 minutes of the film, I was thinking to myself that I couldn't have spent the money any better--I was laughing at Tobey Maguire's reactions to his newfound spider-like abilities, I was getting drawn into the plot and looking forward to some action, and I even found myself rooting for Tobey Maguire who is perfectly cast as the classic and predictable high-school nerd.  But things soon took a terrible turn. The acting became terrible, the plot became completely predictable, and the special effects became so unrealistic and visually flawed that I found them at the point of distraction.  As a New Yorker, I found the city-assaults on New York by the ""Green Goblin"" not entertaining, but more of a recreation of Sept. 11th.  But then, later on in the film, I found myself annoyed at how the makers of this film, obviously influenced by September 11th, put in all these scenes with the people of New York united against evil, and Spiderman flying by all these American flags.  Is it too much to ask not to have scenes of bombs killing people, buildings being blown to bits, people running everywhere, and screams?  But then is it too much to ask not to have corny things thrown into every scene just to prove to the movie-going public that the makers of the film care more about morals than profit?  With this film I found myself smack in the middle of two extremes.  Class, simplicity, style...these elements were not used by the makers of this film.  Gaudy special effects, large explosions, and artificial and shallow love scenes were the things that made up this film.  Spidey is a young nerd one minute; a raging maniac determined for revenge the next.  Kirsten Dunst likes him one minute, and then she blows him off for a while.  The love scenes that were the only human-touches this film had were meant to be as simple, dull, and straightforward as possible, but in the end were only confusing!  I didn't even know whether I should take the time to review this film, but I hope I've helped someone.  My advice...see ""Panic Room"" instead.  It's also a big, box office smash, but is immeasurably better.  Save your time and money on this one--unless you're a parent of smaller kids or under the age of 16."

","Peter Parker is a dorky kid going through adolescent changes.  However in his case they are changes brought on by a bite from a genetically enhanced spider.  In a difficult lesson Peter learns that his gifts bring him responsibility.  Meanwhile the father of Peter's friend, Norman Osborn is developing a hover platform and strength enhancers for the military.  When he faces losing the contract he takes the treatment himself  creating the Green Goblin, who wrecks havoc on the city  with only Spiderman able to stop him.<br/><br/>With some comic adaptations the end results have been disappointing (The Punisher, most of the Batman films etc), however here this is one of recent successes including X-Men.  It may well make changes to the original legend but it's really only things that'll annoy geeks who spend too much time on the internet arguing over whether Iron Man could beat Batman in a fight! The plot has enough to it to distract.  The creation of both Spiderman and the Green Goblin are enjoyable over the first half.  Peter's `experimentations' in his bedroom can be taken any way you want it!  However when the Goblin and Spiderman being to battle it is nice and simple  there's no plot to take over the city, no plan to freeze the world or any silliness like that, it's a simple battle between a good guy and a baddie.<br/><br/>In many bits the effects are surprisingly poor  not as bad as I thought they might be, but still bad.  There are many bits where the computer characters don't look real  not just in terms of their movement but more in terms of their looks, in places it doesn't even look as good as the computer game.  Having said that, for most they blend effects and live action together well.  The Goblin's suit doesn't match the comic and it looks a bit like something out of the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, but they use it well although one scene with him does look like something out of Godzilla!<br/><br/>The cast are actually what makes the film.  Maguire makes a good Spiderman  he's a goofy looking kid and a good actor.  He doesn't have Spiderman's one-liners but he makes a good character, even when he's behind the mask he manages to bring a certain amount of humanity to the role.  Dafoe ran the risk of losing credibility by being a serious actor who goes for the money and get dressed up in a monster suit for a FX movie!  However he is actually really good  you almost forget how silly it could have been.  There are some really good scenes where he's facing his alter ego and it could have been daft but he carries it off  shows what a good actor he is.  Dunst is good  she really isn't much more than a Louis Lane character but she is good and her character has a good background.  My favourite character is J. Jonah Jameson  he's exactly like he's meant to be and is very funny in a hyper sort of way!  The actor who plays him (J.K. Simmons) is probably best known for his role in Oz, the HBO series.  If you know him in that, then it's weird to see the actor who plays, well, basically the Devil, playing this type of thing  but hats off, he's really good and looks just like the comic book.  The support cast has some famous faces  like Bill Nunn, Ted Rami and a few others, and it's nice to see Rami's favourite actor Bruce Campbell in a small role.<br/><br/>Overall I must admit I expected to be let down but, apart from dodgy effects this is a good summer movie.  Plenty of good action and fun but also good performances all round.  The only problem I see is that half this film was filled up with creating the characters  what will part 2 do to fill that time?"
"dbdumonteil","9","3","11","22 December 2004"," A major return to form for Sam Raimi after the disappointing ""the Gift"" (2000)
","Adaptations of comics for the screen have become one of Hollywood's main specialties. So far, most of super-heroes for their transition to the screen were entitled to a reliable film-maker and not to a director of musical video clips. Thus, Tim Burton shot ""Batman"" in 1989 while Bryan Singer amazed with his movie ""X-Men"" (2000). Here, it is Sam Raimi who decided to adapt the adventures of Spider-Man; a plan he surely undertook with joy. Indeed, this iconoclastic film-maker is an avid fan of the comic strip. So, he seemed to be cut out more than anyone else for the film. A surprise: his work doesn't disappoint and maintains itself high above the expectations and is incredibly exhilarating. The movie has been a (largely deserved) triumphant success and for Sam Raimi it was his long-awaited commercial breakthrough. Maybe it wasn't such a bad thing for him to have moved in the Hollywood mainstream.<br/><br/>Why is ""Spider-Man"" so successful? Simply because Raimi hired a winning team at all levels. First, Raimi's making reflects the enthusiasm he felt to shot his movie. Full of energy, liveliness, it doesn't leave a minute's rest to the spectator. We are carried away by the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man with a lot of frenzy and happiness. It is useful to note down that at the end of the projection, you feel so happy that you ask for more! To come back to Raimi's making, there's a perfect marriage between impressive action sequences and the interesting psychological portrait Raimi makes of his main character. On another hand, the indispensable amounts of humor and emotion haven't been forgotten.<br/><br/>Congratulations to the scriptwriter David Koepp. Why didn't he get an Oscar for his work? He has written a watertight screenplay which is flawless. It does everything to remain faithful to the original comic strip. More important, Koepp conceived his script, mainly as a kind of apprenticeship. Peter Parker will test the extent of his powers (first against one of his rivals in his high school, then during a wrestling fight) before putting his red and blue suit on and facing violence in New York and eventually the Green Buffoon (Im not sure if it's the right name).<br/><br/>A brilliant screenplay wouldn't be anything without a suitable cast. It is of an impeccable quality. Thanks to ""Spider-Man"" Tobey McGuire probably finds the role of his life. At last a role at the extent of his talent. Beside him, Kirsten Dunst has such an appealing charm that it is difficult to resist her. Willem Dafoe is just amazing in his role of wicked. As for JK Simmons, he may have a short role but each of his apparitions is a delight so much that he nearly steals the show to the other actors.<br/><br/>But special effects aren't always subtle or sometimes a little too intrusive and David Koepp has forgotten to remove a few clichés about his main character, notably at the beginning of the film. But fortunately, they are tiny details and if we ignore them, ""Spider-Man"" appears as a blockbuster whose homogeneity is impressive. It satisfies both the fans of the comic strip but also movie lovers. Raimi's masterpiece lasts about two hours. Not a minute is too much in it. You can't refuse such an exciting show like this one. The second part of the adventures of Spider-Man was launched in the summer 2004 with the same crew and was equally successful as the first one. As we say: we don't change a winning team.<br/><br/>Well done Mr Raimi!"

She dated Harry, she kissed Spider-Man and she kissed peter, not knowing that the last two were the same person. Also she literally always needed saving. In the other spider man movies with Tom Holland mj was actually smart. The writing in the script was terrible. It also bugged me how they made the origin story all about a girl who can't stand up for her self. As a girl I found her annoyingly stereotypical. Like when green goblin threw the bomb and she was on the part of the roof that was falling off, at first it would have been so easy to run off it but nooooooo she needs Spider-Man to come and save her. Also the fight scenes had the worst sound effects I have ever heard. Also when uncle Ben died and he let the robber escape and Peter saw who he was, they had to flash back to that moment as if we hadn't figured it out by then. Also when he made his second costume it was like he just randomly got better at sewing. Like he went from a red ski mask and a hoodie to a super suit. Like why did he suddenly be able to sew crazy well. I liked hoe in the other movies he had to make his own webs. I feel like the Spider-Man in this one was just not all that smart. He knew tons of random stuff, but he was just really weird."

Now keep in mind this isn't the most comic accurate representation of spidey as... well... he shoots webs out his body (and nowadays people are mad that he didn't make his suit) but keep in mind this is 2002 we're talking about. William Dafoe is incredible here and i love the Goblin as the villain (though not the costume, that was real bad). Great story in general that sets up the other movies and very enjoyable fight scenes! Such a fun movie, and a great start for this great character on the big screen. I'm giving this an 8/10 and not a 9 mostly because the effects have aged badly and the movie is not perfect. Still it remains one of my favourites from my childhood! Also JK Simmons as JJJ is a match made in heaven!"
"aidanratesmovies","8","1","2","7 April 2020"," Imperfect, but a entertaining ride
","Though at times it can seem very silly, Spider-Man is a magnificently entertaining superhero film that may not get all the parts right, but is certainly an enjoyable ride. The acting throughout can truly vary, with the best actors also seeming like the worst actors throughout. It seems the direction and/or the writing can have some effect on the actors performances, but even so they try so hard with what is given to them. Sam Raimi's directing style, I must admit, seems like an odd choice for the film, but proves to be as an entertaining ride as Evil Dead II without nearly as much insanity. Willem Dafoe I would say provides the best performance as the villain Green Goblin, although at times he may seem like he is overdoing it a bit. As for Spider-Man himself, Tobey Maguire seems to mostly do an adequate job of portraying the character, but at times can feel a bit stiff, and others a bit too much. That being said, when the moment calls for it, and everything aligns just right, Maguire provides a very good performance needed for a true moment to shine, which made him just alright in my book. The pacing is quite good, I never truly felt bored, even with the subpar writing. That being said, there are some things in the film that may make you roll your eyes, but also many things that may make you smile. The sheer sense of energy and hope in the film is enough to satisfy any superhero fan and the film truly wouldn't be complete without it. In the end, Spider-Man could have been a lot worse than what it was, but thanks its great entertainment factor and some hopeful moments, it shines better than its worse moments.

","I'm extremely loyal to the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man series. In my opinion, there are no other acceptable versions, and I'd never even consider watching the subsequent remakes. Tobey is the perfect Peter Parker, and the movies are treated with such care and respect, they don't feel like traditional comic book movies at all.<br/><br/>The first one is the origin story, and who doesn't love the first in a series when everything is explained and introduced? Tobey is the unpopular, shy high schooler who has a crush on the girl next door and lives with his aunt and uncle. Mary Jane, the beautiful heroine, is played by Kirsten Dunst, and while she famously dyed her locks red for the subsequent movies, she wears a wig in the first one. I prefer the shiny, lustrous wig since it's more vibrant and attention-grabbing. Rosemary Harris may retain her role as Aunt May in all three movies, but Cliff Robertson gets to deliver the immortal line, ""With great power comes great responsibility."" Everyone in this movie is memorable and important, and if you grew up watching this franchise in the theaters, your loyalty probably lies with them. J.K. Simmons seems like he crawled off the comic pages as the hard-boiled newspaper editor with hilarious one-liners. Who else can play the father-son Osborns but Willem Dafoe and James Franco, a pair of actors capable of being incredibly likable with a darker edge beneath the surface? Who else can endear himself as an unlikely hero who tries to atone and clean up crime in the big, bad city but Tobey Maguire and his innocent, expressive eyes?<br/><br/>Obviously, the Spider-Man movies are going to have great special effects and thrilling action sequences. Whether he's battling the Green Goblin or merely testing out his new flying powers, you're in for a great, fun ride.<br/><br/>DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Spider-Man flies, there are some swift camera movements that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!"""

","SPOILER: 
Spiderman (Tobey Maguire)
I have recently just watched the movie ""Spiderman"" and I have to say that I should have trusted my senses. Before watching this movie, spider man was made out to be a comedic super hero in the Marvel Multiverse. I can say that I was disappointed at the fact that it wasn't as comedic as the comics made it out to be.
Spiderman, A super human that developed spider like abilities i.e. Climbing, Webs, Etc... But there are some things that the Spiderman movie got wrong. With his Blue and red ""Suit"" how is he able to climb the walls when the ""things"" that grew out of his hands are now covered. I understand that this is a long shot but the scene where Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) lets the robber get away, this then leads to the robber killing uncle ben, but however his ""Spider Senses"" can detect the littlest things that could go wrong but could not feel anything bad happening when he lets the robber get away?
Alright, all I have been doing in this review is ripping the film apart but all things aside, the story line/plot was a good idea. Nerd boy gets bitten, finds out he is superhuman, his friend dates the girl he likes, said friend screws things up with said girl, said girl and Spiderman have a connection, said girl also has feelings for Spiderman's alter ego, peter turns girl down to save her, roll credits. Pretty standard, but the way the portrayed it was alright, it wasn't good, but it wasn't bad. 
The acting though. Tobey Maguire casted to play a comedic hero but fails to do so, I mean he has his moments but over all his performance id give it 6/10. Kirsten Dunst casted as Mary Jane. Mary Jane was actually really plain. It didn't seem like she could play a character with a sophisticated background and part in the movie. Sophisticated? Yes, we see throughout the movie she is miserable and unable to hold a steady relationship. Not to mention the screaming match her and her father get into, not really a healthy home life and her mother? Where is she? So over all Kirsten Dunst, only a 4/10.
James franco plays the role of Harry Osborn, the bestfriend of Peter Parker. This character interested me. Finding out that Himself and his best friend both have the love interest, then taking the girl and screwing things up all because of his father, really just a stupid situation to be in. Then he is betrayed by Peter when he sees Peter and Mary Jane share an intimate moment, not only this but not even knowing how his father died, also Peters fault or ""Spiderman's"". Probably the best acting out of the bunch, with a ratin of 7/10.
This movie overall was pretty average for a ""Superhero"" movie. 
6/10 Rating"
"Mr-Fusion","7","1","2","17 May 2017"," A worthy adaptation
","Part of appreciating Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" is understanding its role in the Hollywood superhero boom of the last fifteen years. But on its own terms, what it really does right is the balance between morality and superpowers; the give-and-take of Peter Parker's crushing burden and those thrilling scenes of swinging through the city. That's what really stands out to me today (that, and J.K. Simmon's pitch-perfect casting as J. Jonah Jameson, who owns every one of his scenes). Not all of it works - the story is a bit drawn out and the dialogue scenes between Maguire and Dunst are marshmallowy soft - but it's a perfectly decent treatment of Spidey.<br/><br/>And these days, I still watch it with the firmly-imprinted memory of its success in 2002. The genre landscape was entirely different back then, and a Spider-Man movie wasn't a sure thing. Raimi was a genuine surprise as director, but he produced a film that retained the vibrancy of its source material and populated it with grounded characters. And the timing really helped; it ended up being an anthem for a post-9/11 New York.<br/><br/>In other words, it was a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>7/10"
"dlantz-58368","8","1","2","23 February 2017"," A Great Movie
","Spider-Man is a 2002 American superhero film directed by Sam Raimi. it is based on the Marvel comics character of the same name. The film stars Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker. Spider man is about a high school student who develops spider-like super powers. at around the same time as he obtains these powers, his uncle is killed by a common thug. Peter Parker is devastated and leads him to hate all forms of crime. this is what makes him become spider-man. at first, Peter Parker just goes after low level crime. we see him in a montage stopping several crimes and gaining popularity in New York City. this all changes however, when Spider-man meets the green goblin, played by Willem Dafoe. They fight several times in the movie, and their final fight is by far the best. The movie ends with Peter Parker continuing to hide his identity so that he can continue to fight crime. Overall, i would say that this movie is Very good. i don't believe that it's as good as Spider-man 2, but it showed just how great spider-man can work on the big screen. Tobey Maguire as Spider-man was a great choice in my opinion. i really like how he was able to make Peter Parker look weak in the beginning, and make him look strong later in the movie. one thing i didn't like was the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane. it never really felt real to me. i think the actors did great, but i think they needed better writing. In Conclusion, Spider-man is definitely a movie i recommend."
"Leofwine_draca","7","1","2","29 December 2016"," Comic book adaptation is huge fun thanks to Raimi
","As much as I am loathe to admit it, CGI effects have been getting better and better in recent years. Not always are they just silly cartoon imagery which looks out of place. And they're mainly responsible for the resurgence in superhero/comic book movies that wouldn't have been possible ten years ago - films like BLADE and X-MEN which rely on CGI effects throughout. SPIDER-MAN is the latest in a long line of comic book heroes being adapted for the big screen, and it isn't half bad. Hardly Sam Raimi's best movie but a thoroughly entertaining popcorn flick which is surprising in that it offers up a fairly adult version of the story with an interesting back story to set up the major characters and an emphasis on character development instead of mindless action. That's not to say the film is without action, but the various set pieces are made to count and not just overdone as they so could easily have been.<br/><br/>Most of the elements that make up this film are good rather than brilliant, but the combination is pretty flawless. Obviously the superhero story has been done before but Raimi offers enough originality (along with a few spots of his previous craziness in the zooming skulls and spiders in the first transformations) and vitality into his film to make it feel fresh and exciting. The script is intelligent and offers up strong, likable characters with believable motivations; even the villain is a schizophrenic more to be pitied than hated. The music by Danny Elfman is rather unnoticeable but the film makes up for this with good camera-work and excellently staged scenes of action - the wrestling ring fight, the cliffhanger bridge ending, the carnival disaster are all excellent examples of the fantasy action genre at its finest, offering up explosive thrills and hard-hitting violence. This is a film where the punches count.<br/><br/>The CGI effects are blended nicely into the action and for the most part are pretty good, only looking shoddy a couple of times. As for the actors, Tobey Maguire makes a decent and respectable hero and even though his character development from nerdy geek to romantic lead is rather clichéd, he makes a good fist of it - congratulations to the boy. Willem Dafoe is all hamminess in the role of the Green Goblin, the film's hoverboard-riding villain, and is great as always, especially with that infectious laugh of his. Kirsten Dunst gets a fair amount of screen time as the love interest and even though her character is fairly useless at least she looks good in the part. Special mention goes to James Franco as Dafoe's brooding son Harry, who also happens to be Spidey's best mate. Watch out for the parade of cameo appearances which include Raimi cohorts Lucy Lawless as a punk, Bruce Campbell as the overbearing ring announcer, and Ted Raimi as a newspaper man. Probably the most bizarre appearance goes to porn star Robert Kerman as the boat captain - this is of course the same guy who played Professor Monroe in CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. Sadly he doesn't get to say ""I wonder who the real Spider-Man is?""."
"MaximumMadness","9","1","2","17 September 2016"," Perhaps quaint by today's standards, the timelessness and whimsy of ""Spider-Man"" help it excel. It still stands as one of the most important comic-book movies ever made.
","It's hard to believe it's been so long since director Sam Raimi reintroduced the beloved character of Spider-Man to film-goers with one of 2002's biggest releases. It truly was a magical time, and ""Spider- Man"" was very much to thank for this. Critically lauded and adored by the public, it was not only the first film to gross over $100 million in its opening weekend, but it was also the next big step in comic- book adaptations, ushering the public closer to understanding just how important comic books were and how much potential there was to make high-quality films inspired by these modern day myths. Films like ""Blade"" and ""X-Men"" were for sure the important first steps towards this, but it was ""Spider-Man"" that delivered on this promise, with its impact still being felt to this very day thanks to the rise of franchises like the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>Yes, it is hard to believe how long it's been. Heck, the movie itself would now be old enough to be in High School just like Peter were it a person.<br/><br/>Peter Parker (Tobey Macguire) is a nerdy high school student pining after his crush Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and dodging bullies with his best friend Harry. (James Franco) However, a school trip leads Parker towards a new and heroic life when a genetically-engineered ""Super-Spider"" bites him, granting him superhuman abilities. After the tragic death of his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), Peter chooses to use these abilities to protect the innocent, becoming the super-hero ""Spider-Man."" However, when Harry's father Norman Osbourne (Willem Dafoe) is similarly gifted superhuman abilities in a tragic accident and becomes the dreaded supervillain ""Green Goblin"", Peter will be torn as he will be forced to combat not only the father of his best friend, but a man he has come to greatly respect.<br/><br/>Part of the great appeal is the lush and exquisite style injected into it thanks to the playful and thoughtful direction courtesy Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp's strangely old- fashioned yet appealing writing. The duo form a perfect union to tell the tale. Raimi- at the time best known as director of low-budget horror/comedies like the wonderful ""Evil Dead"" trilogy and quirky studio projects like ""A Simple Plan""- has a unique visual voice that lent itself well to the character. Himself a fan of Spidey's earlier comic-book adventures, Raimi is perhaps one of the few directors who was truly able to paint a film that felt like a comic come to life. With his wild and exotic camera-work, a fantastic sense of scope and color, and a sense of quirky ""fun"", it's just a wonder to behold, with such a magical and whimsical feel.<br/><br/>Koepp's script is also a great deal of fun. As I said, it has an almost old-fashioned tone. It almost feels more akin to classics like Donner's ""Superman"" or Burton's ""Batman"" in terms of structure and dialog, with everything just slightly ""off"" of feeling modern, but in an appealing way. It gives the film a sense of timelessness. It doesn't feel a product of its time... it feels like the sort of film that could have been made at any time- the 70's, 80's, 90's... even now. And it's a big part of what helps maintain the film's freshness. As much as I enjoyed the 2012 reboot, it very much was the product of its time, and I find it feels more dated than this take on the character despite being much younger a film.<br/><br/>The cast is phenomenal, and are also a major contributor to its high quality. For many, Maguire defined the character. He nails just the right tone as Peter Parker, playing him as the sort-of archetypal underdog you can't help but root for thanks to his kind heart and depth of character. He also made for a great web-slinger, though I will admit the humor and banter was lacking. Dunst is just a lovable female lead, even when the film doesn't go out of its way to give her much development or depth. (Though this film is very much Peter's tale, so I can forgive a somewhat cliché love interest.) Franco is a ton of fun and the seeds are planted for the future development of the character. Dafoe is just wonderful, nailing the perfect balance between flawed but good- natured father-figure and scenery-chewing madman from scene to scene. Robertson is a joy as Uncle Ben. And supporting roles like the fabulous Rosemary Harris as Aunt May are fantastic.<br/><br/>Compounding this is an absolutely magnificent score by Danny Elfman. A legend in the field, Elfman's themes help to accentuate the visuals and lend a sense of grandiose to the proceedings. It nails the right sound of just borderline melodrama mixed with grand old majestic heroics. To this day, the opening titles still give me chills, and I still associate any depiction of Spider-Man with his themes in my mind.<br/><br/>All of this praise being said, I can't help but admit the film has some flaws, which is where it does lose a point for me. Despite his structuring and sensibilities being great fun, Koepp's dialog is... a little too out-there. A little too manufactured, even for the quirky tone he and Raimi are going for. Some pacing problems are apparent, particularly in the first and third acts, leading to speed-up's and slow-down's that can be jarring. And even for the time, some of the effects were... sub- par. (It wasn't until about the third film that the CGI used on Spider- Man looked totally realistic.)<br/><br/>""Spider-Man"" to this day stands among the most important superhero movies of all time. And this is thanks not only to the records it broke, or to the paths it paved for future films... but also very much for its quality and grand sense of entertainment.<br/><br/>And it is most certainly worth a near-perfect 9 out of 10."

At the time there weren't very many successful superhero movies that had been released. Well that was until X-Men which had been released 2 years prior came out. Because of the success of X-Men Sony decided to finally give a superhero movie a sizable budget ($139 Million). This movie finally showed studios that you can give a very large budget to a superhero movie and have it still be successful. In fact at the time this movie was one of the most successful U.S movies ever.<br/><br/>Anyways, Now let's get on to the review by starting with a brief synopsis. Peter Parker is a smart, geeky high school student who is bullied by his fellow classmates. That is until he is bit by a radioactive spider which gives him super human strength. He then uses those powers to win money in wrestling. That is until someone close to him dies and teaches him an important lesson on responsibility. He then decides to fight crime and stop those who try to hurt others which includes the villainous Green Goblin.<br/><br/>Despite being a story almost everyone knows, It is done quite well knowing how to pace itself in terms of when to be slow and develop characters and when to get straight into the action. It's length of almost exactly 2 hours is a perfect length in which you won't feel unsatisfied or bored due to length.<br/><br/>In terms of characters and casting I think they choose almost perfect choices for everyone, Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker is a fantastic choice as Spider-Man because he always comes off as a believable nerd and sure he doesn't crack as many jokes as some may want but personally I prefer a less jokey spider-man to an overly jokey spider-man. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane could have arguably been better and possibly fend for herself more but for what the story and movie needs she's fine. James Franco as Harry Osborn is a great choice, he does the role justice and knows how to feel grief later when his father dies. Speaking of which, William Dafoe is an excellent Green Goblin, not only do I think Green Goblin was a great choice of villain for this movie being just the right skill level for early spidey to face, William Dafoe does an excellent job portraying the crazy and controlled Green Goblin/Norman Osborn.<br/><br/>The tone of this movie is just perfect, it doesn't take itself too seriously but also doesn't overdue it. It has good serious moments such as Uncle Ben's death and the final fight fight with Goblin are great examples.<br/><br/>Though I will say some of the dialogue in this movie can be quite cheesy especially from Aunt May and a good amount of bad lines from Goblin as well.<br/><br/>Then there is the action and effects. Now given that this is from 2002 some of the effects have not aged well particularly when he's jumping from building to building. The score for this movie perfectly fits the film though and still holds up today. Also the first fight with Green Goblin can be debatable described as looking like a Power Ranger's fight. Though I will say the final fight definitely makes up for this. It's grounded, more realistic, and doesn't include much shaky cam. <br/><br/>Conclusion While this movie may not have aged as well as it could, it still has great casting, good action, some truly fantastic emotional moments, and overall fun tone. While I do want to give this a 9.5 from my own enjoyment some of the problems overall bogged it down a little but still this is an overall fantastic super hero movie that I will not forget any time soon.<br/><br/>Rating<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>Fantastic"
"KineticSeoul","8","1","2","12 June 2016"," The Marvel movie that started all
","This is a superhero movie that didn't try to get all gritty, serious and full of twist and turns to make it a engaging superhero movie. Instead it's a friendly superhero movie that is just overall fun to watch. Plus there weren't many superhero movies like this, so the audiences were just blown away watching Spidey swing around New York. Yeah, the plot is generic and the CGI is outdated in today's standards but it was a great movie when it came out. I remember first seeing the trailer for this movie and was just amazed by it. Since at that time I have never seen anything like this, despite it leaning toward the cheesy side in today's standards. Spider-Man was my favorite superhero at that time. So as a kid I was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end and wanted to see it again once it was finished. I am not sure if Tobey Maguire was the best choice for the role as Peter Parker. But he played his character as a likable and nice science nerd. Although not as snappy and taunting as Spider-Man but he was believable as a nerd with the heart of gold. This movie doesn't pull much punches, but it has enough of Spider- Man in it with a story-line that for the most part follows through. Despite it not being very accurate to the comics, it does carry on the essence of Spider-Man. I even liked the theme song, despite few very cheesy scores but the theme song by Danny Elfman is spot on. Overall this is a fun and friendly superhero movie worth checking out.<br/><br/>8.4/10"

","why am i writing the 2002 review? well it is the same year the movie came out, but also because im sick of the haters, because i love this film, great music, great acting, great plot, great writing, and at times hilarious. goblin is a menacing presence and is certainly a match for spidey. the action is also very intense, loved the bridge fight which had lots of suspense as spidey had to chose between his love or saving a many young kids. no i don't have my nostalgia goggles on. in fact for some reason this film gets a lower rating almost every year. in fact it used to be much higher it just keeps going down so its like the opposite of nostalgia for the majority, so DO NOT be deceived by the haters, and a enjoy a very good film with a exponential rotten tomatoes score."

","Before this movie came out, we pretty much only had the X-men, and the Burtons Batman movies (that were good in my opinion). But as soon as this came out it showed that superhero movies can be light hearted and still make you shed a tear, pump your fists and give you those dark moments.<br/><br/>Green Goblin was great for the time. i would have love a more mutated version of him but what we got was amazing. and DeFoe doing his own stunts 95% of the time is incredible wish he would have web-shooters but the organic ones are fine all in all this is one of the best superhero origin movies one could ask for!"

","Sam Riami's ""Spiderman"" is a fun comic book movie, but it is not a great one<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy high school student who lives with his Auntie May and Uncle Ben, he hangs about with his best friend (and seemingly only friend) Harry Osborne (James Franco) and lusts after the girl next door Mary Jane Watson (Kristen Dunst) Peter's life is changed for ever when he's bitten by a radio active spider on a school field trip. Once bitten he developed an amazing powers and transforms himself into the superhero Spiderman. Unfortunately Harry's dad Norman Osborne (Willem Defo) has also developed some superpowers and he has transformed himself into the deadly Green Goblin.<br/><br/>I had a few problems with this, the first being the menacing Green Goblin looked like a bad guy from the ""Power Rangers"" TV show and at times you could see his mouth was not moving when dialogue was coming out!! The wisecracking, sarcastic Spidey from the comics is nowhere to be seen. The ending borrowed heavily from the comic book ""The Night Gwen Stacey Died"" but didn't have the courage to actually go through with killing off a main character. Another problem for me was, I didn't find Maguire's Peter Parker/Spiderman or Dunst's Mary Jane that interesting. Willem Defo and James Franco were much more interesting as the deranged Father and neglected son.<br/><br/>Now on to the good parts. Defo and Franco were both very good. The action scenes were well done, and for the most part the CGI is not that obvious. Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris and in particular JK Simmons are very good in their supporting roles. Maguire does well enough in both roles, and Dunst is attractive enough for us to understand Parkers obsession, and she plays a fine damsel in distress. I enjoyed Bruce Campbell, Octavia Spencer and Elizabeth Banks in their small roles. <br/><br/>Overall not as good as it could have been, but still enjoyable enough."
"Horst_In_Translation","8","1","2","31 December 2014"," Great superhero movie, succeeds on almost all levels
","""Spider-Man"" was the start to Sam Raimi's superhero trilogy starring Tobey Maguire, one of the most promising young actors back then, as Peter Parker. He does a solid job with the character. Raimi was mostly known at this point for another trilogy, namely the Evil Dead movies, which he started directing in his early 20s already. Apart from Maguire, the cast has many more famous names. Kirsten Dunst plays the love interest Mary Jane. I'm usually not too big on her as an actress, but she is okay here. Peter's uncle and aunt are played by Academy Award winner Cliff Robertson (who sadly died not too long ago just like his character here) and Golden Globe winner Rosemary Harris. The main antagonist, the Green Goblin, is played by Willem Dafoe and may very well be my favorite character and performance of the film. His son (and at the same time best friend to Parker) is played by the young rising star James Franco. J.K. Simmons has a small role here and he may very well win the Oscar this year. He certainly makes J. Jonah Jameson his own. And finally, Octavia Spencer, long before she became famous and won her Academy Award, plays a one-scene character as well.<br/><br/>I wrote in the title that there is almost nothing wrong with this movie and you'd have to dig really deep to find something, maybe this could be the end. I found Mary Jane's love confession too cheesy somehow and Peter's reaction left a bitter taste too. It's the girl he loved all his life and he just says no to her. Cannot believe that even with the whole power-responsibility reference. But back to the more positive things. One of my favorite parts was how Parker and Osborn (Dafoe) had such similar paths to what they became. What Parker wanted most was MJ, what Osborn wanted most was the success of his company. First, both fight against outside influences (the enemy company, Flash), then against inside influences (the sale, Harry Osborn) in order to get what they want. Parker succeeds and fights for the good side. Osborn Sr. fails and becomes evil. Of course, apart from that the death of Parker's uncle and how it all happened also played a big role. It basically showed Parker that negative actions happening to other people can also affect him if he does not intervene.<br/><br/>The movie runs for roughly two hours. There is a very clean split for Parker. The first half is about him being a normal boy who discovers his superpowers and we find out how he becomes Spider Man (including a funny wrestling match), who the people in his life are and how they shape him. The second half is pretty much all about the battle between Spider Man and the Green Goblin. Here, I especially liked the scene when Osborn realizes Spiderman's identity. That disguise scene in the burning house was great fun too. In the end, with the last comments from Franco's character, we get a bit of an appetizer for the sequel. On a random side-note, Raimi just recently reunited with Franco for ""Oz"".<br/><br/>You could probably discuss if Maguire is a better actor than Andrew Garfield, but I have to say I definitely prefer Maguire's Spiderman. It works so well, even if he is already in his 20s playing a teenager and there are many memorable scenes in this film, including the kiss between Mary Jane and Spiderman obviously. Thumbs up for writer David Koepp who has also shown his talent on ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Mission: Impossible"" before 2002. And lets not forget Steve Ditko and Stan Lee, the latter even has a little cameo here. And finally a shoutout to Kevin O'Connell and Greg P. Russell, who scored one of the film's two Academy Award nominations and it seems they just cannot get the win. They would have deserved it for this one. Such a shame. The first Spiderman movie was, by far, the most seen film from the year 2002. Crowd magnets like Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars came short. And for good reason. This is one hell of a joyride. Very much recommended."
"CinematicInceptions","4","1","2","30 July 2014"," Good story, but could hardly have been executed worse
","I give this movie a 6.7 out of ten, but I rounded down on the integer rating because it deserves a rating lower than what i gave it. The story is good, and there wasn't very much that I would have changed with that. The character is good as are his various predicaments. Spiderman is a very classy superhero that has some pretty cool abilities. So I give credit to the guy who originally came up with the character and story whose name I haven't bothered to look up. The storyline gets an 8/10. However, the rest of the film gets about a 3 or 4/10. The special effects are less than realistic, and some of that is probably due to the advancement of CGI in '02, but there isn't much of an explanation of making the blood that drops from Spiderman's cut arm look like ketchup when it hits the floor. I'm not that pleased with Toby McGuire's acting either. Peter Parker is often described as mild-mannered, but his constantly star-struck face makes him seem more like an awed three-year old than a quiet high-schooler. The guy getting carried out on a stretcher after fighting the pro-wrestler is hardly convincing in his cries of pain. The other main roles of Aunt May, MJ, and Dr. Osborne/Green Goblin are also not performed with anything spectacular. Even though I'm not really a fan of James Franco, I think he was the only actor with a decent performance in this movie. I feel that the main issue with the movie lies in the fault of the screenwriters. The Green Goblin firing out cliché threats to accompany his missiles makes for more of an annoying than menacing villain. Peter Parker is given so little personality that some of his attitudes contradict each other. Mary Jane is also just sort of there, and not really given a personality. And I'm not really that up on which superheroes are in the DC and Marvel universes, but I do know that Superman and Spiderman are in different fictional universes. So, yes, Aunt May, you are right that your nephew is not Superman because in your world, Superman isn't supposed to exist even in the imagination. Even the film score was very lacking at times. The Green Goblin should not have background like Dracula during the climatic scene. And somebody must think that Mary Jane looked like Tweety Bird while getting chased by the guys who jump her in the street because there is no other explanation for the flute solo in that scene. On the whole, I would not suggest watching this movie to anyone except people that are genuine fans of the character."
"Sewaat","8","1","2","21 April 2014"," A classic childhood favourite
","Though my memories are vague, I recall seeing this film for the first time around the age of seven years old. Most clearly, I remember feeling an abundance of joy whenever this movie was put into my VCR player. And when Danny Elfman's amazing score began it's first notes with the visual of the Columbia pictures logo....I felt a rush of child-like wonder and excitement fill me. I knew I was in for a treat.<br/><br/>What can I say about this movie, now? Well, I can tell you that some of it's bigger strengths lie in the casting decisions. And look no further than the decision to cast Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman. At the story's beginning, Maguire comes off as a dork and a nerd. Exactly as he's meant to be. But when pushed to the extreme, his character can change from mild-mannered teenager to heroic vigilante when need be. It's a fantastic blend of realism and fantasy that one expects from a super-hero. And this version of Spiderman is no exception. But the actor who really over-shadows the whole production, is Willem Dafoe as Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin. His bi-polar tendencies make for an extremely shifty and mysterious performance. He comes off as being both terrifying and hilarious when the situation calls for it. If the film had not possessed the amazing talent of either of these stars, than perhaps it wouldn't have been nearly as charming.<br/><br/>It can't be denied that the film suffers from a sprinkling of corny moments. Both from the characters and the action sequences itself. Fortunately, these silly moments are few and far between. And the drama and intensity of the story arc over-shadows anything that can be considered too over the top or ridiculous. It is the darkness that this film weaves(no pun intended)ambiguously into the plot that saves the film from becoming another ""kid-friendly"" super hero bomb.<br/><br/>Though it can be sometimes laughable and cliché in a certain light, it's without a doubt one of the more passionate super hero films to date. It underlines the moral message of courage and responsibility. Both things that turn a boy into a man as Peter comes to term with through-out the story. So, in a manner of speaking...Sam Raimi's 2002 marvel masterpiece could be considered the most elaborate coming of age story yet. Combined with the compelling spirit of what it truly means to be a hero."
"alindsay-al","9","1","2","16 February 2014"," The first epic Marvel Film
","This Film was the first real blockbuster of this new comic book generation and the first Comic book film I ever saw. I believe this film has a bit of everything for the comic book fans and just the casual fans to enjoy. This film was especially appealing for me once I heard The Green Goblin was going to be in the film since he is my favourite villain in comic book history and I believe The Goblin was the perfect villain for this film and just added to the overall quality of the film. This film has great action and a narrative that really does make the character of peter parker relatable to the audience and add to the emotional parts of the film which just like the majority of the film. The only small negatives are such things as some slow parts and awkward dialogue portions between Mary Jane and Peter. But there is just too many positives to miss out on this film apart from what I mentioned and the relationship between Harry and Norman Osborne was a great addition to the love story. Overall a fantastic comic book film with just about a bit of everything positive for it."
"whysoserioushutch","8","1","2","5 February 2014"," Webtacular!
","I remember the hype, all the fuss and the excitement of this film coming out in what seems like all those years ago. I remember seeing it, then seeing it again and loving it even more on the second showing. By the time the two disk special edition DVD came out I pretty much worse the disks out. I was besotted by this film, it's look, it's feel, it's heart, it's characters and it's action. This, coming from a non Spiderman fan!<br/><br/>I never liked spider man, I was always a Batman fan but you know what this film did something, it changed my mind about a character who graced the screen in spectacular fashion and caught me well off guard.<br/><br/>Spiderman really is amazing in this well shot, well acted and very well directed piece of superhero cinema. The film tells the story of Peter Parker (played wonderfully by Tobey Maguire) a geeky kid with only one friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) and a crush on his next door neighbour MJ (Kirsten Dunst). It's while out on a field trip Peter gets bit by an engineered spider and overnight is gifted or perhaps cursed with spider like abilities. At the same time we have Norman Osborn (Willem Defoe) trying to keep his company beyond the competition with performance enhances. With the army breathing down his neck he takes it upon himself to have a human trial, with life changing results.<br/><br/>The film first and foremost has a wonderful pallet of colours that really bring out the comic book feel. Director Sam Raimi gives every scene a wonderful sense of Americana and comic book colours with every single frame of film. At the same time the cast all give wonderful performances to boot. Tobey and James play their friendship and hardships out beautifully, and play the teen angst well. Kirsten Dunt can come across as a little whiny in parts but it's got to be said, in the whole trilogy this her least whiny performance. Of course Willem Defoe dials in the villain performance with pure ease when in green costume yet his most interesting turns come when he is loosing his mind, talking to himself. Great and creepy moments indeed.<br/><br/>The action is relentless and the film is soon done and dusted and it really is a thrill a minute, as ever with the superhero genre the origin story is slightly tedious but Raimi sprinkles enough character plot points so it's hardly noticeable.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman steps in with his wonderful music scores to provide something almost a little more special than that of his Batman score and that's no mean feat. His music adds real muscle to the action scenes but also heart to the moments where that extra beat is required.<br/><br/>It certainly had been a long time since viewing this film but I'm glad to say its aged beautifully. The special effects while slightly (and only slightly) dated look as good as I remembered and of course the ending is worth the wait...<br/><br/>Turn up the volume as Elfman's score kicks in to full super heroic melody as spider man soars, swings and sweeps through New York city. Consider me a spider man fan, yes it's all down to you Sam Raimi!"
"OllieSuave-007","8","1","2","29 January 2014"," Pretty good superhero movie.
","I have not read the Spider-Man comics and don't know the character's story or origin, so this movie was the first introduction for me to the superhero. After watching it, even to somebody completely new to the comic book character, it was a pretty good and entertaining movie. Tobey Maguire stars as the nerdy and shy high schooler Peter Parker, who was bitten by a genetically modified spider, turning him into a more muscular and confident man with spider-like abilities that he must use to fight evil and the villainous Green Goblin, all while experiencing a tragedy in his family. Along the way, he attempts to court his high school crush, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).<br/><br/>The acting was descent, albeit a little wooden at times, but I think it helped enhance the steady-going plot story. The special effects were neat and there are plenty of action to keep the story entertaining and exciting. I like the movie's motto, ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility!"" I think that message couldn't have resonate with a better character like Peter Parker since has to rise to the occasion after experiencing the rough side of high school, tragedy and competition with his more popular and well-off friend Harry Osborn (James Franco).<br/><br/>Overall, an entertaining movie which I think is the best of the three made starring Maguire.<br/><br/>Grade B+"
"kylekazooie","8","1","2","9 December 2013"," Actually an incredibly written movie.
","I first saw Spider-man as a 7 year old kid, and obviously I enjoyed it. I flogged the crap out of our VHS copy, so much so I think the tape started to deteriorate. But of course I liked it when I was 7, it was a Spider-man movie! However, unlike a lot of things I liked at 7, this movie holds up incredibly well. In matter of fact it actually gets better every time I re watch it. The casting, the acting, the practical and CG effects, the direction, they all stand up as still being fantastic after 12 years. But it's the focus of the script that really makes this movie so fantastic. The film, at its most simple, is about Peter and MJ. It's also about Peter becoming aware of the responsibility to use his powers for good. This film is so focused because it knows what its focus IS. This is why 2012 SM is so bad (imo). It seems to decide that its story arc is that of Peter's parents, but that fizzles out after 20 minutes. It seems the sequel will try and pull this story back in, but its importance just wasn't explored properly in the first film. Instead it got distracted and copied 2002s central plot with the love story. Which they obviously needed to do but could have focused on much less, as I mentioned, they have Peter's parents to focus on. 2002 SM didn't! All there was to explore was Peter and MJ and it executed it perfectly. Even the sequel handled these ideas well. MJ and Peter finally end up together and Peter begins to question his responsibility to be a hero. The third could have made a prefect trilogy; the ingredients are in there. Peter's dark side is exposed and he himself becomes the villain. Peter's actions causing MJ fear and ultimately stop loving Peter is a tragic end to the tale, but it's perfect because of that tragedy. Sadly this all got muddled up with too many extra villains and unfocused execution. ANYWAY, Spider-man is a fantastically written movie! 10/10! (or more, 8/10!)"
"AaronCapenBanner","8","1","2","25 August 2013"," Hugely Entertaining.
","Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker/Spider-man with a sense of wonder and fun that he became the perfect choice for the role, though Willem Dafoe as his mentor turned nemesis Norman Osbourne/Green Goblin is equally good. James Franco as Harry Osbourne and Kirsten Dunst as love interest Mary Jane Watson round out a fine cast.<br/><br/>Witty script captures the knowing self-awareness of superheroes and villains, and their place in a society that may accept, then later reject them. Director Sam Raimi clearly loves this character, and brings this material to life in grand fashion, with a memorable climax and final scene that sets up the franchise beautifully.<br/><br/>One of the best comic book films ever made was a big hit, and became a trilogy."

"FilmFreak94","8","1","2","9 October 2012"," Some Parts Don't Hold Up Today But Still A Good Introduction to Spider-Man
","Geeky science-wiz and High School student, Peter Parker, was bitten by a radioactive spider while on a field trip and developed spider like powers which allows him to climb up walls, shoot a web and swing on it and super strength. At first he uses these powers for his own gain but when his Uncle Ben is murdered in cold blood by a thief Peter decides to use his powers for the benefit of New York City. As his Uncle Ben said, ""With great power comes great responsibility."" <br/><br/>While this is going on, Norman Osborn the head of OsCorp has taken a super serum and has gained super strength and a twisted alter ego. He dons a glider and body armor to become The Green Goblin and begins terrorizing the city. He has made it his personal goal to get Spider-Man to join him on his personal crusade against order. Spider-Man has to balance being fresh out of High School, his relationships with his friends and Aunt, and stop Goblin from hurting innocent people.<br/><br/>The plot is what you'd come to expect for an origin story but some parts of the film when looked at today are considerably dated. Most of the CGI while impressive for its time looks very fake when compared to the effects we're used to today. Even back then they looked a tad off. For instance scenes where the Goblin is flying on his glider or when Spider- Man is climbing a wall or jumping off something are pretty obviously CGI. It doesn't take you out of the feel for the movie per se but it looks a little jarring.<br/><br/>What might take you out of the moment is some of the dialog. Comics in their day had some pretty corny dialog but recently movies have been averting the corny dialog. And even though this movie was one of the first superhero films to revive the genre some of the dialog feels very forced. The scenes with Peter and Mary Jane (his love interest) are sometimes good but other times they feel awkward and that's probably what they're going for since Peter is supposed to be awkward but when he's Spider-Man it still feels a bit awkward. The Goblin's dialog is like it was taken out of the Adam West Batman TV Show. That isn't terrible in fact it's actually really enjoyable but if we're trying to take him seriously as a threat his dialog has to have a little more threatening tone to it.<br/><br/>But the film still holds up on the emotional side of Spider-Man. The scene where Uncle Ben is killed is still sad and the relationship Peter has with his friends and Aunt May are performed very well. It's just the dialog that makes it feel a little forced. And the fight scenes are still engaging and filled with energy. <br/><br/>The cast pull their characters off as if they were made for the parts. Tobey Maquire does a good balancing act as Spidey and Peter Parker keeping Spidey's sarcastic sense of humor and Peter's nerdy behavior. Kirsten Dunst plays a decent Mary Jane, James Franco pulls Harry Osborn's relationship with his father very realistically, and Willem Dafoe is in my opinion the best actor they could've picked for Goblin and Norman. The one that stands out as the best though is J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jamerson. There is no doubt about it he is the perfect Jamerson. His quick humor and motor mouth fit the character to a t, and I can't think of anything bad to say about his performance. <br/><br/>So while the film has a lot of flaws it's still a fun movie to watch. It's a nice introduction to Spider-Man if you've never heard of the character(surprisingly enough) and a good film on its own.<br/><br/>I give Spider-Man a 7.5 leaning to an 8."
"bethanymilankovic","9","1","2","29 June 2012"," A fun, exciting, energetic film!
","I think this is a great film and it tells a good story. It brings the famous Marvel character to life. It grabs your attention from the start and keeps you going all the way through. Even though it uses special effects they are not too obvious, making the film more realistic. The cast in this are amazing and play their roles very well especially Tobey Maguire who is really having to play two different people as he is showing two opposite sides to one person, he brings emotion and energy to this film and is the perfect person for the job; playing a nerdy teenager who doesn't particularly fit in at school and also playing a brave hero. This film is one that you can watch many times and still enjoy the story and action and is a great start to the next films that follow. It's a good film which is definitely worth watching!"
"gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","8","1","2","25 March 2012"," An entertaining and faithful adaptation of the comic
","It's a shame that I didn't see this movie back at 2002 when I was a little kid, but since it's almost celebrating it's 10th anniversary with The Amazing Spider Man coming out this year, I'm going to review all three Spiderman films starting with this one. The reason why I'm giving this an 8/10 is because it's a more faithful adaptation of the comic book it was based on and tells the origins of how Spiderman came to be perfectly.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi's direction is surprisingly superb and the cinematography is flawless, but I think that the atmospheric music score from Danny Elfman, the groundbreaking action, the visuals (great CGI included) and an excellent cast (Tobey Mcguire did a great job portraying as the brainy and awkward nerd before transforming into Spiderman after getting bitten by a spider. Not to mention kicking some a** in the process. Kirsten Dunst was very cute as the love interest Mary Jane and the interactions between Mary and Peter are brilliant. J.K Simmons did a good job as J. Jonah Jameson, the grouchy news publisher who fired everybody which caused me to laugh my butt off. Arguably, I think Willem Defoe steals the show for not only his scary, but his over-the-top performance as Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin. Other actors including James Franco and Rosemary Harris are also pretty good as well) are the only strongest aspects of the entire movie.<br/><br/>The only two complaints that I do have with this movie is the clunky editing and it's corny Dialogue (""The Itsy Bitsy Spider Went Up The Water Spout"", ""And when she got out of the car, and you saw her for the first time, you grabbed me and you said, ""Aunt May, Aunt May, is that an angel?"", ""You have a knack for saving my life. I think I have a superhero stalker."")<br/><br/>Overall, not a masterpiece, but an entertaining and faithful comic book movie nonetheless and would always be recommended to die-hard fans of superhero movies."
"classicsoncall","8","1","2","13 August 2011"," ""You're not Superman, you know"".
","My summary line above came from Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), spoken from her hospital bed to nephew Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) at her side. It was a great line and a cleverly playful shot at DC Comics, who haven't had as much success in adapting their super-heroes to the big screen the way Marvel Comics has. Back in 2002, this one was the 'make or break' film that would propel Marvel into future projects if it was successful, and history bears out the results. I saw the picture when it came out, but wasn't writing these reviews back then, so I'm a little late to the party. But I have to say, watching it again some nine years later leaves me with some of the same feelings I had back then. I thought the condensed story of Spider-Man's origin was neatly done, along with the way Peter gradually learned to use his new found powers. By the time Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) has his heart to heart talk with Peter and advises - ""Just be careful who you change into"" - we're already in on Peter's amazing secret with a sense that big things are ahead for the teen-age hero.<br/><br/>One of the great kicks I get out of watching the Marvel franchise films is waiting to catch comic book writer and legend Stan Lee in one of his now ubiquitous appearances. Lee is seen in this one during the Green Goblin's attack on the Unity Day Festival when he pulls a young girl away from some falling debris. I was surprised today to see how quick that scene played out, so if you're not attentive you're bound to miss it. I see that Lee's appearance in the picture is uncredited as the 'Man in Fair', but a better clue to help pick him out would be 'Man who saves girl', but as I say, it was a pretty quick scene.<br/><br/>The other great memory I had while watching the picture again today was the appearance of Randy 'Macho Man' Savage portraying the wrestler Bone Saw McGraw. Savage, who along with Ric Flair, was one of those pro wrestling villains that had a way of attracting a fan base because of his cool style. He displays his classic finishing move, the flying elbow drop off the top ropes on a hapless opponent before Peter enters the ring as the Human Spider. I was saddened to learn of his untimely and tragic death earlier this year, as he was a colorful character in his own right, and seemed to finally have found some measure of peace in his hectic life.<br/><br/>Aside from the reminiscences, the picture itself is a nice balance of character development for the principal players, and action scenes involving Spider-Man and his chief nemesis, Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). I have to admit, the Goblin get-up seemed cheesy to me, looking like a static green robot, especially when the eye-guards were in place. But hey, it's over and done with, so no sense quibbling now.<br/><br/>So overall, I thought this was a pretty good and entertaining kick start to the Marvel Universe in cinema, and certainly for your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Subsequent pictures would reinforce the idea that with great power comes great responsibility, a line that has come to epitomize the super-hero genre."
"bubromer","8","1","2","24 June 2011"," Spider-Man Hits Hollywood
","I think this is a good movie that has stood the test of time. It is both the best and worst Hollywood can offer. Great action sequences, good easy to follow story, good acting, good effects, good costumes, a certain amount of (pinko liberal) social commentary but also a great deal of soft sentimentality which makes me glad for a satirical show like South Park, although I do not claim to be impervious to the sentimentality as even after watching the movie several times, I am still stirred by it, almost despite myself.<br/><br/>Most importantly, Spider-Man the movie does the comic book justice. It lacks the gritty humour of the comic strip and yes, Tobey Maguire lacks the intellectual/spiritual maturity of the comic book Peter Parker, not to mention his wit and likability as a guy, but, to my mind, he does a good job for the most. My favourite performance in the film is that of James Franco - I think he really shines in this film.<br/><br/>The film has its clichés but they are not jarring - for example, the military giant Oscorp creating a super-villain in the form of the Green Goblin (unlike the star review, I think his costume is awesome, and so is Spidey's), corporate power struggles, some script that is a little iffy (but hey that is what you get in comic books and I personally like its simplicity and lack of pretentiousness), boy becoming adult, woman (Mary Jane) as spur for manly self-overcoming (Peter Parker) etc.<br/><br/>At the risk of sounding too intellectual, I think the film shines in its caricatured portrayal of America and New York in particular, where you get a sense of the diversity of individuals (for example when different people utter their views on the new super-hero in town), the difficulties of making a living and holding down a job and the difficult process of starting out in life (developed further in the excellent sequel) (made even more difficult by the bullying tactics of self-glorifying entrepreneur/petty capitalist Jona Jameson and chef Enrique (Mary Jane's employer))...<br/><br/>There is a strong Christian ethos that permeates the film's (moral) philosophy. This last thread is personified in the film by the character of Ben Parker who coins the phrase ""with great power comes great responsibility"", easily transferable to America's role as world superpower, several references to the Bible, the Lord's Prayer, a Christian church in the background: in short good versus evil. (In Spider-Man 3, true to the comic book, Spider-Man's evil symbiotic costume is got rid of in a Christian church - a very transparent metaphor).<br/><br/>On the evil side, of course, we have goblin, and Defoe who I think is really good as the mentally ill villain. Osborn Senior's collection of masks points to a primal awareness of the power of disguise and warrior gear (developed interestingly in Batman Begins ""To overcome fear, you must become fear"", i.e. Batman and the notion of the symbol), all or nothing, psychotic and cynical thinking that is characteristic of our view of ""evil"" as well as this idea that the masses are made, in Osborn's words, to drive the few to become exceptional and be carried on the teeming masses' shoulders.<br/><br/>Two scenes in this film I find graphically exceptional: the scene in the burning building where Spidey confronts Goblin for the second or third time, and the final confrontation in the graveyard, which I find visually stunning and violently dark in an effective way.<br/><br/>On an aesthetic level then, this film largely succeeds. The lighting is ""comic bookie"" but not jarring (except in some sequences in Times Square), there are brilliant and subtle transition graphics such as when an explosion blends into graduate hats being thrown in the air or when Peter Parker is designing his costume and there is quite a lot of caricatured yet quite accurate representation of crowd mentality such as the one watching gladiatorial combat in the form of the wrestling contest.<br/><br/>To conclude this review, I would say that this feature film has quite a bit of meat to it, if one is prepared to pay attention, and, like the best of comic books, has a good deal of reality seeping into it, despite appearances.<br/><br/>Eight out of ten."
"andreabilger","5","1","2","30 May 2010"," Nice visuals, bad dialog, nice sound, mediocre acting
","Tobey Maguire is very weak -- my daughter's cartoon drawings have more expression. Kirstin Dunst is really just barely OK but Tobey makes her look good. Some of the dialog between Tobey and Kirstin is literally painful to sit through. The movie is very pretty. The CGI crowd did their job, I just wish the writers had done half as well. My husband is really into sound and said it was good. (I thought so too, but one ear doesn't really work.) The movie started so slowly, we were wondering whether we should give up on it about 20 minutes in. We only give up on about one movie in twenty, so that tells you something. I'd heard good things about Spiderman and thought they applied to both 1 and 2, but I'm starting to suspect (and hope) that they were really about 2."
"thesar-2","8","1","2","15 November 2009"," Who am I? The Human-Spider!
","I should really give 2009's 'Avatar' a chance. When I watched the recent trailers, the blue fish people look really fake in the trailer and it makes me either not want to see it or go for a good laugh. In 2002, I said the same thing about 'Spider-Man.' Spidey looked so fake in the trailer and the action/swinging was so slowed down, I almost didn't see it. Nevertheless, I gave it a chance opening weekend and waited a long time in line. Man, I was not disappointed. Somewhere in translation, they sped up the action sequences and you truly believed Spider-Man was swinging from building to building, fighting, etc. But, there was more to this movie, much more.<br/><br/>Director Raimi and writer Koepp added so much depth to the characters, setting and took Stan Lee's age-old teenage comic book hero to new heights, literally. I've always loved the talent of Maguire (Peter Parker/Spider-Man) but you really felt every blow, physical or mental, he went through. Simmons (J. Jonah Jameson) and Harris (Aunt May) were absolutely perfect from the comic books I grew up on. Oh, and I always love Bruce Campbell (aside from 'My Name is Bruce') so I am glad Raimi loves to continue to use him. Unfortunately, not everyone was pitch-perfect.<br/><br/>Dunst (Mary Jane ""MJ"" Watson) was just ""okay"" though she did seem to act her heart out in each scene. (Strangely, I always envisioned her with rich red and curly hair – of which neither were true, though she did have just barely a red-tint.) And what was with the Green Goblin/Norman Osborn (Dafoe)? Sure, in the 'strip he's either literally green or in a costume – I can't remember him much, he was always my least favorite of Spidey's villains. I guess they needed to upgrade to make him more believable with a horrid mask (again, I'm guess, that's the best they could come up with) which didn't make much scene, since supposedly they made the suit/mask before Osborn went wacko, and it just happened to look sadistic? At any rate, they did a fantastic job, making you truly believe in Spider-Man/Parker and all of his troubles and triumphs while keeping to the core of the always-broke, always-bantered teen who's trying to do good and always vying for the girl (MJ.) Here we have the origin story of Spider-Man, but, like 'Superman: The Movie,' you won't see the super-hero in red/blue tights until about half-way through. You'll be fully introduced to this nerd, his girl-next-door crush, his living arrangement with Aunt/Uncle and the infamous bite that spawned the teen web-slinger.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in the movie's weakest story, Pete's best friend's Dad experiments on himself with some green smoke that, well, uh, makes him stronger and angry. Not Hulk angry – though he's got the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde thing going on, but just upset at those that are against the green smoke in the first place and eventually, of course, Spider-Man. This is one of the same problems I had with 'Daredevil's completely underdeveloped super-villain ""Bullseye."" You're simply asked to believe these two bad-guys have some kind of super-power and that they want to rid the city of the hero because, well, it said so in the comic books.<br/><br/>The only other flaw I could tell (and Raimi never seemed to correct this in the following two sequels) was the length. All three movies (so far) are way too long with scenes that could've obviously been trimmed. Granted, this one is the best paced one, but standing alone, it still could've been cut easily down 20-25 minutes.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the movie, as a whole, is highly recommended. The fantastic score (one of Elfman's best,) graphics, dialogue, comedy, romance & longing and the setup were all great. It was a perfect introduction to the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. It can easily be viewed by all audiences, and they did a great job of making it almost virtually timeless so it can be enjoyed by generations to follow.<br/><br/>So, thanks Spidey, you not only saved the city and the girl (oops, spoiler), but you might've persuaded me to buy a ticket to help probably the most expensive movie ever, 'Avatar,' make back at least one ticket's worth."

","Along with ""Blade 2"", 2002 unleashed another superhero blockbuster ""Spider-Man"". The popular comic book character is brought to life and Sam Raimi brings it to life exceptionally well. The characters are now on the big screen just as they were in the comics, something fans will for sure enjoy. This movie takes the simple idea of the ""accidental superhero"" and it turns into something people of all ages will appreciate. The mild mannered Peter parker is played by Tobey Maguire who actually turned out to be a good choice. The rest of the cast is also well assembled, with James Franco, J.K. Simmons and Rosemary Harris.<br/><br/>The drama is very well played and I believe audiences will enjoy watching Peter Parker's journey from ordinary nerd to a nerd with super powers. Cliff Robertson, playing Ben Parker, was great in this film and his death was a truly sad moment.<br/><br/>Playing our villain is Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn, a.k.a. Green Goblin. It is here we first a lot of CGI being used for the action but it works very well. Spider-Man swinging through New York looks remarkable and the stunts are amazing. The Green Goblin suit is actually very different from the one seen in the TV shows and comic books themselves. It's very mechanical, looking much more like armor. It is a change that many like myself don't mind at all and other than that the villain remains the same, a psychotic terrorist. Plays the role of Spider-Man's enemy perfectly. The portrayal of the character's insanity is done just how it should've been. Danny Elfman is the composer and Spider-Man's theme sounds heroic most definitely. It seems he has a thing for hero films, starting since the original ""Batman"" back in 1989. Who would've guessed that Sam Raimi, the director of the ""Evil Dead"" films, would be able to make such a well made film. Sam Raimi, you did good."
"tburke85","7","1","2","9 June 2009"," Spiderman A Good Comic Book Movie With Some Flaws
","Spider-man is a good comic book movie with some flaws. I prefer the sequel over this one but the original is still a solid comic book film brought to life by director Sam Raimi and the talented cast. Raimi does a decent enough job telling the origin story of nerdy high schooler Peter Parker into the web slinging superhero Spider-man. The cast includes Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-man, William Dafoe as Norman Osburne/The Green Goblin, Kristen Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, and James Franco as Harry Osbourne. Maguire is admirable in his role as both Peter Parker and Spider-man giving us character who is nerdy but is willing to put others before himself. He's a teenager with problems and I think thats why people can identify with him. He's also a man in love with his beautiful neighbor Mary Jane Watson. Dunst as Mary Jane is okay as Peters love but isn't really given much to do besides eventually being the damsel in distress later on in the film. William Dafoe is impressive as Norman Osbourne and his evil alter ego The Green Goblin. I like the fact they made the Goblin a split personality a side effect of the performance enhancers his character takes in the movie. His costume did look a little corny and it resembled something you'd see in an episode of Power Rangers or something but Dafoe makes for an imposing villain none the less. James Franco is good as Norman's son Harry but like Dunst he isn't given much to do either except to show up here and there throughout the movie. Rosemary Harris as Aunt May and Cliff Robertson in a small role as Uncle Ben are effective supporting characters. They both have good chemistry with Maguire making them believable as his characters aunt and uncle. Bruce Campbell has a brief appearance as a wresting announcer and he makes the best of his small part in the film. The special effects are state of the art and the action/fight sequences are well executed but at times you can definitely tell is CG which is okay but not as good as when you see two worthy adversaries without costumes duking it out instead of something created in a computer. The pacing in between the action was a little slow and the dialogue wasn't the best at times. Overall though Spider-man is still an entertaining comic book with just the right amount of action, some suspense, humor, a little romance, and solid performances by the cast that make for an enjoyable movie to watch."

","Whilst out on a high school museum trip, student Peter Parker is bitten by a genetically enhanced spider. He suddenly finds himself with arachnid like super powers and goes on a crime fighting spree.<br/><br/>With a budget of $100 million and a then up coming director in Sam Raimi in the chair, expectations for the first live action film of Spider-Man was extraordinarily high. Thankfully, Raimi and his team succeeded in producing a rip roaring spectacle that doesn't want for human based drama either. Back in 2002 Spider-Man was rightly being lauded as a film that appeased all comers, Raimi fans, comic book geeks and the walk in thrill seeking cinema crowd {the last one is a club i'm proudly a member of} all of which got catered for. Today, after two differing sequels, some of Spider-Man's shine appears to have dimmed, it's almost as if the franchise is judged as a whole, and not for this splendid, and very well crafted piece of fantasy. Which is a shame as Spider-Man doesn't rest on its comic book laurels, that would have been the easy option. Revisiting the film now in this post Dark Knight era, where darkly drawn undercurrents are all the rage, Raimi's Spider-Man is actually a leading light.<br/><br/>Having Raimi in charge greatly benefits the piece, because where one could easily have dealt in full blown light entertainment, Raimi and screenwriter David Koep have flecked the fun with shades of dark. Comic book villainy gets a complex make over courtesy of Willem Dafoe's cackling Norman Osborne/Green Goblin splice off, with a mirror sequence fit to grace any head doctor seminar!. And Parker's duality {excellently realised by a well cast Tobey Maguire} alongside his own complex moral quandaries ensures that Spider-Man the movie is not just about bang for the buck shenanigans. Some minor problems do exist, the CGI at times comes off as creaky, and Danny Elfman's score is not up to his usual high standard, but in the main they are really only throw away complaints. To wit the odd quibble about Spider-Man origins and a hokey Green Goblin costume aside, the film is a sure fire winner. Kirsten Dunst eventually warms to the admittedly twee role of love interest Mary Jane Watson, and James Franco serves notice of undoubted ability as Peter Parker's best friend, Harry Osborne. With a humongous budget and a salivating fan base to please, Raimi was entrusted great responsibility. That he crafted such a ripper of a movie, with little shades of dark, is now, to my mind, a towering achievement. 8.5/10"

","I remember when this movie first came out I was somewhat skeptical about seeing it but I finally gave in and was surprised of how good it was and how faithful it was to the comic book. The story itself is basically how Spider-man came to be. On a field trip Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) gets bit by a radioactive spider and gains powers from the bite. He not only has to struggle with making ends meet he has to struggle with a destructive lunatic called Green Goblin(Willem Dafoe)and also revealing his true feelings about his long-time friend, Mary Jane(Kirsten Dunst).<br/><br/>This movie is so true to the comic book, its almost eerie. Tobey Maguire is great as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Willem Dafoe is excellent as The Green Goblin, J.K. Simmons is great as Jonah Jameson and even Aunt May and Uncle Ben are portrayed and acted accurately. The action sequences are pretty good and even though they use CGI its not an eyesore here as it is in other movies that use it heavily.

OHH.. He had been bitten by a super spider. So let's have that naughty advanced spider to bite a lot of young boys and girls to have lots of Spidermen, Spidergirls, Spiderdogs. Surely one of them could be less provocative then you know who!<br/><br/>_(Willem Dafoe) is kidding with us? Right? Because he is a fine actor, not just a bad joke wearing some kid's stupid green toy. He was having a rare schizophrenia to be a businessman at day, then some MacDonald's plastic doll at night!<br/><br/>_Spiderman looks cool and athletic when he is in the suit, but (Tobey) looks just boyish. Another reason to believe that HE'S NOT THE MAN IN THE SUIT!<br/><br/>_That script can be the cheesiest script ever. Actually, making a comic book movie does not mean writing it dully. It could've been more suitable to make it like it takes place in the 1940s. To tell you the bitter truth, it looked more like it had been produced in the 1940s!<br/><br/>_The CGI was obvious, adolescent, and guess what? Silly.<br/><br/>_At the scene of (Spiderman) and (Green Hornet), in which they were talking over some building, why I felt like I'm watching a lousy puppet show? Even the kid in me vetoed: ""What kind of nonsense you're watching pal, get a life!"".<br/><br/>_Why all the characters, the situations, the events, the dialogues, the actors, even the action looked like old bad TV episode with primitive performance from everybody, and campy sense all over everything? A mystery indeed.<br/><br/>_Spiderman has an idiot alter ego, works at a newspaper, with nervous yet nice editor-in-chief who wants to know everything about the hero from that young journalist! Hallooo!! I hear echoes from Superman here, so why to make it again? As the old comics or not, they didn't find other solutions. Therefore, I got the deja-vu syndromes.<br/><br/>_ I didn't like (Kirsten Dunst) acting here; it was overdone.<br/><br/>_(Kirsten Dunst) and her last scene. I can't hold my laughs. At the first time I watched it, I laughed like a drain. Her performance was so awful, and (Tobey) was like a child at a school's play who forgot his lines to gaze smiling with idiot look on his face (I think it's natural), then he refused simply the ""sudden weepy"" love of her and left. I thought: ""You're such a fool! How dare you refuse her love?!, it was a miracle to find someone to love you in the first place!!"". That was illogical, and was acted badly, to a real funny degree!<br/><br/>_The last shot, when Spidey is jumping all over the fake skyscrapers, and making a lot of fatuous CGI around, he is just unexpectedly jumping at us??!! Aside from being scary for some, I felt it was extremely funny and so impressive as a good example for this movie's unique silliness.<br/><br/>_2 sequels?? That's unbearable. Tells you a lot about a generation who wants more psychedelic SuperAnything even it was SuperMaguire!<br/><br/>The year of 2008 witnessed the release of part 3, and after a while, there was the release of the parody (Superhero Movie).

It's a superhero movie at the finest level with motivated characters soaring action sequences and truly devious Nemesis. Let me just say that Tobey Maguire was the perfect casting choice for Peter Parker. For better or for worse he will probably always be remembered as Spider-Man and that because by the series second installment he had totally immersed himself in the role and you did realize it was him anymore you just saw Peter. Im not a Kristen Dunst fan at all but she did give a great performance in this. James Franco used this to establish himself as a very solid convincing actor. Then there's Willem Dafoe who truly is a great actor and is consistently underrated. He played such a great villain helpless, lost, and a borderline weak person as Norman Osborne. When he becomes the goblin he's a wise cracking, evil, motivated and powerful killer. Kudos also go to Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris, and J.K. Simmons for playing their roles true, entertaining and in Simmons case funny. The plot was great because it felt like you were watching a comic-book film which made it fun and involving.

The film is a thrilling ride from start to finish , moves at a great pace and keeps us entertained all the way through with its action sequences and emotional scenes. Tobey Maguire was cast brilliantly as the web slinger and although from time to time he maybe a little tooo geeky , it was all well. Willem Defoe was cast brilliantly as the Green Goblin and although The Goblin was never truly one of my favourites he seemed to make the regather interesting. James Franco and Kirsten Dunst who otherwise I can't stand were class.

SPIDER-MAN is the ideal summer blockbuster, and the fact that this film was a highly-praised summer attraction is understandable. Packed with state-of-the-art special effects creations that parade in front of the screen like magic, but also powered by a great story and a sharp focus on characters, SPIDER-MAN is a web of gold.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is ideally cast as Peter Parker who, after being bit by the radioactive spider, is turned from ultimate nerd into the ultimate superhero of the title, but you all know that. But the film makes everything else interesting for the audience. Instead of being just your fairly typical summer event picture, living it up with special effects alone, this one actually has a story to boot, and interesting characters ranging from Parker, his family and the villain, Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), who turns into the evil Green Goblin. Director Sam Raimi doesn't dumb this one down as a visually exhilarating and incompetently plot-less summer picture. What SPIDER-MAN turns up to be is a terrific roller-coaster ride of an adventure, which gives audiences have much to think about.<br/><br/>Although the sum of the parts are often uneven, SPIDER-MAN is still a wild ride of a summer movie that'll knock your socks off.

This is personally one of the few highly anticipated films that I saw on its theatrical release that not only met but ultimately surpassed all of my expectations, successfully re-channeling my childhood romance with this iconic character & taking his epic tale to even greater heights. ""Spider-Man"" tells the tale of Peter Parker, a mild mannered teenager who constantly seeks acceptance from his peers & ultimately dreams of one day gaining the courage to confess his love to Mary Jane Watson, who is the girl of his dreams. But his life takes a remarkable turn when he is bitten by a genetically enhanced super-spider while on a high school field trip. He miraculously gains superhuman powers that reflect that of a spider's abilities. He finds that he is able to, strangely, shoot webbing from his wrists, detect in coming danger, climb walls, & has superhuman strength and flexibility. After accepting his powers, Peter then seeks to use them for personal gain. But when he fails to stop a criminal that later murders his beloved uncle, he learns a tragic yet valuable lesson: ""With great power comes great responsibility."" Peter then vows to never let what happened to his Uncle Ben happen to anyone else & becomes Spider-Man! <br/><br/>""Spider-Man"", unlike many comic to film adaptations, succeeds in revealing the true essence of the man behind the hero's mask. It also grabs the heart of its audience by presenting Peter Parker as an ordinary person at heart as it captures his everyday struggles to live an ordinary life while protecting the streets of New York in the guise of this iconic hero. Toby Maguire is terrific as Peter, as he nails his nerdy yet charismatic charm as well as Spider-Man's confident personality & amazingly mirrors his phenomenal physique. Ultimately, ""Spider-Man"" delivers in its story telling, special effects, & well choreographed action sequences. Five stars, & two thumbs up."

Now, six years on, Spider-Man is one of my favourite comic book characters and Stan Lee is one of my heroes. It gives a really good origin story in the beginning that stays pretty true to the comics for the most part. Sure there were changes made to the story in some parts, but it was still pretty close. The origin carries into a pretty solid plot, which really works as a Spider-Man movie.<br/><br/>The acting was really good, and I felt the actors all portrayed their characters well. I thought that Tobey Macguire made a really good Peter Parker and a decent Spider-Man, James Franco was really good as Harry Osborne, and I think I'm one of the few people that thinks Kirsten Dunst made an alright Mary Jane Watson. They all had great chemistry together. You could really imagine that Mary Jane was the girl that Peter loved, and that Harry was his best friend. The father/son relationship between Harry and Norman Osborne was pretty believable. All the actors just worked really well together, and I believe good chemistry works really well toward making a good movie. Even the supporting characters are perfectly cast, like Uncle Ben, Aunt May, J Jonah Jameson and Betty Brant seemed as if they were straight out of the comics.<br/><br/>The storyline is pretty cool. It's filled with lots of drama, when you get to see Peter feeling different things throughout the movie. Guilt, love, confusion. You get to see the transformation of a nerdy, weak teenager into a powerful hero. It's not just about some kid who gets bitten by a spider and becomes a superhero, it's got a whole lot more depth than that. And for the most part, the actual storyline doesn't just feel like filler until the next action scene. That's part of what sets it apart from a lot of other comic book movies. Some of the dialog in the movie is a bit cheesy, especially some of the stuff between Peter and Mary Jane, but I don't really let it bug me. <br/><br/>The action scenes are really good, although a little fleeting for the most part. They just seemed over too soon sometimes. They were still really cool though, and were definitely some of the high points of the movie. The costume designs are really good as well. The Spider-Man costume looks awesome in about 132 different ways. Apparently the changes that were made to the Green Goblin costume in comparison to his comic counterpart caused some problems with fans. I think the changes were necessary to avoid being too cheesy. And his new costume looked awesome anyway. The special effects in the movie were pretty good, especially in scenes where Spidey is swinging around. There are some scenes where it does look a little fake, but it shouldn't take away from the movie for people. But I know people do like to whine about every problems in movies, so some people might find the effects an issue.<br/><br/>All in all, it's an awesome movie, and we were lucky enough to get two sequels to it. I've watched it a few times, and it holds up well. A fairly re-watchable movie. It was one of the movies that helped start the modern Marvel movie trend, along with X-Men and the Blade movies before it. Just another great thing it had a hand in. Sam Raimi is a great director. Spider-Man is a great character and was really done justice in a movie that could have easily been awful."
"sherrimichel2004","8","1","2","18 June 2008"," spider-man review.
","This is just a good Spider-Man film. There is nothing amazing about. It is an origin story so it does move a little slow. But Spidey's origin has always been a multi step process.Although details are changed a lot, Peter's first love is Mj, the name of the wrestler is changed, the webs are organic etc., the script mostly understood the characters. There is a lot of development to them. They are all well-defined. Although this is probably the least dramatic of the spider films, it doesn't have any fun with itself. When Peter enters the suit, he is supposed to be a wise-cracking, fun loving guy. He doesn't change at all. He just mumbles and mopes around. Tobey Maigure gives a wooden performance as Peter Parker/ Spider-man. That is my only real complaint."
"cosmorados","9","1","2","7 June 2008"," What do you want?! Shawshank 2!
","Because when I look at various comments on these pages regarding this film, and other blockbusters, I feel that this is what people want in every film they see and I don't know why. When I go to see a drama I see a drama, when I want to see a comedy I see a comedy, why does every film have to be ""The Godfather"" otherwise it's badly acted and scripted? <br/><br/>The only films that tend to buck this trend are superhero films that have character actors as their lead. The truth is that this is a really good blockbuster film. <br/><br/>The story revolves around Peter Parker and his conversion from nerdy college kid to crime fighting superhero, at the same time as his nemesis, the evil Green Goblin, is spawned from his best friend's father Norman Osborn, and whilst Peter is Spider-Man, Norman's persona splits, tearing into the quiet and benign Norman, who eventually becomes the bullied victim of the controlling and evil Green Goblin.<br/><br/>Like most good adaptations it stays pretty close to its source material and, in some areas, improves on them. The cast are are excellent in their respective roles with particular plaudits going to Willem Dafoe whose switches from Goblin to Norman are so perfect that you are never left in doubt who is who as his persona becomes more fractured. Cliff Robertson and JK Simmons are equally good as inspirational Uncle Ben and Uninspirational J. Jonah Jameson respectively.<br/><br/>The action set pieces are all handled supremely well and even though some of the effects aren't brilliant, because of the overall strength of the film it matters little as the characters and story keep your interest so much that it doesn't matter if some of the effects aren't up to the standard of other blockbusters with less charm, plot and characters.<br/><br/>A great start to the spider-man series. Shame 3 lets the side down.<br/><br/>Nuff said Em"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","1","2","27 May 2008"," The first superhero movie to get it right
","In 2002, one movie proved what no one thought possible: Superhero movies were a genre almost untapped in potential and capable of generating millions of dollars world-wide. ""Spider-Man"" showed that costumed crime-fighters have a multi-generational influence and a mass appeal if kept under one condition: they are about the people behind the mask. <br/><br/>What makes ""Spider-Man"" a film that transformed a genre and a whole decade (so far) is that at its heart it is a story about Peter Parker, a normal, geeky kid who comes across great power (that he learns comes with great responsibility). It is an origin story, not obsessed with the action and what the hero does as much as why he does it. Director Sam Raimi clearly connects with Peter Parker and knows exactly how to portray him. Tobey Maguire is an actor that gets at that. There is nothing hunky or masculine about him, yet he is beloved in the role, because through him the audience connects to Peter Parker more than Spider-Man. That connection being so strong then allows for everything Spider-Man does do to become more interesting, exciting and moving. You are with him and Raimi every step of the way.<br/><br/>The very reason ""with great power comes great responsibility"" has become such a heavily quoted line is because when the script hits you with it, you're totally ready. After some great action and an interesting story with a compelling villain in the Green Goblin (Defoe) and strong character relationships, ""Spider-Man"" becomes a hit with its final scene. More important than the movie itself, however, is the way this film altered the course of Hollywood for the next decade, a decade that will be remembered that way forever."

"mckillotd","4","1","2","22 June 2007"," Its OK but just too over-hyped...
","OK, first things first, this is not a bad film. It may actually have been quite good, but I seen it on the back of all this hype proclaiming it as the greatest comic book film ever made and a fantastic spectacle of special effects and this let it down badly.<br/><br/>The effects are amateurish compared to other good CGI films and not a patch on the likes of Lord of the Rings, with the scenes of Spiderman swinging through L.A. looking more like a computer game than real life. I don't understand how it got Oscar nominations as surely the point of CGI is that you don't even notice it isn't real and this clearly looks computer drawn.<br/><br/>The plot was OK and quite true to the comics but it just didn't grab my attention quick enough. I also found Kirsten Dunst a highly unconvincing Mary Jane. Toby Maguire is nerdy enough to play Peter Parker well and does a good job as the transformed Spiderman and Willem Defoe overacts superbly as Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin, but overall the acting left me feeling distinctly underwhelmed.<br/><br/>Like I said, it may have been the timing and the very high expectations I had but I left the cinema feeling very disappointed, and as I was a fan of the comics and even the TV series in my much younger days and this just failed to fill the void of expectation.<br/><br/>Worth watching on TV, but I wouldn't pay to see it...."
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","8","1","2","21 May 2007"," Cheesy Fun!
","It's hard to believe it took 40 years to bring Spider-Man to the big screen, which is probably a major contributor to its success. Spider-Man is my favorite entry in the series because it's the least pretentious. <br/><br/>Like most of the first entries in Superhero franchises, Spider-Man is an origin story. Once bitten by a radioactive spider, high school nerd Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) exploits his new powers to make money in a wrestling match, so he can buy a car to impress Mary Jane Watson (Dunst). After the owner of the wrestling ring pays Peter less than he was promised, a thief steals all of the owner's money. Peter, furious with his former employer, fails to stop the robber. Afterward, Peter finds his Uncle Ben lying in the street, with a bullet in his chest. To his horror, he discovers that the very same thief whom he failed to capture murdered his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson). Peter devotes his life to fighting crime as Spider-Man, using his Uncle's motto ""with great power comes great responsibility."" In the meantime, Norman Osborne, the father of Peter Parker's best friend Harry, experiments with a new steroid serum in a vain attempt to save his business. The serum drives him insane, turning him into a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde like character known as The Green Goblin. From here the film really picks up with some grand webslinging and goblin glider action scenes.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is really the only film that adequately portrays the humorous side of Spider-Man's character. In Spider-Man 2 he's all depressed and in Spider-Man 3 he becomes an emo kid. Maguire pulls off the humorous and nerdy sides of his character quite well. The film has a near perfect cast, with Rosemary Harris as Aunt May and J.K. Simmons, who is absolutely hilarious as J. Jonah Jameson. Kirsten Dunst doesn't have much to do except be saved by Spider-Man, but she does as well as she can with the material. The movie pays a few homages to Superman, from Peter Parker opening his shirt like Clark Kent to the scene where Kirsten Dunst asks ""Who are you?"" ala Margot Kidder. There is a good balance of action and character moments, from Peter's conflict over Mary Jane and his superhero career to Harry yearning for his father's approval. The film's central theme, ""with great power comes great responsibility,"" is conveyed without hammering it over the audience's head too much.<br/><br/>The first half of it is rushed, and the CGI has dated poorly (but they really couldn't help that). The movie has a fair amount of cheese. As many other people have mentioned, Willem Dafoe's suit looks like a Power Ranger costume, and since his mask's mouth is permanently open, it's a little funny when he talks. In Dafoe's defense, all of his scenes as Norman Osborne are performed wonderfully, especially his split personality scenes in front of the mirror. I've always felt that the Green Goblin was Spider-Man's best villain, since his relationship with Spider-Man is more personal than most villains. The film also suffers from the Green Goblin's lack of a grand super villain plot, but the final battle still hits home. Comic book fans will appreciate its similarity to ""The Death of Gwen Stacy."" Peter's decision to walk away from Mary Jane at the end is a bit of a downer but still noble.<br/><br/>None of this seriously detracts from the film's enjoyment though. All in all, this is one fun movie that isn't boring for a minute!"
"rachelmnop","5","1","2","11 February 2007"," Poor Casting
","I have been reading Spiderman ever since i knew how to read, and i would say i know the comic well. That being said i have never seen a movie so poorly cast. Peter Parker is supposed to be nerdy, but also an in-shape, somewhat with it New Yorker. His nerd side is supposed to be there, but he gains a lot of confidence after becoming Spiderman. He is also supposed to be WITTY and make clever and funny remarks all the time, but most notably during fight scenes. By eliminating this aspect they made Spiderman and Peter Parker an extremely flat character. I can't even say anything about Mary Jane, there are no words to describe how horrific she is in these movies, it is an ultimate disaster."

"Tehmeh","8","1","2","1 June 2006"," Childhood hero in the screen does well
","*just a little of spoilers, if any* When I saw this, I had to see it 3 times in a row. That's a lot. I was just so excited about this. Spider-man (as well as X-men) was such a character, I spent years reading the comics and loving it.<br/><br/>I must say this was done well. Spider-man wasn't so dark as Batman or X-men, and it shouldn't be, it has always been more relaxed-kind of thing with him. Peter Parker, basically a low-esteemed kid, problems with his civilian life, crushes on girls....you name it. Casting is good. Tobey Maquire is the perfect ""nerd"" for the role, and he delivers it well. The humor was OK. Spider-mans humor, in the comics too, was really different from the other comics, and it was adapted to the movie pretty faithfully.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst, well, M.J. was given a pretty different role here than in the comics, but hey, it works. J.Jonah Jameson - perfect! Aunt May - perfect! Green Goblin - perfect casting.<br/><br/>There were taken some things that were changed from the comics, for example the web slings. Peter could sling web by himself in this movie, he did not need the wrist-machines. Which was OK, didn't bother.<br/><br/>And well, the immersion of Spider-man flying around the city? Was done well. And I just loved the thing that Peter was still getting used to his new powers and not controlling them so much. Action scenes were good. Acrobatics, web slinging, camera rides - oh man.<br/><br/>However, the Green goblin was a bit lame. It's just me, cause I don't like bad guys with ugly green costumes. That ain't the fault of the movie, just my own personal view about the several bad guys spider-man faced in the comics. Willem Dafoe was great though, I liked him.<br/><br/>This movie was good, and did some building for the 2nd Spider-man movie. Sam Raimi really is a fan himself."

","Having grown up in the 60's, I, like so many millions of young teens were introduced to Spiderman through the medium of Marvel comics. Now through the magic of Hollywood Cinima, American audiences are further introduced to ""Spiderman"" the movie. The imaginative comic writer, Stan Lee is credited with bringing his web-swing character to life and does a 'marvelous' job of transferring the lonely, troubled teen to the big screen. His original concept is that of a young, book-worm, nerdy teenager who is accidentally bitten by a radioactive spider. Nearly dying, Peter Parker, (admirably played by Tobey Maguire) awakens the following day and discovers that instead of killing him, he has been transformed into a super hero with astonishing powers. Everything from his spider senses to his incredible spider strength, Parker is at first convinced he can make some easy money, by exhibiting his abilities in an arena. Unfortunely, his perception of why he was chosen is changed when his seeming ambivalence turns to tragedy with the death of his favorite uncle. The film is imaginative and laced with action scenes which enhance the comic-book-hero's' exploits. With the additional talents of Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin, Cliff Robertson as Ben Parker and J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the film proves it is slated to become a classic. ****"
"nived84","9","1","2","18 April 2006"," Spider-Man learns to crawl, but only later does he learn to fly!
","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man is full of energy, zipping and zooming across the screen with gleefully wild delight. The former Evil Dead creator's visual style for quick zooms and he's zany sense of humor is present throughout the film, but Raimi has also brought along his heart and passion for the comic book to his film. The film was written by David Keopp, fresh after writing David Fincher's Panic Room, and his script gets a few things right and a few things not so right, but in the end this is a pretty amusing and exciting sci-fi/adventure that's sure to keep you entertained.<br/><br/>The cast of Spider-Man does a quite a good job, but I'll be honest when I first heard that Toby Maguire was going to be playing the role of Spider-Man I thought to myself, ""Who? That nerdy kid from Pleasantville?"", so obviously I had my doubts as to if he was up to the task of pulling off the part of Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Why Maguire is perfectly suited for the role of Spider-Man is because he can easily pull of the nerdy/boy-next-door look that is required for Peter Parker. Another good job in casting was getting Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka ""The Green Goblin"". Dafoe goes all Nicholson on us, and doesn't hold anything back; he's in full-on snarl and growl mode, and his voice and mannerisms fit well with the character he's playing. I particularly enjoyed the scene where he talks to himself in the mirror, showing his multiple personalities, a scene that's gone somewhat similar in Peter Jackson's The Two Towers.<br/><br/>The special effects on the other hand aren't quite as flawless as the casting, but for the majority of the film they do work to one degree or another. In the scene where Parker discovers his powers and jumps along the roof tops it's pretty obvious that's a computer effect, but watching Spider-Man battle the Green Goblin on the Queensboro Bridge in the film's finale is quite something. The shots that seemed to take my breath away the most were the dramatic shots of Spider-Man swinging his way all around Manhattan and the cinematography by Don Burgess really helps add to the vibrant look of the film, which is very cool.<br/><br/>However, there are a few little things and one big thing I didn't like about Spider-Man. First off, the little things. Personally I think Mary Jane looked a little ""skanky"" in the beginning of the movie. Was I the only one that thought that? Secondly, I wasn't surprised that Peter Parker lived with his Aunt and Uncle, but it certainly would have been nice to know exactly why that was. Then there's the overindulgent Macy Gray cameo that was completely pointless. And lastly, and most importantly I really didn't like how they decided to do the Green Goblin. If you've read the comic book series Ultimate Spider-Man by Brian Michael Bendis the Green Goblin was created by Norman Osborn injecting himself with a green plasma in a syringe, and then psychically and literally turning into a green monster, which looked much more menacing than the space suite and helmet they ended up using the film. I thought that was a really, really bad choice, because of two reasons. One, it seemed a little strange that the Military would actual end up wearing a goofy looking helmet like that, and two, it just wasn't dark enough for me. But put aside those few complaints I think the film is still pretty good, but it could have been a little better. As for right now I'm giving this film a score of a seven, it's a pretty good film, with a good cast and some fun action sequences that's also able to get us involved with the characters and enjoy them on a small emotional level, so for those reasons it is a success, but it certainly could have used a little tweaking here and there."
"shanejamesbordas","4","1","2","14 March 2006"," Truly Unbelievable
","One can't really expect too much in the way of enlightenment from a comic book adaptation but even by those standards 'Spiderman' has a dreadfully hokey script rife with cliché and unexplained coincidence. Lest we forget, suspension of disbelief applies even here.<br/><br/>A number of the performances are just plain corny (Cliff Robertson certainly milks his small role as Peter Parker's uncle) but Willem Dafoe's theatrically hammy performance does entertain in an Olivier-like fashion.<br/><br/>The film has most to offer in its beginning section which features a number of spectacular special effects during our insight into the origins of the hero's super-powers. Later when he becomes fully fledged (with little further explanation as to how he got there) the film looks decidedly more like a video game and will surely fail to sustain interest except in the youngest and most uncritical audiences."

Pretty soon he gets bitten by a mutant spider, causing a nasty bite and pretty soon some big side effects eg super strength and being able to shoot webs from his wrists. While this weird stuff is going on, Peter is still trying to woo Mary-Jane (Dunst), his cute next door neighbour. Peter soon becomes fascinated with his newfound skills and decides to enter a fighting comp. He wins, but decides he should dedicate his skills to helping people, not living large. When the Green Goblin (DaFoe) comes onto the scene, it's clear we have a good old good vs evil battle brewing.<br/><br/>There's lots of twists, love triangles, relationship struggles and more that make this more than just a boring old comic adaption.

","""Spiderman"" was an enjoyable flick, with a decent visual effects and some nice moments, but overall it was not very impressive. The first big NO-NO in the movie is Toby as Peter Parker. Nothing personal against the actor, he actually played quite well, but he is not for this character. He is more fit for Harry Osborn and John Franco would have been an ideal Spiderman. Kirsten Dunst was not too great, too. The bad guy was OK, although he was too intense from the beginning, while in the comic books Norman was just a corrupt businessman. Apart from this, the film is quite good. The story is slow-moving but interesting, it is well shot and the battles between Spidey and The Green Goblin were very well made. Also there were some classic moments as the Goblin disguised as an old woman or the people, turned into skeletons and then killed. Unfortunately, the sequel of this film is quite stupid."

","All my friends like the movie, I do not! The story's as simple as dumb: There is Peter Parker transforming into a human spider, a bad guy wants to rule the world (after he also got transformed - into a crazy sucker) and our beloved Kirsten Dunst is so sweet and helpless, that Maquire (Parker) needs to rescue her. The jokes are as smart as the German music charts (I know this disease, cos' I am German) and the upwards kissing scene is the worst piece in movie love (how sick and slimy!). Good: Nice special effects (especially Maquire's computer- muscles... *he he*) * Bad: Everything else * Ugly: Willem Dafoe *** I guess, part two is better than this boring standard-hero-bad-guy-story.

","Reviewing Spiderman makes me learn about a few simple rules about critics: # 1. Critics are subjective, because it is the result between The story and Our story. So Spiderman being my first big moment of entertainment in my childhood, its movie could only be viewed with tolerant eyes.<br/><br/># 2. Adaptation is a success if the «spirit» of the work has been understands. Thus, the pleasure for the fan is to live again this spirit, in front of a lot of little differences from the original work. In Spiderman, the spirit is indeed there: a loyal nephew and friend, a torn soul between his dreams and his duties. And the cast embodies perfectly the characters.<br/><br/># 3. The key to evaluate an adaptation is that not only the fans loves it but also the new comers. And I have got 2 friends who likes Spiderman whereas they didn't even read comics !!!! So, if the Xmen is too complicated for the non-initiated, if Superman is too perfect, if Batman is too dark, Spidey is really the Number one of the super heroes in comics and in movies!!!"

","""Spider-Man"", while not quite the spectacle and extravaganza as its successor, is definitely something special, working freshly and effectively as a blockbuster, and as a human story of overcoming adversity. Peter Parker (Toby Maguire) is a beleaguered outcast who genetically transforms into a superhuman with spider senses, thus enabling him to become a superhero who nets criminal offenders in a web, while vigorously swinging from building to building above the streets of New York City. His nemesis is also one of his most loyal acquaintances, Norman Osborn (who becomes the notorious Green Goblin, wreaking havoc on his ""glider"" and combating the heroism of Spider-Man), his best friend Harry (James Franco)'s father, who promises, whatever Peter needs ""just give me a call"". Now all that is in need is a love interest and vulnerability for the impervious Spider-Man, and Kirstin Dunst plays Mary Jane Watson, the girl whom Peter Parker desires more than any other and whose life he ""has a knack for saving"". The action throughout the film is exhilarating and sensational, and watching Spider-Man exhibit his superhuman capabilities is nothing short of breathtaking, especially set amidst the interference of the ruthless Green Goblin. The story is deeper and more concentrated upon than what might be expected from a summer blockbuster, yet not nearly as personal or even engaging as ""Spider-Man 2"" two years later. The technical aspects of course are nothing short of marvelous, with the CGI entirely believable (if somewhat cartoonish, a feat much corrected in ""Spider-Man 2""), the music sensational and portentous to the spectacular action, and the editing of Spider-Man slinging high above the streets of New York, battling his nemesis the Green Goblin, and rescuing Mary Jane and a bus load of innocents is extremely effective and really builds the intense atmosphere the film is trying to convey with the action. Perhaps a major complaint can be had with the cliché and by-the-numbers script, which features some really cheesy one-liners such as ""You're not SuperMan you know"" and ""I was in the neighborhood""--- blah, blah, blah. Yet what a remarkable achievement ""Spider-Man"" really is, when it manages to be both an exhilarating, special-effects laden blockbuster, and a really human and somewhat captivating story, and as entertainment, it's a real web-spinner! ***1/2 out of ****"
"dunmore_ego","7","1","2","19 August 2004"," Hanging With The Big Boys
","From the web-woven opening credits to the last strains of the cartoon theme as the copyrights roll, Spiderman joins the pantheon of underpanted heroes whom the movie forum has portrayed as mightily as their bulging quadriceps (at this movie's release date, that being only Superman and Batman - the OG's).<br/><br/>Directed by Sam Raimi and starring Tobey Maguire, Willem Dafoe, James Franco and Kirsten Dunst's Breasts.<br/><br/>Spiderman's new movie franchise ambassador had to win over audiences in his first 5 minutes screen time, or go the way of Leno-chinned Nicholas Hammond, the vacuous, Gilligan-hairdo nerd of the late-70s TV series, The Amazing Spiderman, which was as exciting as swallowing chalk. Tobey Maguire, running after his bus, browbeaten by schoolmates, lamenting in voice-over his teen-age problems, was a winner right outa the gate! <br/><br/>An exhilarating feature of this film was the web-swinging (non-existent in the soporific Amazing Spiderman TV series, due to its technical difficulty). Movie technology has lent literal wings to stunts and visuals which were impossible in the days of Adam West running around with a Wile E. Coyote bomb over his head, or Reb Brown decimating the legend of Captain America throughout that whole ineffectual DOINK of a movie. Truly this is the correct era to begin making films of 'super' heroes, for only now can movie-makers convey a 'superiority' that George Reeves could never achieve by lying on a table and being chroma-keyed onto a swishing sky-scape.<br/><br/>Aficionados may lament that there *is* a CGI jerkiness to the man-spider's swinging - but this nonhuman factor somehow only enhances the arachnoid element in this 'spider'-man. It's a letdown, yes, knowing that Tobey is not even on screen when Spiderman is barreling along, but it's better than watching 'crooks' with pencil-mustaches shooting at George Reeves with their hats on, while he poses arms-akimbo-legs-apart, then crushes their guns like the movie-clay models they are ('one-trick-pony' in the dictionary, there's a picture of George Reeves as Superman).<br/><br/>In the 60's comics, Parker was bitten by a 'radioactive' spider  this was updated to 'genetically-mutated' spider, reflecting each era's fears and misunderstandings. The decision to have Spiderman internally generate his webbing seems more rational now, than his creation of web-cartridges in the 60's. It always intrigued me why Stan Lee (Spiderman's creator) balked at the webbing aspect, giving his young hero super-strength, an inexplicable 'spider-sense' and even the power to walk up walls (which should not be possible; stickiness of appendages is irrelevant, but rather volume-to-surface-area ratio allows insects this ability), yet no endemic webbing  a spider's trademark. (Spiders 'spin' their web via spinnerets located anally, so did Lee consider this and veto it?  and I suppose any superhero generating web from a butt-spinneret would lose most of the popcorn vote.) <br/><br/>Who better to play Spiderman's greatest arch-nemesis, the Green Goblin, than Willem Dafoe? Face carved from crazy and body ripped like Jesus in crucifixion pose, Willem OWNED this role. The kiddies might have relished Norman the Goblin in his techno armor suit (a deviation from the comics, though definitely an improvement on the purple and green sexually-indecisive Halloween attire), but my favorite scenes were Willem battling the Goblin Within; when he was simply - like John Malkovich  Being Willem Dafoe.<br/><br/>James Franco, as Dafoe's barely-tangible son and Peter Parker's almost-incorporeal pal, Harry Osborn, phoned in his role on a cellphone that kept cutting out. In the comic world, Harry wildly grabs the party reins when his father dies at Spiderman's hands, and becomes the second Green Goblin. By movie's end, Franco - in a valiant attempt to become three-dimensional - vows to make Spiderman pay for killing his dad, but I don't think any of us can visualize the fey Franco carrying the torch of Divine Wicked that came so rapturously naturally to Willem. Probably the biggest crime this wisp of smoke could perpetrate would be to join a boy-band and pretend to be The Hard One.<br/><br/>Can anyone deny the integral role played by Kirsten Dunst's Breasts?; ubiquitous, delinquitous, nasty-perky, herky-jerky, firm yet forgiving, relentlessly real, cruel but fair. Remember, dears: when walking home from work, *always take the darkest alleyways and wear no bra*. Flame-red locks, sotto voce delivery, camera unable to focus on anything BUT those mounds of necessity, those pillows of slavery. Spiderperve has the advantage that most of us who wear dark glasses indoors gainfully employ: behind that mask, we KNOW what he's looking' at! After impressing her by kicking white-rapper butt, he hangs upside-down passively, allowing her to ease his mask off his mouth, in the same manner she would ease dark-nylon stocking from betwixt milky thigh, rain streaming down his roundish head, delineating her pinkish curves, as they lock lips in a tongue-roving, erotogenic, nerve-jangling, storm-driven kiss, rivaling easily the heat of Scarlett & Rhett in Gone With The Wind, or Rourke & Basinger in Nine ½ Weeks, and even Christopher Reeve and Michael Caine in Deathtrap. The subliminal metaphor was not lost on this disciple of heady foreplay: Fear, Sweat, Violence, Surrender. And all of it  WET. The Human Procreation Arc.<br/><br/>Like the movie's slipshod ending, I have to wrap this essay suddenly (I've reached my word-limit, as Raimi probably reached his budget-limit). Kirsten Dunst's Breasts suddenly profess an irrationally-deduced 'love' for Parker, which is an essay unto itself, outlining the needless 'hope' this would instill in geeks who bag their comics who are NOT secretly superheroes: perpetuating the fantasy that a Pasty-Boy can Make Good if his Love is Real  well, boys, you'd better pray that somewhere out there, there's a radioactive ferret with your butt-cheeks' name on his teeth.<br/><br/>(Read this review unabridged at: www.poffysmoviemania.com/Spiderman.html)"
"lomticks_of_toast","4","1","2","16 April 2004"," totally over-rated
","Grade:  4/10<br/><br/>I've now seen this film approximately 30 times, and every time it comes on HBO I watch it, hoping I will like it more than during the previous viewing.  Alas, that is not the case.<br/><br/>This film can be viewed as 2 separate parts:  Peter Parker and Spiderman. The Peter Parker portions (say that 3 times real fast) are far and away the superior portion of the film.  I enjoyed Peter's interactions with Mary Jane - Maguire pulls off the shy, nerdy kid really well.  However, his relationship with Norman Osborn (Dafoe) always felt rushed and silly. Osborn tells him at the end, ""I've been like a father to you.""  Huh?  When did that happen, exactly?  They have perhaps 3 conversations throughout the film and they're very brief and businesslike.  I can't really imagine their relationship growing off-screen, either.<br/><br/>Another rush-job was Uncle Ben's death.  Peter gets about 1 minute to see his uncle die.  This could have been a very emotional moment in the film but I felt nothing, since their relationship wasn't explored enough, either. I guess it's excusable since the film was already very long, but Peter's relationship with Uncle Ben is what gives birth to Spiderman as we know him, so it should have been highlighted more.  I should mention, however, that the champion of goof, Mr. Stan Lee, has his Spiderman ""tag-line"" appear far too often throughout the film, ""With great power comes great responsibility.""  By the 3rd time I heard this I just groaned.  How melodramatic.<br/><br/>Then we come to the 2nd part of the film, the Spiderman portion.  At first everything's great as Peter learns to use his new powers. Unfortunately, it quickly transforms into a goofy-looking cartoon.  I can understand CGI when Spidey is swinging through the streets of NY, but why must we suffer it during street-fight scenes?  Spidey hops and floats around like he's 4 feet tall and fighting on the moon (is he related to Yoda or Gollum?).  No matter how good CGI gets (and it's NOT good, in my opinion, except with junk like spaceships), one thing the effects folks haven't figured out is realistic human dynamic movement and GRAVITY.  Perhaps, however, Raimi wanted Spidey to look like he had jelly-legs with springs inside...but I believe a talented gymnast and some well-choreographed rope-work (see for example the Matrix, but not crud like Charlie's Angels or Romeo Must Die - terrible rope work) would've looked a lot better, say, when Spidey fights off the punks trying to mug Mary Jane in the alley.<br/><br/>Last, we come to the Green Goblin, perhaps the corniest villain ever devised (second only to John Travolta's role as Terl in Battlefield Earth?). Everyone raves about Dafoe (and I personally enjoyed him in American Psycho), but he blows it here.  Sad to say I liked Nicholson as the Joker better than Dafoe as the Goblin.  The Goblin's dialogue is CHEESE, even to a five-year old.  Dafoe is much more effective in his Norman Osborn role, when he's talking to himself/the Goblin.  Also, his suit is ultra-goofy (designed for the military?!?!  How about Cirque de Soleil?) and the fact that the mouth on his mask is fixed made me feel like the Goblin's dialogue was overdubbed (maybe it was).  The overall effect is just plain silly.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to Spidey 2, but alas, it looks like the effects will be no better.  Oh, well, there's always Spidey 3, 4, 5..."
"chackers","Null","1","2","3 April 2004"," Humorless
","This is strictly a by-the-numbers plot, and utterly lacks visual flair (""Star Wars"" had more convincing special effects, and it's 25 years older!). I loved the cartoon when I was a kid, especially because Spiderman seemed to be the only superhero with not only a sense of humor, but a self-deprecating one at that (I don't think I was consciously aware of it at the time, but in retrospect, I realize that this is one aspect of the cartoon I enjoyed most). Toby McGuire's ""flat"" performances have worked well in other movies, but he has been miscast here: this rendition of Peter Parker/Spiderman is utterly humorless. And except for the extraordinary rain scene starring Kirsten Dunst's wet blouse, the movie isn't even worth watching even if someone else paid to rent it."

It tells of peter parker, a nerdy teen with a decent record who loves his cute next-door neighbor and is brilliant. He gets bitten by a radioactive spider in a demonstration and chance of fate, and develops powerful, cool powers like web-making, wall-crawling, and superstrength. When his uncle dies in an accident Peter refused to prevent, he put on a suit, and destiny awaited... SPIDER-MAN!!!!! However, he has to fight a villanous murderer in a cool, goblin armor suit, known as Spider-Man's most evil foe, The Green Goblin. It's a great movie. You should see it."

","Well, this film has its good points and bad points, the action sequences are well done and up to when Peter Parker actually 'becomes' Spider-Man it's actually a pretty good film.<br/><br/>However from there it descends into the type of bland movie that usually would go straight to video. This film features some of the most awkward and just plain bad acting I have seen in a big budget film, the scene in the hospital between Parker and MJ makes me wince every time I see it, in fact I just skip right past.<br/><br/>And the less we mention about the atrocious ""New York coming together"" scene at the bridge the better, it made me laugh out loud in the cinema.<br/><br/>As for the Green Goblin, without the suit Dafoe excels as the bad guy, and is wonderful, but once he dons that green armour, he turns into the type of caricature you expect to see in a Saturday morning cartoon.<br/><br/>Overall, this film isn't too bad, although I haven't really said many nice things about it, but the whole middle section of the film would be better left out, but thankfully in the age of the DVD we have the skip button."
"norbc","8","1","2","17 August 2003"," A cartoon springs to life
","Simply probably the best comic book hero movie made, translating to the screen much better than the earlier Superman or Batman epics. The acting is top-notch, the story line is fun and well-paced, and the computer graphics are excellent. What probably makes this so much better than the others, however, is the human qualities and frailties and doubts built into old Spidey -- his trademark. It brings him to life and makes him seem much less comic-bookish than other such heroes. It is indeed a three-dimensional character, rather than one- or two-dimensional. This one is just plain fun, guilty pleasure, with the bonus of being superbly written, acted and directed as well. May the sequels, when they arrive, live up to the standard set here!"
"SnobbyDude","9","1","2","20 July 2003"," Good, but not perfect
","This was a great movie.  I remember seeing it a couple of times in theaters and telling everyone to go see it.  The story is great-I thought the twist in the beginning was great where Peter Parker learns that ignoring his responsibility (with great power comes great responsibility) causes grief in his personal life.  I hear that this is similar to what happened to him in the comics as well, but I wouldn't know, having never read the comic.  I also loved the action scenes.  I understand that a lot of CGI was used, but I have no idea where it was used.  It's all transparent to me, so I think they did a pretty convincing job.  I'm glad that the action was fast and they didn't recycle that slow-motion action that was first seen in the matrix.  Watching someone leap in the air, have the camera stop, and pan is now a trick that has outstayed its welcome.  Fast action conveys a sense of urgency and excitement and is suits this movie.<br/><br/>There are a few strikes against this movie.  One thing I wasn't crazy about was the sugar-coated feel of it.  There are a number of scenes that feel like they were tweaked to lure in the teenaged girls.  I found myself cringing at some scenes that were a little cheesy and I didn't feel that happening in some of the other, more recent superhero movies.  It doesn't reach the heights of cheesyness that Titanic does, but I would have liked a more serious spiderman.  It doesn't have to be as serious as the Hulk or Daredevil, but maybe something in between would feel right.  I would also like a more interesting villain, with a real motive for his behavior.  The costume was a little silly too...I just wasn't afraid of him.  A good villain should instill fear in your heart.  Maybe these issue will be addressed in Spiderman 2.<br/><br/>I'd give this movie a 10 and subtract a point for some of the dialog and the power-ranger outfit of the goblin."

","This is easily the worst comic-book adaptation I have ever seen.  I didn't even make it through to the end.  Painful.  The visual effects and action sequences were pretty good.  Apart from Defoe,  the acting was painful, the dialogue was worse,  and the love story was sickening.<br/><br/>You would think that a boy who became a spider-man would have a bit of a dark side,  or have a little trouble adapting to this new life.  What do we get?  ""Oh well.  I guess I'd better make a costume...""<br/><br/>Pathetic.<br/><br/>Any stars I gave this movie were for Bruce Campbell."

For adults who like to think and appreciate good movies, this is nowhere near well done. Yes, Toby Maguire, Daniel Dafoe, and Kirsten Dunst were good. But I cannot say the same about the direction of Sam Raimi.<br/><br/>
Spiderman had enormous potential...but the way it was done, it was probably catered to 8 year olds!<br/><br/>First, ""with great power comes great responsibility"" is a rip-off from the Superman film where Superman's father tells him the same thing, and there are numerous sequences where the director didn't have the imagination nor the intelligence to bring something unique to spiderman ripping a lot of the scenes. The costume of green goblin was awful, I can't believe they did this in 2003 rather than 1950! The fight scenes are boring and unrealistic, climaxing in that bridge scene which was oh so predictable.<br/><br/>

I am surprised that veteran actor Willem Dafoe did such a terrible job as the Green Goblin, but still, he probably delivered the best performance.  Tobey Maguire smiles goofily as if he's a four year old who is trying to get onto his uncle's camera.  Kirsten Dunst's main acting ability is to whimper, that's all she does: whimper.<br/><br/>I am surprised that David Koepp, the screenwriter, penned such great scripts as Panic Room after this disaster.

"bsinc","6","1","2","13 June 2003"," What a hype
","It's a usual procedure to compare newly spawned comic-book based movies with Burton's ""Batman"" and rightfully so as it is only a small step away from perfection. After doing just this I came up with the following:<br/><br/>THE COSTUMES: Spidey's is great but the Goblin really does look like a badly done creature from the Power Rangers<br/><br/>THE MUSICAL THEME: As far as I'm concerned one of the most important parts of a comic-book based movie. Well I didn't really expect Elfman to surpass his Batmen theme, but the music in ""Spidey"" is hardly ever noticeable and besides sounding very similar to much of his previous work, lacks in atmosphere and should have been much more powerful and striking. One of Elfman's worst.<br/><br/>THE BIRTH OF A SUPER HERO: They wanted to show how ""Spidey"" came to be and I have no real complaints except for not making the most of it. The most enjoyable part of this movie for me was the part where Peter Parker is discovering his super powers. This movie was intended as the first of many so why didn't they take some more time to explore his newly given strenghts as they sure won't be able to do so later.<br/><br/>THE VILLAIN: Oh please, anybody can wear a mask, if they decided to go for the cheap, move-free mask they could have at least made it cooler looking. Dafoe didn't do it for me, he seemed to weak and sympathetic-looking to be a worthy, let alone dangerous opponent. <br/><br/>THE SPECIAL EFFECTS: They sucked in the trailers, they sucked in the movie. Some unnecessary scenes like the one where Parker is jumping from rooftop to rooftop are so bad I couldn't believe my eyes. There are some nice moments in the movie, no doubt, but even ""Superman(1978)"" , and notice the year of release made me want to fly. Spiderman made me want to kick the s..t from all those special effects ""artist"" because they did such a low standard job.<br/><br/>THE ACTION: To be honest I don't really remember any good action parts since they were all ruined by the special effects. Mediocre at best.<br/><br/>THE FEMALES: I don't find Kirsten Dunst to be very attractive, but she did an OK job. But I liked the kissing scene. Aunt May doesn't look like she's going to make it to the sequel.<br/><br/>THE REST OF THE CAST: J.K. Simmons is the only one worth mentioning for his portrayal of the ever cynical and spider-hating Jonah Jameson. He looks exactly like his character in the comics and the cartoon. It's one of those lucky casting marvels(like Hugh Jackman's Wolverine)<br/><br/>AND THE FRIENDLY NEIGHBOURHOOD HIMSELF: Well, Maguire's not bad at all, but as soon as an emotional scene arises I knew exactly why many people thought he was a mistake. He just looks so passive all the time and he has the most ridiculous cry, but I like his goofie scenes and expressions. Oh well, we're stuck with him for some time.<br/><br/>I guess I didn't really compare ""Spidey"" with ""Batman"", but all those enthusiastic Spidey fans would probably be furious if I did because it would be tough to spot a positive quality.<br/><br/>ANYWAYS, THE FINAL VERDICT: Although possessing some nice moments(all in the first half of the movie, where Parker is exploring himself) the movie lacks a solid (PG-13 free) script(and none of those ""We'll met again, Spiderman"" or ""You're out Goblin, out of your mind"". It's just not necessary!!!). I liked Raimi's ""Darkman"" much better, with all those cheesy effects and everything, because it had heart. ""Spiderman"" could have been spectacular, but wound up being a mediocre summer disappointment that earned itself over 400 million US dollars. 6/10"

super hero, Spider-man.<br/><br/>In the end Spider-man made the higher amount of money in box office sales.But that would probably be down to George Lucas's decision to only have his 'Attack of the Clones' screened in cinema theatres with digital sound.Spider-man never suffered from this restriction.But having said that this latest comic book based blockbuster is the better movie.Not that it's a great movie by any long stretch.It's just that Raimi first real blockbuster is a masterpiece in comparison.<br/><br/>The story centres on young Peter Parker(A fantastic Tobey Maguire).An eighteen year geek in his last year of school,the young lad lives a pretty humble life with his adoptive parents.His elderly aunt May(Rosemary Harris)and Uncle Ben(Cliff Robertson)are the only real family that Peter seems to have.If things were not hard enough for Peter, he is also the constant victim of the class room bullies who pick on him.His one and only true friend apears to be Harry Osborne(James

trip.While there, Peter who is a photographer for his schools news paper is taking photos of the inside of the building(as well as M.J.)when he is suddenly bitten by a radioactive super spider that had been bred by the labs scientists.The resulting spider bite gives Peter extrodinary powers.He becomes stronger,more agile and has special spider senses that can warn him of danger before it occurs.On top of that he can shoot special sticky web fluid from his wrists.But to top it all off, Peter can walk on walls just like any common household spider.It's only a matter of time before Peter becomes the costumed,super-heroic wall crawler that is Spiderman.<br/><br/>While this is going on Harry's old man,Norman is having some serious problems.His company Oscorp has designed a special suit of armour and a mechanical glider to be used by the millitary.It's with such tools as these that the United states defenders hope to create an army of the most powerful soldiers.The only setback is trying to find a human guinea pig who is willing to take a new drug the scientists have invented.The drug is supposed to increase a human specimens strength,stamiana and agility.But a series of tests on some labs rats have proved to be less than optimistic.While the rats did indeed become more powerful,they displayed signs of agression and turned on one another,leaving none alive.With the threat of the army deciding to turn to another company, Norman against the the strong protests of one of his chief scientists takes the drug himself.Wthe the most devastating of results!The effects of the drug leave the obsessed millionaire with a deranged alter ego.Another personality that is able to opress Normans better nature.Turning him in to a deadly merciless killer, who soon dons his own companys armour and uses it's armour to become the meniachal Green Goblin.<br/><br/>To reveal what happens next would be to reveal too much.Sam Raimi's take on the famous comic book character(co-created by Marvel comics founder,Stan Lee)is as far as I can tell,quite faithful to the comic.The odd change has of course been made to make it that bit more plausible.Peter himself does not create the special web fluid he uses in the comic.As I stated above, it come along with the rest of his powers.Plus he is not the every day mild mannered guy he was in the comic books.Here we have the story of the worm who turned.someone who for practically the whole of their life had been down trodden by unfeeling bullies only to amazingly be gifted the power to fight back and use this power to do good.It's a story I believe fashioned for your average comic book geek to relate.They know how it must have felt to be the one who was ridiculed and teased and the fantasy of being able to stand up and say, 'No i'm not gonna take this no more' I myself have dreamed of at some time in my life.It's fair to say that it works in the movies favour.<br/><br/>There are some nice touches of humor as well.The first scenes of Peter starting to come to terms with his powers are certainly quite rib tickling and theres the scene where he tries to make some extra money for himself by becoming a wrestler.Raimi's direction is pretty good as well but it's not perfect.Where as he is able to wring great, charismatic performances from the likes of Dunst and Maguire, not to mention much of the rest of the supporting players(Although Willem Dafoe is a tad too over the top)he fails in other areas.<br/><br/>Some of the special CG effets of Spiderman(especially the scene where Peter, in a cruder version of the costume is chasing a thief)look too false.Practically cartooney.The script could have been better as well.Because of the amount of back story involving both Spider-man and the Green Goblins creation (as well as the films running time of just under two hours)the end product climax when it arrives apears to be way too soon.The writers could have could added an extra fifthteen to twenty minutes of material.<br/><br/>As for the story.Don't try looking for one because they is hardly one at all.All we're basicly subjected to is the Goblins taunting of Spider-man and one violent showdown after another.Oh, and don't get me started on the Green Goblins costume.<br/><br/>In surmising, Spiderman is not a bad movie but could have been done a lot better.The chemistry between Maguire and Dunst and is certainly a brilliant ingredient to Raimi's mediocre cake.The pair perfectly define their characters.But if you ever get a special chance to see it on the big screen, don't bother.Wait for the DVD or video.Chances are it would be cheaper and more worth your while.I was lucky as I got to see it for free.<br/><br/>Robs Rating: * * *"

","I have been a huge fan of Spider-Man for as long as I can remember. When I first heard there were plans for a movie, I knew it was going to be amazing. Well, I'm amazed at the fact that I was wrong.<br/><br/>I don't know what in particular screwed this up so badly. I just can't put my finger on it. Maybe it's the fact that I expected this movie to truly amaze me, and my expectations were a little to high.<br/><br/>Five years ago, this movie would've amazed me. That is, it would've amazed me because I didn't recognize bad movies. Five years ago I didn't realize how truly bad Batman & Robin was. I guess this movie was made for kids, but they should've thought about the teens and adults who grew up with Spidey and thought that maybe he grew up too.<br/><br/>How could it have been better? Here are just a few suggestions:<br/><br/>
1) Don't change the bloody costumes or powers- the Green Goblin was NOT supposed to make me laugh, but it did. And what was the point of making web-shooting an integrated power instead of an invention?? If it came with the powers, realistically, it would come out of Peter's arse.<br/><br/>2) Make the movie darker. It's too happy; Spider-Man is supposed to be a little darker inside. There was way too little thought about Uncle Ben's famous words: ""With great power comes great responsibility"". Spidey is supposed to be dwelling on this philosophy waaay more.<br/><br/>3) It's a simple boy-meets-girl-and-falls-in-love-then-gets-superpowers plot, which even in the comics demonstrated little depth. I just thought maybe they could explore his uniquely teen mentality more, get into Peter's psychology. After all, his mind, flaws and truely human frailty is what attracted most of his fans.<br/><br/>Overall, the film just didn't go deep enough. But this is coming from a person who expects movies of this caliber to be really, really good. Overall, this is an okay movie to watch with pizza and some friends, and that's about it. I must admit, it's interesting to finally see Spidey in live action, and it'll be interesting to see Doc Oc and the Lizard on film (and possible Venom or Carnage in the third movie, which I'm sure they'll make). I give Spider-Man a 6 or 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>Hopefully they'll remake the Spidey movie in 20 years...I'll make it a personal goal to live to see a Spider-Man movie adaptation I truly love."

"cellomaster","Null","1","2","20 February 2003"," Horrible!
","One thing I will say about this movie- it didn't make me want to go out and read Spider-Man comics. Even though I am not a fan of the original webbed hero, I will say that I know enough about him to figure out that he wasn't correctly depicted in this film, especially considering this film was geared to the younger generation.<br/><br/>You know the story- geek wants pretty girl, big bad boy has pretty girl, geek gets bitten by a mutated spider and becomes super-hero who saves the day and shoots webbing from his wrists. Anonymous super-hero finally gets the girl, but at the last minute geeky super-hero turns down girl because of his super-powers. What utter nonsense.<br/><br/>My first complaint is that there was way to much unecessary violence in the film (i.e. especially at the end when the Green Goblin's abdomen was sliced and blood was shown flowing from his mouth as he..""died""). I was also pretty shocked at the numbers of young children that were in the audience. Second, even though I liked Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst in their respective roles, I thought the film was poorly-cast and badly written. The plot was so predictable. The ending was the worst. It was obviously an opening for a sequal. About halfway through the film, I wanted to get up and walk out.<br/><br/>I know about the next two planned sequals to this film, but I can asure you I won't be seeing either one of them."

","An extraordinary example of the superhero genre of action films -- it manages to create in the audience a sympathy with Peter Parker (Maguire), the high school student turned ""Spider-Man"", as well as a sense of shared, vicarious joy as spidey discovers his tremendous powers.  The movie is fun and funny, Raimi providing a fast-moving arena for the excellently realized CGI spidey to do his tricks (just watching it made me want to go buy the game for X-box, but I haven't gotten around to it yet).  He must face the Green Goblin, his classic foe, played to a 2-sided malicious tee by Dafoe, whose character doubles as a big-time weapons manufacturer.  Dunst and Franco are merely adequate.  <br/><br/>That rare kind of superhero film that left me itching for the sequel -- bring it on, Marvel!"

","I still have fond memories of Sam Raimi's surprising ""Dark Man"" so I had some hope for ""Spiderman.""  As Otto would say, ""Disappointed!""<br/><br/>Talk about slow-moving, but the worst aspect of this lugubrious effort is the villain.  Besides looking incredibly cheap, Willem Dafoe's ""Green Goblin"" is simply uninterestingly unpleasant.  Dafoe's a good actor, but let's face it, would you trust a guy that looks like him?  He has to act to make himself likeable.  Why any character would trust him in this movie is a mystery.  So we have bad casting, bad costume, cheesy effects when G.G. is onscreen.  The Spiderman CGI weren't special.  The only saving grace is watching Tobey Maguire, who can act, and Kirsten Dunst, who can act and is lovely to look at.  <br/><br/>No need for sequels, please!"

And appreciate the excitement over this movie.  But I fail to see where everyone can just give it a 10/10. It certainly can't get any awards for being a quality film.   The plot is a bit fuzzy.  The editing work is rather poor.  The acting is pretty good, but the costume for Williams Dafoe is idiotic.  Alot of the CGI work is extremely fake.<br/><br/>They didn't do much in way of production values for the dvd.  It's design in both technical and layout was created by a drunk.  With absolutely no hint on how to design a good menu system.  It does have a good share of easter eggs.  The CGI bloopers provide about a minute of laughs.  But the other 2 minutes are filler crap.  Shrek's CGI bloopers are better.<br/><br/>The majority of my 6/10 rating comes from the last 20 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>A majority of plot items are left explained.  Who made his nice gettup? You don't go from a moronic costume to this awesome suit without some sort of inspiration.<br/><br/>And the idiots at Columbia/tri star failed to respect Stan Lee (the creator of Spider Man).

","Quick rundown...the acting was well done,the casting was well done...the effects were well done...so what's my problem with it? The Green Goblin was so ridiculous looking to me I couldn't get around it. Not Willam DaFoe himself but rather the foolish costume they put him into. The Goblin glider was very good but what were they thinking with that costume? Another quibble with it I had was that the story didn't grip me at all. Being a Spidey fan for a long time now I knew nearly everything that would happen. If companies are going to tell these stories,they've got to have at least a few plotline surprises for the old time fans. Not a huge complaint enough to ruin it for me but I didn't really mind the whole 'Make Spidey a mutant' thing but I would have preferred had Peter Parker made his own web shooters,etc... XMen was a much better superhero adaptation.....and for the record,in print I'm a much bigger Spiderman fan than XMen."

Well i caved in rented it after seeing the part with uncle ben talking to peter in wallmart(aka hell). Was it as bad as i thought it would be? no. Was it good?no.<br/><br/>i'll admiit that im a bit of a reformed comicbook geek but, it wasn't the descrepency's with the comics that bothered me (with the one exception that peter stands his own with the tough guy at school, peter was still a loser in school. And would always think to himself ""if only they knew i was spiderman). It was the fact that is was poorly developed. One minute thay move to the city, the next he has a spider-man costume, aunt may cry's after her husbend dies for two seconds. does peter cry at all?<br/><br/>The ending is too blatent as well.<br/><br/>also. the green goblin is a p*** poor villian. if you'd like to see a good comic book movie watch tim burton's batman movies or the the first superman. Marvel's big budget x-men is equally as bad, and i have my doubts that good comic book will come out for some time.<br/><br/>I know these movies are suposed to be for kids but if they took a little more effort they could be enjoyed by adults too.<br/><br/>lord of the rings, both harry potter movies, and star wars ep 2 have all been on the top 250. none of these movies are really horrible but none of them have anything special about them. HEll the effects of these 50million plus movies arent even good. when you see computer graphics you think ""wow thats great"" although you can tell it was obviously done with a computer and sticks out from everything else thats going on.

","**Warning possible spoilers**<br/><br/>I just watched this movie today and I really liked it.  I didn't think it was too far out there.  Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man sounded like miscasting to me, but he pulls it off very well.  I hardly recognized Kiersten Dunst with red hair.  And Willem Dafoe definitely made me raise my eyebrows at first.  The scene where he talks to himself and realizes he is the Green Goblin is very well done.  I like the little jokes like where Norman says work was murder.  Bruce Campbell as the ring announcer.  A nice little piece of casting there.  Overall I felt like some parts of the movie dragged and I really couldn't get into it.  As the movie progresses things pick up.  The final fight scene was rather one-sided.  Spider-Man was getting whipped until right there at the end.  Am I the only one who felt half way sorry for Norman when he died?  His last words are don't tell Harry.  He tries to protect his son from knowing that his dad was a killer. Apparently it doesn't work because Harry goes on to become Green Goblin #2. The final scene is perfectly played even if it is something I've seen before.  Girl wants boy.  Boy wants girl but knows anyone who gets close to him will suffer or possibly die.  I could be wrong but doesn't MJ die in the comic books?  When Spider-Man pulls her back up with his web her neck is broken from the force of the fall and sudden stop at the bottom.

I thought the Spiderman actor was a little young, but maybe he's supposed to be.  But why do they call him Spiderman, and not Spiderteenager?

","Being hearing impaired, I ahd to pick up the DVD version of Spider-Man (2002) in order to get my first viewing of the film.  I was a comic-book geek in the early 1990's, I was a film-fan that followed the legal battles to get ""Spider-Man"" made on the big screen.  I lobbied for people to give Tobey Maguire a chance as Peter Parker because I was a fan of his and I thought he deserved a shot at showing Peter Parker in his full splendor....<br/><br/>That being said, this film pained me to watch it.<br/><br/>When watching comic book adaptations, one lists Superman, Batman and X-Men as some of the quality cinematic versions of the Comic genre...  Superman put the Man-of-steel into reality, Batman took us the comic book with it's overall production, and X-men mocked itself in order to give a realistic twist to the fantasy.    Spider-man does a good job of staying true to some origins and has scenes that are very campy and make you feel like it's a cinematic version of a Comic Book.  There are too man flaws in the film however -- the painful-to-watch Kristen Dunst as Mary Jane Watson and her carpet-bagging with boys (oh yes, she is beautiful, yes she is talented - but her smile looked painful and part of her performance I enjoyed most was the rain-soaked scene), Tobey as Peter Parker/Spiderman who I couldn't quite get behind and couldn't quite believe as the nebish and socially inept Parker, and the a-bit-too-CGI Spider-man shots (that were a necessity).<br/><br/>With all this negativity, I need to give a nod to James Franco and Willem Dafoe for their portrayals of Harry and Norman Osborne (respectively). Those were characters I got behind....  The antagonist (Dafoe) and his not-quite-good-enough son (Franco).  It's very disenchanting when you can get behind the villian before the hero.<br/><br/>Suffice it to say, I am very dissappointed in ""Spider-Man"" as a motion picture.  After nearly 20 years of studios feuding to get the right to make this movie, you would think that they would have done a better job with the script, with the characters and with the direction of the film."

Where you the viewer are in on the secret, and kind of hoping that M.J can figure it out.  The special effects were mostly great.

If I were the casting director, I might have picked someone other than Tobey MaGuire. But the chemistry between MaGuire and Kirsten Dunst is undoubtably what landed them the parts. Also, William Dafoe is no Jack Nicolson (as the Joker) no question. But then who is as great as Jack -- NOBODY!  And, compared to Batman, this script was written for a younger audience. But ya know what? You could also argue Tim Burton's Bruce Wayne was too dark and mysterious. You couldn't help but like Sam Raimi's Peter Parker.  But if you take Batman and Superman and put it on a shelf, and look at Spiderman for it's own value, this movie is genuinely good clean fun! The special effects just blew me away. It raises the bar for movie makers.  I can't wait for the sequel."

","Unless you have something against refined acting, intelligent story design, screenplays intended for 12-year-olds, or you simply happen to LOVE Spider-Man, this is a movie you can probably do without. While the movie did have its few moments, the vast majority of the 2 hour flick seemed reminiscent of a glorified action-figure commercial. If you're seeking intelligent entertainment, go see ""Cider House Rules"" or something where Toby Mcguire isn't blatantly wasting his talent."
"PlanecrazyIkarus","Null","1","2","27 September 2002"," Overhyped, overrated, over-everything
","Spiderman finally hit the screens this year, after a long wait and some CGI corrections to get the World Trade Centre out of it. And the longer the wait, the more eager people became to see it. When it was finally released, Hollywood seemed to celebrate, critics seemed to hail it and everyone was happy.<br/><br/>Everyone, that is, who does not mind watching a rubbish movie. The story of a geeky teenager who finds out that he has superpowers has been done before (Superman, X-Men). And, in light of recent comic adaptations, it was bound to be popular. However, there is little more to this story, apart from a vague wave at a Disney-esque ""moral of the story"".<br/><br/>So, let's compare this movie with X-Men. That movie was visually impressive, but I left the cinema feeling slightly unsatisfied. On second watching, I liked it better, because of all the visual style and the consistency, and the slightly darker edge of the characters. And perhaps I'm partial to the entire ""segregation against mutants"" backstory. How does Spiderman compare? It's pretty much the opposite. I left the first viewing feeling slightly bored and disappointed, but on second viewing I struggled to finish the movie. Too numerous and too blatant are the flaws. Ranging from overly traditional plotting with ultra-old-fashioned story features, to the kind of silly dialogue one would expect a six-year-old to write. One can almost see the producer's checklist: - embarassing discovery of superpowers? check - obvious, predictable humour? check - kid avenging death? check - Spidey-catching-lots-of-criminals montage sequence? check - dangers of careless scientists? check - helpless Damsil in Distress? Check, double check and triple check. - big showdown? check<br/><br/>The entire movie feels like a mixture of Superman (the newspaper setting, the powers, the geeky alter-ID), X-Men (the critical perception of the (in-movie) general public) and Batman (avenging relatives plot). In the 70s, such a movie would have been acceptable. But in 2002?<br/><br/>Spiderman is, and will always be, a kid's movie. It is a serious alternative to Harry Potter. But please, please don't pretend that adults can enjoy this embarassingly simple-minded, stupid stuff!"

","Kudos to director Sam Raimi for giving the human touch to the popular comic book hero. The story is interesting enough and the action moves the story at a good pace. Tobey Maguire is well suited for the part of Peter Parker, but I'm having trouble with him transforming into Spider-Man. Willem Defoe is great as the Green Goblin/Norman Osborn. I am most impressed with Kirsten Dunst and even get a kick out of the red hair. It is also good to see veteran actor Cliff Robertson working again. Over all, the movie is very entertaining. Amazing F/X and the Danny Elfman score deserve credit for this movie's success. I hate to say that SPIDER-MAN is not my choice for this summer's blockbuster. A pretty good movie, but to me not a 'knock your socks off' flick."
"Andy Stehr","2","1","2","9 May 2002"," Bitter disappointment
","I was looking forward to seeing Spider-Man for months, and when I finally got to see it, I was bitterly disappointed.  I felt the plot was overly complicated, the characters had no motivation for most of their actions, and the special effects seemed silly instead of amazing.  I thought the acting was great, and I thought the first twenty minutes of the film were pretty good, but then things went down hill fast.  I'm really baffled because everyone else I talked to loved it.  I just wanted to voice my dislike of the movie, so all the other people out there who didn't like it know they are not only.  By the way the comics have been excellent lately."
"stamper","9","1","2","20 July 2002"," Spidey rules New York and the world
","It had been a long time since I had seen something of my beloved superhero Spiderman. I'd grown to love the Spider man TV, but I quit watching it, after I'd seen them all twice or so. I then later saw, that they were still making new ones, but I have to say, I'd kind of grown out of animated series. I never started do dislike the animated show, but you kind of grow out of all TV shows, because they run for much too long. This even happens when you love the show. You just can't help it. And after a while you start forgetting about your once loved ones' and you turn your head to new things. Yesterday I turned my head to a new old thing'. I turned my head to the Spider Man movie.<br/><br/>
This movie was supposed to be big. It had made about 750 million  at the Boxoffice and it was listed among the best 250 movies at IMDB, but still I had my doubts. Why you ask? Well, I'd seen some of the music video's and they gave me the impression that the effects were really bad and that the film would be like Blade, a two hour music video. How wrong was I?<br/><br/>
First of all, none of the songs from the Spider Man Soundtrack are featured in the film, like it is done in the Blade films. The songs can be heard in the background, playing on a radio or so. Second of all, although the effects were bad, I did not mind a bit, since the movie was so awesome, that I did not even notice most of the time.<br/><br/>
What was great about the movie, you might ask? Well I can tell you what was not in a nutshell: the effects. The rest was pure genius and truly inspired by the comics and the animated series. First of all I have to give credit to the casting bureau. All of the parts were casted really well. Everyone fit in like a glove. Then credits of course go to the director (Sam Raimi) and the cast. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) came over as a real big nerd (even worse than I remember him in the animated series), M.J. Watson (Kirsten Dunst) was very gorgeous, charming and likeable and Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe) was really great as well. The scene, when he's talking to himself in the mirror was really great. The grimaces he made, from one shot to the next, were really awesome.<br/><br/>
The director must also be credited, for bringing everything fabulously to the screen. I mean, there was nothing really innovative about it, but he was very solid and knew exactly what he needed and wanted. Last but not least I think I owe my thanks to the writers and to Danny Elfman. The writers of this film really succeeded in making up a story and dialogue in the film, that capture the figure that is Spider Man. He is a boy, who could be me (if he looked different). He was very human, a bit shy around magnificent beautiful women, a bit of a loner but basically a very nice guy. Then he gets to have extraordinary power. What is he to do? What will he become? What will happen to his loved ones? Throughout the film we observe the evolution of Peter Parker to become Spider Man. We see what power his new found strength brings and what responsibility. We see his powers upside, but also it's downside. So despite Peter Parkers nonhuman strength he remains a very human and normal figure which the viewer can relate to and that is what makes Spider Man such a great comic figure. A very big thanks to everyone involved for giving me the best two cinematic hours in a long time.<br/><br/>

"iamito","2","1","2","3 July 2002"," Weak Adaptation to the Big Screen
","Sam Raimi is a great entertainment director but he is not very good at adapting comic books. You can look at it from this angle: Tim Burton and Batman - that's a great adaptation to the big screen from a comic book! It had the essence of the heroe, the smart dialogues, the gothic environment, the proper casting... Spider-man is on a completely different scenario. It is a ""typical holywood money making"" film with weak plot, uninteresting scenarios... The problem starts with the main actor: Tobey Maguire - he's the ideal image of the well mannered boy with an inocent smile. He doesn't portray properly the ""Marvel"" Peter Parker! What we see in ""Spider Man"" (2002) is a Hollywood Peter Parker, developed in order to look as much ""audience friendly"" as possible. The movie has very weak dialogues - some are so irrealistic that they become pathetic -, there's an unbalanced use of special effects... This is a movie to sell, not to tell the story of the real Spider Man. It even distorts some facts about Peter Parker's powers and how he got them! This is a movie to see with lots of pop corns."
"hazzers","9","1","2","3 July 2002"," Don't tell Harry, but Spider-Man was AMAZING!
","Believe it or not, I was actually looking forward to Spider-Man. A lot. I'll admit, I'm certainly not a comic book person, but the cartoon was brilliant. Since all this hype about Spider-Man began, I had to go out and buy a huge hardback book documenting just about every major storyline that was ever featured in the comic books. <br/><br/>Before I went to the film, I knew it'd be good. How could it not be? Surely just having Spider-Man in it would be enough. There's something about him that makes him the coolest super hero (by far). Maybe it's because he's young, different, interesting. Look at Super Man. Boring job, boring life. And how he has the cheek to think a pair of glasses is somehow a 'brilliant' disguise, I'll never know. At least Spider-Man has the decency to cover up a bit. <br/><br/>Going in already expecting it to be fantastic could be a problem. I was a little concerned that I'd think it was good when it really wasn't. Although I don't think that was a problem, in the end. A lot of hype, yes - but not over-rated (unlike 'Bored' of the Rings). <br/><br/>So, for anyone who's been living in a cave all their life, here's a brief outline of the story. Peter Parker is in his senior year of high school, and is a bit of a science whiz. He has a deep crush on his next-door neighbour, Mary-Jane Watson, and his best friend is Harry Osborn, whose father owns Oscorp Industries. He lives with his Uncle Ben and Aunt May, who are a couple in their late sixties (although it's not mentioned in the film, Peter Parker's parents were apparently killed when he was very young). Peter is often ridiculed at school and people regard him as a bit of a nerd. One day, on a science trip, Peter is bitten by a genetically modified spider. The next day he finds the spider has given him 'Spider Powers' including the ability to scale walls, shoot webs and detect danger with his 'spider sense'. While this is going on, Norman Osborn, owner of Oscorp Industries, is conducting a test on himself to show his chemicals work successfully. However, exposing himself to these chemicals turns him into the evil Green Goblin...<br/><br/>The storyline itself is very different and new. Although the storyline has existed for years, what Raimi, Lee et al did with it created a pretty decent film. The camera work was fantastic, which ranged from over-head action shots to intense emotional close-ups. The special effects were flawless. Particularly when the Green Goblin gatecrashed the Oscorp Unity Fair, the scenes of Spider-Man and the Green Goblin battling were incredibly realistic. You could tell a lot of the conventions had been drawn from recent films, such as The Matrix. However, this film itself has set a lot of conventions. Sam Raimi was an excellent choice for the director of this film. He managed to take small, insignificant actions, and turn them into the most memorable scenes in the film. The blood drip from Spider-Man's fight wound is just so inventive and the camera work and special effects make that scene so suspenseful and intense. 'Spider-Man' creates a wide range of emotions - sometimes you'll be staring open-mouthed and engrossed at the action, and other times your heart will be breaking at the grief.<br/><br/>Before I went to see this film, I was warned about Tobey Maguire's role of Spider-Man. After seeing it, I can't understand what everyone was complaining about - I honestly can't think of anyone better to play Spider-Man. They needed someone fairly unknown to play Spider-Man, so that they could develop his character from a clean slate. He had the perfect 'nerdy' look at the start (I was a little worried it'd be a typical case of the actor who only needs to remove his glasses in order to be considered attractive...), and definitely stood out next to all the other male characters in the film. Very suited to the role. He even managed to pull off those classic Spider-Man wisecracks. Look out for the ""Nice costume - did your husband buy it for you?"" when he's wrestling with Bonesaw McGraw. Unfortunately, these wisecracks become a lot more sparse as the film becomes more serious. <br/><br/>As for Kirsten Dunst, I think she did well, but I was a little unhappy about Mary-Jane's character (see below). Her performance did seem genuine and believable, and luckily, the red hair dye didn't look too fake...<br/><br/>Star role was Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin. He suited the role perfectly, and was easily flitted between the good guy and the bad guy. I also liked J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, but it would've been nice to see a little more of him in this role.<br/><br/>For any die-hard comic book fans, the question might be how true did the film stay to the old comic books? Okay, so I'm not a die hard fan, and probably have no place to comment, although I did read the hard back book from cover to cover, and have familiarised myself with the storylines a little. Obviously it would be impossible to stick to the exact storylines that evolved in the comic books. This didn't create too much of a problem, except that there wasn't much room for Spider-Man to develop. In the comic books, there were a few editions of him discovering his powers, fighting a few petty criminals, etc, before he moved onto fighting the big ones. There's no way the film could digress for half of it, before finally introducing the Green Goblin. It was a little cheesy and unconvincing that both Peter Parker and Norman Osborn happened to transform at the same time, as well. However, I think it was generally handled well.<br/><br/>Everyone should know that Spider-Man does not actually have the ability to shoot webs, but in the film he does. I can't really say why this is, but I get the feeling that his character is slightly different to the Spider-Man in the comic books. Once Peter Parker left high school, he never seemed to mention science much anymore. I think perhaps they were trying to give him a 'cooler' image, and breakaway from this 'nerd' persona. If Peter Parker had had the knowledge to actually create this webbing fluid, it might have given him a less of a 'cool' and 'macho' image. <br/><br/>I also have to say that I wasn't too impressed with Mary-Jane in this film. In the cartoon and comic book, she was far more forward and confident. In the film she seemed a little more insecure and subdued, despite being popular. Kirsten Dunst did say ""Tiger"" on one or two occasions, but it didn't really look right coming from her character. I was more expecting her to say lines like ""Let's face it Tiger, you just hit the jackpot!"", giving her a cheeky, almost arguably arrogant character. She was quite different in the film. <br/><br/>There were a few other points too, like the way in which Spider-Man and the Green Goblin were created - these processes seemed to be changed slightly to make it more modern, and realistic. Well all know too that Uncle Ben was killed by a burglar - the film modernises this to a car-jacking. And, if I'm right, wasn't it Mary-Jane's Aunt Anna, who lived next door to Peter's Aunt May? Yet, in the film, it was Mary-Jane herself who lived next door to Peter. And it was Aunt May and Aunt Anna who set them up on a blind date, rather than Peter secretly carrying a torch for Mary-Jane.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I feel that creating a film which matched the comic books exactly was quite a tall order. Some parts of the film suffered, because it was hard to cover all the important aspects of Peter's life in two hours. However, I cannot imagine this task being approached any better way. It might've been better if it was a little longer, as, at times, it felt a little rushed. I must say though - a truly fantastic film, full of surprises and excitement. Don't wait for it to come out on DVD - it was an amazing experience watching it on the big screen, and you'll be thoroughly thrilled from start to finish.<br/><br/>The ending was absolutely amazing. I won't give anything away, but it was left very much wide open, and was very unexpected - in more ways than you might think! It's fairly obvious they'd always planned to make a 'Spider-Man 2' as well, so I can only hope the sequel is just as good.<br/><br/>One thing's for sure: it was waaaaaaay better than Batman..."
"BravesPaul","8","1","2","18 June 2002"," Easily my favorite of the year... when I saw it.
","Despite the hype, I actually expected the movie to be good -- not great, not bad, just good. I expected the acrobatics to be cheesy and annoying, and (most of all) I expected the villain to be so cheesy that I wouldn't believe in his threat. The ""Green Goblin"" just didn't appeal to me in the trailers. I compared the villain to Montgomery Burns (The Simpsons) in my head on several occasions before seeing the movie, just for the childish, it-could-never-happen feeling he gave me.<br/><br/>However, after actually watching the movie, all of that subsided. Tobey was great, Kirsten was great, Willem was great. Given that Spider-Man is a fantasy/action flick, Raim and friends actually made a darn good movie -- easily my favorite of the year (was there ever any doubt?) at the time...<br/><br/>At least until Star Wars was released. Now I'm faced with the problem of deciding whether I liked Episode II for Episode II, or because I love the idea of the entire Star Wars universe so much. Either way, Spider-Man is much better as a standalone film, and hopefully it has kicked off a healthy string of successful Spider-Man films in the future."
"bithok","2","1","2","11 June 2002"," Disappointingly far from the original thing
","This is not the spiderman which adventures I used to read, 15 to 20 years ago, this is just another american block buster. Despite an outstanding music (you just can't deny Danny Elfman's talent), you will wait a long time until something funny or breathtaking happens... And it won't. This Peter Parker is not half-nerdy as the one I read about was, he spends a long time learning his own skills instead of going out to save lives, he fights against his college friend Flash Thompson while the original one would just hide his powers. He refuses MJ's love at the end while Peter Parker was just dying for her... So what ? They modified the plot, the hero, even Aunt May is not the same kind as in the original books : she's strong and red-blooded while the original one was thin and sweet. Spider-Man is IMHO not DVD-able, I can't risk wasting 2 hours one more time in front of such a bad movie. But if you loved the X-Men movie, you may then adore this one."
"Chris_Docker","7","1","2","10 June 2002"," If only all comic book heroes filmed this well . . .
","Spider-Man, the movie, knew what it needed to do and got on with it. As a sci-fi comic-strip action adventure adaptation this is one of the best. I am reminded of the tagline ""With great power comes great responsibility"" when I see how vintage director has handled the special effects. They are colourful, emphasise the story rather than their own technical mastery and have a beauty to them that is almost choreographed in its appropriateness. Tobey Maguire, irresistibly cast as the young lad who grows up to discover he is ""Spider-Man"" takes to the skies with all the joy of an adolescent with a new toy. Kirsten Dunst is melt-in-the-mouth as MJ. The transition from comic book to celluloid is effortless and an achievement within the genre, with the assistance of veteran writer David Koepp (Panic Room, Stir of Echoes, Mission Impossible, Jurassic Park to name just a few). Of course, Spider-Man, no matter how well done, is not everyone's cup of tea. Nevertheless, it leaves Batman, Superman and even X-Men standing."
"NoArrow","Null","1","2","30 April 2004"," I would like to retract my earlier statement; ""Spider-Man"" isn't all that bad...
","In my previous review of ""Spider-Man"" I unfairly listed all the bad things about it and gave it a 3.5 out of 10, which is really too low a rating. Though this is by no means a great film, it's not very bad either.  The plot - obviously - focuses on Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), a high school nerd, who is bitten by a radio active spider and gains spider powers.  He uses them to fight crime, make money and woo is long-time crush Mary-Jane (Kirsten Dunst).  Meanwhile Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe) - a high-ranking millionaire/scientist - has gained some super human abilities of his own, and become ""The Green Goblin"", a crazy high-flying super villain whose motives are never really made known.<br/><br/>First I'll start by saying that when I wrote my review last year I hadn't seen many Raimi films yet, but no that I have I understand his style and the type of comedy he uses.  He's a lot like Joel and Ethan Coen, you have to recognize their entire body of work or else one movie may seem a little too odd to you.<br/><br/>I also complained about the action, and I'm sticking too that argument. Maybe it's just me, but I hate it when all the action in a film is computer generated.  I love watching movies where I know that the actors or stuntmen really did do what's shown on screen (""Kill Bill"", ""The Matrix"") instead of just a guy at a desk clicking a mouse and typing keys.  Of course, there are a few exceptions - 2003's ""Hulk"" for example - but ""Spider-Man"" isn't one of them.  Of course, action doesn't make a film.<br/><br/>The acting in ""Spider-Man"" varies with the actors and characters.  Maguire is completely miscast as Parker, he doesn't capture the smoothness of the character of the comics.  The writing is somewhat to blame too I guess, but the way Maguire speaks his lines is just awful.  As for the others, well, like I said, it varies.  Dafoe is admirable as Osborne, he makes a good villain, and Dunst gives another great performance (the best of the movie) as MJ.  The supporting players, James Franco, J.K. Simmons, Cliff Robertson all do pretty well too.<br/><br/>In the end this is merely an enjoyable yet mediocre super-hero film, but nothing compared to the greats (""Batman Returns"", ""X-Men"", ""Hulk"").  The fact that it has a rating of 7.4 while the three other films I've mentioned are getting lower bugs me.  To me, this movie is a 6.5/10."
"jmyoung","8","1","2","8 May 2002"," Good storytelling.
","This is primarily a response to Mr. Bunch's opinion.  As both a long time comic book fan as well as movie buff, I have to say I am tired of people that exalt style over substance.  Batman does not even come close to this movie.  In general, while Burton's films look good, they are primarily all style and no substance (with a couple exceptions such as Ed Wood and the Nightmare Before Chistmas).<br/><br/>This movie actually had a STORY and a PLOT.  That it is not to say that I thought it was perfect. I agree that Dafoe's performance was a bit over the top and some of the dialog sounded like it might have come from a 60s comic. Further, some of the CGI did not come off perfectly and the laws of physics seemed to be ignored in a couple of cases (the cable car scene especially).<br/><br/>
However, Raimi blows away Burton when it comes to telling a story.  Evil Dead II is an alltime classic.  Also, the Gift and the Quick and the Dead were both fine movies (though I don't think either was great).<br/><br/>
Raimi is also good at characterization.  I don't see how anyone could knock Maguire's performance, or Dunst's for that matter.  They actually portrayed characters.  Keaton's acting in Batman was defined by his lack thereof. And I like Keaton.<br/><br/>This movie is up there with the original Superman movie for all time great comic adaptations, and it is not as corny."

","I am reading these other reviews and so many people are calling this movie amazing. I have to say that it was entertaining. I do not feel like I wasted my money, and I cheered on Spidey/Peter with the rest of the audience. But the Green Goblin was REALLY corny. Willem Defoe is a great actor, but what could he do with those terribly scenes talking to the mask etc.? The best part of the movie was Peter's self-discovery of his new abilities. The basic good vs. evil part of the plot flopped in my book. I haven't been to a movie in a long time where I actually rolled my eyes and laughed at how stupid some things were, especially dialogue. Laughing at a ""serious"" line is not a good thing. I will go see the obviously-on-its-way sequel, but probably not on the first weekend. Does this replace the classic Superman? I don't think so. Does this rate against other great movies like Crouching Tiger (like another reviewer suggested)? You HAVE to be kidding! I was, however, intrigued by the preview for The Hulk directed by Ang Lee. Interesting..."

I didn't buy the way spidey spun about town at all and the Kirsten Dunst stuff was just plain pointless.  For a brief moment it looked like the spidey and his uncle scene might actually go someplace and then we have the typical plot development (I wont give it away...but its easily guessed!).

The special effects were awesome, but to an extent I think I've come to expect that and I think the days when a movie can survive just on it's special effects are over. I can't say I'm a great comic book fan, but the Batman movies struck me as superior to this one. Some of the problems - Peter Parker suffers a number of horrific losses in the film, but his reactions are so downplayed and wooden - its hard to believe he really gives a damn.  MJ was OK but seems so shallow, dating an obnoxious ass presumably because he has a hot car - hard to find much sympathy for her. I think the last straw was (possible spoiler) when Peter's best friend decides that he hates spiderman and is going to seek revenge.

The movie to me was based around a weak plot and was fueled by several action scenes full of special effects to draw the viewer away from the non-existent plot.  This movie is your typical corny, hero vs. arch enemy movie.  If the first 90 minutes of the movie do not convince you of this than the ""exciting"" and ""suspenseful"" ending will convince you.  Within this worthless movie there is one thing worth noting.  That is the performance of William Dafoe.  Dafoe is the perfect and maybe the only actor who could of pulled off his portrayal of the Green Goblin.  But overall don't waste your time or money, because this movie is terrible."
"zetes","8","1","2","5 May 2002"," Rare summer blockbuster that not only lives up to expectations but surpasses them
","Frankly, a serious, realistic film version of Spider-Man is an impossibility. How, pray tell, does one make a movie with a character like The Green Goblin or Dr. Octopus without making the audience laugh? That's why Sam Raimi was the absolute perfect director for the Spider-Man movie. He's got the most uncanny ability to entertain the heck out of the audience while they are laughing at how tremendously silly the whole thing is. This comes from the Evil Dead section of his career.<br/><br/>Now, from the more recent side of his career, like The Gift and A Simple Plan, Raimi brings the ability to people Spider-Man with good characters. Some of them are straight from the comic book, sure. Rosemary Harris' Aunt May is a perfect version of that character. And Willem Defoe's Osbourne/Green Goblin. He's so cartoonish, well, let me reserve a special place later on to talk about Defoe's performance.<br/><br/>Now, Peter Parker, Mary Jane, and Harry Osbourne (Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco respectively) are amazingly well realized. I did the same double take that everyone else did when they heard that Tobey Maguire was cast as Spiderman. Huh? That kid from The Ice Storm? Well, he's been very good in several movies (he was also poorly cast in a few movies, too, especially The Cider House Rules), and Raimi obviously cast him because of his acting skills. He could have went for the kid from Dawson's Creek or something, but he was right to get someone who could actually act. Kirsten Dunst may be the most underrated actress out there right now. She's been in some for-the-money projects, surely, and this is another one that'll pay her big. But in the meantime she lands some great roles, things like The Virgin Suicides and Crazy/Beautiful. Even the weak stuff she improves simply by her presence. Spider-Man isn't one of her best performances, but she's good. I like the early stuff, her problems with her terrible parents. It's actually kind of disappointing that they leave that character baggage almost completely behind Mary Jane after they graduate and move into the city. She is more or less relegated into the role of damsel in distress at that point. James Franco, who plays Harry Osbourne, is exceptional. I believe that his character becomes a super villain in the comic book, and that suggestion is left with us at the end of this film. He projects a lot of personality, more than his character actually has in the script.<br/><br/>Now for Willem Defoe. No, he's not bad. Exactly the opposite. This is where the film goes way over-the-top, deliciously so. The Green Goblin is a great villain. He's nearly at the same level as Jack Nicholson's The Joker. Willem Defoe has a ton of great scenes, both as Osbourne and as The Green Goblin. I love the seen where he has a conversation with his evil mirror reflection. Critics are kind of complaining about Defoe's performance, but I think it's perfect for the film.<br/><br/>Another great comic-book performance comes from J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, the newspaper publisher with whom Peter Parker sells his Spider-Man photographs. His scenes are the best in the film. Hope he has even more next time!<br/><br/>My only real complaints about the film are the generous steals from the first Tim Burton Batman film (the balloon parade attack) and The Matrix (the fire sequence). There are so many inventive sequences that it's unfortunate that they couldn't come up with two more original ones.<br/><br/>Spider-Man, despite its small flaws, is the perfect example of summer entertainment. I am seriously considering seeing it again in the theater, something I never do for this kind of film. It's probably the only time that I walked out of the theater wondering why the sequel was taking so long to make!<br/><br/>Word to Raimi fans: both Bruce Campbell and Ted Raimi. They both have hilarious cameos."

","As usual, no over-hyped film can meet my expectations, but the more I think about ""Spider-Man"", the better I think it is.  <br/><br/>First, the good points: The acting is good, the story is strong and the effects are great(though at first they seem a little fake). Once Spidey and the Green Goblin started fighting I was in heaven. The film also makes some good changes from the comic, like Pete not making the webshooters, and the pivotal scene with Uncle Ben is done more believably.<br/><br/>Now the bad points: Too much build-up. The film is more than half over before we see a fully-costumed Spider-Man. It seems like he's only in the last 45 minutes or so. Unfortunately, that's when the film really kicks into high gear, and it's too little too late. I enjoy a good story too, but like 1989's ""Batman"" we see too little of the hero. I hope the sequel will make up for it. If the film had another half hour or so of Spidey in action, it would have been great.<br/><br/>Overall, a good but not great comic adaptation. Better than Batman or the X-Men, but not as good as Superman. 8 out of 10."

","This is going to sound like a typical fanboy review, but I just saw a sneak peak of Spiderman, and I found it to be simply Amazing.<br/><br/>Each member of the cast was perfect for their role, specifically Willem Dafoe, who played the insanity role of the Green Goblin quite well. Tobey Maguire was an unexpected surprise, able to show both sides of the Spidey costume with ease. J.K. Simmons filled the always-fun role of J. Jonah with his own unique style - not at all like the Mr. Jameson we've seen in every other Spidey series before, but still enjoyable.<br/><br/>Others have said that the screenplay was trite and overplayed. I disagree. I thought the story was very typical for a Spiderman-themed anything, but it served it's purpose as the basis of a (hopefully) long-term movie series. The next installation in this series will be more unique and originally, one would have to assume.<br/><br/>I thought Stan Lee's minor cameo was unexpected, and in fact, it sounded like I was the only one in the theater to spot him. I won't spoil it, so that you can find The Man for yourself.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the movie for what it was, an action-packed, somewhat dramatic, well-made summer blockbuster. I highly recommend this movie to those of all shapes, sizes, and ages!<br/><br/>8/10"

"rookie-8","Null","1","2","3 May 2002"," Terrific
","After last summer, in which more movies left you with an empty, almost annoyingly apathetic feeling when you left the theatre, it is wonderful to leave feeling good again. Feeling as if the now $9 it takes to get in and see one of these event movies is worth while. Spiderman works for me because of one simple fact, a fact I had had great reservations about before entering this film, and that fact was; Tobey McGuire.<br/><br/>I have always been a fan of Tobeys work, I loved Wonder Boys, found some nice things to like in Cider House Rules, and have always found McGuire to be refreshingly real. He never tries to do too much, he just is in the moment and in a day where it seems everyone is just over acting every single scene they are in his minimal effort performances have always been good. But, this is suppose to be a kick ass, bust them up action movie where the real fun comes from watching this dorky kid becone a superhero with super-human powers. Could McGuire pull it off? The answer is............YES!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Like Keanu Reeves did in the Matrix and Micheal Keaton did in Batman, McGuire is able to make you think that, yes, he can kick your butt all over Metropolis and still be back home in time for dinner. McGuire does a wonderful job of conveying both an innocent young man and a superhero who knows it is his duty to protect those less gifted then he. He makes you feel sorry for him, makes you laugh with and at him, and makes you believe in him in the scenes where he is saving the world, or New York at least. The star of the movie truly is just that and if you didn't know who Tobey McGuire was before this, you will after.<br/><br/>The supporting cast can ver well be where the difference between a great movie and a so, so movie lie and in this case the supporting cast does a wonderful job. Defoe has gotten some criticism as the Green Goblin from press and some fan reactions alike, but at the end of the day Defoe carries the Goblin and perfroms brilliantly. He is mean, psychotic, but also funny and witty, bringing that great strength of all great superhero villians to life, and that is charm. He is funny while being evil and while we have no pretenses whom we want to see win the battle in the end, Defoe's Green Goblin is a witty villian who doesn't just bring death, but death with a punch line. Kirstin Dunst is wonderful at playing what she truly is, that radiant gilr next store, who looks like the type of girl every one of use would have fallen in love with in High School. She is strong when she needs to be and vulnerable enough for Spiderman to need to rescue her when she needs to be. And at the end of the day she is just flat out likeable. Maybe this won't win her an academy award, but you want her survive, you want her and Peter Parker to get together, you want her to get everything in her life worked out and succeed despite the odds. You like her and in this dayand age, when some actors play parts to the point where you wish for an atomic bomb to wipe everyone out at the end of the film, this oe presents us with characters we actually like.<br/><br/>But for my money, the real gold star goes to Sam Raimi. I have always loved Evil Dead and Army of Darkness, so I am a bit biased, but he does an absolutely wonderful job of bringing a very difficult movie the the screen. Think about it, Spiderman doesn't fly, doesn't drive a car, but what he does do is swoop from building to building using his webs. That could present a serious problem for most, on how to create these movements without making everyone in the theatre sick, but Raimi seamlessly intertwines the speacial effects and the live action scenes.<br/><br/>A wonderful movie, a wonderful job, and well worth the $9. Hopefully, as oppsed to last summer, this is a sign of things to come. Now all we have to hope for is a Star Destroyer falls on Jar Jar Binks and the world will be moving forward again."
"J.M. Fan Club","7","1","2","3 May 2002"," Better than I expected
","When I first heard they were making a Spider-Man movie, I was horrified. The thought of seeing Toby MaGuire dressed as Spider-Man just had me thinking of the Power Rangers, and that's about what I was expecting.  The more I saw the trailers, and the more I saw the commercials, the more I wanted to really hate this movie.  At the same time, I found myself this past week really curious about the film, and thinking it may be better than what I expect.  And I must admit, this was a good movie. The story wasn't great, but it was good enough to keep my interest.  The love story between Mary Jane and Peter Parker actually added to the movie, which is usually not the case in the super hero genre of film.  There were a couple moments when I was reminded of the Power Rangers, but those moments usually came from the Green Goblin, and not from Spier-Man.  I think the most amazing thing is there were several attempts at humor, and for most part, they were actually funny (my personal favorite came when Peter Parker was on the roof attempting to figure out how to sling his webs). So despite my best efforts, I did enjoy Spider-Man.  So if you are a Spider-Man fan, or just think Kristen Dunst looked really hot with red hair, you should enjoy this movie."
"gabridl","2","1","2","5 May 2002"," Kirsten has a block-head
","Spider-Man (don't you love that nineteenth-century hyphenation) entertains mainly through its special effects. These last about 2% of the film. The remainder of the movie looks like stuff I used to watch on TV during the 70s. Toby Maguire sounds and poses and hops like a toad, and Kirsten tries to summon up the enthusiasm to kiss him. It's sad that film has sunk so low that even comic books are more sophisticated."
"Cristofer Seven","10","1","2","5 May 2002"," The hype is not just hype.
","The buzz surrounding this movie you would think it was the second coming, but it is a solid film.  This film was not lacking in any way.  I have heard that Willem Dafoe was a bit over the top with the green goblin, but I am of the opinion that he portrayed the character as he is in the comic.  The green goblin was a wild villain.  The character was over the top.  I do have one complaint.  The soundtrack... it sounded like the Batman score in its tone and pacing.  The soundtrack would have fit better in a movie about the Dark Knight not Spiderman.  This is a great film."
"ttbrowne","2","1","2","5 May 2002"," Didn't Transfer To Screen Well
","Being a big fan of Spidey I remember reading about his first appearance. That's why this was a great disappointment and a huge surprise. First I thought the Maguire kid was greatly miscast. He just doesn't cut it for me. Then there is the fact that they HAD to go back to high school. Ya know, It seemed perfect in the comics but when it transfers to film it looks downright stupid and juvenile. I thought they could've handled that part differently, like in Batman.  I didn't care for the lighting and wholesomeness of the film. The Batman films captured that comic book look to a tea. This one seems all sugar and spice and everything nice. I truly believe they made this film for 8-10 years old's.  Don't waste your money if you're a true Spiderman fan. Save it and buy one of old comic books."

","Seems like only two days ago I had the UNpleasure of watching the Scorpion King. I never went to see Blade II, although a friend of mine said it was good. I was waiting for Spider-man. Finally, yesterday, having left the ladies at home, me and my collegue (also a moviegoer and just like me not a very big fan of Spidey) went to the theatre with two tickets and a big bag of popcorn. <br/><br/>Let me take you along...<br/><br/>For five minutes I had to sit and chew popcorn watching the credits... boring, but reminds you the 80s, when many movies began this way. And what? We all loved that movies, because of what followed, of course.<br/><br/>What followed was the story of a boy who.. you know;) By the way, this was the first time I saw Tobby Maguire. Meant for this role. Willem Dafo's Green Goblin definetely wasn't bad, at those short moments he wore no mask, he gave a very good performance of a person, struggling with himself - man, everyone in the theatre was laughing. But do we have to take this movie or its good/bad guys seriously? I guess, those of us, who will or have tried to, are the ones dissapointed.<br/><br/>Now we come to the lady. In a movie, which is a comic adaptation, there MUST BE romance. Judge yourself, it's difficult to create a good plot, so it is substituted with CGI, them come more CGI and then the movie's over (see for Batman&Robin). Probably mindful of it, they gave Mary Jane a lot of appearances. With or without our hero. I bet many of you remember how she said she had to go to the actor's school. I just wonder how many of you would agree with me that she really should...<br/><br/>However, the scene in the rain was wonderful - or am I too romantic? Pity, but the lady didn't see that one. The CGI were terrific, should I tell you that? Guess I'll see it again.. 8/10"

","Okay...I went to watch this movie expecting a good batman movie...but no. Spiderman took the spotlight. So I decided to watch this movie. As I watched it I noticed something. It sucks more then Pam Anderson. If you read the comics you would know that spiderman doesn't have the webs shooting out of his skin. Peter parker got bitten by the spider and had every power but that. So he built a machine that shot webs. So other than this movie being accurate it has a few issues. Mainly that it is a lot of talking and not enough action. When I open a movie expecting batman and get spiderman, I at least expect some action. Instead the only real fight was the end with the Green goblin. Even that was boring. you would expect a great ending fight but instead you get half bored to death hoping for the fight to finally end. I finished my night unsatisfied and a little dead on the inside a 2 out of 10 is an acceptable rate for this movie."

Mary Jane is one of the comic book world's hottest girlfriends. and they gave the role to an ugly and bad actor, Kirsten Dunst, who gives an inferior performance. Willian Dafoe was the perfect choice for Norman Osborn and Green Goblin, and he wasted it by talking to himself in the film. The Green Goblin looks like a Power Ranger. The CGI was very bad. I can't believe that people liked this film, although they started hating it when Spiderman 3 came out. This was just an awful film. I gave 1 star out of 10."
"EddyTheMartian007","7","2","9","21 December 2018"," Spider-Man (2002) is the perfect example of a Superhero Origin done right!
","Spiderman is one of the first CBMs I ever watched, and it was the movie which introduced me to Spiderman. After this movie I started to really like Spiderman. Anyways This Movie has surprisingly aged pretty well. There are some very goofy parts(like the bomb which turns people into skeletons), especially near the beginning, but for the most part this is a pretty solid movie.<br/><br/>I think the beginning of the movie is probably the weakest, but as it progresses it does get much better. In the beginning of the movie we get the origins of both Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Norman Osborn (Willem Defoe) with both of them being a goofy in their own way. Peter being in a museum where one of 14 genetically modified spiders escapes and bites Peter, and possibly bites other people?! Also the Spider gives peter abs. Also peter doesn't tell anyone about getting bitten by a radioactive spider? I mean you'd probably die. We also get Green Goblin yelling like a madman when he very stupidly tests out the serum on himself. I thought the motivations were told well enough, but it was shown way to quick. The school bits with peter weren't very convincing, they didn't feel like an actual school, and when he figures out his powers it didn't really make sense logically, especially when he's jumping off of Buildings with some very outdated CGI. I do think Norman's descend into insanity was done very well.<br/><br/>Once we get to Peter's relationship with Aunt May(Rosemary Harris), and Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) (which are both great) the movie really picks up and gets much better. The dialogue between Uncle Ben and Peter is really good, and they feel like a family, and when the ""with great power comes great responsibility"" line is dropped it has a huge impact. The relationship is relatable to people who've lost someone. When Uncle Ben dies because of Peter ""revenge"" against the Wrestling Promoter, it's handled extremely well. Peter in some way caused his Uncle's death and Peter feels responsible. When Uncle Ben dies it's emotional and you feel the impact and dread it brings peter. He's once again filled with revenge trying to kill his supposed killer. Once again when he ""accidentally"" cause the killer to die peter realized what he has done, and then it hits him. ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility"". Peter now realizes he should use he's powers for good, and thus Spiderman is born! Also he made his own suit somehow...<br/><br/>Peter's Arc in the movie is one of the best parts of this film. Another great relationship is Harry (James Franco) and Norman Osborn. Harry is really good in this movie, Peter and Harry's friendship is established since the beginning and it's done well. There's a great Juxtaposition done with Peter and Uncle Ben's connection, compared to Harry's and Norman's connection. Uncle Ben was always kind and close to Peter while Norman is always cold and distant to Harry. It brews a good rivalry between Harry and Peter when Norman wants a son like Peter. The other character and one of the weaker ones, but still good enough is Mary Jane (Kristen Dunst). She unfortunately is the average Damsel in Distress. They try to give her some more character with having abusive parents, but it's never expanded on. Peter's and Her relations ship is kinda weird, it works better when it was Spiderman and MJ, but Peter feels kinda weird around her.<br/><br/>I think Norman Osborn was a pretty good villain, his motivations make some sense, and he's insane so it's a bit more excusable. Willem Dafoe's performance was very enjoyable, and I think he brought some good character. The only real problem I have with him is the motivations against Spiderman aren't exactly too clear. Despite this I thought he was a pretty solid villain, and the 3rd act with him making Peter choose MJ or children was very good. The ending of Norman accidentally killing himself, and Peter revealing to Harry that he ""killed"" his father brings more rivalry for the future.<br/><br/>
Overall I think this was a very good movie. I do have a few problems, like the beginning of the film. That really brought this movie down for me. Also it's kinda goofy in some areas, but when it's serious it hits. The rest of the movie is really good though, and to me this is the perfect example of a CBM origin movie.<br/><br/>7/10"
"TheLittleSongbird","8","2","9","8 May 2009"," Definitely exceeded my expectations!
","I am not into action films particularly,(I'm 17) but this was a really pleasant surprise. This is a well-designed, well-acted and well-directed film, that is close to the comics, which my younger brother used to collect. I loved the music score by Danny Elfman, very like Batman. The special effects were excellent, especially with the scene on the bridge, and the direction from Sam Raimi was fast-paced and secure. But for me, the acting was the best aspect of the movie. Tobey Maguire was the biggest surprise. Usually actors playing comic book heroes are bland, but Maguire was not that at all. If anything he was very charming. Kirsten Dunst portrays the thankless role of the damsel in distress, and I must say, she is very impressive. J.K Simmons gets the most laughs as Jameson, but the best actor was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn aka the Green Goblin. He not only looked the part of the Green Goblin, but brought some welcome gravitas to the role. The story is sweet and sometimes poignant towards the beginning, though the only real complaints I have of this movie is that the script at times is a little uneven, and the film is a bit long. All in all, a satisfying take on the comic book hero. 8/10 Bethany Cox."
"lee_eisenberg","10","2","9","26 April 2006"," 2002 just may have been Stan Lee's annus mirabilis
","I'll admit that I've never really been into comic books (or do people like to call them ""graphic novels""?). But whether you're into them or not, ""Spider-Man"" is sure to blow you away. More than just a superhero story, it shows how, as the title character reminds us: ""With great power comes great responsibility."" As Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Tobey Maguire brings to the screen a superhero with whom we can all identify: misunderstood and searching for his goal in life. And Willem Dafoe makes one nasty, but cool, Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. Other cast members include Kirsten Dunst as Peter's love interest Mary Jane Watson; James Franco as Peter's friend (and Norman's son) Harry; Cliff Robertson as Peter's uncle Ben; and Rosemary Harris as Peter's aunt May.<br/><br/>I also have to admit that around the time when this movie came out was the first time that I'd ever heard of Stan Lee (who appears in the movie briefly). Right before the release, he made a guest appearance on ""The Simpsons"" (the episode where Bart creates an online cartoon about Homer's mishaps). Two thousand two must have been a great year for Lee.<br/><br/>All in all, you're sure to love this movie. I also recommend ""Weird"" Al Yankovic's song ""Ode to a Superhero"" (parodying ""Piano Man""), about the movie. Just great. I guess that Rosemary Harris is probably the only actress who can lay claim to starring in a movie about Hungary's history (""Sunshine"") and a superhero movie."

This film still holds solid after 16 years despite the various reboots.

","I know I'm gonna get hate for this, and I know this movie is loved by so many. But for me, this movie is comedy gold. It is really, really funny. Even when it's not trying to be. First, let's give the film credit: I like how they did Spider-Man's origin story, the way Uncle Ben died and the costume is awesome. The fact that he works for the Daily Bugle and that he's a ""friendly neighborhood Spider-Man"" is a win of course, it's a good throwback to the comic books.<br/><br/>Let's also mention Green Goblin, I like his advanced Technology suit, and his mannerisms where like the Goblin of the comics. The way he said ""We'll meet again Spider-Man!"" Was very comic-book like, and I thought that was cool.<br/><br/>Now to the negatives:<br/><br/>Peter Parker has self-generated webs. Where in the world do they come from? The more you think about that the more disgusting it is. They are literally coming from his body! Ew!<br/><br/>Goblin is a good villain, but he's very laughable sometimes when you want to take him seriously. Like when he says ""BACK TO FORMULA"". And jumps on the railing half-naked with that goofy face. It's cringeworthy, and at the same time hilarious. How did this get past the editing team??<br/><br/>Finally, the Love Story. This Spider-Man movie teaches you that it's okay to stalk the girl you love, you'll win her heart anyway. That's what Peter does in this film, he repeatedly stalks Mary Jane, and no viewer notices it! They are just like, well, he likes her, can you blame him? I can blame him, because stalking is illegal. And If I tried to stalk a girl I liked, I would end up in jail.<br/><br/>The worst part is that Spider-Man is able to beat Goblin Just because Green Goblin threatened Mary Jane. That's very cringeworthy, because it's like: ""MY WOMAN'S GONNA BE KILLED! YOU CAN'T HAVE HER!""<br/><br/>So in conclusion, yeah. Some of the newer Spider-Man are better, but I will say this is the second best in the trilogy, and don't think I'm saying the second film is the best. I also love that line: ""GODSPEED SPIDER-MAN!"""

He gets way too much credit for this movie. I also thought the Green Goblin villain was weak, despite a strong Willem Dafoe performance. The only part of this movie I ended up enjoying was J.K. Simmons' J. Jonah Jameson, who was well-acted and hilarious. This movie, also, every time I see it, can't help feeling campy. I'm sure at the time, this was probably a (small) step up for superhero cinema, but movies like the Dark Knight, which is celebrating its ten year anniversary at the time I'm writing this still have a huge impact all those years later, whereas this just doesn't feel special anymore."

I love it and it is my favorite best Spider-Man movie yet. I watch it in 2003 my mom bought me VHS when she was still alive, she isn't anymore it remind on my teenage years in high school. I watch it yesterday and I still can't get bored with it. Green Goblin was the best villain ever in Spider-Man I love him. The Amazing Spider-Man was really awesome I love it so much. I love them all Spider-Man movies.<br/><br/>I still find the original enjoyable, but I'm not nearly as forgiving of its flaws as some are.

I get it that it appeals to people by ""capturing that exciting comic book feeling"", but that isn't enough for me to say it's a good movie. The new movie has stronger emotion and had more weight to it, and I was RELIEVED that the ending was different. Yeah, it was a selfish thing on the new Peter's part, but I forgive him for it. A marvel movie shouldn't really go to much into the origin unless it relates to the story of the rest of the movie, if the origin is connected to the actual plot, then it's appropriate to show it, if not, then it's something you can get done and over with in the first 10 minutes or so, this movie is a prime example, the goblin wasn't related to the origin, so it went by quickly.<br/><br/>I love The Amazing Spider-Man a lot, but my favorite movie will always be Spider-Man 2002 I grow up with that movie. Spider-Man 2002 is much much better for me then The Amazing Spider-Man is. Fans who compare TASM over SM are just kids and maybe they watch TASM before they even hear about SM or who knows why they do that, everyone has their own opinion. I love Spider-Man 2002 equal the way I love The Amazing Spider-Man:P That is my opinion .<br/><br/>Average teenager Peter Parker is transformed into an extraordinary super hero after he is accidentally bitten by a radioactive spider. When his beloved uncle is savagely murdered during a robbery, young Peter vows to use his powers to avenge his death. Deeming himself ""Spider-Man,"" he sets about ridding the streets of crime, bringing him into conflict with malevolent super-villain ""Green Goblin."" <br/><br/>The action, acting and pacing are excellent and the movie manages to action, romance, drama and comedy all into one great package! Spidey has always been one of my favorites. I was surprised that Raimi was given the role of director with this film, considering his only real claim to fame is the Evil Dead series before this, but his direction here is very well done. The acting is very good. Tobey Maguire IS Spider-Man/Peter Parker. Everyone fits into their role well -- great cast. The special-effects are okay. Raimi can't seem to decide what scene should be CGI or which should be wires when it comes to the antics of Spidey saving the day or duking it out with a villain ""Green Goblin"".The musical score was only part of the success for this movie thanks to Danny Elfman. The special effects were mind blowing for me to see Spiderman swing from high buildings to catch the bad guys. This movie is worth every penny and it is worth owning. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson did a wonderful performance of her role. I seriously love the actress, I am a huge fan of her and I always was. She did played the character well, like the role of Mary Jane Watson was written on her skin.<br/><br/>""With great power comes great responsibility."" <br/><br/>Bottom of line I love this film and the fighting scenes between Spidey and The Green Goblin was awesome. CGI in this film wasn't bad It was great. The whole film was huge Entertainment.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is a 2002 American superhero film directed by Sam Raimi.

","SPIDER-MAN is one of my favorite Comic Book films of all time and this is my review of the 2002 original.<br/><br/>The film follows Peter Parker, an orphaned high schooler who pines after popular girl next door Mary Jane Watson. While on a science class field trip, Peter is bitten by a genetically- engineered ""super spider"". As a result, Peter gains superhuman abilities, increased strength, speed and the abilities to scale walls and generate organic webbing.<br/><br/>After his beloved Uncle Ben is murdered, a murder Peter could have easily prevented, the teenager realizes that he must use his newfound abilities to protect New York City and he becomes Spider-Man. Meanwhile, wealthy industrialist Norman Osborn, the father of Peter's best friend Harry Osborn, subjects himself to an experimental performance-enhancing serum, which creates a psychotic and murderous split personality. Donning a military battlesuit, Norman becomes the freakish ""Green Goblin"", who begins to terrorize the city. Peter, as Spider-Man, now must do battle with the Goblin, all while trying to express his true feelings for Mary Jane.<br/><br/>The feel of the comic book look and the film should be praised. Director Sam Raimi and his team really did a great job of bringing the Spider-Man character to life on the big screen was really amazing, and with today's CGI effects, they were about to make him jump and climb up walls.<br/><br/>From the skyscrapers of New York to the warehouses to the film's web slinging sequences to the action sequences, this movie makes you feel like you wish you had the same powers as Spider-Man and the film has a great cast, who bring true performances to the characters they are playing.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker and Spider-Man and who does an amazing job in the part and his performance won me over in this film and he would play the part for the next two films. When he is Peter Parker, he takes a serious approach, but once he is Spider-Man, man, he is super cool. The way that had his costume in this film was just wonderful, but the one thing that was missing was his web-shooters, but that was in the reboot.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe plays Norman Osborn and Green Goblin and he gives us a menacing, hilarious and serious villain who loves being evil and I will say, the costume is a bit stupid, but I like it though. It's not horrible, but it could have been worse, worse than George Clooney's Batman suit in Batman and Robin and that is for sure! The rest of the cast is just amazing. James Franco plays Harry Osborn and he does an amazing job. Rosemary Harris is sweet and was the perfect casting choice and he is just amazing and fantastic, as the grandmother and aunt of Peter Parker, Aunt May Parker and she does wonders.<br/><br/>The late Cliff Robertson plays Uncle Ben and that was the best performance of his career. It was really amazing and fantastic to see him in that role, who would later be played by Martin Sheen, in the 2012 reboot.<br/><br/>At last, but least, Kirsten Dunst plays the role of Mary Jane Watson and she gives an amazing performance in this film and her and Dunst won 2003 MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss and that kiss with them is one of my favorite moments in movies.<br/><br/>The music by Danny Elfman is just amazing and fantastic. The theme is really amazing as hell and it is fantastic and so amazing. It was a really good musical score and I love his BATMAN and BATMAN RETURNS musical scores and that was really fantastic.<br/><br/>The visuals are amazing and the action sequences that I like the most are the fights between Spider-Man and Green Goblin and the fight choreography in those scenes were really well done and the dialogue in this movie is really wonderful and this script was written by David Koepp and he wrote a good script and this film is really amazing.<br/><br/>Overall, SPIDER-MAN is a really amazing film and it is really fantastic and an amazing, spectacular, incredible, stunning and well done superhero film that does not get enough credit and it really gets a lot of things right and this was really fantastic and it is really amazing to see Spider-Man on the big screen.<br/><br/>I could go for hours talking about how much I like this and talk about the action sequences, the dialogue, the effects, music, editing and the acting from the actors, but I know that IMDb has a word limit and I've got to keep this review short.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is a really good and amazing comic book film and this will remain as one of my best superhero films of all time and one of my best superhero films on IMDb and it will not change. I'm giving this film a rating of an 8 out of 10."
"CinemaClown","Null","1","3","9 September 2015"," Sam Raimi Casts His Web And It Sticks Tight, Even After All These Years!
","One of the first movies to pave the groundwork for modern superhero flicks, Spider-Man is an incredibly fun & endlessly entertaining action-adventure that brings its web-slinging hero to life on the silver screen in a truly fascinating manner after spending nearly a quarter of a century in development hell and, with its record-breaking box office performance, acts as a precursor to an era when superheroes would dominate the summer box-office.<br/><br/>Based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, the story of Spider-Man follows Peter Parker; a high-school kid who after being bitten by a radioactive spider at a genetic laboratory begins to develop spider-like abilities and puts his new powers to good use by turning to crimefighting. Meanwhile, Norman Osborn experiments a power-enhancing drug on himself as a desperate attempt to preserve a military contract critical for his company's survival.<br/><br/>Directed by Sam Raimi, Spider-Man has all the ingredients of a summer blockbuster plus it benefits a lot from Raimi's dynamic filmmaking style that doesn't dwell on a single moment for far too long, keeps the story fresh, light-hearted & action-packed for the most part, plus never loses its initially-gained momentum. David Koepp's screenplay is no slouch either for it packs in a compelling plot & few interesting characters and the whole story is splendidly humoured.<br/><br/>The technical aspects are all brilliantly executed. Camera-work is excellent for the most part for the chosen angles, swift movements, slow-mo shots & warm colour palette are correctly employed. Editing provides a frenetic pace to its narrative, each moment has a role to play, and its 121 minutes of runtime simply flies by. Visual effects team makes use of both CGI & practical stuntwork and it's amazing just how well it has dated when compared to other effects-laden movies released back then.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Spider-Man packs in a very interesting cast in Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Willem Dafoe, J.K. Simmons & others, and many of them are pretty convincing in their given roles. Maguire does a terrific job under Raimi's supervision, Dafoe plays Norman Osborn with finesse but that Green Goblin suit is extremely off-putting, Simmons is a near-perfect rendition of J. Jonah Jameson from the comics while both Dunst & Franco do a fine job as Mary Jane Watson & Harry Osborn, respectively.<br/><br/>Also worthy of admiration is Danny Elfman's outstanding score that captures just the right tone & feel of your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man's universe and brims with tracks that seamlessly integrate into the story. On an overall scale, Spider-Man may not seem as impressive today as it did back when it made its debut on the silver screen but it still remains one of the best offerings of its category and delivers a roller-coasted ride that's enjoyable, entertaining & highly satisfying. Far better than its decade later reboot, Spider-Man is summer popcorn extravaganza right on the money."

I gave it 9 because we may have overlooked some mistakes in the movie and so I show the good things in the movie and the bad things in the movie The Bad: too much unnecessary slow-mo scenes, corny lines and fight scenes look rubbery and effects look rubbery The Good: Tobey is a great nerdy Peter Parker, Sam Raimi directed it, parts stayed true to the comics, the burning tower suspense, great cast, great soundtrack, great plot, excellent scenes, funny scenes were actually funny and even if you know what happens you still laugh So as you can see there are so much great things in this movie that I personally think if anyone hates this I will find you..........................Anyway great film!

","Spiderman was a good film, but nothing special as some are claiming it to be, but it's still a very good film, however.<br/><br/>The story is basically about a high-school student called Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), who goes on a school trip. During the trip, Peter (Tobey Maguire) gets bitten by a genetically engineered spider and later, starts changing and gaining superhuman strength. His life changes dramatically since that day not just for the good, but also for the bad. Peter (Tobey Maguire), not only has to deal with his love-interest Mary-Jane (Kirsten Dunst) but also, confront and tackle the dangerous villain known as the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe).<br/><br/>Like I've said, it was a good film but nothing great. The film has good action, it is funny, and at the same time, can be serious. The problems I had with this film is that the story could've been a lot better, it felt dull to me, especially the character Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe).<br/><br/>Also the people that portrayed as ""high-school-students"" looked way older. Willem Dafoe, who played Norman Osborne, was a poor choice. He didn't look right to be a Green Goblin, and taking on a young hero called Spiderman.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are the ones that made this film good. They had the most parts to play.<br/><br/>So, it was a good film, but not outstanding. The Green Goblin could've been portrayed a lot better I feel, and that's important because he is Spiderman's number one enemy."
"Eightiesjunkie","10","1","3","27 June 2015"," A silver-age comic book come to life!
","I know that many people were dissatisfied with Sam Raimi's first two Spider-Man films. I'm sure most of them were expecting something with a dark/harder edge to it, rather than the lighthearted, action-adventure film that was presented. I know because upon seeing the film for the first time, I felt the exact same way. You see, I grew up with the 90's animated series which had a bit of a darker take on the character of Spider-Man. At first I regarded the film as ""good"" but not ""GREAT"" or ""FANTASTIC"" because it wasn't what I was expecting. Now however, after many years, (and two God-awful reboot films!) I find the film to be excellent! I finally understand the director's intention for this film, and I've read a bunch of the original silver-age comics, to which the the film is based on. In my opinion, this film succeeds on all levels! The main plot of the film is based on Spider-Man's origin story (From Amazing Fantasy 15) and the climax of the film is partially based on Amazing Spider-Man #121. a.k.a (The night Gwen Stacey died) Although, some changes were made. The story, characters, and look of the film work extremely well. All of the actors were excellent! They fully understood the core of their characters, and made them come alive. Many people have complained about the silly lines of dialogue, and the corny jokes said by certain characters in the film. I no longer have a problem with this, and here's why: In the original 60's comics, there were silly lines and corny jokes, but that was all part of their charm, and atmosphere. Which is what this movie beautifully re-creates, the charm and atmosphere of the original 60's and 70's Spider-Man comics. I liked this movie back in the summer of '02, but now I LOVE it! Sam Raimi has made the two best Spider-Man films of all time, and I don't think anyone will ever come remotely close to topping them."

","Spider-Man (2002): Dir: Sam Raimi / Cast: Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Willem Dafoe, James Franco, Cliff Robertson: Spider-Man is a superhero of enormous ability yet viewed in the wrong perspective. Tobey Maguire plays high school student Peter Parker who secretly loves fellow student Mary-Jane. On a class trip he is bitten by an unusual breed of spider. Now he can scale buildings and spin webs. His nemesis is the Green Goblin who arrives, as most villains do, by freak accident. Exciting climax where Spider-Man is forced to choose between two factors with the stakes being extreme either way. It is directed by Sam Raimi as a departure from his Evil Dead films. Only Maguire brings a real emotion giving off bewilderment and a sense of awe as he struggles to perfect this new ability. Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane basically plays a damsel and kiss Spider-Man upside down. Willem Dafoe as nemesis Green Goblin falters with little concentration on his personality glitch. This results in a lack of emotion where it should be in the conclusion. And it is no surprise that James Franco as the Goblin's son will grow apart from his best friend Parker with Mary-Jane presented as a wedge. Cliff Robertson provides the pivotal yet somewhat cardboard role of Ben Parker, Peter's uncle. Entertaining visual wonder about abilities and the web of pain that can occur if we misuse our gifts.

The years will pass, but the winner will remain the glorious 2002, as I saw from the beginning what would be the best superhero adaptation at the time, and, without doubt, the best first of all films of superheroes . A large repertoire of actors, Tobey Maguire with the size of the character, as well as a lucid Dunts Kirsten in his role and, of course, Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin by one of the greatest villains in the superhero movie, I even encourage say the cinema in general.

"classicalsteve","9","1","3","6 May 2015"," Possibly the Best First-Time Superhero Film Since Reeve's Superman of the 70's
","The first time an iconic superhero flies across the big screen in his (or her) tights, cape and/or mask, the end product often has mixed results. The bar was set pretty high with the first ""Superman"" film starring Christopher Reeve, Marlon Brando, and Gene Hackman, still probably the finest superhero film ever produced. The first ""Batman"" film, directed by Tim Burton and starring Michael Keaton in the title role and Jack Nicholson as the Joker had problems, some wonderful moments in between lagging scenes. (Some people have called ""Batman"" the best mediocre film ever produced! Or is it the most mediocre film among good ones?) Either way, the end result may or may not hit the mark. Luckily, especially for fans of the original comic book, the first Spider-man film, based on the character created by Stan Lee, works on a level towards the original Superman film.<br/><br/>When you boil down the raw elements needed to create a good film, you need three things: a good premise, good actors, and a good screenplay. And let's not under-appreciate the last one. While a good screenplay still may save mediocre acting, often the opposite isn't true. In Spider-man, all three are present in spades. Let's look at them in terms of how they are portrayed in the current film.<br/><br/>The Premise. Well, the premise must be a good one because, since its inception in the 1960's, Spider-man has become one of the most important comic heroes alongside Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. However, Lee brought a bit of a twist to the character. Like other superhero characters who have some magic-like abilities, in this case the abilities of a spider inside a human body, Spider-man's alter-ego, Peter Parker is a troubled adolescent suffering from the typical angst of all young people around that age. Unlike Superman, Parker is still finding out where he fits in. In terms of the present film, the original premise, although updated slightly for the 21st century, is still adhered to. Parker/Spider-man is an angst-ridden kid, loving a faraway female, trying to navigate school, and dealing with bullies.<br/><br/>The Acting. The acting takes us right into the heads of the three most important characters: Spider-man/Peter Parker (Toby Maguire), the Green Goblin/Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe), and Mary Jane Watson, a.k.a. MJ, (Kirsten Dunst). Maguire offers both the angst-riddled teen and the resolved superhero. I particularly appreciated the way he was portrayed in the film. Not a bad-looking kid but not a GQ cover model either. He's rather nerdy, a science wiz, like Lee had envisioned him, but not the best at getting dates. The absolute stand-out is Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin/Mr Osborne. Character actors like Dafoe, similar to Gene Hackman as Lex Luther, are the best suited to play villains. Dafoe is terrific as a kind of Marvel equivalent of Two-Face, having two sides to him. On one had he's the upper-crust businessman who's tough but confident. However, the other side, the Green Goblin side, emerges and confronts the ""waking"" self. He becomes a kind of split personality that few actors can pull off, and the scenes in which the two sides speak to one another are entirely believable. Also honorable mention to Dunst who is a very attractive high school girl but certainly not someone who will be entering teen beauty pageants. She attracts the likes of Peter Parker at a very human level.<br/><br/>The screenplay, probably the most important ingredient, works well, and much better than the Keaton/Burton ""Batman"". Parker is a typical high school kid just trying to navigate through school, being cared for by his adoptive uncle and aunt since the death of his parents. Then a strange circumstance changes his life: he's bitten by a radioactive spider which gives him spider-like abilities. A nice series of sequences shows him testing his new-found talents. At first Parker uses them to earn money in trashy athletic events, but then he switches gears and decides to use them to combat evil. Certainly we know this will be Spider-man's calling but a conversation with his uncle puts him on track, reminiscent of Brando as Superman's father. <br/><br/>On another front, the father of a friend of Parker's, Norman Osborne, is head of a tech company testing a machine which would improve human metabolism in soldiers, probably for the military, a bit like Captain America. Osborne built the company, but now the board of directors are selling the company out from under him. He retaliates by testing the metabolic-altering machine on himself and hence a different side emerges after the experiment. Simultaneously, there's Mary Jane, the distant love of Parker, who knows he exists but is dating a much more athletic and popular guy at school. Eventually, these three stories clash in a wonderful and believable climax. Parker becoming a crime-fighting disguised hero, Osborne becoming an adversary of Spider-man, and Dunst caught in the middle.<br/><br/>The story is about transformations. All three characters undergo transformation during the course of the story. Not all seem to relish this transformation and none of them understand fully what it means. Some of them embrace the transformation more than others, but in the end it's unclear whether or not the characters are better for what has happened to them. Two survive the transformation while another doesn't. And that's the mark of a great story: when what seems the inevitable outcome isn't quite what the characters and the audience foresaw. Ultimately, it comes down to caring about the characters and what transpires which evolves them into something else, be they heroic or villainous. Maybe that's the problem with many superhero films, the filmmakers forget that we need to be reminded to care about them, not just be awe-struck when they fly around."

","Sam Raimi's genre re-invigorating blockbuster holds up reasonably well. Maguire makes for an earnest and likable Peter Parker. He's not quite as comfortable with the wisecracking stuff as Spidey, but Raimi doesn't really focus on that very much here. Dafoe's a little hammy, but his performance fits in well with the tone of the movie. I found my self swooning over the sweetly vulnerable Kirsten Dunst, so mission accomplished there. And J.K. Simmons... Let me just say 'Whiplash' should've been his second Oscar (mild exaggeration, but he owns).<br/><br/>The action scenes are a bit lacking in the thrills department, but the F/X work holds up pretty well save for a few noticeably dodgy sequences. And Danny Elfman delivers one of his least annoying scores. But what ultimately makes it work is its heart. Raimi gets the crux of Peter's journey--that with great power comes great responsibility--right (it's one of the many things I felt the reboot botched). As a result, the story and the characters all resonate emotionally"

","I saw the trailer of this movie and was expecting a very interesting and action-filled masterpiece. I begged my mom to let me see it in the movie theaters. But I never saw it in the theaters. But my grandma and grandpa had bought it on DVD, so when I was at their house one day, I decided to watch it, thinking I'd love it.<br/><br/>Now I am saying this for every person who still has even an ounce of sanity left. THAT WAS BY FAR THE STUPIDEST MOST BORING MOVIE I HAD EVER SEEN IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!!!!!!!! What a waste of my time! The acting was OK, but some of it was bogus! The special effects was just plain fake!! There was no action in it, or at least not enough for me! I was COMPLETELY disappointed!! I hated the fact that Uncle Ben died. I didn't think that was necessary! As the time passed on I started getting bored. I kept glancing at the clock, and started reading books, and almost fell asleep. When it was over, I hurried up and turned the DVD player off and turned nickelodeon on. I kept telling myself how silly of me to think that it would be, like Spy Kids, interesting and fun and action-packed. I actually thought that! Boy, was I wrong! Those of you who still have some sanity left, take my advice and don't waste your money to buy the DVD. My dad bought the DVD 'cause he liked it, but I didn't like the idea of owning the movie. My brother liked it(although he was only 3 at the time)and then he kept on annoying me with his obsessiveness with the movie. Good thing we lost the stupid movie! But the sequel looks a lot better!! I just hope I don't get bored again!<br/><br/>If you like this movie, I recommend Harry Potter1 & 2(1:6/10;2:7/10), Spy Kids1, 2 &3(1:10+/10;2:10++/10;3:10+++/10) and 13 Going On 30(9/10).<br/><br/>Over all, this is my rating for the movie: -100/10"

","This movie is without a doubt the most depressing experience I've had in the last year of movie going.  If I wanted to watch a cartoon, I would watch pokemon. At least it isn't as happy, fluffy, and corny as this movie.  I can't believe I waited years for these 2 hours of agony.  I would rather go suffer through a Disney sequel!! I loved Spiderman as a kid and found nothing but disappointment in this movie.  It's a shame, too, because this movie had all the right pieces to make a great movie but they made it look corny instead of cool.  I swear Spiderman's weightless or else he wouldn't be able to jump like this.  Why couldn't they just have made it look like he had weight?? I will give it some credit though.  Tobey Maguire did do a good job in his role.  Kirsten Dunst and the supporting cast did their part. However the green goblin was pathetic compared to Gene Hackman, or Jack Nicholson.  The musical score was great. I say this movie is happy, and fluffy, because no one dies, all the people are nice, and it doesn't show how the real world is.  I've got nothing against New York, but I know it's not that cheery. Overall this movie just comes up short of the quality that Superman or Batman attained.  I feel bad about this because spideys always<br/><br/>been my favorite.  Hopefully Daredevil or the Hulk will give Marvel its well deserved recognition. Until then DC comic's heroes are superior in Hollywood.   But for now all we have this horrible movie with an ending only `Planet of the Apes' can boast at being worse.  If only Sam had tried to make a believable movie like he claimed to be doing."
"atzimo","7","1","3","30 November 2002"," Amateurish
","I just wanted to start off by saying that after the release of Spider-Man, Sam Raimi seems a lot less talented to me than he did before. And the reason is that he didn't manage to ultimately have control over the final look of the movie. He gave the computer guys complete autonomy for all the action sequences and that ruined the whole thing. 'Superman' (1979) looked a thousand times more real (just because he WAS real).<br/><br/>You can immediately tell when a shot contains digital elements, especially when Spider-man moves, where he is always a frame faster than a real character. You know why? It's because in normal speed it would be even easier to tell that the hero is a CGI guy. It's a real trap that only an extremely talented director can escape of. James Cameron or Paul Verhoeven could easily pull this off for instance.<br/><br/>Anyway I am deeply disappointed because in 2002 we could do a lot better with a digital character who has no facial features and no hair.<br/><br/>Sad...<br/><br/>5/10"

"mgerben","1","1","3","3 August 2002"," Good effects, but story way too thin
","Granted, the movie deserves a few points for the effects. But the problem with making a movie about Spiderman is that you are bound by the frame of the original comics. You can't go too far, so the storyline is fixed. The story takes one of his many enemies from the comics. He has to fight this ultimate bad guy, nearly looses, and I don't want to spoil it for you, but he gets up and wins in the end (where have we seen that before?). Of course we've seen that genre before, but this film lacks everything original. Bat Man, Superman, Robocop: this movie is just more of the same. But Spiderman stands apart in that it has nothing going for it whatsoever: not an interesting story, no incredible effects, no humour.<br/><br/>The film ends unfinished and unsatisfying, with an opening for follow-ups whenever the Hollywood-producers are short on cash in the near future. You'll miss nothing if you don't see this film."

The last 15 minutes finally get it together for what passes as a movie experience. Until then, however, this film is pretty much a letdown, padding its material in a blur of camerawork apparently intended to hide how thin it is. In one of his less-than-stellar performances, Tobey McGuire portrays the geeky Peter Parker, who develops super human powers after being bitten by a radioactive spider. Kirsten Dunst and Wilem Defoe were more convincing in their roles as Parker's/Spiderman's love interest and arch-memesis respectively. Sam Raimi directed this unbelievably slow and drawn-out film in which scenes begin and end with nothing having been communicated. This is just too bad, because it's not the actors' fault. Laughably predictable and cliched, there are no mysteries about Spiderman, other than the one of how a film this bad can end up costing so much money to make."

It missed the edge that  made Batman original and the style that made X men memorable. Lines like ""I'm your friendly neighbourhood Spiderman"" really sucked. I don't care if he said that in the comic. Music score was not Elfman's usual standards and Kirsten Dunst whilst beautiful, was only good for screaming. Only Tobey Maguire was memorable and some of the effects. That green goblin outfit was sooo bad. Worst costume since the guyver movie. It was too teeny, too lame and too long.

","This was so bad I left halfway during the movie when the jokes went from bad to ^%^#$#$. Spider-man was even worse than 'Batman and Robin' in some ways! Everything in this flick was wrong: concept, story, script, dialogue, characters, acting, cast (miscasted some actors, wasted others), effects, unfunny jokes, anachronisms... Stay away from this piece of crap. Or, better, when it is released on DVD and VHS buy all the copies you can find and burn them. All thinking persons in the world will be grateful for this heroic deed. If you want to see a truly great movie about a superhero, check out Tim Burton's 'Batman' and Richard Donner's 'Superman', and enjoy a couple of real masterpieces. Spider-Man was supposed to have been produced on a budget of $140 million dollars, and it sure looks the part. $1 mil. on filming, $139 mil. on brainstorming at the local pub. If I were even somewhat involved in the making of this folly, I would be really ashamed of myself. :-("

The special effects, while flashy, did not make anything better unless you are attracted to flashing lights and noises (not literally). The ending was thin and unrealistic; and inexcusable goofs like Mary Jane's hair blowing towards the wind (instead of against?!) swinging on Spidey was so comical that the audience in the theater started to howl with laughter and hurl popcorn at the screen. This is not a film I would hardly recommend, unless you long for the good old days of food fights at the school cafeteria."
"smackajacka","1","1","3","4 July 2002"," Absolute Rubbish
","What is it with Hollywood these days? They seem to be making boring films or resurrecting old comic book heroes etc. What happened to the days when we had Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sly Stallone and Bruce Willis? Now they were good actors and starred in good films. These days, all Hollywood seem to do is put a bunch of 'famous' people (who are rubbish) like Julia Roberts or Brad Pitt into films and waste a few billion dollars investing in special effects and it seems that the movie is a hit. Spiderman is no exception. It is a ridiculously boring film, the main actor Toby Macguire should not have been given the part and the thing that makes it bad is the fact that it uses about 1 billion special effects every second! When will directors ever learn? It doesnt make it look any good..it just makes it look a whole lot worse and MUCH less realistic. Films like Terminator 2 were a hit success not just because it used groundbreaking digital effects, but it didnt swamp the whole film with them. This is what made it, (and still now after 11 years) so realistic and pleasing to watch. Spiderman is a waste of time and money..why do directors seem to think that just because they waste all their money on effects, that the film will be a hit? Well, the only reason why it did well in the USA was because Spiderman had been a legend for 100 years and people waited for the movie to come out..that is the ONLY reason why. In the rest of the world, (UK being a main example), it got bad reviews and i just can't wait until this 'spiderman fever'(that's targeted for 10 year olds and the director being stupid enough to make it so violent it is rated 12) goes away. Don't waste your money on this trash. Be sensible. See something else."
"gothedhel","1","1","3","3 July 2002"," Amazingly boring
","I went to see Spiderman hoping that the critics were right and it was not another Batman Forever. But, as usual, critics were wrong. The acting is bad, and so are the dialogues -whenever Parker talks to M.J. longer than ten seconds it becomes irritant.  Special effects are not specially bad, but didn't shock me. Spiderman looked very fake during some scenes -mainly action scenes-, though.  Action scenes are just fine, but unspectacular. The Green Goblin looks like if he stole some Power Ranger suit, and sometimes he was also too clownish. Peter Parker doesn't make any joke while fighting with the Green Goblin, what is a shame, since it was part of his personality in the comic-book.<br/><br/>Yeah, it beats Batman and Robin, but that's not saying much. After watching Spiderman, I must say that Attack of the Clones was far better. In fact, it was funny, since all that was supposed to be better done in Spiderman was ridiculously bad. I left the cinema very disappointed."

The effects were ok, but nothing to great to talk about and not on screen long enough to be interesting. The only good thing in the movie is Kirsten Dunst, at least she can act and saved the movie from reaching the all time low score of ZERO. My one point vote goes entirely to her. This movie must have been aimed at a 5 year olds audience, but mentally all you needed to watch this piece of haggis (cooked sheep intestines for those who don't know what haggis is) is rocks in your head.

"sperman","1","1","3","27 June 2002"," Disgustingly BAD !!!!!
","I really don't understand all the fuss about this so-called movie, because I'm not even sure we can consider it in such way! But let's start.<br/><br/>Actors: what actors? The only good and cool one is Willem Dafoe, because the others are more or less parodies. Characters: pure stereotypes, which is quite normal because the movie is taken from old Marvel comics, but it really doesn't match with nowadays requirements for thicker personalities. The only attempt to awaken the human side was made on Spider Man himself, and was pretty bad and flat. The girl is an outrage to women and so also is Parker's aunt. Special effects and computer graphics: one would expect at least to have decent effects, considering that we are in the era of computer graphics, but it is not so. Effects are BAD. The animations of Spider Man flying around are as fake as they could have been in the 80's and the fights are copied (once again) from Matrix, only they didn't even manage to copy them decently. Dialogues: totally flat. Jokes are sitcom-oriented and simple-minded (with a couple of exceptions) and the effort to make Spider Man look human falls miserably into stereotype. General overview: AWFUL. The movie is soaked with bad propaganda about US strength and unity, typical of periods of crisis when a nation needs superheroes. Already the fact that it was re-edited to censor the scene with the World Trade Center (which was anyway the main scene in the old trailers) made it a miserable attempt to be politically correct. Altogether boring and pathetic."

Sam Raimi (director) could not decide what this movie was about: was it just setup for future movies, was a pathetic love story, was it a ""evil"" good guy, a ""good"" guy, or Just a Well Hyped Movie to Make $$$$$.

Sure the orignal idea for spiderman was to have a loser kid transform into this amazingly freakish superhero, but why Toby. Not that I have anything wrong with him, he's still a good actor, but after you take the glasses off spiderman deserves to be cooler,James Franco, would have been better for godsakes. But back to the actual movie. I see everyone forgetting this movie by next summer. I feel the story was tragically flawed. The plot just really weak. The only time I was actually glad while watching this movie was when i saw Willem Dafoe, but most of the time he had a horribly ridiculous mask on. Nothing in the movie hopped out and hit me with amazement, even the graphic, they were good but it's nothing I havent seen before. Well to sum it up, the plot was predictable, the action lacked horribly, the graphics were par, and the best acting game into play in the form of Dafoe, with that ridiculous outfit. Overall i would like to tell everyone that its not worth the hype and i wished i waited for it on video. For those who say its the best comic book movie since Superman, you don't know your ass from your elbow. Both superman and batman, were far superior. I gave it a 6, just because i liked the opening theme song.

A non-superhero character possesses more than superhero abilities near the end, apparently disobeying gravity and the laws of physics. Although it was based on a comic book, that doesn't merit characters, supposedly average everyday people, to have outrageous abilities unless he/she is actually the superhero.

"TheMovieDoctorful","8","1","4","9 June 2015"," A Really Good, But Not Quite Great, Superhero Movie
","Let me get this out of the way; I LOVE Spider-Man. Spider-Man has been my favorite superhero since I was 10 years old, mainly due to his extreme relatability and his sheer selflessness as a character. And, as you may have guessed, I do think the original Sam Raimi ""Spider- Man"" is a very, very good movie. That said, I don't think it's a GREAT movie. I don't think Marvel would give us any GREAT movies until 2003 when we got ""Daredevil"" and ""Ang Lee's Hulk"" (And I know that it's extremely controversial and perhaps unwise for me to say that, but that is my honest opinion), and while there IS a great movie buried deep in here, there are is one BIG problem that keeps it from being great.<br/><br/>That problem is the romance. This film tries to make the romance the heart and soul of the movie, but when the two leads have so little chemistry and so little reason to truly be in love, you're in big trouble. Such is the case with Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker and Kristen Dunst's Mary Jane Watson. Mary Jane is a very unlikable character here to be perfectly honest; she's unsupportive, weak in her convictions and honestly seems to mess with Peter a fair amount, even if not intentionally. And of course, she is quite possibly the biggest damsel in distress in comic book movie history. She's not so much a character as a plot element inserted to help PETER develop. To be fair though, Peter isn't much better. Throughout the film I am completely stumped as to why he loved Mary Jane apart from her beauty. There is simply no other reason for him to be attracted to her, and it makes Peter seem very shallow romance wise.<br/><br/>The effects are also EXTREMELY dated too. When I was watching Spider-Man swing across New York, I didn't feel like I was watching a real superhero. I felt like I was watching a cut scene from an Xbox 360 game.<br/><br/>That said, if the romance had been executed better, this would truly be a great superhero movie. Apart from a mediocre Kristen Dunst (And her performance is NOT her fault. The script simply gave her nothing to work with), most of the acting is good. Tobey Maguire is fairly on and off. He perfectly captures the awkwardness and geekiness we know and love in Peter Parker, and he can really give us some true emotional depth in the more touching and tragic scenes of the movie, but he never really gives the alter-ego of Spider-Man much personality. And, of course, he has no chemistry with Kristen Dunst. I'd give his performance a B; not anything mind-blowing, but decent. Cliff Robertson, Rosemary Harris and Willem DaFoe are all fantastic in their roles; I can't imagine anybody more perfect for the roles of Uncle Ben, Aunt May and Green Goblin, it was like watching the comic book characters come to life. For a die-hard Spidey fan like me, it was a riot to watch them breathe so much life into these roles.<br/><br/>Then of course, there's J.K Simmons as J.J Jameson...What can be said about this performance that hasn't already been said? At the end of the day, all I can tell you is this; there's a reason why Spider-Man fans want him to come back as J.J in the new ""Spider-Man"" films. Simmons alone was born to play this role. <br/><br/>The pacing is some of the best I have ever seen in an action or superhero movie. There is not a single moment in ""Spider-Man"" where you will be bored or disinterested, it's very fast paced and does a perfect job of grabbing and holding onto your attention in both action and character development. Sure, Mary Jane doesn't really develop much beyond crushing on Peter, but Peter's transition from immature teenager to selfless guardian of New York is handled very well, and Norman Osborne's descent from well-intentioned scientist to schizophrenic madman is tragic, terrifying and captivating all at once. The action sequences are all spectacular, feeling extremely source to the source material in style and choreography without coming across as goofy or over the top. <br/><br/>And lastly, the musical score. Danny Elfman's ""Spider-Man"" score is rousing, exciting and truly iconic to a Spidey fan like myself. It's impossible for me to listen too without smiling, and it really captures the tone of the movie and character perfectly.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man"" is a really good movie, but I'm not quite willing to call it great. Yes, I do have only 2 criticisms of the movie, and only one major, but the fact remains that when the romance is the heart of your story, you damn well better make it work.

","Mabye kids like this film.  But the simple fact is that it just doesn't measure up to the hype it's got, or the range of other great films coming out/out this summer. The visual effects are good but director Sam Raimi used them to carry the movie and ,as we all know from AI, that just doesn't work. The acting could have been much worse, the best comming from Willem Dafoe, he had a difficult role to play but managed to stop it becoming to corney and instantly forgettable (unlike that stupid green costume he had to wear). Toby Maguire and Kirstin Dunst could, and should have been much better, with Maguire seemingly unable to carry the movie by himself as all leading actors should do, and throughout the film he didn't really seem to always be in character and this let him and the film down. But something that should have been so much better was the cinamatography which should have been short sharp shots during the fight scenes, to really capture the action. Instead we had a steady-cam sat at a distance just like the audience and at a time when they need to be surrounded by action it just didn't happen. In conclusion, don't make a second one unless it's going to be better and if it's going to be an action movie, put more action in it, if it's going to be a romantic film, have more romance in it e.t.c<br/><br/>Oh and it was way too long!"

"odor007","1","1","4","10 May 2002"," MEDIOCRITY AT ITS PEAK!
","I must admit I enjoyed the first 45 minutes of this film.  I loved Tobey Maguire who was perfectly cast as the classic high school nerd.  I loved watching him overcome the odds against the school bullies, and I liked the entertaining scenes where he is exploring his new spider-like abilities. But after that, saying that the rest of the film went downhill would be a compliment.  Dull, predictable, terrible acting, and so desperately action-packed and backed by gaudy Hollywood special effects that it was sickening.  I found the assaults on New York by the ?Green Goblin? to be violent, disturbing (especially after Sept. 11th), and offensive.  I even had to wake up my slumbering buddy next to me so we could have a debate whether or not to leave the film.  Basically, the people who don't understand the title to this review, love shows like ""Survivor,"" drive an S.U.V. and thought movies like ""Pearl Harbor,"" ""The Matrix,"" and ""Gladiator"" were fantastic are going to be the people who loved this film.  Yes, that's right, it's a film that targets the masses like no other, and apparently is playing many ""film lovers"" like puppets.  Those who believe that this was the best film of 2002 (I'm not even going to discuss those who thought it was the best film ever made) need to catch the first ride out of the Texas trailer park and explore something called independent cinema--""Blade 2"" and ""The New Guy"" aren't the only movies out right now.  The only two elements where ""Spiderman"" had potential for decency were the special effects and the romance.  The special effects were so visually flawed and half-assed that it became a distraction, and the romance, well; let's just say it wasn't top notch.  The dialogue made me embarrassed to be sitting in the theatre, and the acting complimented this dialogue wonderfully-the only human touches this film had were intended to be as dull and straightforward as possible, but were only confusing--first Kirsten Dunst (M.J.) stands up for Spidey and likes him, and then she blows him off for half the film.  And finally, after hours of agonizing torment, the makers of the film decide to end things by (SPOILERS AHEAD) having the obsessive Spidey actually TURN-DOWN M.J.'s confession of love--after hours of us knowing how much Spidey loves her, the film ends with ""we only can be friends.""  I also loved the only scene in the film that involved a blur of ethnicity?the entire film is flooded with white actors, and I found it ironic that the only scene where minorities pop out is a rape-scene--that is until our hero conveniently comes to save the day! I thought this film was too bad for me to take the time to review, but I felt I had to attempt to persuade the moronic millions who claimed that ""Spiderman"" was a gem.  HOPED I SAVED SOMEONE OUT THERE $10 and a few wasted hours!"

","Why is this the most successful movie in history all of a sudden?<br/><br/>There has never been much of a buzz about Spider-man before, why now of all times? Personally, I thought the movie was entertaining, but it wasn't that good. The comic bookish lines such as, ""I'll get you next time Spider-man!"" and such may have been in the original comic book, but should have been left out in the movie. Nowadays, insults like ""F__ you Spider-man!"" would have been used, but this is a PG-13 movie. I found myself chuckling at a lot of parts in this movie. Whenever something pops up in a movie I don't like, I always make fun of it.<br/><br/>Let's just say I have never made so many comments about a movie in my life. Sure, Tobey macguire and Willem Dafoe were absolutely perfect for the parts, they were the only saving grace for this film as far as I'm concerned. However, having Spider-man computer generated almost the entire movie ticked me off. Couldn't they have hired a chinese acrobat or something? Whenever I see an action scene that is in CG, (ex. Final Fantasy), I never feel any suspense or even the least bit of turmoil because it is all controlled by a guy behind a computer. My biggest beef is that the green goblin guy works for a company that created an anti gravity one man vehicle, a strength serum, and little spheres that disentigrate people and shoot blades out and explode. Please, is Hollywood this dumb nowadays, can't they contribute to the plot a little and at least have him acquire these objects in another way?<br/><br/>My rating, I give it an 8 for entertainment, but a 5 for the movie overall. Spiderman fans who blindly give this movie a 10 because they think they are obligated, get a life or a wife. One of them will change you."

But about love, there are some stuff which is so cheesy in that film. Actually it has some more creepy stuff but in the great tempo and editing of the film they are not necessary to think about. Sam Raimi and writers did an amazing job on storytelling and introducing characters. Everything characters do have some reasons; we see what they do, why they do and connection between previous and next acts of characters. Cast is fantastic. I love Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man, he is still my best hero because of my childhood. Also, there is someone who steals the show every time: J.K. Simmons. He is fabulous! On the other hand, there is something this movie have which newest Spidey movies don't: Iconic scenes. Remarkable things are happening in that story.

"Michael_Elliott","Null","1","7","4 May 2012"," Very Good Characters Make Film
","Spider-Man (2002) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>The first film in the trilogy features Tobey Maguire playing Peter Parker, a dorky whiz who gains superhuman powers after being bitten by a generically engineered spider. With his new power he tries to work up the courage to talk to the girl he loves (Kirsten Dunst) but then a family tragedy forces him into crime fighting and battling the Green Goblin (William Dafoe) who just happens to be the father of his best friend (James Franco). SPIDER-MAN is a very good comic adaptation that benefits from some great direction by Sam Raimi, a wonderful screenplay with real characters and actors that bring those characters to life. There's no question that there are some flaws in the movie but none of them are so drastic that they take away from the quality of the film. In fact, I'd argue that the film has actually gotten better with time because of how well-written all the characters and situations are. This here is especially true of the Peter Parker character because he's just not a dork turned superhero. The screenplay really gives him a lot of emotions to play with and I think you really start to feel for the character and then feel for the problems that come along with his powers. The romance with Mary Jane works extremely well as does his friendship with the Franco character and the problems that eventually happen in not only the love triangle but the issues dealing with the villain. Raimi does a very good job at juggling all of this stuff and he manages to make sure that the action scenes live up to the expectation of fans but at the same time they never outdo the story and characters. It certainly doesn't hurt that the casting was so perfect. Maguire has no problems playing both the dork as well as the action hero and that laid back style of his perfectly comes to life in the film. Dunst makes for a good love interest as she just has a certain charm that she brings out of the character. Dafoe is wonderful, as usual, and he never has a hard time playing emotions or anger. Franco also does a very nice job as does the rest of the supporting players. SPIDER-MAN contains some very good action scenes and mixed in with all the human drama going on you're left with a strong entertainment."

"Bob_647","9","0","1","13 June 2020"," Comically cool introduction to the Spider Man legend.
","The appeal of the best sequences in the Superman and Batman movies is that they lend weight and importance to comic-book images. Within the ground rules set by each movie, they even have plausibility. As a reader of the Spider Man comics, I admired the vertiginous frames showing Spider Man dangling from terrifying heights. He had the powers of a spider and the instincts of a human being.<br/><br/>Spider-Man takes most of its cues from 1978's Superman: The Movie. Peter Parker's journey from unassuming geek to high-flying hero mimics the Man of Steel's in story and tone. The colorful comic spirit of Richard Donner's gleefully exciting original is all here, just Marvel fiend. Raimi and screenwriter David Koepp approach Spider-Man's origin with reverence for Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original story. Koepp's script hits all the beats you'd expect (Spider bite, wrestling match, great power, and all that), but it also includes, unexpectedly, an intelligent, eloquent emotional foundation. Raimi and Koepp understand who Peter Parker is, and how his transformation into Spider-Man can metaphorically parallel his development as a character. In being confronted by new and strange spider powers, Peter is also confronted by the responsibilities of manhood. Koepp takes Stan Lee's best idea (That Peter Parker should grapple equally between super villains and everyday problems), and pushes it to its logical max.<br/><br/>Peter's infatuation with girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is given equal importance to his struggle with Norman Osborne's manic alter ego, the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). The result is pretty well timeless. The quintessential Spider-Man story. A coming of age tale that gracefully weaves together every important aspect of the wall-crawler's myth into a grand concoction of pure Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Enhancing the story is one of the great casting jobs in motion picture history. First and foremost is Tobey Maguire, who was a revelation as Peter Parker/ Spider-Man. Like Christopher Reeve before him, Maguire completely defines the role. His Parker is a good kid; shy, dorky, and believably square. He radiates with innocence and later, teenage anxiety. As Spider-Man, he's delightfully charismatic. Lively, but never annoyingly brash in the way other Spideys have been. In the costume or not, every subsequent Spidey will live in his shadow. Maguire's casting was a stroke of genius, but it was no anomaly. Kirsten Dunst is a luminous Mary Jane, and she and Peter's romance sparkles with charm. Willem Dafoe relishes his Green Goblin role, with a voice and presence that burn with comic book intensity. Peter Parker was crucial in the evolution of Marvel comics because he was fallible and had recognizable human traits. He was a nerd, a loner, socially inept, insecure, a poor kid being raised by relatives. Ma Guire gets all of that just right, and I enjoyed the way Durnst is able to modulate her gradually increasing interest in this loser who begins to seem attractive to her.<br/><br/>I also liked the complexity of the villain, who in his Dr. Jekyll manifestation is brilliant tycoon Norman Osborn and in his Mr. Hyde persona is a cackling psychopath. Osborn's son Harry is a rich kid, embarrassed by his dad's wealth, who is Peter's best and only friend, and Norman is affectionate toward Peter even while their alter egos are deadly enemies. That works, and there's an effective scene where Osborn has a conversation with his invisible dark side. The origin story is well told, and the characters will not disappoint anyone who values the original comic books.<br/><br/>But Spider-Man belongs to Sam Raimi. A Spider-Man super fan since childhood, Raimi was destined to bring the web slinger to life. The offbeat sense of violent fun and jubilant cinematic showmanship that made Evil Dead and Darkman so entertaining is precisely what was needed to bring Spider-Man's New York to dazzling light. And what a creation Raimi's Spider-Verse is! The tone, with a precarious balance of larger-than-life action and textured character moments, never wavers once. Raimi crafts in Spider-Man, a New York where the archetypal comic book mainstays: the cackling villains, the wise-cracking heroes, and the pedestrians who shout to the skies ""Look, it's Spider-Man!"", fit just as well as the richly drawn human characters. Raimi and the creative team behind the film's production design deserve the highest of praises. There is nothing else that combines style and realism to such astonishing effect. It's as if forty years of comics have been distilled into a real world somewhere alongside our own.<br/><br/>Spider-Man showcases Sam Raimi at his exuberant best. Every frame of this movie is bursting with life. Whether it's the often gripping action scenes or the carefully crafted soap operatic drama, Spider-Man is an enthusiastic piece of crowd-pleasing entertainment, a passionate celebration of the Spider-Man Myth, and above all, a work of unparalleled quality. Blockbusters, especially superhero movies, with their all but guaranteed profits, can often breed lazy film making. Sam Raimi and company fly in the face of that conceit. The filmmakers have taken the time to really craft this film. Wrapped up in all the soaring spectacle is something real; An enchanting love story, a poignant morality tale about becoming the man you will be for the rest of your life.<br/><br/>That movie starts the string of the spider man that I'm grown with and raise the bar really high for the next super hero movie which comes soon after it. This part is really good synthesized. I can tell much more good thing about the movie but you can make them on your own."

","Spider-Man may play out like a slow drama, but that does not mean it is not exciting. As stated above, the sequences in which Parker discovers his new powers and tests them for himself prove to be particularly entertaining, although some skills seem to be mastered way too quickly (his fast reflexes saving MJ and her food is almost corny). It is also very interesting how the movie employs a montage to combine action sequences with an explanation of how Parker is able to get such good photographs of himself fighting crime. The action sequences between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin are fine overall, but the Goblin is honestly an underwhelming villain in this movie. Early in the movie the writer quickly throws in a reason for his insanity (one side effect of the performance enhancers is literally ""insanity"" according to one of Osborn's employees) and his plan to join with Spider-Man to - uh, wreak havoc? - is very poorly explained.<br/><br/>Raimi's Spider-Man proves to be an entertaining drama that does not overplay its use of comedy. There is a great balance between the drama, humor, and action in this movie, making it a great experience for all ages and a visually remarkable movie.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Every so often you revisit a film you haven't seen in years. I dug out my old DVD of Spider-Man and afterwards had lots of thoughts while dissecting it eighteen years later. We've had so many incantations of 'Spider-Man' that we forget that this film was the conceptual groundbreaker for the MCU and Hollywood's endless parade of comic book movies. What do we make of Raimi's contributions to the mythos now that the dust has settled? To be honest the whole Raimi series is over the top and sometimes it is to the point of being obnoxious. 'Spider-Man 3' is one of the worst comic book films ever made. But does this original hold up at all?<br/><br/>I kind of enjoyed it but the whole time I was wondering if I may have been laughing at and not with it. It's a cartoony movie with superheroes and villains that are flamboyant. Willem Dafoe alone is worth the price of admission and I mean that sincerely. The Green Goblin is a B movie villain and not some tortured soul. Dafoe realizes that and plays the part perfectly.<br/><br/>I think though that Sam Raimi who has a great sense of humor and flair for pulp entertainment was for the most part taking this seriously. The fun set pieces and scene chewing from Dafoe don't make up for the creepy screen chemistry between Maguire and Dunst. This is the prime example of the 'Your Princess is in Another Castle' trope. The fact that Mary Jane is totally oblivious to Peter Parker is insane. Maguire's Parker has all the charm and subtlety of Norman Bates.<br/><br/>And also this is prime Bush era Post-9/11 porn. The brave tough cartoon New Yorkers throwing trash at the Goblin saying ""Don't mess with my city"" is hilarious now. You have to think that the ""With great Power comes great responsibility"" stuff played well to that mindset too. That's something I definitely am tired of and have no nostalgia for.<br/><br/>For what it's worth 'Spider-Man' can be appreciated today if you don't take it for a high art requiem on good and evil like we are expected to do with 'Avengers Endgame'. It's a fine dumb comic book movie"

There is a reason this had such a huge day at the box office Spiderman is riveting and interesting while simultaneously sentimental. I would recommend this movie to everyone and anyone looking for an exciting action flick."

","After the success of other characters in adaptations to the big screen, especially with X-Men (2000) director Bryan Singer, it is natural that other adaptations would come around. In 2002 came the turn of one of the great comic characters of winning his first adaptation: Spider-Man. And it would not be an easy task, since it is one of the most popular heroes, collector of millions of fans around the world, as popular as Batman and Superman, for example. The arachnid world's most famous first appeared in the magazine ""Amazing Fantasy"", in August 1962, in his 15th and final edition, and like other dozens of characters, Spider-Man was created by Stan Lee who was responsible for its creation and the concept of the first adventures of the superhero, while Steve Ditko, was assigned to be the principal designer, is also co-writer of several of the stories of Lee's Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Who first became interested in bringing the hero to the movies was the renowned director James Cameron (The Terminator, Terminator 2: Judment Day, Aliens), who wanted even to Leonardo Di Caprio embody the hero. But due to problems with the production and rights, Cameron just ever abandoned the desire for adaptation, especially when you got involved with ""Titanic."" What Cameron is one of the greatest in its function, and we have no doubt is an eternal curiosity for fans would be like to have him in charge of the adventure. Later it was revealed that the treatment of Cameron's script, which came to be delivered to executives, brought as a mixture of the main villains Kingpin with Electro, and the Sandman, and also proposing the controversial web launchers organic and constructed and show the hero's love interest, Mary Jane Watson, as a girl digger and depressed.<br/><br/>Luckily for fans, the script was discarded, but the ideas of Cameron still serve as the basis for a future definitive treatment given by the renowned director, writer and producer, David Koepp. The writer, who had big hits on his resume of movies, such as Jurassic Park (1993), Mission: Impossible (1996), Panic Room (2002), Carlito's Way (1993), made occasional changes in story of Cameron and finally delivered a script that was accepted by Sony.<br/><br/>With the script in place, began the task of finding a director. After probing names like Chris Columbus (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001) and David Fincher (Fight Club (1999)), was chosen Sam Raimi, director of the films low budget horror The Evil Dead (1981 and Army of Darkness (1992), and good thrillers The Gift (2000) and A Simple Plan (1998). Initially the director - even being declared fan of the Spider - did not seem to be the ideal choice, but the good work in the last two films mentioned earlier, led Sony to give a vote of confidence to the director. Choosing director to leave the movie with a villain and not two as was originally planned was not crucial to the hype on the screens.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire was then called to live the great hero. The actor had already had good roles in movies such as the great Pleasantville (1998), Ride with the Devil (1999), Wonder Boys (2000), Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas(1998), and The Cider House Rules ( 1999). Although at the time of filming the actor be 26 years, it ends well with a convincing teenage college by his appearance and especially for his acting ability. It also brought a dramatic maturity necessary for the character crafted by young and experienced actor, who once took off his career in Hollywood.<br/><br/>The script by David Koepp has as part of its inspiration the famous comic titled ""The Death of Gwen Stacy"" in the first girlfriend of Peter dies while being attacked by the Green Goblin, who played from atop the George Washington Bridge (although Drawing comics is of the Brooklyn Bridge) in New York. This was the basis for the entire climax of the film version. The script has, however, has a few caveats. In translating the comic to the big screen, one of the most bother the fans was the fact that Spider-Man shoot organic webs and not through a device designed by Peter Parker. It really takes away the scientific genius of Parker, which was not as well used as well in the movie, but the solution to be something organic is much better explained. If he was bitten by a genetically altered spider and acquired numerous other features like spider sense of danger determined, able to climb walls etc, because he could not have webs to be born, to come out of himself? An explanation is fully consistent with the reality of the character. Could be followed as in the comics, but the solution is no attack on the arachnid and not something badly explained or flee from the very well-known by all.<br/><br/>Another point of controversy is the apparition of Mary Jane and not Gwen Stacy, Liz Allen - who later became the wife of Harry Osborn - or even Betty Brant, the secretary editor J. J. Jameson at the Daily Bugle. However, as stated earlier, it is more known to the general public was chosen to be the face of her love. What was strange was put Mary Jane in situations - especially the climax of the film - instead of Gwen Stacy in the comics. An enigmatic scene in the comic was shown as the Queensboro bridge collapse caused by the Green Goblin, but as Mary Jane. Who knows the background story can bother a bit about it.<br/><br/>Leaving aside these two topics essential qualities script Koepp are many. Approaching the hero even more teenage audience, showing that in fact it could be anyone, not necessarily the strongest, but a shy boy, awkward, skinny, who wears glasses and who is not rich or powerful. Spider-Man is not just a powerful being who protects the city of criminals. It is also the Peter Parker, a young student who needs to work to survive and help his uncles home. It is the most humble and the most human of heroes with flaws and virtues, causing an easy and immediate identification with the audience.<br/><br/>David Koepp wrote the script for the film acts very different and interesting. Almost half of the film was to present Peter and how he became Spider-Man. By now the boy knew well and track changes in your body caused by genetic mutation is sensational. If at first he thought of making money with the powers, family tragedy, and posture to assume the responsibilities of his alter-ego fighting enemies that would arise were a radical change in the youth's life. The events are occurring with impressive fluidity, and occurs very gradually transforming Peter, causing torÃ§amos for him all the time. One of the virtues of the script and direction was perfectly balancing the action scenes in the novel. Who does not remember the iconic scene of kissing Mary Jane Spiderman upside down? And the statement that Peter does for Mary Jane indirectly when they are in the hospital next to Aunt May? And when they talk in the backyard of their home talking about the future after graduation? Or when she says to him in the final scene and he is forced to reject her for not wanting to ever let her in danger? Are romantic moments, simply furnished and involving the audience so exquisite.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn did very well. He is a scientist who, pressed by the government decides to make experimental tests that end up changing not only your physical but also your mind. Norman ends up becoming the Green Goblin and has a reason for it. There is only one character in a single facet, no depth and has the sole purpose of ending everything and everyone. Here his relationship with his son is shown and justified their actions.<br/><br/>Since the action was a little aside, as a source movie. The famous jokes that Spider-Man ever talk to combat crime were a little aside and focus more on the emergence of the alter-ego of Parker. The focus here was evidently the transformation of Peter Parker an introverted guy without confidence, Spider-Man, whose powers were beginning to bring you great responsibilities. But as it would be in a blockbuster, we have some great sequences like the first fight between Spidey and the Green Goblin-event Oscorp, the great final sequence involving the Queensboro Bridge Mary Jane, a group of students, Spidey and Goblin Green.<br/><br/>The soundtrack by Danny Elfman (Batman (1989) Batman Returns (1992), Edward - Scissorhands (1990)) - collaborator Tim Burton minutes long - is certainly one of the best parts of the movie, knowing thrill and engage in moments of romance and drama and making us embark on the wild action in a landmark paper, clearly be an adventure more cartoonish and less dark and gothic as composed by him for most of Burton's films. We can even say that this first foray into movie character is a film about responsibility, personal growth and romance, surrounded by several memorable action scenes.<br/><br/>The special effects cannot be without service. If today we look back and see outdated special effects, with the movements of Spider notoriously well-being artificial (classic example is the race of the Spider and the buildings their heels when Peter discovers his powers, and of course the jumps between skyscrapers) at the time was what was more modern. Allied with photography done by Don Burgess and art direction by Neil Spisak, was actually very faithful to the comics movement by skyscrapers local flights sensational, all movement in the body of the spider like to stand crouching, the release of webs, and frames using centralized closes over as if they were the angles of comics.<br/><br/>The first adventure Arachnid is a big hit movie and it would create two more sequences becoming one of the highest grossing franchises of all time. We have plenty of mood and action scenes efficient. Most scenes happens day and violence is used very sparingly, yet there is no blood thrown on the screen or something so brutal. Guaranteed fun, with humor, adventure, action, romance just right."

"nyarnebbanot","7","0","1","16 March 2020"," A movie from a simpler time.
","I remember growing up as a kid. It was the summer of 2002 and everyone was going back to school. Spiderman came out.<br/><br/>Spiderman came out at a time when people wanted normalcy once again. After the 9/11 attacks Spiderman got everyone's love and attention. Patriotism was in the air and as well as this movie. Special effects where on everyone's minds. We where all about cliches and getting off the rough edge of the 90's.<br/><br/>SETTING: Spiderman is set in an ideal time of when Baby Boomers were reading comics and we where enjoying the atomic family. Set in New York City where everyone is rough but happy.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS:
Peter Parker is your average teen boy. But less than average socially. No one likes him except for a minority of people. Then one day he gets bitten by a radioactive Spider and becomes spiderman.<br/><br/>Mary Jane is the love of his life.<br/><br/>The Green Goblin played by Willem Defoe is a somewhat cliche rich man character but you still gotta love him as he is intimidating.<br/><br/>ACTING
The acting is rather akward as Toby McGuire makes rather dumb faces a lot. There is tons of hamfisted dialogue. However this is forgiven because the pace of the movie is easy to get into. You won't cry much but there is lots of funny moments!<br/><br/>The fight scenes are fun to watch as well.<br/><br/>SPECIAL EFFECTS
The special effects are mostly good but some are dated. There seems to be an emphasis on motion blur with many CGI models of Spidy swinging and flipping around.<br/><br/>OVERALL
Spiderman is definitely a product of it's time. A product that has ranked millions of billions of dollars in ad revenue . But you'll still enjoy the ride with your family."

","Though groundbreaking in 2002, a modern retrospective analysis of Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" reveals some cringe inducing stuff. All the high school scenes feel like a corny made-for-television teen drama show, like it's from MTV or something, and the adult ages of the cast are clearly not teenagers to the point it's near laughable. Also, there's a lot of dialogue bits and quips that feel juvenilely written all throughout this movie, but for notable example, there's a scene where Peter Parker tries various dumb verbal cues and hand positions to shoot his wrist webbing in different takes; it just seems like cheap audience laughter tactics (also to mention with that, contradictory to that scene, Peter had used the iconic Spider-Man finger positioning to shoot out a web strand at a cafeteria tray in a previous scene; how'd he know to conveniently do that with his hand earlier then?).<br/><br/>To the movie's merit though, the greatest and most memorable strengths for me are J. K. Simmons and Willem Dafoe's performances as J. Jonah Jameson and Green Goblin respectively. Simmons' performance is an impeccable incarnation of the comic book counterpart as if the obnoxious Jameson was conjured to life off the Lee-Ditko pages. As for Dafoe, his raspy cadence and cackles make him equally an impeccable incarnation of the comic book character. The only slight downside of this movie's Green Goblin for me though, being an avid comics fan and reader, is the disappointing design of the suit. It's generic and uncreative in comparison to far better comic book versions they could've adapted elements from.<br/><br/>To conclude this, the movie's a product of its era; superhero movies didn't have the same sensibilities and respect as they have now, and that must be kept in mind. But despite that, 2002's ""Spider-Man"" is still an enjoyable experience, just with the right dulled mindset. But if it were released today, I'm sure it wouldn't be the critical success it was; there's noticeable cracks in its glass."

","Spider-Man is personally my favorite superhero. He is just your friendly neighborhood super hero. If I learned anything from this film, is that with great power, comes great responsibility. Yeah, It is considered cliche now, but it was a powerful lesson back then and I can always tie the theme to this movie. While, there are bigger and possibly better superhero films to this day, Spider-Man is one of the best of the pre MCU films. (Though there is a film that I believe is better than this one). I enjoy this film a lot. It is a nice origin story full of action. William DeFoe is over the top as Green Goblin, but it actually works in this film! Tobey McGuire is not too bad as the lead in this film. The acting, is not too bad overall.

I think movie like this can be really good, if when, he is eaten by spider it making him more scary and turn him into actual spider instead of him wearing halloween pajaams. I like the story but I just don't believe it. Nobody can climb buildings if even you are eaten by spider. Magic spider dont make you climb buildings, but maybe in world like this it is possible. I notice many american movies like this. People put on clothes that are funny, making names about animals, and then they go fighting people.<br/><br/>Dont watch this movie if you think it will be horror movie about a man who is like spider.

","Sam Raimi had brought us a trilogy that everybody wanted, about a web-slinger climbing walls and fight crime. Yes, it's Spider-Man. He had made the first movie so great that I really was entertained when I watched this with my younger brother. It's just one of the Marvel Movies I could never forget.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire was just excellent and really perfect to be Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He was just a heart-felt character. He could even cry in the film (which most actors could do when they pretend that someone in their family is dead like Uncle Ben). The other casting choices were perfect as well like Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, Peter's love interest, James Franco being Harry Osborn, son of Norman Osborn who is the Green Goblin, the main antagonist, played by Willem Dafoe. He was also one of the best performances making Green Goblin one of the greatest Marvel villains thanks to Dafoe. The performances were actually a lot better than I expected and all went really well. Flash Thompson played by Joe Manganiello, was a perfect bully in the film. He was just so naughty being Peter Parker's Draco Malfoy that made me wanna hit him in the face.<br/><br/>There are so many memorable scenes which were quite hilarious like when Peter screamed :WHOAOAOAOAOAOAAAAA!"" when he swung with his web over and hit himself on a wall. The wrestling scene was also hilarious. Bonesaw really looked like an idiot. The battle between Peter and Flash was the same, I laughed when Flash got kicked in the ass. I was surprised when Peter just shouted: ""Shazam!"".<br/><br/>The screenplay was also good with some unforgettable lines, they were iconic like: ""That's a cute outfit! Did your husband make it for you?"". Some were funny, some were emotional and some were iconic. The dialogues and conversations were wonderful.<br/><br/>There wasn't much CGI in this film which made the movie even better. There were webbing action sequences, epic battles and they used little CGI. I was a bit disappointed with the cinematography because it was like old-school like the 80s, 90s or maybe the 70s. I felt okay when this movie didn't have any black bars. It's just the first modern Spider-Man movie (I'm counting Nicholas Hammond as well but it's a Tv Series).<br/><br/>The best part about this movie was Danny Elfman. When it comes to superheroes, Danny Elfman was the greatest one among the composers who could do that like Alan Silvestri but I felt Elfman was best in Spider-Man. The score was the best and I could never forget it. I even downloaded it on my MP3 player to listen when I'm having an adventure. Nobody could compose such a good superhero score like him. Of course, John Williams is still the best but he wasn't as good as Elfman in superheroes.<br/><br/>This is one of the greatest Spider-Man movies. I felt like it deserved to exist, a high ratings from critics though IMDb users made it 7.3/10 which was really disappointing. Metacritic is also a disappointing movie rating website (another 73 points). Rotten Tomatoes gave it well, 90%, it deserved that. It had many things I needed and it's one of the greatest Marvel movie today.<br/><br/>Ratings: 8.8/10"

","What a great movie this is.
It might corny and filled with the cheese but that's a part of what makes this movie so good.<br/><br/>CHARACTER
Toby maguire is an excellent Peter parker.
They gave him a short but great character arc in the beginning of the movie but even after that they managed to make Peter parker a great loving character and you can see that with the dialogue that is being provided.
For example the first time Mary Jane and Peter parker are having a real discussion and when Peter parker talks to Mary jane after graduating college all these dialogues show how great and loving of a character Peter is.
Harry is a decent character who is affected by his father not being there for him and it shows there is more to come.
Mary Jane was damsel in distress and was a pretty meh character.<br/><br/>VILLAIN
I would call Green goblin one of the greatest generic villains i have ever seen.
He might be generic but i still love him (Maybe cause of Willem Dafoe's performance) But at least he faced a challenge for Peter.<br/><br/>SPIDER-MAN
Toby maguire isn't that good of a Spider-Man cause he dosen't speak alot or make any jokes.<br/><br/>THANKSGIVING

","Ever since the dreaded ""Batman & Robin"" movie screened up in 1997, Moviegoers criticized it over and over, until we were left with one question: can superhero movies ever be good again?<br/><br/>The answer was yes.
Director Sam Raimi (Notable for his work on the horror films ""The Evil Dead"" And ""Army Of Darkness"") stepped inside Sony Pictures Entertainment to answer that question. Together, they created what was widely considered to be the best superhero movie series yet: Spider-Man.
For starters, this movie handles the Spider-Man origin story very smoothly. From the spider bite to Uncle Ben's death, no other superhero movie can top the origin story better than this one.
Now let's talk about acting. We've got Tobey Maguire playing Peter Parker/Spider-Man, and I say he does a great job with it. Raimi's Peter Parker displays the nerd inside but also showing a shy side to girls, even Mary Jane Watson (Kristen Dunst) - the girl Peter loves the most.
Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) does his work but after a human body experiment his personality goes full villain. Thus creating his alter ego ""The Green Goblin"" how Raimi handles the goblin is somewhat the best I've heard of from Dafoe so far.
And now, let's talk about special effects - brought to you by Sony Pictures Imageworks.
I've heard from some reviews that the special effects were kind of shaky, and I agree. But the special effects here are pretty well done - from blue screening to excellent CGI, You could tell that was hard work for all the people working for the special effects department.
Peter's relationship with Mary Jane Watson somewhat ties in with the original comics, if you're a comic book expert that is. But i don't understand why MJ is somewhat hated throughout, she's always put into a ""damsel in distress"" situation in ALL 3 MOVIES. But I can mostly ignore that, MJ is always the girl Peter/Spidey wants to save the most because Peter cares about MJ, she's his love life, and MJ always loved Peter since the first day they got together. Saving people is Peter's duties as Spider-Man.
Oh, and who wouldn't forget Peter Parker's friendship with Harry Osborn (James Franco), Norman's son? It seems to start here, but grows bigger and until Harry thinks Peter/Spider-Man killed his father and later becomes the new goblin in the third film. But i'm glad he realizes Norman Osborn/Green Goblin actually killed himself because of his own glider. How can someone who has been the son of a villain blame their friend, who is a superhero, for something that wasn't entirely their fault? But I guess that's Harry Osborn for you all.
And the CGI - oh my god. The way they handled the CGI in this movie is really realistic. Spider-Man's CG model is really accurate to the real one, done throughout all 3 movies - perfect.
And overall, what do I say about this movie? Fantastic. Spider-Man really captures the comic book spirit of a movie adaptation through the entire movie, with great actors, great story, great special effects/CGI, and great everything else. This movie really sets up the gold standard for superhero movies old and new.
And remember - With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility.<br/><br/>INFO

There wasn't a lot too it.It showcased his powers then, villain. The famous Uncle Ben line was not played out, so was the rest of the acting. Toby McGuire's acting is not really my favorite.

","The webslinger's first foray onto the big screen, and in many ways the grandfather of the big Marvel juggernaut that's been chewing up the box office for the last decade. Sam Raimi's vision of Spidey and his pals is true to the essence of the character, with a vibe that's often reminiscent of his '60s debut, while still feeling modern and serious when needed.<br/><br/>It boasts an extremely effective cast, despite selecting a few actors I don't usually enjoy. Tobey Maguire makes an appropriately awkward, plucky Peter Parker. Kirsten Dunst is sweet and charming as his lifelong next-door crush. James Franco shows range as the troubled best friend. J.K. Simmons was positively born for his bit role as the hot-headed J. Jonah Jameson. And, of course, Willem Dafoe brings a fantastically expressive act in the villainous role of Norman Osborn, the Green Goblin (though he's often, sadly, relegated to mere voice work behind a stiff, metal mask).<br/><br/>It has spirit and humor and character, but it also has a habit of over-reaching and a wince-worth tendency for ridiculously awful dialog. Even in print, it can be tough to keep this character from sounding corny and stilted, and in live action that's doubly difficult. The script constantly trips and stumbles over itself, trying and failing to seem cute and off-the-cuff, and Raimi's direction (itself known to lean on the cheesy side) always has the actors winking at the camera while their puns are falling flat.<br/><br/>The plot is solid, planting handfuls of seeds for future storylines while effectively setting up the current conflict, though it does have a nasty habit of over-indulgence. A double backflip during a schoolyard fistfight, for example, when the leap alone would've been enough. That kind of exaggeration is all over the place, and not only isn't it necessary, it actively ruins the immersion. I remembered really enjoying this upon its release, and it's still entertaining viewing, but much of it hasn't aged well, particularly in light of its modern counterparts."

","I've seen a great many films in my time, and most fade with the passage of time. It's been six years since this movie's release, and unlike most efforts, it still holds up very well. Tobey Maguire, previously seen at that time in the controversial ""Pleasantville"", gained worldwide attention when director Sam Raimi cast him in the title role. By contrast, Kirsten Dunst's portrayal of Mary Jane Watson was (and still is) widely debated among both critics and the fans. Personally, I enjoyed her role very much, and thought she did a wonderful job with both the empathy and strength of the character. So many heroines in films seem shallow, weak, or oversexed. Mary Jane is none of those, although one scene does push the third reference quite a bit (more on that later).<br/><br/>James Franco, who went on to star as a military trainee in the drama ""Annapolis"", does a nearly-perfect job as Harry Osborn. The character has been taken through many trials in the comic world, from drug addiction to demon posession (thank God the filmmakers didn't use either of those!); as such, it takes a talented actor to fill those shoes, and Franco does it justice. Willem Dafoe, as both Harry's father Norman and the psychotic Green Goblin, gives one of the greatest performances of his career, playing both sides of the proverbial coin: a weak-willed, oppritunistic man bent on success, and a crazed, evil being who revels in death and destruction.<br/><br/>But by far, my favorite role in this film is ""Law & Order"" star J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. He truly enjoys playing this character, and it shows on every conceivable level. As the saying goes, he truly ""eats the scenery"" in all his moments. Casting him was a stroke of pure genius.<br/><br/>The effects in this film are truly wonderful, though in retrospect the two sequels have definitely improved them. Still, the costumes, colors, and heroics are all stylishly believable. The world of this film is recognizably ours, yet raised slightly, to mirror the fantastic tone of the comics. Explosions, web-swinging aerial photography, digital composites, practical stunts - all these and more keep this film at an often-frenetic and rarely dull pace.<br/><br/>The music, composed by film legend Danny Elfman (""Beetlejuice"", ""Batman""), consists of everything from wondrous, gentle string arrangements to grand, epic stanzas, and Elfman works each one like the professional that he is. From the love theme for MJ and Peter, to the phenomenal main titles, the score is brilliant from start to finish.<br/><br/>Lastly, my criticisms, few but important. Being a PG-13 film, you might expect certain films to push every conceivable boundary; ""Spider-Man"" is a welcome release, in that it aims for heroic, selfless integrity, and succeeds for the most part. Still, there exist a few moments of note. One such moment takes place during the thunderstorm rescue with Mary Jane Watson. During a series of shots, the rain has soaked her clothes entirely, and her shirt almost looks like it belongs to a ""Wet T-shirt"" contestant (Dunst's breasts and nipples are partially visible through the material). Given the situation (a cold, wet thunderstorm at night), her attire is understandable, though morally unacceptable. To Raimi's credit, the scenes are quickly edited and not extremely graphic, though I personally believe decency should have been a higher priority in this situation.<br/><br/>Secondly, the violence. Being a superhero film, this movie fits that formula, having our wall-crawling avatar battle numerous thugs, as well as the Goblin. Citizens are often in peril (Mary Jane in particular), and though not bloody, many of the action sequences feature flying punches and kicks galore. The language in this film is thankfully kept to a minimum, with the most recurring instances being remarks such as ""ass"" or ""hell"". For such a film, I truly applaud Sam Raimi's effort at maintaining decency for most of this entry.<br/><br/>This film gets an 8 out of 10, deducting two points for violence and sexual material. The nobility, respect, and (in most cases) upright morality are a welcome change of pace from the excessive swearing, explicit sex, and buckets of blood seen in many modern films."

","Spider-man is my favorite superhero and the films really brought him to life in various forms. I am a fan of almost every cinematic representation but the initial film truly brought the hero to life for me. I remember seeing this film on opening day back in 2002 after anticipating it for months. The film begins with a voice-over narration by Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) as he's just a dorky high school kid though a brilliant mind who reads research on nanotechnology. He's late to catch the bus for a field trip to a spider research facility and is tripped when caught staring at his crush Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). Also attending the trip is the wealthy high school kid Harry Osborn (James Franco) who is a disappointment to his father Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe). While taking a picture of Mary Jane, Peter is bitten by a genetically modified super spider. Norman Osborn works at Oscorp to develop a glider, an exoskeleton suit, and a super soldier performance-enhancing serum but risks losing funding without successful human trials. <br/><br/>At Peter's home, Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) worry about their financial stability and Peter who comes home sick. Norman moves ahead with the human trial testing it on himself but it drives him crazy and he kills a researcher. Peter wakes up to find he has strange power like better eyesight, a ripped body, faster reflexes, and a strange webbing coming out of his wrists. When the bully Flash Thompson (Joe Manganiello) tries to fight him, Peter easily outmaneuvers him and punches him across the hall. He begins to experiment with his newfound abilities, crawling, jumping and swinging around buildings. The oddest thing about this film is the natural web shooting out of his arms, which at first, I thought wasn't so strange but didn't realize this was not the original way it was written in the comics. <br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"

","As dated as some of the dialogue, acting, effects shots, and plot points are, there will always be a special place in my heart for the original Spider-Man film (I'm not going to count those 70's features). This is largely due to the fact that it was the first superhero film I ever saw in a theater. I specifically remember where I saw it, who I was with, where I sat, and how terrified I was at the 3D images of the Green Goblin's face. For those reasons, I'm always keen on re- watching this one.<br/><br/>Before the golden age of superhero film, Spider-Man came out at a time when being inspired by Donner's 1978 Superman and Burton's 1989 Batman was the norm. You can clearly see how influenced Sam Raimi was to those films, specifically with his choice of bringing in Danny Elfman to do the music. This all gives the film a very nostalgic vibe to me. However, some dated qualities manage to shine through some of the better moments.<br/><br/>Those being the fact that Kirsten Dunst's 'Mary Jane' is essentially a useless plot device for the entire film. This doesn't necessarily change throughout the trilogy, but it's overtly clear with the first Spider-Man. My 8-year-old mind can push aside the damsel in distress moments, but 15 years later it becomes increasingly more difficult. The same goes for the dull dialogue between MJ and Peter, and the unquestionably awkward line delivery at times. I'm all for Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst, but their relationship isn't always sold well enough in the various scenes they have together.<br/><br/>With that said, someone who undoubtedly does sell their scenes is Willem Dafoe. He was terrifying as Norman Osborn a child, and he still sends a few chills down my spine when I see him talking to himself through a mirror in the Osborn mansion. But he isn't just a one-note villain either. Significant time is spent developing him as a forceful antagonist, but also a troubled man with misplaced intentions. In today's age of setting up future films way too far in advance, there usually isn't enough time given to developing villains (i.e. every MCU film), but luckily that's not the case with Green Goblin.<br/><br/>Overall, Spider-Man is clearly a dated film in many areas upon re- watch, but it's hard not to overlook them based on pure nostalgic alone. In a way, some of the dated qualities actually end up making it even more charming.<br/><br/>+Nostalgia<br/><br/>+Score<br/><br/>+Dafoe<br/><br/>-Dated, and definitely cheesy<br/><br/>8.0/10"
"stormhawk2020","6","0","1","12 June 2017"," A strong Marvel entry
","One of Marvel's flagship characters finally makes it to the big screen and with Sam Raimi at the helm, you have a sure-fire winner. The first half of the film is as expected, fantastic. It has just the right balance of humour and action and although Tobey Maguire's acting talents are rather limited, he manages to pull off the dorky charm of Peter Parker with some success. There's a lot of humour in the discovery of his powers and how to use them and the supporting characters are all believable. It also shows the motivations and character development of Spiderman really well and rarely descends into schmaltz. Unfortunately once the tights go on, things are not quite as strong. The Green Goblin was never a particularly interesting character and although the schizophrenia plot line is clever, Defoe holds the attention far more as the disappointed father than a dayglo action figure on a hover board. Raimi handles the action nicely though and it's worth it alone for J. K. Simmons whose hilarious J. Jonah Jameson steals every scene he is in."

","Marvel's greatest superhero is given a great film that compliments the talent of Stan Lee. The casting of Tobey Maguire, Williem Dafoe & Kirsten Dunst her best work is a perfect example of Directors picking good celebrities to fill great roles. They all put in memorable performances in this Romance story which was a big part. Peter and Mary Jane was a perfect match together as portrayed, now the material they had to work with the great Spiderman comics helped in creating those characters. Not so the Green Goblin. Dafoe made that character just like Nicolson made the Joker in Tim' Burton's Batman. Instead of a generic bad guy we got a likable schizophrenic who was screwed by the people around in. The film is a comic classic."

","Spider-Man was released in 2002 and was directed by Sam Raimi. The film is about a high school kid named Peter Parker whose life changes completely when he is bitten by a radioactive spider and gains superpowers, going on to develop the alter-ego of Spider-Man.<br/><br/>What makes this movie stand out from other superhero movies is how much attention to human detail it is given; we're presented with relatable every-day characters which we begin to care for because of how much we identify with them and it becomes a story you can understand and doesn't seem out-of-this-world like many other superhero films. The director also understands how to balance the amount of time given to both the human side and the superhero sides of the characters. Tobey Maguire is perfect as Spider-Man and even though I think Tom Holland will do a great job in the new Spider-Man: Homecoming, Tobey is the true Spider-Man in my eyes. He captures the character of Peter Parker perfectly; awkward and quirky but a character you can identify with and relate to and therefore care for. His traits combined with Maguire's performance make him a very likable character and a great lead.<br/><br/>The relationship between Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter Parker was handled in a realistic, albeit very entertaining manner and there are multiple situations that many can relate to as they can put themselves in the positions of both of those characters and feel what they are feeling which makes their relationship one that audiences can connect with.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe portrays the main antagonist of Norman Osborn/the Green Goblin. I loved his performance as Osborn and he was a fascinating, complex character, however I couldn't really buy the Green Goblin too well. I understand that the film is supposed to be comical and goofy at times and for the most part that aspect is handled well but I think they might have gone just a bit too far with this villain; his motivations for acting this crazy don't really make much sense and he literally says and does every supervillain cliché in the book. His costume also looks absolutely ridiculous and it's impossible to take him seriously, however this isn't something that holds the movie down too much.<br/><br/>I've also got to mention how amazing J.K Simmons is as J. Jonah Jameson; all I can say is perfect casting choice.<br/><br/>This film is a film that certainly has dated, however it isn't necessarily a negative point. When you watch it, you can instantly tell that it's from the early 2000s, whereas watching the other two you'll have a harder time working out what time period it's from. It's mainly the style of the film which has made it dated, the biggest reason being the character of the Green Goblin for me. Like I said, this isn't necessarily a negative point but something I felt should be said.<br/><br/>Conversely, the style is also something which makes the movie unique as what it is and gives it the comic-book feel, but not going too over-the-top (most of the time anyway). The style adds for plenty of humour which was refreshing to see and makes the movie even more charming.<br/><br/>Overall, I don't really have anything else to say about this movie and I thought it was really good, with a great lead character and a director who clearly understands the material. It's a film that has certainly dated, however it isn't necessarily a bad thing.<br/><br/>7.8/10"

"GusF","Null","0","1","16 April 2016"," A very good superhero film
","Released in the year of its title character's 40th anniversary, this is a very good superhero film. I have always been much more interested in DC than Marvel so, outside of this film and its first sequel, my familiarity with Spider-Man comes mostly from the 1990s animated series and what I have picked up by osmosis over the years. As such, I'll be reviewing these films on their own merits since that it is all I can do, really. Although there are a few silly moments, the screenplay by David Koepp is generally strong but it could have benefited from sharper characterisation. The relationships are painted in pretty broad strokes. The special effects are impressive for the time and Sam Raimi directs the film with a great deal of flair and energy. My favourite action scene is the Green Goblin's attack on the World Unity Fair but the finale is not quite as exciting as it could have been.<br/><br/>The film stars Tobey Maguire in a great performance as Peter Parker, a shy, awkward high school senior who finds that he can do whatever a spider can after he is bitten by a genetically modified - as opposed to radioactive - super-spider. Peter is highly intelligent but lacking in the social graces. He is disliked by most of his peers and is more or less at the bottom of the high school totem pole. When he develops his powers, Peter uses them for selfish purposes such as beating up his seemingly long-time bully Flash Thompson and entering a wrestling competition to win $3,000 to buy a car to impress the love of his life Mary Jane Watson. However, after his beloved uncle Ben Parker is murdered by a thief whom he had refused to stop barely an hour earlier, Peter learns the hard way that Uncle Ben was right when he said, ""With great power comes great responsibility."" The experience motivates him to become New York City's web-slinging protector and he quickly captures the public imagination. Maguire excels with the material which he is given and he is certainly able to convey Peter's social awkwardness and love for Mary Jane very well. However, I would have preferred if more emphasis had been given to the internal conflict that he faces as he tries to rectify his real life and his superhero identity. When it comes to Uncle Ben's death, I felt that we were told rather than shown the impact that it had on Peter.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe is very good as Norman Osborn, the brilliant scientist and industrialist who tests his company's highly experimental super- soldier formula on himself out of desperation. As these things never end well, he is driven insane and becomes the Green Goblin. The Goblin manifests itself as a separate personality. This is very well illustrated in the excellent scene, perhaps the best in the film, in which Osborn ""converses"" with the Goblin while looking in the mirror. I really loved this scene as it emphasised that the Goblin is a dark reflection of Osborn's original personality who compels him to do things that he would not be capable of doing on his own. In this respect, the scene reminded me of the more extensive exploration of the concept contained in ""Magic"" (1978), in which the ventriloquist Corky Withers regularly talks to his extremely creepy dummy Fats. Unfortunately, the scene in which Osborn speaks to the Green Goblin's mask is nowhere near as effective. A further examination of Osborn's fractured psyche in more scenes along the lines of the mirror scene would have been very much appreciated. Speaking of the mask, I had mixed feelings about it as I loved the look of it but it prevented Dafoe from using any form of facial expression. I did like the fact that Osborn has a distant relationship with his son and Peter's best friend Harry, played well by James Franco. This served as a good contrast to his affection to Peter before he discovers his secret as well as to Peter's bond with Uncle Ben.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst is good as the very likable Mary Jane and the character is nice and sweet and everything but she doesn't have much of a personality outside of being the Love Interest. Still, she and Maguire have quite good chemistry and some of their scenes were quite touching. The famous upside down kiss is one of the aforementioned silly moments but I do think that it's nevertheless a cool and oddly romantic one. I wasn't really convinced by her relationship with Harry but this was largely because it is underdeveloped, having been inserted merely to provide an obstacle to her and Peter getting together. The film occasionally feels rushed in its second hour and this is the best illustration of that. Unsurprisingly, the great Cliff Robertson does not have much screen time as Uncle Ben but he is excellent in the scene, another of my favourites, in which he tries to impart his wisdom on Peter when it comes to the issue of responsibility. This is really the only time that which Robertson gets the opportunity to shine and it meant that I found Uncle Ben's death scene more affecting that it would have been otherwise. J.K. Simmons has even less screen time but he comes within a hair's breadth of stealing the show with his hilarious performance as the Daily Bugle's loud mouth, obnoxious, Spidey- hating editor-in-chief J. Jonah Jameson. However, I think the character's bark is worse than his bite as he seems to like Peter in spite of his bluster and does not reveal his identity as the photographer to the Green Goblin even when his own life is threatened. Rosemary Harris is good in the fairly thankless role of the supportive Aunt May.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very enjoyable film but it could have been an even better one."
"flickfreaks-70695","8","0","1","24 March 2016"," The long-awaited big screen incarnation of the 40-year-old Marvel Comics superhero
","The pictures's first, and better, half is devoted to Peter's makeover from campus dweeb to physically unique righter-of-wrongs. While visiting a Columbia U. science lab, Peter is bitten by a mutant blue-and-red spider. Next day, his vision is perfect and he's newly buff, and it isn't long before he discovers he's capable of spinning industrial- strength webs and walking up buildings.<br/><br/>He first uses his new strength and acrobatic skills to dispatch Mary Jane's a-hole b.f. in a school fight, then thinks to impress her by earning money in a wrestling challenge matched against a monster named Bone Saw. This entire apprenticeship section was always going to live or die on the charm and appeal of the actor playing Peter, and the initial sweet sensitivity Maguire conveys, followed by the growing thrill of self-discovery of his new superhuman abilities, proves captivating. <br/><br/>Peter's strictly Lark use of his powers comes to an unwelcome end when his uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), who with wife May (Rosemary Harris) has raised the boy, is killed in a Manhattan carjacking. Donning Spider-Man gear and swinging via self-generated threads from building to building like an urban Tarzan, he dispatches the culprit while deftly eluding police seizure. Already in this early major action sequence, though, something feels a bit off; the movement seems jerky, the pursuit unnecessarily hurried, so that while the sight of the young crime-buster gallivanting through the nocturnal canyons of New York City is impressive, it lacks the desired visceral thrill.<br/><br/>Naturally, Spider-Man requires an adversary, and he gets one in the form of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), an Armour-plated fiend who zips around like a rabid snowboarder on a heavily armed glider dropping pumpkin bombs on uncomprehending foes. Like Spider-Man, the Goblin has a human identity, that of Norman Osborn, an ousted corporate arms manufacturer who becomes a Jekyll-and-Hyde upon consuming an experimental formula of his own devising. Unlike Peter, Norman can't control when he slips into his alternate self, and Dafoe's best moments come when the two sides of his personality argue with one another and flip back and forth as quickly as a light switch. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, when ""Spider-Man"" settles into full superhero mode an hour in, the conventional contours of David Koepp's script come fully to the fore. With the Green Goblin committing such heinous acts as blitzing a World Unity Festival in Times Square top-lining Macy Gray and threatening to drop Mary Jane and a Roosevelt Island tram loaded with kids into the East River, he and Spider-Man face off in increasingly standard-issue good guy/bad guy fashion, with no bigger issues to give their rivalry special import. Further deflating the balloon is an abundance of over-cranked digital physical action that's singularly lacking in grace or the feel of real movement, human or animal.<br/><br/>Welcome compensation comes in the form of Peter's continued pursuit of Mary Jane, who remains oblivious to his dual personality for some time but eventually warms to his newfound confidence. For many teenage boys, picture's highlight will not be found among the action interludes but rather in the scene of Mary Jane, her flimsy shirt drenched by rain, peeling back the lower part of Spider-Man's face-mask in order to kiss him while he's hanging upside down in a dark street. <br/><br/>Ironically, it's when ""Spider-Man"" sticks to simple human interaction that the film breathes and ingratiates itself. Chemistry between Maguire and the winning Dunst is excellent, and there are good moments, too, between Maguire and James Franco, who plays Norman's unhappy son and Peter's only friend at school, as well as with Robertson and Harris as Peter's doting substitute parents. Cackling behind his armoured Goblin costume, Dafoe is stuck with routine villainy when not writhing through his transformations, while standout supporting turn is served up by J.K. Simmons, who brilliantly catches his piece's comic book origins while snapping out funny one-liners as a cynical newspaper editor.<br/><br/>Physically imposing production is notable for Neil Spisak's production design, which involves considerable invention but also allows New York City to play itself without Gotham City-like stylisation. James Acheson's costumes, beginning with the terrific ribbed Spider-Man outfit, are splendid, Danny Elfman's score punches things up in customary form, and Don Burgess' lensing, while accommodating the countless effects, makes the actors look great."

","Sam Raimi's Spider-Man still holds a near and dear to my heart. This was the first film I watched in theaters in multiple viewings. Being eight years old and being a big comic-book fan, Spider-Man was a film that I could not wait to see. <br/><br/>It's been almost twelve years since May 2002, and yet, the film still holds up in certain levels.<br/><br/>I like the casting of Tobey Maguire. He brings out the best of Peter Parker and fits the title role very well. He holds the film on his shoulders but with also a good supporting cast. Willem Dafoe is great as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. I love how Dafoe is able to turn his Goblin persona on and off so effortlessly. He's very frightening and very cold, while at the same time can be a very nice man. James Franco is great as Harry Osborn, he doesn't overplay the wanting attention and support from his father, as well as displaying some jealousy towards his friend Peter, it's all very subtle and it works well. Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson are excellent in their respective roles as Aunt May and Uncle Ben. J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson is spot on. Probably the best casting of a supporting comic-book character ever. <br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst is, in a lack of a better word, just okay. Her delivery is solid in some moments, but it's near the end where she throws herself at Peter, admitting her love for him seemed very forced. It is the only uncomfortable scene to watch out of the whole film. <br/><br/>The Visuals are decent in some shots, but overall, there are moments in the film where one could easily tell it was all CGI, and it's not that impressive. Costume of Spidey is very faithful and looks great on screen, I can't say the same for Goblin. It's very Power Rangers like. <br/><br/>Spider-Man isn't an your typical summer action blockbuster. It is a blockbuster in every regard, but it has something more. The characters are relevant and I liked the whole dynamic between Norman favoring Peter over his own son Harry, whom he's disappointed in. It adds layers to the film and shows these character their reasons for doing what they're doing. The romance is cheesy, but it isn't too terrible, though Dunst isn't as strong as the other actors, she and Maguire have enough chemistry to buy into. <br/><br/>Spider-Man is still very much an enjoyable film and swings high. <br/><br/>8.6/10"

","Brief Overview: Sony has released two different Spider-Man franchises to date, and the movie I am reviewing is the first Spider-Man in the original trilogy (I have also reviewed both movies from the current franchises, so if you find this helpful check out those two reviews under my name iconic-sr). 2002 Spider-Man for the time it was nothing short of spectacular. In many ways, the original Spider-Man is a pioneer for many of the comic book movies we have today. This film is directed by Sam Raimi, and stars Tobey McGuire as Spider-Man, Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin (the antagonist) and Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane.<br/><br/>The Positives: For the most part, 2002 Spider-Man stays true to the comic books, while making some minor changes that actually work pretty well. I felt that the casting was good, and each actor fit their role (with the possible exception of Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane). The CGI for the movie is impressive for the time this movie was made, and the action sequences are shot very well. Willem Dafoe plays a very good Green Goblin, displaying insanity and a sinister vibe that really makes him a notable villain for comic book movies and proves a challenge for our protagonist.<br/><br/>The Negatives: I think most people who have seen this movie would agree that the overall tone is bordering on the cheesy side. I felt like a lot of moments that should have been intense were underplayed and others were overacted. Kirsten Dunst's interpretation of Mary Jane was bland. She portrayed virtually no emotion, and is really the only problem I had with the casting for this film.<br/><br/>The Conclusion: I gave this movie an 8/10 because given the time that it was created this movie was the elite super-hero movie. The storyline, action and dialogue keeps the interest of the audience and provides a fun movie for comic book fans. I recommend this for general audiences."

","After 25 years in development hell, Sam Raimi(The Evil Dead, Darkman) and Columbia Pictures brought Spiderman to the big screen in the Spring of 2002. The film does justice to Marvel's Spiderman comic books and it's fun to watch even if you've never read a comic book. Tobey MacGuire plays Peter Parker and his alter ego Spiderman. During a field trip, a radioactive spider escapes from its cage and it bites Parker on the hand! The spider bite gives him superpowers such as a ""Spideysense"" and the ability to shoot webs. In the comic book, Peter uses ""prosthetic web shooters"". In the Spiderman movies, the web shooters are organic. Peter Parker has a crush on Mary Jane(Kirsten Dunst), a redheaded girl who goes to the same high school. After Peter's uncle Ben Parker(Cliff Robertson) is killed by a mugger, Peter fights crime as Spiderman. Spiderman has to help people as the malevolent, psychotic, power-hungry Green Goblin(Willem Dafoe) kills people in New York. TV's Spiderman and his Amazing Friends(1982) and a Spiderman T-shirt that I wore in 1985 were my first exposure to Spiderman. Although, Spiderman has been around since the 1960's. A live action Spiderman movie project was passed around from studio to studio. Cannon Films had the Spiderman filmmaking rights at one time. At one time, James Cameron was going to direct the film. A movie poster and a movie trailer with the World Trade Center was used to promote the Spiderman movie in 2001. Both disappeared after the Terrorist Attack on September 11th, 2001. Spiderman(2002) is jam-packed with patriotism and flag-waving. The visual effects in Spiderman have been criticized for looking rubbery and cartoonish, but they get the job done. The visual effects in Spiderman 2(2004) and Spiderman 3(2007) make it up to us by having eye-popping, glossy visual effects. The late ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage plays a wrestler that Peter Parker fights in an arena. Lucy Lawless, Bruce Campbell, and director Sam Raimi make cameos in the film. Tobey Maguire an inspired choice for Peter Parker/Spiderman. He has to be mild-mannered, strong, and good-looking at the same time. Kirsten Dunst i hate as Mary Jane there's no chemistry between her and Tobey but the upside down kissing scene is a classic. James Franco is quite good as Peter's friend, Harry Osborne. Willem Dafoe plays Norman Osborne and the Green Goblin. Rosemary Harris plays Aunt May and J.K. Simmons plays Daily Bugle chief J. Jonah Jameson. Danny Elfman's Spiderman music score is good. Spiderman was spoofed on The Simpsons and the ""Weird Al"" Yankovic song 'Ode to a Superhero'. John Dykstra(Star Wars, Batman Forever) crafted the visual effects for Spiderman(2002)."

","Finally, ""Spider-Man"" makes his debut to the silver screen after all the 1970's Nicholas Hammond TV serials. How well has it been adapted? <br/><br/>The casting is debatable even to this day when among my friends. Do you remember when Michael Keaton took heat for Tim Burton's ""Batman"" (1989)? Well Tobey Maguire is constantly lauded and berated among my peers, but I personally think he did very well and continues to hold up nicely. No doubt I think he gave it his all in ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004), whereas ""Spider-Man 3"" (2007) feels no more than a burnout for everyone involved.<br/><br/>Though Maguire remains a nice debate for fans, everyone else is casted brilliantly. James Franco and Kirsten Dunst hold their own as great supporting characters. J.K Simmons ""IS"" J. Jonah Jameson and though William Dafoe is undeniably cheesy in his execution, he steals the show in every scene (That costume however is utter crap, and I highly recommend looking online for the original goblin designs).<br/><br/>The action scenes are also very decent, yet the films dated CGI can be a little jarring nowadays. However, scenarios throughout the film kept it engaging as the 10 year old me was blown away at the times release, and it still remains one of my favourite movie going experiences. Though Sam Raimi deviates far from the original storyline, the characters motivations and morals stay true to the original source. It's awesome to see a director incorporate this kind of imaginative camera-work into this movie as he did his older work. Even the final battle arena echoed that of ""The Evil Dead"" movies.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: An American icon brings super heroes into the new millennium with stunning confidence. 8/10."

","Having already proved himself more than capable of creating a fun comic-book style movie with Darkman (1990), Sam Raimi finally had a crack at the real thing in 2002 with Marvel's Spiderman—and he did a remarkably good job, delivering a slick, action-packed, major-studio, summer blockbuster that genuinely feels like a superhero comic-strip brought to life, with colourful cinematography, perfectly nuanced performances and the director's playful visual style very much in evidence (as opposed to those dreary Nolan Batman films that take matters far too seriously).<br/><br/>Starring Tobey Maguire as the titular web-slinger, Spiderman is an 'origins' movie, and as such takes a while to get the slam-bang action, but the characters are so well defined and the script (by David Koepp) so smartly written that boredom is never an issue. I've never been much of a fan of comic book movies that dwell too heavily on the whole 'tortured soul' aspect of their central character (as in Nolan's miserable Batman films), and with Spiderman being one of Marvel's classic 'emotionally troubled' heroes, there was serious potential for this to be a rather joyless affair. Thankfully, Raimi handles the personal trauma in such a manner that it never drags the enjoyment factor down. This is pure entertainment all the way—a real corker of a superhero film that still has the power to wow well over a decade after its original release."
"joetufano882","9","0","1","20 June 2014"," The first superhero film I saw that blew my mind
","Spider-Man (2002) is a movie that has stayed in my imagination for a long time, and this movie along with the sequel Spider-Man 2 has become of my all time favorites over the years. Before, I never really cared much for comic books or superheroes except for Batman with the Joel Schumacher Batman flicks which... well, you know. My feelings beforehand on the film before it's release, ""Looks fun, but nothing THAT special"". Boy was I wrong because I was in complete awe as I watched it in the theater with my Dad. I loved it then, I still do today even though I do recognize it has some flaws but I give this movie a lot of credit though for (along with X-Men) for reviving the comic book movie genre, and for getting me into the idea of superheroes in general.<br/><br/>I know a lot of people don't like Tobey Maguire anymore because of the Emo Peter sequence in Spider-Man 3, but I've always thought he was great in the role of Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Having read the comics, I will say that in a lot of ways he encompasses the traits of the classic Peter Parker. He's shy, timid, intelligent but also caring of the people in his life. Within the first 10 minutes of the film, he's established as the school nerd who isn't with the crowd, has Harry Osborn who is his only friend and goes unnoticed by Mary Jane Watson whom he's been in love with since childhood. And you do feel for him as a character and understand his progression as we see his progression from hapless nerd to cocksure fool, to humbled hero after the tragedy of Uncle Ben's death. Call me crazy but I think Tobey did a great job of capturing those qualities and I think he did a great job as Spidey also successfully encompassing the heroic nature of the character with a touch of Spidey's humor here and there. Kirsten Dunst I don't feel is THE best Mary Jane ever, but I've always appreciated her portrayal of the character. Yes the damsel in distress act gets annoying after awhile but like with Peter, you see her character change throughout as she decides what kind of man she wants in her life, and she had some depth to her as far as her home life with her parents. <br/><br/>James Franco does commendable work as Harry Osborn and I love the hint of him becoming the villain in the future. Cliff Robertson (RIP) and Rosemary Harris are terrific in the roles of Uncle Ben and Aunt May and the scene where Uncle Ben dies makes me tear up every time. Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin is perfect. Even though his character comes off as evil for evil's sake, he does bring a human element to the role since he favors Peter over his own son Harry. And yes the Goblin costume does look stupid, but I like it anyway. And JK Simmons is PERFECT as J. Jonah Jameson... Nuff' said! Along with Sam Raimi's direction, David Koepp's screenplay play a huge part with these characters and they both succeed in giving us likable characters that we can connect with.<br/><br/>The score by Danny Elfman speaks the character so well, the effects while some of it looks a bit dated still hold up today, the humor (while it goes overboard at points) is also great, and Sam Raimi's style I think is very suitable for Spider-Man given that the film is very colorful with characters, the tone and the music. It even feels like your watching a comic book come to life. The action is also masterfully executed. Sam Raimi I feel is a master of directing action/suspense since he uses a mix of practical stunt work and CGI. The final fight between the Goblin and Spidey is a showcase in this film for his skills of directing fight scenes. And I absolutely LOVE the final sequence of Spider-Man swinging through the city after he gives the ""my gift, my curse"" monologue with Elfman's theme blaring in the background.<br/><br/>And I know some people have problems with some of the changes made to the character as far as MJ coming before Gwen Stacy and the organic webbing. Personally I never had a problem with these changes because you can't adapt every single thing from the source material, and every creative mind is going to have his/her own spin on the story. The organic webs I felt were more believable than the idea of a high school student having the 3 million dollars or so to create the mechanical web shooters, and also given that he was bitten by a genetically engineered spider, why not?<br/><br/>Regardless of how people feel about this movie now that the reboot is out, I've always loved this film and always will even though I like the 2nd one better. It's got well realized/likable characters, fun action, a truly amazing score, and a tone that perfectly captures everything that Spider-Man's all about."

"richieandsam","7","0","1","17 April 2014"," A lot of fun and a good film to watch.
","SPIDER-MAN<br/><br/>This is the original Sam Raimi version.<br/><br/>The movie is about a school student and photographer who gets bitten by a spider and develops special powers like a spider. His nemesis in this is the Green Goblin.<br/><br/>I like this film I know the Sam Raimi version got slated by a lot of people, but the films were a lot of fun. The feel of this film is very comic book. But that is what I like about it. I felt that with the latest Batman trilogy they took the comic feel away from it and made it into a very dark, realistic feeling movie I loved it, but I still preferred the Tim Burton version of Batman because it still had the comic book feel.<br/><br/>The effects are not too bad, but at time you can tell that there are a lot of computer generated moments, especially when Peter is sunning along the roof tops.<br/><br/>The casting was quite good, but I thought there were some lines and scenes where they delivered the lines so badly. Especially MJs facial expressions at times I have to admit, I did laugh at it. Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He does a great job. I think he is a good actor, but haven't really seen him in much else. Kirsten Dunst plays MJ. Kirsten is a very good actress, but this is not her best work. She has times where she is very convincing, but other times she was quite bad. James Franco plays Peters best friend, Harry. James has grown in leaps and bounds he was good in this film. I understand completely why he is as big now as he is. The Green Goblin is played by Willem Defoe... he is an excellent choice for this role. He has the perfect facial expressions for the part and does a brilliant creepy performance. I also really like the cameo appearances from some famous faces Stan Lee, WWF Superstar, the late great Macho Man Randy Savage and the legend that is Bruce Campbell.<br/><br/>There were parts of this movie that I thought were ridiculous. It just didn't make sense. Peter gets bitten by a spider, it swells up so badly and he feels really ill so instead of going to the doctor or hospital he goes home to bed? Really? No-one would ever do this! I also thought it was really funny how MJ was so confused all the way through the movie she was so immature for her age. She starts the movie by dating the school meathead, then starts dating Harry, then she has a school girl crush on Spider-Man and then ends the movie telling Peter that she loves him Blimey, get a grip woman! It seems that she has no clue as to what love is.<br/><br/>This film is a great movie which I will watch again and again. Sam Raimi has done a good job with it and I love the way the whole film feels. A nice little finishing touch was right at the end of the credits you get to hear the classic Spider-Man theme tune! Awesome!<br/><br/>I will give this film 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>""With great power, comes great responsibility"""

","Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a nerdy high school student who has a crush on his next door neighbor Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). His only friend may be Harry Osborn (James Franco), the son of wealthy inventor Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe). On a field trip to Oscorp, Peter gets bitten by a genetically modified spider, and he develops powers to become Spider-man. Meanwhile Norman is desperate to prove his formula for human performance to the military. When he test it on himself, it corrupts his mind and turns him into the Green Goblin.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi has created a very good introduction to Spider-man. The actors are all very capable and fit their characters. Willem Dafoe is amazing as Green Goblin. The only minor complaint is the web slinging ability. It's a major change to comic lore, but I understand the reason. I always liked Peter Parker because he was the underdog nerd. So it's a great thing that this series starts off well. And who doesn't love an upside down kiss in the rain?"

","Peter Parker, an intelligent but awkward teenager's life is forever changed after he is bitten by a genetically altered spider, giving him spider like super powers. Peter learns that with great power comes great responsibility as he must fight evil as a superhero after tragedy strikes within his family.<br/><br/>Based on the MARVEL comic, many people consider this a fantastic film, and why i do agree up to a point, certain aspects of the film fall short with me. The action is superb but much is left to be desired with some of the over the top hokey dialog and cheesiness throughout the film. Now granted there is a good bit of this film that is extremely enjoyable, the pacing of the film is well and most of the acting is decent, personally i believe Tobey Maguire is a perfect Peter Parker but a let down as Spider-Man. Let be known that as a child I grew up reading Spider-Man as he was my favorite MARVEL comic book other than Captain America, so the character holds special relevance to me. Now I'am not saying this is a bad film, not at all, but certain aspects of the film left me flat and I felt as though much more could be perfected and achieved through this film. Now granted compared to its eventual sequels this is by the far best of Raimi's Spider-man trilogy, but not the best comic book film. Enjoyable action sequences, a true to form story and with a decent pacing within the film. The biggest drawbacks are in its acting and in its dialog throughout. Spider-Man is an enjoyable film, just not the best."

","Raimi's spiderman was released into theatres back in 2002, the film is great it had everything that a spiderman fan wants in a film adaption of the character's origin story.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi did a good job at directing the film, his directing made me feel like I am spiderman (when spiderman swings the camera often moves) therefore giving the viewer the closest experience he can get from web swinging around new york. Raimi's take on spiderman wasn't dark it wasn't too comedic either, the film seemed to have the perfect blend of action, drama and comedy.<br/><br/>Spiderman had a lot of humorous scenes, which were very interesting especially like when peter says ""shazam"" while trying to use the web or when he catches the food with MJ's tray, the fight scenes were excellent, I mean it's spiderman vs the green goblin...who wouldn't want to see that, but, the romance between Peter Parker and Mary Jane was way too extreme, I refuse to believe that MJ was Peter's inspiration to become spiderman.<br/><br/>In terms of writing the film had a good screenplay, it covered all the traditional elements of a superhero origin story, and added a few things, like the romance between MJ and Peter (which I did not like at all, it ruined the film for me)<br/><br/>The acting in spiderman was not bad, Kristen Dunst's performance wasn't as good as expected, it felt like the sense of mystery was missing from MJ's character. Some people complained about how Tobey Maguire didn't look like peter parker, in my opinion he was a great Spiderman, he live up to the role, he was able to portray the high school nerd side of peter parker and the spiderman side, his movements were ""spider-like"" as well, and his reflexes were great while he was spiderman, unlike Andrew Garfield's take. James Franco was as always...brilliant, and surprisingly William Dafoe made an excellent Green Goblin he had one of the best portrayals in comic book movie villain history!<br/><br/>The costumes were great in spiderman, the spiderman suit looked very fresh and modern, when Green Goblin's suit looked bad ass, it was excellent!<br/><br/>The Cinematography in spiderman was really good especially when spiderman is swinging around new york. The effects were good too.<br/><br/>Overall I give the film a 7/10 it was a well written, well directed film, but the romance between MJ and Peter was way too extreme and ruined the film for me."

","2002's Spider-Man is a film that will always have a special place in my memory as, though I did see the first X-Men film on television some time after it came out on DVD, I never saw it in theaters, Spider-Man, on the other hand, was the first superhero film I saw on the silver screen. It was a film that had enough impact on my very young mind to make Spider-Man my second favorite superhero, right behind the Caped Crusader himself. I loved this film as a kid, almost as much as Jack Nicholson's outing as the Joker in the original 1989 Batman film, and watching Spider-Man again and again as I grew older has only made me appreciate it's spectacle even more. <br/><br/>For one thing, the special effects were top notch for the early 2000s and, for the most part, hold up very well today. That is, aside from the very early 2000s video game-esque crawling spider and spinning DNA strand intro animations, which I can't give them too much trash for because they are certainly not an integral part of the film, and I think they were going for a stylized, comic book appearance anyways. Aside from that though the special effects are still fantastic looking today with epic swooping camera angles and fantastically choreographed fight scenes. The overall cinematography of the film is grade-A with a perfect combination of practical and special effects for the majority of the film, aside from the occasional, dated, 90s- esque close-up shots of Spidey yelling to show how much fun he's having, but this is a movie about the web-slinger, and the web-slinging looks great. <br/><br/>The score of the film is fantastic as well with a powerful, trumpeting orchestra, presenting the perfect tone for both the action and emotionally-oriented parts of the film. It is yet another winner for Danny Elfman in my book and is the type of score that I would take any day over many of the heavily electronic scores of recent years even while these symphonic pieces seem to be fading away in favor of soundtracks that can be made by two guys with a computer and a $100 software program. <br/><br/>As for the acting, the majority of the cast is very strong and supported by an excellent script comprised of a multitude of Stan Lee's memorable as ever characters, making for some very compelling performances. Starting with the amazing wall-crawler himself, Spider-Man, a.k.a. Peter Parker, played by Tobey Maguire, while there are certainly those who would object, mainly due to the train-wreck of a final installment which was Spider-Man 3, which was mainly a directorial disaster, in my opinion, I felt Tobey did a fantastic job as Spidey. Before what I imagine was director Sam Raimi's evil alter ego forcing Maguire to die his hair and dance around like a total numbskull, Tobey Maguire was delivering Spidey performances like this, bringing in all of the awkward nerdiness, emotion, charisma, humor, compassion, and complexity of both Spider-Man and Peter Parker, Maguire is not at all a bad pick for a leading role and he carries the film marvelously. Next we have the great Willem Dafoe whose role as the Green Goblin/Norman Osborne is easily in my top 10, if not top 5 supervillain performances of all time. Dafoe brings all of his Academy Award nominated, and in my opinion deserving, acting chops to the role bringing the menacing insanity of the character along with his emotional conflict as a father, friend, and businessman. When you're watching an actor like Willem Dafoe, you know your in for a classic performance, I only wish he had a more revealing mask, because with the diversity of this man's facial expressions, he could have brought a whole new level of terror to the Green Goblin if he did. To follow Willem would be Kristen Dunst as Marry Jane Watson, Parker/Spidey's love interest and, while I can't say I'm consistently her biggest fan, she delivers on the emotional aspects and a likable performance, so you can't ask for much more than that. After Ms. Dunst would be who I see as the only short link in the film if only because he isn't used enough, or allowed to develop his character enough in the film, Mr. James Franco, I never thought I'd say it because I am planted firmly in Franco's corner as of recent years but his character simply does not get enough screen time for you to care a whole lot about the misfortunate Harry Osborne. The last actor of note other than those characters would be J. K. Simmons as a simply spot on, bar none, perfect J. Jonah Jameson, after his performance there is just no one else I can think of for the role.<br/><br/>Overall, Spider-Man was a groundbreaking superhero film both visually and emotionally. It is spear-headed by an all-star cast and supported by a phenomenal original score. Though the film may have a few short comings, and can even feel a bit dated at times it is still, what I believe will be, and already is for me a superhero classic. The third film may have fallen off in it's own respect but this first film was a monumental step in the right direction for superhero films and for that, it's a 5 out of 5. For Spidey's Burning Building Baby Help Line, this is The Truth You Can't Handle, signing off."

I believe this Spiderman movie does him complete injustice. While the first one was not as terrible, the second and third were appalling. I was a lot younger when they first came out and even then I didn't really enjoy or like them. It wasn't well done, the actors were very boring, and I hear from fans that they slaughtered the original comics. I never understand why the movie industry feels the need to change important things, unless it is to save time or they simply do not have the technology to do it justice. The movies felt very watered down, and Kristen's acting is a bit painful to watch. I actually like her in other movies but this is definitely not one of them.

","Sam Raimi, a known director for the movie: ""Drag Me to Hell"", brings yet another exciting movie to the big screen. <br/><br/>I honestly didn't know what to expect since I hadn't read the comic book.

The overall quality of acting was outstanding. Each person highly exceeds the expectations dictated by the plot. Never at one moment does any actor fail to deliver as their character. Being my first time of watching a movie directed by Raimi, I must say I'm overly impressed. Raimi undoubtedly knows how to spin a web of fast-paced action and admirable scenes of tension carefully designed with bits of suspense. He stands out as an exemplary creator of quality action films. The only minor let-down was the costuming of William Dafoe. I didn't really fancy the idea of the color of the costume being green, given that the color itself symbolizes growth and harmony. This goes in high contrast to the dangerous and intimidating vibe that his costume is supposed to give off.<br/><br/>Despite the movie's minor shortcoming, Spider-Man is first-class, striking and exceptional--definitely worth a few hours of entertainment."

","If there is one superhero I relate to the most, it's the web slinging Spider-Man. Ever since I was a kid, this red and blue, wall crawling arachnid has also been the superhero I saw myself in, the superhero I can see myself portraying. When the 2002 film starring Tobey Maguire came along, I was as excited as a leprechaun locked in a chamber full of beer. This superb superhero flick is up there on my favorite superhero film list and even if sequels have come along as well as a stellar reboot, this film still holds a special place in my heart. This is a shining jewel in the comic book based movie category and when it comes to Spidey films, this is a feast fit for any Spidey fan. <br/><br/>The comic book look and feel of the film must be praised. Sam Raimi and his team surely came through in delivering a great comic panel to silver screen transition and making us feel like we were watching a comic book come to life. From the New York skyscrapers to the abandoned warehouse to the film's web slinging scenes, you really feel like your sucked into the motion picture and every, jaw dropping moment. You feel like a piece of the pie, and this film is a pie that will make any comic book guru go bonkers. This film hearkens back to the great Steve Ditko stories of the golden age of comics and really delivers a scope and feeling of epicness. Spider- Man is mighty and the actor portraying him is radical. <br/><br/>Tobey Maguire gives us a more serious Spider-Man than the wise cracking one seen in the panels of the comics, but he still has a touch of humor here and there and really fits in Spidey's shoes perfectly. When it comes to playing Spidey's alter ego, Peter Parker, Tobey also hits a home run and really portrays him as an average ordinary everyday teenager. Many people, including myself can relate to Maguire's take on Parker/Spidey, for he plays him as a realistic, determined fellow just trying to make his way in the world. William Dafoe is great as the Green Goblin, giving us a menacing and hilarious villain who loves being villainous. I will admit, his costume is a bit ridiculous, but it's not the worst I've ever seen. It's a lot better looking than Halle Berry's Catwoman, that's for sure! <br/><br/>The other actors are also good in their aliases. James Franco is a rebellious, yet headstrong Harry Osborn and Rosemary Harris is a sweet, grandmotherly Aunt May (More wheat cakes, Petey?). Kirsten Dunst is as Mary Jane as you can get, although she can be a little petulant at times, especially in the later films. And of course, the great Bruce Campbell in all his glory makes an appearance. Him and Sam Raimi are like peanut butter and jelly, and Campbell always knows how to make his cameos work, giving us brief, yet funny and memorable moments. Did anyone see his cameo in the latest Oz movie? <br/><br/>Overall, Spider-Man is a fun, whirling and twirling action packed suspense thriller that will have you entangled in it's awesomeness ever second. Honestly, I could sit here for countless hours talking about the grand action scenes, the iconic dialogue, and the cheesy, yet comic book inspired special effects, but IMDb has a limit, and I gotta keep it short. Spider-Man is just a head spinning ride of unexpectedness and epicness, but doesn't hold a candle to the sequel that would follow two years later. We'll get to that one some other time."

Not saying the the films were terrible they were very good but the fact that the third was bad was not what i was expecting. William Defoe in the first was a great green goblin. Toby was a great spider-man. could of been more action scenes but great overall. The second spider-man had an even better villain and tons of action. Yet the third movie took a BIG I MEAN BIG DROP. Toby wasn't as good as he usually is and his performance just disappointed me. I could not get past it. I am giving the a six because Sam ruined a really good spider-man trilogy."
"cherold","5","0","3","15 December 2012"," Terrible, terrible script
","I just watched 2012's Amazing Spider-Man, and it reminded me of how hugely disappointed I was by this 2002 movie. And I just feel like ranting about it, because ten years later, it still really bugs me.<br/><br/>It's funny what I remember from this movie. For example, I remember Peter practicing with his web by shooting it at a soda can. I remember that because I remember how the can was placed to perfectly display the brand name in a way that shouted out THIS IS PRODUCT PLACEMENT! If they had set the can down so the brand name was slightly off center I probably wouldn't remember that now.<br/><br/>But that wasn't the problem with the movie. That was fine. I recall it being a cute scene. <br/><br/>The problem with the movie was the script seemed to have been written by a bunch of people who weren't reading each other's contributions. The best example of this involved Peter and Mary Jane. Early in the film, Peter is either practicing saying something to MJ or writing something to her - I don't recall which - along the lines of, ""you don't really know me even though we live next door blah blah blah."" At the end of the movie, MJ makes this speech to Peter about how she realizes he was always there for her. It really aggravated me, because those two tiny segments are opposites that don't belong in the same movie. How can you make a huge, big-budget film and not catch that contradiction?<br/><br/>The real problem with this movie, though, is the bad guy. I don't really remember the story, I just remember there really wasn't much of one. The bad guy was lame and it all went nowhere.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a terrible series, with only Spider-Man 2 worth watching (and that one was not as good as The Amazing Spider-Man). But what bugs me most of all is how so few people seemed to have noticed what a terrible script this movie had. What's up with that?"

","I'm gonna say it right here, I'm a HUGE Spider-Man fan. He's my favourite superhero of all time. So, being such a big fan, I, of course, had to watch the movie adaption. Surprisingly, I didn't actually see it in theatres - I wasn't old enough at the time, or maybe my parents just didn't take me to go see it. Who knows.<br/><br/>So, finally watching it, I gotta say...it is SO an early 2000s movie. There's this one scene, where it's just a shot of Spidey (played by Tobey Maguire, which was an interesting choice) from just a bit below his shoulders and up. He's against a bright New York Cityscape sunset. And he raises his hand and does the websling motion...<br/><br/>...and it looked so BAD I burst out laughing. You know, that laugh where you feel kinda bad for laughing? Yeah? That one. It looked SO dated, it was humorous. Most of the other special effects were pretty decent, if nothing special.<br/><br/>This is a fun superhero movie. It's nothing more than that, to be honest. And it did have some problems with it. First off, the dialogue between Spidey and his big villain, Green Goblin (played by Willem Dafoe) was just so cheesy and forced. There's a part where Green Goblin sings ""Itsy Bitsy Spider"". I'm serious.<br/><br/>My second problem with it is that so much about Spidey was changed in the movie. Looking back, now knowing more about Spidey than ever, I see so many problems. First off, where's Gwen Stacy? Part of me just thinks the writer was scared to kill her off, so she wasn't put in. Oh well. <br/><br/>Secondly, Spider-Man's webslingers. Or, rather, his lack-there-of. Spider-Man NEEDS his webslingers - it's an integral part of his character, showing the intelligence of Peter Parker. That's a big problem in this movie - Spider-Man doesn't seem smart, at all. This continues into the other films, so be warned.<br/><br/>I thought the suit was fine, but the white webbing as opposed to the black was kind of strange. Come to think of it, what else is Red, White, and Blue? A flag...of a country...a very powerful country...<br/><br/>That's right! France! Subliminal messaging, people. Subliminal messaging.<br/><br/>Anyways, if you like Spider-Man, be sure to check this out. It's great fun."

This could be the director. I also resent that he does not look like he has the physique does not look like the physique in the suit because the suit is a muscle suit. I would like the actor that plays Spiderman to look like he has the physique. I think that they should have found somebody that can portray a geek, but also look like a superhero when the body suit, like George Reeves or Christopher Reeve who had to play a similar character as Superman. If Superman can find an actor that can play both sides well, so should Spiderman. Then all I have to see to ruin the film for me is to see Tobey Maguire's smile.

","Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Willem Dafoe, Rosemary Harris, Cliff Robertson and J.K. Simmons star in Sam Raimi's 2002 action film based on the Marvel comics. Maguire plays nerdy teen, Peter Parker who lives with his Aunt May (Harris) and Uncle Ben (Robertson). He also has a best friend, Harry Osborn (Franco) whose father, Norman (Dafoe) is a wealthy scientist. Dunst (Interview with the Vampire) plays Peter's crush, Mary Jane Watson who lives next-door to him. Soon, Peter gets bit by a super-genetic spider while on a class trip with Harry and starts to change. Meanwhile, Norman tries to save his failing company by performing an experiment on himself and becomes menace, the Green Goblin. Peter starts feeling different and becomes tough against bullies and wrestlers. Soon, he learns that with great power comes great responsibility and becomes web-slinging hero, Spider-Man. He also gets a job as a photographer at The Daily Bugle owned by J. Jonah Jameson (Simmons). This is a good comic book/superhero film featuring a good cast, neat effects & great score by Danny Elfman as usual. Bruce Campbell (The Evil Dead) also makes a cameo in this and the next 2 films with Raimi's younger brother, Ted and Spider-Man creator, Stan Lee. I recommend this."

","I admit expecting a silly, immature waste of time when I started to watch spider man, believing that I would last about ten minutes. Two hours later, as the credits rolled, I must admit that Sam Raimi made a really good and entertaining comic book adventure suited to adults.<br/><br/>Toby Maguire is just right as Peter Parker, with the aw shucks, humble kid next store demeanor for the part. He is smooth and likable and Raimi made the right choice. Dr. Norman Osborn is the central villain and Willem Defoe is a villain from hell who is the right actor for the part. The weak link is Kirsten Dunst who is whiny, clingy and downright annoying. The strengths heavily outweigh the weaknesses so just sit back and enjoy the ride."
"Toxicwasteland","8","0","1","15 February 2012"," Good film...
","I recently rewatched this film. It actually is very good. I changed my rating from a 6 to an 8. Don't know why I had it so low in the first place. I still think they should have kept a lot more of the original script. Good think they took out Doc Ock, though but it would have been awesome having Green Goblin and Doc Ock teaming up against Spidey.<br/><br/>In the original script he had more interactions with Flash, was a little bit more action packed, and was more true to the original material but I can see why they cut it down because with all that it would have been a very long movie.<br/><br/>This movie is great but I never really felt Tobey was right for the part having read the comics. In this film he portrays Peter Parker very well but in the sequels the character becomes him. Out of the trilogy this one is my favourite. Number 2 was good but was too corny for my liking.<br/><br/>I am in support of the reboot but this is a film I will always love deep down inside. This will always be the classic but I have a feeling the new reboot will be better. That's my opinion though."
"The-Sarkologist","8","0","1","31 January 2012"," Much, much better that I originally expected
","I have never really been that much interested in superhero movies, particularly since many of the offerings in the 80's and 90's were pretty average at best. Up until recently the only superhero movie that I really liked was Batman Returns, however this was before the recent offerings from Christopher Nolan appeared, and even then it wasn't until one of my friends sat me down and actually showed me Batman Begins that I actually realised that some of the more recent offerings were actually pretty good. So, it was when Spiderman 3 hit the movies, that I decided to watch the earlier two, and discovering that all three were directed by Sam Rami (better known for the Evil Dead trilogy) that I actually gave this genre another glance.<br/><br/>Spiderman has been around since the 60's, though is first appearance was in a compilation comic book. However he quickly became very popular, and has since spawned numerous comic book series, cartoons, and as of recently, three movies. He is also rated as the third most popular superhero (with Wolverine taking out first place). To me Spiderman differs from a lot of the other superheros in that he is simply not a very strong alien (eg Superman) or some rich billionaire (eg Batman and Ironman) but rather a struggling photographer that happened to have been bitten by a spider that had been genetically altered.<br/><br/>I am not that familiar with the development of the superhero franchises so I cannot say whether Spiderman took superheros in a new direction, and I can't say that the film does so either. However this film does raise the idea of the superhero as a struggling young boy who lives a double life. While no movie truly follows the comic books (it would be very difficult to do so), we do have the aspects of where Peter Parker starts off as a highschool kid, goes to college, and then tries to make his way in the real world, while living a double life a Spiderman.<br/><br/>One of the strange things is that when Peter Parker discovers that he is a superhero, he does not immediately run off and tell everybody. In fact he tries his best to keep it secret. Even in the fight scene where the school bully decides to try and teach him a lesson, he does his best to play it low, buy dodging all of his punches, performing flips in the air, and it is only when he is forced to that he punches back, and it is with this single punch that he pretty much brings the fight to an end.<br/><br/>This film, and indeed the other three, seem to focus on the loneliness of being a superhero. He has to keep his identity secret, and while he has friends (and these friendships are tested with his double life) he does not believe that he can really get close to anybody, which is why he quietly rejects MJ at the end.<br/><br/>In the comics Spiderman is not alone, he has the entire Marvel universe to interact with, and does have affairs with a number of X-men (including Kitty Pride, aka Shadowcat, and Jean Grey has a crush on him). However he always seems to remain the lone masked figure. Very similar to Wolverine in many respects. In one comic that I read, Wolverine finishes off a whole building of ninja's, and Spiderman makes a cameo, asking if he needs any help, which Wolverine (not surprisingly) politely declines. I do believe that these films capture this loneliness quite well, but it is something that I will explore further once I watch the next two films."

I have never cared about films with lots of special effects and little story, but Spiderman confirms my dislike because of corny and overused special effects and no story that has never been told better before. Raimi is not going for anything having to do with characters, he is simply showcasing a large amount of effects on yet another digital backdrop.

","This could have been a lot better. I felt like the costumes were too Hollywood looking and didn't look like a student made it. The Green Goblin costume also had this effect. The sets looked like sets and CGI was really apparent. The final fight with Spiderman and the Green Goblin couldn't have looked more staged and the set totally looked like a sound stage. Luckily, we have learned since then. Tobey Maguire was fine as the lead, although they could have picked better. I didn't think that Willem Dafoe was cast right. He didn't embody the goblin like I thought he should have. There wasn't enough spiderman action. I did love the last shot of the movie though, classic. Mary Jane played by Kirsten Dunst did a fare job but once again casting could have been better. I don't think that Sam Raimi was the best choice for directing this. I am by no means saying he is a bad director because he isn't. It's just that he is more known for horror films and that style of filmmaking is vastly different from a super hero movie. So overall, an OK film but nothing to get excited over. The lighting was terrible during the night shoots and you could hardly see spiderman. The camera was also whack during the first web slinging bit. This isn't a good movie, but it isn't terrible."
"johnnymacbest","8","0","1","7 July 2011"," A great adaptation of one of the most famous superheroes.
","I remember seeing the trailers for this film and I thought: WOW!!! They really pulled off a believable Spider-Man film that does justice to the spirit of the comics and character. Spider-Man is a film that audiences young and old to enjoy, with it's dazzling action sequences, humorous lines and a well-written and exciting plot.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi, known for his cult ""Evil Dead"" films and the underrated but brilliant ""Darkman"" gives the character so much in traits and personality, wit, that it's hard to imagine anyone else that can deliver a Spider-Man film. More often than not, I think this film is a great example how much hard work and devotion is done to make sure that this film is a success. True, some of the shots seem artificial, but what viewers should really focus on is the story and characters, something that moviegoers sometimes fail to do. And with a script like this, you will be too.<br/><br/>Like Richard Donner's ""Superman"" another film done right, Spider-Man spends a considerable time on the origins of Peter Parker, who is motivated to use his powers for good due to a tragedy in his life. But whereas Superman was brought up to do good by his parents and the values he learned on his time on Earth, Spider-Man was struck by circumstance, both by his surroundings and his personal tragedy. These characters are completely different from each other. But what makes Spider-Man so compelling than Superman is that he's an average, ordinary guy with everyday problems that one day becomes blessed(and to a certain extent, cursed) with an extraordinary gift. His reaction is that of joy and excitement that is shared by everyone in this world when they find themselves doing extraordinary actions. Though not in no way in the context of the real world, but the point still stands. And lets face it we all like to be superheroes some day. Spider-Man gives us the feeling of living out those fantasies in more ways than one.<br/><br/>To make a great superhero film, or any film for that matter, you have to have strong actors and Tobey Maguire is by far the best choice for the film. He's really believable as a guy who is shunned by his pears but still is kind-heart and meek, bright. You grow to care for Peter, Mary Jane, Aunt May, Uncle Ben, and Norman Osborne. When a film makes you care for the characters, then you know it's good. As for the action scenes, they are thrilling, exciting, and at times, very brutal. Even though Spider-Man is a bit light-hearted and fun, it can be really intense and scary, which parents ought to be cautious when seeing these films with their children. But despite all this, Spider-Man is still good fun.<br/><br/>Now that a reboot is being planned, I'm very excited to see what's next for the Web-Slinger even though I enjoyed the first film along with the second(which I will review later on). The less said about Spidey 3 the better, but Spider-Man is the best one ever made and the sequel is pure magic as a film that surpasses the first one by far."

","Comic book adaptations are ten-a-penny these days; and while Tobey Maguire, so often annoyingly dopey, is a natural to play Peter Parker, the amazing Spider-Man's alter ego, overall, I found this film ordinary. There's some good stuff: I liked the idea of Parker trying out his super-powers in a wrestling competition, but his subsequent development into a full-blown superhero seemed accelerated, and a wasted opportunity. I also found the Green Goblin, with his static mask, a frustrating enemy - his failure to move his jaw when speaking makes one feel like one is reading a static strip, not watching a moving picture. The film gains some tension towards the end, but whereas 'Batman Begins' grew on me in spite of myself, 'Spider-Man' didn't; and there's some overplayed moralising in the mix as well. In some ways, comic books boil down a story to its essence, and the rest is all in the visuals; the same is true for this film, and for me, there's not enough complexity to make it truly interesting."
"stacie_nicole2001","9","0","1","20 March 2011"," Spiderman Review
","There is no doubt Spiderman is an excellent movie. I would highly recommend this film to movie goers as this incredible yet lifelike action film is paced by the plot and the characters to keep the interest of the audience. This movie takes the comic book genre to the next level. The directors reinvented the comics into an epic journey by enhancing the already brilliant characters and making them more realistic similar to the movies X-Men and The Hulk. What captivated my attention the most is the unbelievable fantastic special effects. The theme is a super hero who fights crime in New York City and stops criminals making the world a better place.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is about a high school student name Peter (Tobey Maguire) who is transformed into an ultra-superhero after he is bitten by a spider that has been genetically altered in a lab. Once Peter transforms into Spiderman he discovers that all of his senses are enhanced such as the ability to hear and see better, climb buildings with his spider hands and swing from building to building using his web as a brace. Spiderman starts to develop feelings for a fellow classmate named Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and she falls for Spiderman. Peter takes a liking to becoming a super hero and fighting off criminals, Spiderman becomes famous and all along no one knows who the real Spiderman is. Then comes the Green Goblin/Norman (Harry Osborn), Norman is the father of a close friend of Peters who develops an alter ego from testing a dangerous chemical on himself. The Green Goblin makes it a mission to destroy Spiderman and uses Mary Jane in the process by kidnapping her and putting her in a harmful situation in an attempt to attract Spiderman. In the end Spiderman defeats the Green Goblin and the movie ends with a cliff hanger because Green Goblin/Normans son Harry (James Franco) vales to destroy Spiderman for what he has done to his father.<br/><br/>The angles of the film are very important to captivating the audience and relating to the theme as a major part of the film is Spiderman gliding in the air making the angles and lighting tie into the importance of making Spiderman's action shots appear realistic and lifelike. This is important to the theme because Spiderman is a Superhero that stops criminals and makes the world a better place."

","What a great movie! There was so much adventure, so much story, so much emotion, and so much to relate to! The main character is a socially rejected, nerdy kid. Same with me. The kid ends up with super powers (that spider man has, hence the title of the movie) and uses it to show off to a girl who he (according to the movie) has had a crush on since he was 8-10 or so. The girl is actually quite a good choice. Not a cheesy blond or something nasty, just a nice pretty red haired girl. Perfect for the social rejects.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the story as well. It was very emotional during the Uncle's death, as well as the Aunt in the hospital. I really liked the ""love"" scene between the main character and the girl. I also liked the competition feel during the movie where the reject wanted to impress the girl but the other guy, who was still a nice friend, was doing so already. I guess as a 17 year old it's just easy to relate to it.<br/><br/>Of course who could forget the action, the excitement and intensity while spider man faced his many villains! Rated 8/10, mostly because of some mild swearing."

It also has the distinction of being quite a good super-hero film (origin films are often so tied up with telling the origin story that they forget to give the audience a fair helping of what they went to the movie for - the super-hero of the hour actually doing his super-heroic thing).<br/><br/>A well-cast Tobey Maguire goes through sufficient dollops of (rather mature) teenage angst before suffering the bite of a radioactive spider, contributing to his much-loved uncle's murder through inaction, designing and making an extremely snazzy costume, falling foul of his best friend's loopy millionaire Dad, and finally making headway with the girl of his dreams (headway, in this case, being an extremely wet upside down kiss).<br/><br/>And the audience is favoured with some decent Spidery goings-on, with a particularly effective climax on some bridge in new York (probably the Brooklyn Bridge, but don't quote me - I'm from the Isle of Wight).<br/><br/>The performances are all good: as noted, Maguire is a little old for high school age peter parker. And the other slightly wrong note is the absence of wisecracking from Spidey in costume. Otherwise all is very well (with Rosemary Harris and JK Simmons spot on, visually and performance-wise, as Aunt May and J Jonah Jameson).<br/><br/>The CGI is a little wobbly early on, but is mostly very near to what the comic suggests Spider-Man's movements must be.<br/><br/>And the emotional journeys of the characters all work well in this satisfying movie."

","Now that enough time has lapsed since this movie was released and that the series of Sam Raimi/Tobey Maguire Spidey movies have reached an end, i feel OK to give a full, frank revue of the movie, without feeling like a stick in the mud against the universal praise the movie received on its release, and with enough nostalgia for the film as i remember it. For me the movie never quite captures the pure white heat enjoyment of the greatest Spider-Man stories from Marvel Comics. Raimi never quite gets to grips with the danger and excitement of Spideys world. Whilst the action sequences and special effects are truly awe inspiring, the world in which they are presented feels too much like a high budgeted Power Rangers remake. This is in no small part due to the glossy Production Design by Neil Spisak and the airy, breezy cinematography by Don Burgess. Both commendable by any event movie standards, but at the sake of a translation of a dangerous, fun, darker world that existed in Spider-Man comics since the 60's, 70's, 80's. Tobey Maguire gives a solid, earnest and emphatic performance as peter Parker/Spider-Man, and im sure for a whole generation Maguire will be the definitive Spider-Man actor. Spidey in this movie, and its two sequels is not the comedian with the heroic side readers of the comics are familiar with, and i think this is a potential problem. Maguire gives a sweet, innocent, driven performance as Peter Parker which clashes with his earnest portrayal as Spider-Man, unfortunately this means the character at times can come across as bland and boring. Willem Dafoe is a great choice to play Green Goblin and he does so with relish, unfortunately they completely messed up The Goblins costume, which in the battle scened with Spider-Man looks like two Action Figures in conflict. It would have been much more interesting to utilise Dafoes already Goblin like features and to have gone down a more Jekyll and Hyde road. Its the revisionist approach to the chronology of the characters that weighs the movie down. Kirsten Dunst is excellent as the girl next door Mary Jane, but it would have been better had they started with a Gwen Stacey as Spidey's first love interest, purely because the origins compared to the comics are somewhat jumbled. Danny Elfmans theme is completely uninspired, it recycles elements of his own Batman/The Flash/Darkman themes and is over lush and melodramatic, failing musically to capture the danger and excitement of Peter Parker/Spider-Mans world. For an origin story, Sam Raimi really sets up the character and story arc well. But its tantalising to think just how amazing this movie could have been, so its with excitement i look forward to 2012's Andrew Garfield starring/Marc Webb directed Spider-Man reboot, which promises to capture a real flavour of the best Spider-Man stories. Spider-Man (2002) however is a lot of fun and for an origin movie and one of the most important movies for Marvel Studios, it does its job nicely."

","I admit it I usually go for movies that are romantic or musical flicks like Grease or HSM but I actually liked Spiderman since I was a child as there was no Hannah Montana,Sabrina the Teenage witch which came out in 1996.<br/><br/>The film version of Spiderman is about a young nerdy guy named Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire who is now replaced by Andrew Garfield in the rebooted version)who isn't the popular guy in school as guys give him a tough time as he is in love with a girl who is his next door neighbor Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst)who is quite popular in school.<br/><br/>One day he goes to some school trip all about spiders and as he takes a photo of Mary Jane he gets bit by a spider and he becomes Spiderman a superhero who fights the bad guys in New York City as his uncle got killed by a robber(who is actually Flint Marco which you can see in the 3rd francise which is rubbish BTW that killed Ben aka Peter's uncle).<br/><br/>Meanwhile Peter's best friend's father turns into Green Goblin by some syrup stuff and he is the villain in this movie.<br/><br/>What I like about Spiderman is that it edgy,creative and although its a guys flick but girls who like a man that can kick butt might fancy him . The cast is good yet its too bad that they didn't give the role to Mary Jane Watson to Amy Adams or whoever as Kirsten Dunst was a bit of a bitch in this film she's always moaning and whining like a baby and she just annoys me,Tobey Maguire was OK as Peter but having said that he was great,the music is great as for everything else.<br/><br/>I'll give it a 7/10"
"Floated2","8","0","1","19 September 2010"," Great film adaptation of Spiderman
","Spiderman is a very common superhero comic book adaptation turn into movie. I remember precisely when this movie first came out, I was somewhat skeptical about seeing it but I finally gave in and was surprised of how good it was and how faithful it was to the comic book. The story itself is basically how Spider-man came to be. The story starts basically on a field trip Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire) gets bit by a radioactive spider and gains powers from the bite. He not only has to struggle with making ends meet he has to struggle with a destructive lunatic called Green Goblin(Willem Dafoe)and also revealing his true feelings about his long-time friend, Mary Jane(Kirsten Dunst).<br/><br/>This movie is so true to the comic book, its almost eerie. Tobey Maguire is great as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Willem Dafoe is excellent as The Green Goblin, J.K. Simmons is great as Jonah Jameson and even Aunt May and Uncle Ben are portrayed and acted accurately. The action sequences are pretty good and even though they use CGI its not an eyesore here as it is in other movies that use it heavily. My only gripe is I could do without the weak one-liners that appear once and awhile in the movie. All in all fans of the comic book as well as the cartoon series wont be disappointed. I liked how it seemed and how it connected to those.
===
As a rewatch 04/01/19' opinions remain relatively same about Spider-Man. Having not watched this film for nearly 8 years, much memory had been forgotten about this film. As it was nice to rewatch this film after watching both TASM (2012) and Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) for sake of comparisons and differences. This Spider-Man is relatively a simply origin story as it does stay true o the comics. The film's pace is at ease and has an enjoyable feel, as well as a turn of emotions.<br/><br/>The film isn't too depressing, but is filled with enough joy and fun moments that it makes the end worthwhile. In comparison to TASM, Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker is easier to root for as he is far more likable in a sense where we can see his struggles more clearer. We also see where the chemistry between him and Kirsten Dunst begins, as it folds naturally. The villain of the Green Goblin is a worthy character for a starter villain. The action is well done, there are some decent comic reliefs scenes and the ending does leave us wanting more."

","Spiderman the movie is an action packed (focus on plot) hero versus villain (theme) story with a touch of romance. Average boy, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) finds himself with spider-like qualities after being bitten by a genetically altered spider on a field trip to Columbia University. His admiration for his neighbor, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) also known as MJ, has inspired him to use these new found abilities to impress her and others with acts of heroism. <br/><br/>This story brings an emotional closeness of family. Peter Parker and Harry Osborn (James Franco) are the best of friends; Peter has lost parents and lives with his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris). Harry Lives only with his father, Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe). Don't forget about MJ, she lives with her father next door to Peter's and his family. They have all lost loved ones and are doing the best they can to get by. <br/><br/>The conflict of Spiderman and the Green Goblin is very intense; this brings technology in filming to its finest. The lighting used was fabulous, the low-key lighting used when someone was in danger or high-key lighting used when Spiderman had saved the day. The angles used to catch Spiderman and the Goblin was fantastic, as they fly through the air in many different directions. Spiderman casting his webs, swinging from place to place and the Green Goblin riding the glider brings a challenge to produce the film but great entertainment for the viewer. What made this movie stand out from others, even Avatar was great visually, but the sound effects used in Spiderman were exceptional. Sounds to intensify or calm a scene, such as a scene full of conflict had great audio to intensify the scene, sounds of calmness when the conflict is resolved, and sounds of sorrow in times sadness. This made Spiderman, the movie, so impressive. <br/><br/>This,hero versus villain, film is absolutely one of the best films of all times, and provides a variety of entertainment for everyone; action, fantasy, and romance. Great characters, great actors helped this movie be a fabulous film to view over and over again. The sequels Spiderman II and Spiderman III are available now, and are anticipated to be just as great or even better. More villain, more romancewho could turn that down? Enjoy the movie."

","Seeing this movie 8 years after it was made, I kind of expected rough CGI. I thought it was surprisingly good! (Even the Green Goblin wasn't too cheesy!)<br/><br/>It's really easy to screw up a super-hero movie, as displayed by countless Super Man movies. This is not a bad super-hero movie. Aside from Iron Man, this is probably my favorite!<br/><br/>Applause to Tobey Maguire for his performance in this. Looking at all the other choices to play Peter Parker/Spider-Man, including one of my favorites, Leo DiCaprio, I really can't think of a more suitable Spider-Man. There're a lot of physical scenes in this movie, (some are CGI, but as I mentioned the CGI is incredibly well done and there are parts where you are wondering if it's a Maguire or not) and he couldn't have done a better job. Not to mention he's just adorable in this and you can't take your eyes off him!<br/><br/>I've never read a comic book in my life and I liked this. However, I'm a super-hero movie fan, so I asked around and most everyone had high remarks. High action and high entertainment- highly recommended to anyone looking for an action movie! (Be warned- once you see this one you'll want to see the second and third ones, too!)"
"KrazzyDJ","8","0","1","21 August 2010"," Here comes the Spider-Man !!!
","Fresh and Energetic. If I were to describe this movie in two words, the aforementioned ones would be it. Right from the first scene itself, you feel as if you've been sucked into the world of high school student Peter Parker. And you realize that it's not as bright and nice as it should've been.<br/><br/>The movie serves as an origin story to Spider-Man. It shows the transition of Peter Parker from a nerdy, butt-of-all-jokes high school student, to a slightly more confident and arrogant personality to, eventually, a responsible superhero in the form of Spider-Man. No point in discussing the plot here as its fairly predictable and spilling the beans here itself would make it more so. Sam Raimi's direction is excellent and the movie is a thrill ride from start to end. The performances are utterly convincing. Hats off to Tobey Maguire, after viewing this movie, I'd be hard-pressed to recommend any alternative for the role of Peter-Parker / Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst is also convincing as Mary Jane Watson - the next door neighbor and childhood crush of Parker. So is Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborne - the businessman who later on, after experimenting with a performance enhancing drug in a laboratory, turns into his alter ego, the Green Goblin. And so are the others.<br/><br/>The film is great technically as well with its brilliant cinematography which has the camera swooping up and down buildings and New York streets at a breathtaking speed. The art design is also great and has been used appropriately to handle and provide us with some memorable sequences (special mention goes to the Unity Fair sequence at Times Square). The visual effects, while good, are something which I found below par at times (again note some of the shots of the Goblin at the Unity Fair sequence; it's clearly evident that there's some mixing and matching being done here). Maybe this was because of the color schemes of the lead characters because of which they had to be shot separately which may have been responsible for this. Danny Elfman's music is also very good; the best piece being the opening theme.<br/><br/>What is so endearing about the movie that it has a heart and soul of its own. It becomes clearly evident while watching the movie that the makers of the movie are extremely passionate about Spider-Man. And that passion is visible in every frame of the movie - be it the action sequences, the characterizations or otherwise. It has become difficult for me to imagine another team behind the future installments of this movie. Before viewing this movie, I only knew about Spider-Man from some of the cartoon shows that used to appear on Television about him. Now, after seeing this movie, not only has my interest in Spider-Man sky-rocketed, but I consider him to be the most intelligent and the best superhero amongst the lot of fictional superheroes. Fantastic stuff."

","When this movie came out I was 7,my family went to see it but I was at a birthday party at the time. They liked it and I was a Spidey fan so we rented it afterwards. At first,I thought it had too much Green Goblin in it and not enough Spiderman but then I watched it when I was older and I rejected that thought. This movie is very good! Lots of good fight scenes, good acting and humour r. I thought the upside down kiss with Mary Jane was an excellent idea. But,I do think that there is too many frightening scenes for kids. For example: when there is that flash ,Green Goblin breaks into Aunt May's house,Green Goblin breaks into Daily Bugle.What I thought was better about 2 and 3 is that they had more humour,more action and more romance. Also the sequels don't have as many frightening scenes as this one. As a movie it's great but I like 2 and 3 better. I give it and 8/10."
"wright89","8","0","1","1 August 2010"," Spider-man
","There is a certain formula used when making a superhero film. Spider-man is no exception. Based off of the Marvel Comics this movie brings the comic strip hero to life. Peter Parker, played by Tobey Maguire, is your ordinary, unpopular, socially awkward, character who is infatuated with a girl who seems to be out of his league, Mary Jane, played by Kristen Dunst. Has lived next door to Peter for most of his life, and he has been infatuated with her for the entire time, however due to his current social status he's never been comfortable making his move. Also in following the usual formula of the superhero films, this everyday ordinary guy, gets extraordinary powers. The theme of this film like many other superhero films is good verses evil. This film is set in a major city setting for more dramatic impact. Once Peter Parker is transitioned into his superhuman powers, Spider-man is constantly battling with himself and evil. He must fight to protect the ones he loves. Spider-man he battles himself against things he cannot change. He must deal with not being able to reveal his true identity to the ones he cares about.<br/><br/>The film has much action, however some of the digital effects and computer graphics appear unrealistic. This is not the case with all scenes, but is worth mentioning. Some of the graphics used were before their time and could have been done differently and better. The general idea of what was trying to be conveyed during the specific scenes was successful, and those who do put much thought into graphics will have no problem with this portion of the film.<br/><br/>Through struggles, battles, trials, and triumphs, does the hero always prevail? Sometimes, but it is not without conflicts and sacrifice. As seen in this film, it becomes apparent to the hero that the ones he loves will always be the ones who pay, and ""with great power comes great responsibility"". Spider-man feels he has a responsibility to protect those he loves and keep good people from harms way. These tasks may become challenging as he is only one man with one extraordinary gift. <br/><br/>For those who enjoy an action movie, that is somewhat predictable but always entertaining, where good takes on evil and challenges are never out of sight. This film is these things and more. Spider-man contains, action ,drama, suspense, romance, tragedy. Although it does follow the formula of a typical superhero movie, the characters of this film give it a life of it's own as Maguire brings Spider-man to life."

","I was so surprised seeing this film. Sam Raimi did a wonderful job of remaking this classic to the most popular superhero genre today. Toby Mcguire is fantastic as the nerdy book worm who by happenstance gets bitten by a radioactive experimental spider, which results in Peter Parkers (Mcguire) new found powers. His new world changes as he begins his adventures on stopping the bad guys from evil doings in the big city. People either can take him as a good guy, or the bad guy but his results are still the same. His motivation is because of his uncle's death from a coincidental mugger who happens to be let go by parker after a wrestling bout. As he was trying to cash in, the robber passes him and he lets him go, resulting in his uncle's demise. This story is intricate, well thought out, and the graphics are excellent. It is a great story and wonderful thrill ride who still loves to read the grand comics by Stan Lee. And the sequel is just as much the roller coaster ride as this film."
"jake-law123","8","0","1","25 June 2010"," Such a fun film
","I love these films! Even though they're not the most honoring to the comics, they're still fun, colorful, and unique to watch. Even if you don't read the comics, the film gives you enough to recognize the main parts of the comics, such as the characters, the settings, and of course, the villain.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire plays a miraculous Peter Parker and Spider-man. He's such a nerd, which makes you feel all the more happy for him when he's kicking the ass of every crook on the street. The build up for gaining his powers, the death of Uncle Ben, and the birth of Spider-man is done incredibly well. The villain is the Green Goblin, played by Willem Dafoe, who is also built up real well.<br/><br/>The relationship is actually with Mary Jane Watson instead of Gwen Stacy, like the comics have it. I'm not going to lie, i'm not the biggest fan of Mary Jane, all she seems to do is get in trouble and have to be saved, not really Kirsten Dunst's fault, that's just what Sam Raimi wanted. She herself doesn't do a bad job, but she sure does scream a lot. You still care a lot about her, since Peter loves her so much.<br/><br/>The film is very colorful and adventurous, the costume is very traditional, but looks so nice. The cinematography is smooth, and swinging around with Spider-man is so fun because you just feel like it's you swinging from building to building. The music by Danny Elfman is, what I consider to be a classic music score. The effects are standard early 21st century CGI, which isn't bad, but some scenes are painfully obvious that they're CGI. Either way I have much respect for this film. It's a film before it's a comic book, therefore it decides it doesn't need to follow the comics so closely to be successful. If you're a hardcore fan of the comics, then this might not be your cup of tea, but if you're looking for a solid comic book action film, then look no further, because this is one of the best comic book films of all time."

","Normally I can't stand movies derived from comics, for example the duds that were the Hulk & Daredevil, but this one surprised me.<br/><br/>An excellent take on the comic book character created by Stan Lee. Next to the X-Men movies that came out about the same time, and Superman with Christopher Reeve, it is definitely one of the better Comic to Movie films put out.<br/><br/>The cast is well chosen. McGuire is Spiderman/Peter Parker to me. I don't think they could have chosen better. Kirsten Dunst makes a decent Mary Jane Watson, wasn't ever fond of her to begin with, but it's pulled off well. Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin is sheer genius.<br/><br/>The story is well written and keeps you along for the entire ride, coupled with action that's explosive and thrilling.

"hnt_dnl","8","0","1","11 February 2010"," Raimi's best SPIDERMAN was this one!
","In reality, despite what WAY TOO MANY people say, Sam Raimi's original SPIDERMAN (2002) film is the best that he did. SPIDERMAN 2 just plain sucked! It did...It really did! SPIDERMAN 3 was not as bad as people say and had a much more ""entertainment"" factor going for it than 2 ever did. But this first SPIDERMAN, flaws and all, is the best of the lot b/c Raimi kept it, in a word...simple! It flowed much more easily and didn't have stalls in action or plot like both of its sequels did. In SPIDERMAN, the action actually comes from the plot rather than defines it.<br/><br/>SPIDERMAN tells the tale of Peter Parker (solid performance by Tobey Maguire), a meek, smart New York City high-schooler who is about to graduate with his best friends Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and Harry Osborn (James Franco); Maguire, Dunst and Franco are fresh young faces and nice choices for these roles. Mary Jane aka MJ is the object of Peter's affection and Harry is Peter's secret ally for MJ's love. Also, Harry is jealous of Peter because his wealthy father Norman (the great Willem Dafoe) respects Peter more than him. Peter has science acumen (physics his major when he graduates) and had to work hard to support himself, whereas Harry had everything handed to him on a silver platter, so there is underlying tension between the two boys. Peter lives with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben (distinguished film veterans Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson).<br/><br/>Norman is the head of Oscorp, whose primary division is R&D. He is tasked by the military to build a supersuit for human enhancement, but when better bid comes along a rival corporation to develop the technology, Norman (in disguise wearing the outfit he was developing for the military) attacks their lab and kills the general in charge Slocum (Ron Perlman). Now Oscorp has regained control, but later, the other corporation after recouping its losses is big enough to buy out Oscorp and when Norman's board agrees with it, he goes insane and vows revenge and wreaks havoc on NYC as The Green Goblin.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Peter has been bitten by a radioactive spider on a field trip and sees that he has developed amazing abilities (web-shooting, buidling-scaling, super strength). At first, he uses it for silly things like impressing MJ and his fellow high-schoolers and also he goes out one night to an amateur wrestling match to try to win money to buy a car to impress MJ further. Dressed in a spider costume, Peter wins, but when the event organizer won't pay him, Peter rebels by refusing to stop a thief who stole all the money from the office safe. Ironically, Peter finds out later that night that this thief killed his Uncle Ben during the police chase, so Peter goes after him, finds him, and accidentally kills him. In the ensuing months, Peter's guilt and agony turn to productivity as he vows to fight crime under the mantra ""Spiderman"". During this time, the 3 friends have graduated high school and Peter enrolls at NYU majoring in physics, MJ pursues a career on Broadway, and Harry goes to work for his father and is set to become his heir.<br/><br/>Suffice to say, Spiderman and the Green Goblin square off and in the end, Spidey prevails, but not before Harry finds out that his dad was the villainous Goblin. Harry vows to avenge his father's death, aka SEQUELS! The biggest issue I have with these SPIDERMAN films is Peter's borderline obsession with MJ, who I find to be a very ""loose woman"". She bounces from boyfriend to boyfriend way to easily! Peter should take that into account in his assessment of whether or not she is the right woman for him to spend the rest of his life with! <br/><br/>What makes SPIDERMAN a solid comic book tale is that Raimi does a find job balancing the stories of it's main characters lives and has just enough action at the right moments, but it never quite devolves into the sappiness or stops dead in it's tracks, like both of it's sequels did, esp. SPIDEY 2! The acting is good, especially by Dafoe, and the ending scenes are especially powerful with a really memorable, emotional ending. <br/><br/>A solid entry to the comic book movie fold!"
"mlp2305","5","0","1","10 January 2010"," Messy, and only about the dollar.
","I'm a fan of the Spider-man comics printed from 1960 through 1980ties. The golden Era of Marvel and Comics in general. These years the Spider-man stories were PURE ART..the stories, the drawings, everything was to say the least..GENIUS.<br/><br/>Everything else coming from Marvel after this, being it Comics, Movies or whatever, is pure GARBAGE. Violent, gloomy..for some reason they think that the more people who dies in extreme violent ways, the better it is. WRONG. Originally. When someone died, it was a serious matter. Not today, about 20 people get killed and the bystanders still clap and smiles when Spidey saves Mary Jane. What about the massacre just happened !?<br/><br/>This has almost nothing to do with the original spider-man.. My main beef is with the script, not the actors or the effects. But to briefly go there, Tobey don't remind me of PP and Kirsten Dunst don't remind me of MJ.<br/><br/>The people behind the original Peter Parker and Spider-Man did a lot of thinking when they created the characters. What they created WORKS. Why change it ? Why did they change his net shooters to organic ? The thought of a human throwing organic web makes me wanna throw up, same with the hair or whatever it is that enables him to climb.<br/><br/>Peter Parker arguing with Uncle Ben, telling him not to ""act like his dad"". This is very out of character for Peter Parker. Peter Parker refusing to stop the mugger that later kills his uncle. In the original it's because he just wants to mind his own business. In the movie, it's sort of to get back at the wrestling manager who cheated him. Again, this is very out of character, Peter Parker does not contain this kind of malice.<br/><br/>When Peter Parker find the mugger, he doesn't do anything to save him when he falls out the window. He don't even try. He is facing him unmasked, making it necessary to kill him of course. Again, why change the original story ? Here Spider-Man simply catches the mugger and leave him to the police. Spider-Man is a Super Hero, not a Killer ! <br/><br/>But of course, I forgot, if someone is not killed every ten minute, the movie becomes boring ! or so they think.<br/><br/>Mary Jane being in love with Spider-Man. She is starting to have a thing going with Peter Parker and suddenly she starts making out with Spider-Man, someone she just met, tongue and all..just wrong on so many levels.<br/><br/>As so many things in this movie, it is just there, just for being there, for no reason as it never really lead to anything, or has any consequence. Mary Jane is pretty off character, as this serious, dull girl. A bit nerdy actually. Totally different from in the comics. In the comics there's no reference to her having an abusive dad, there she is living with her mother and have no domestic problems at all.<br/><br/>The thing about her father is never used for anything later in the movie, so why was it even mentioned ? Strangely, even though she looks like this nerdy, quiet girl, she still hangs with the cool bunch in the school. Can't they just make up their mind and simply put her in a category ! Just another annoying little thing.<br/><br/>Aunt May and Uncle Ben are kind of underdeveloped. You never get any sense of their personalities. Small passages like Uncle Ben just having lost his job keeps you alert to what next what will happen to him now, but of course, this is never mentioned again and was just there because they didn't know what else to put there.<br/><br/>Peter Parker fighting Flash Thompson in the can tine using his super powers and throwing webs all over. None wonders about why the weakling Peter Parker suddenly can beat the strongest guy on campus...or why he is suddenly moving in bullet time ! Stupid really. I had still a vague hope for the movie before this, but not after. This is by the way the only reference to Flash Thompson, a huge character in the Spider-Man universe.<br/><br/>From a movie standpoint, also if you forget that this is Spider-Man, it is kind of boring. Doesn't change pace, is never really thrilling, kind of rushes you through the movie which is over before you know it. No real character development. Suddenly we're at the final fight which Peter Parker just wins with no real problems.<br/><br/>This movie proves that a good franchise can always sell when converted to a movie, as long as is it well advertised. They make you buy the ticket and after there's nothing you can do."

Bryan Singer's ""X-MEN"" was the movie that introduced the superhero film to the 21st century. It raised the bar so high, the audiences were astounded and it seemed like no other movie, superhero or otherwise, could surpass it. That bar has definitely been raised to new levels many times since then with films such as the spectacular ""THE DARK KNIGHT"" and, to a lesser extent, ""IRON MAN"". However, ""SPIDER-MAN"" is nothing to sneeze at either. High school nerd Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) lives with his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson). His next door neighbor happens to be the beautiful Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), whom Peter has loved since ""before he even liked girls"". Peter is also best friends with Harry Osborn (James Franco), whose dad is Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe). Norman is overly ambitious with his company, Oscorp (which supplies weapons and special equipment to the military), and wants to give Harry everything that he never had in his younger days. One life-changing day, Peter's class goes on a field trip to Columbia University's Science Department. During the tour, Peter is bitten on the hand by a genetically enhanced ""super-spider"" that escaped from an exhibit. That night, Norman is testing one of his company's performance enhancers on himself. The experiment goes horribly wrong, and Norman becomes the incredibly strong yet viciously insane Green Goblin. Meanwhile, Peter has undergone a night of dizziness and a stomach ache due to the spider bite. In the morning, he finds that he also has gained heightened strength, agility, can spin webs from his wrists, climb walls, and a certain ""spider-sense"" to warn him of danger. Mary Jane and Peter become much closer friends, despite the fact that she is now dating Harry. She also thinks she loves Spider-Man after he saves her life twice. Goblin is suspicious of Spider-Man's true identity. He also feels threatened by Parker, but has not yet made the connection between the two. They finally square off in a fantastic showdown that is also one of the best scenes in the entire movie. But, at the end of the day, ""SPIDER-MAN"" still has its faults. For example, what is Goblin's plan? We understand his revenge against the Quest Aerospace officials and the Oscorp board members, but what else is there? He has a personal vendetta against Spider-Man, but why? Just to write it off as him being insane is not sufficient. Up next is the cinematography during the scenes of Spider-Man swinging through the city. They play and look like a video game, with the camera seeming to be too distant and too close at the same time. The feeling of all the tension, fear, and confusion of his new powers is actually not felt at all; he acts more like a kid in a candy shop. Instead of keeping the camera a reasonable distance from him so we can see how he uses his surroundings to display his amazing powers, the camera is tight on him, right over his shoulder most of the time. Strangely, the cinematography for the action scenes is quite good. The only scene of this kind that works in this film is the ending, which was filmed with the Spyder-Cam. It was a very effective technique that was used for all the swinging and fighting scenes in ""SPIDER-MAN 2"", and I would assume it was used in #3 as well, but I haven't seen that one yet. As a matter of fact, everything in #2 is improved over #1. The acting, action pieces, dialogue, and especially the villain. Nevertheless, everything in this film still comes together reasonably well, with only a few drawbacks.<br/><br/>Also Recommended: ""SUPERMAN"" (1978), ""X-MEN"" (2000), ""X2"" (2003), ""SPIDER-MAN 2"" (2004), ""BATMAN BEGINS"" (2005) <br/><br/>THIS REVIEW IS DEDICATED TO ANYONE, LIVING OR DEAD, INVOLVED WITH THE MAKING OF ""SPIDER-MAN""."
"Ziya90","5","0","1","3 January 2010"," Great entertainment, but a very scratchy adaptation
","I watched the movie many times, it is one of the most enjoyable movies, but in comparison with the comic book or the animation series (to me one of the bests of all time), it was very disappointing, because no expectation is met here. Raimi (and also Tobey Maguire himself) has made us believe that Tobey Maguire is Peter Parker/Spider-Man, despite the original character is much more stalwart and he is not that loser as Peter Parker in this adaptation. What kind of person Peter Parker is? The movie becomes scratchy while asking this question, in other words, the introduction of one of the best Super heroes is unsatisfying. In addition, may be the most important part of the movie, the part which the spider bites Parker and the metamorphosis process were great fun, but something is missing. Can it be a careful direction and a brilliant script? The bite scene take place too early, it is also an ordinary scene from the movie. Spider-Man flies throughout the city, those images are dazzling, then he rests the Gargoyles statue, sometimes he talks with it which is humor. In the movie all these details and more are ignored. The tone and the atmosphere of the movie are very different, so I felt out of things. By the way, the fight in the school, the zooms before that look amateurish. As I know, some people criticize the film so that it is like a teenager movie, in my opinion, it is not, but it has different problems. In some scenes, very bad CGI is an eyesore. I just did not like the wrestling scenes, it is because of Raimi again, the Wolverine fight in X-Men, for example was much more better, excellent. J. Jonah Jameson character is cartoonish, especially in the second movie, he was superficial, but some people think that he is as good and funny as the original character. The action scene with balloons (recalls Batman) is the best action scene of the movie and great fun, too and there is a weird image that Parker imitates Superman! Lastly, the humor conception, many enemies versus Spider-Man fantasy, character development, story editing, lack of detail etc. are problematic. Spider-Man often puts his camera somewhere in the crime scene in order to take money from J. Jonah Jameson. Sometimes, the camera crumbles, but sometimes he succeeds in delivering the photos. Or Spider-Man is a chatterbox, he often talks with himself while flying or fighting his enemies. Sometimes, he makes jokes about the situation he is in etc. None of them is here! Spider-Man is a feel yourself good movie and one of the most entertaining movies, but fails as a Spider Man movie."

","Its about a young man with a great physique in spandex climb walls, and fight another gentleman riding a hovering skateboard. Not only is the guy called ""Spiderman""the hero, the villain is called the ""Green Goblin"". Watch the young Peter Parker grow into the man ... nay the Spiderman that women fall first into distress for then into love with, and the one the men wish to become. As Spiderman takes form during this movie and fight the daily bugle's never ending condescending comments on him he finds a way to still live a normal life and chase after his true love MJ. This one is an instant marvel classic. This movie will blow your mind strictly on the fact that women alone are deathly afraid of spiders, but it goes to show if the spider is strong cute and can save your life the spider can steal your girl away as easy as saying ""Im your neighborhood friendly Spiderman."""

","Spider-Man is at last brought to the big screen after several years of banishment. And I have got to say, that this is one of the best super-hero films I have ever seen. Everything that made the comic-books famous is in this film, and the character development is just excellent. It's too bad Ang Lee's Hulk wasn't like this.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is pretty awesome, the stunts and effects done on the character make him look as if he is real, and was not made on a computer. The Green Goblin is also pretty cool, but his costume was a little off. I thought he should had has his trademark ghoul like costume instead of some strange green suit of armor.<br/><br/>The movie also has great action scenes, great acting, and in the end, this film is incredible as the comic books are. Spider-Man 2 and 3 are also awesome, but it will always be the first that gives us that Spider-Man pep we need."

","A friend once said to me that characters from a book, comic or computer game cannot be made into a successful film.<br/><br/>Based on the evidence of this film he is wrong.<br/><br/>Spiderman has been faithfully adapted from the old worn down but classic comic books of the fifties and onto the big screen. And it is fantastic.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi a director before this who I was not familiar with had made this a winner.<br/><br/>The concept of the character and the surrounding story is spot on. Toby Maguire plays Peter Parker/Spiderman with real understanding. He conveys the right tone a being smart but awkward around the love of his life Mary Jane Watson but and has the wit and the looks to show heart.<br/><br/>Support from James Franco and Kirsten Dunst as Harry and Mary Jane keeps the central storyline strong.<br/><br/>Who ultimately steals the show is Willem Dafoe who plays the villain. The Green Goblin.<br/><br/>He dominates the screen with his menacing fashion and a hilariously cackling laughter making the Goblin a fearsome adversary.<br/><br/>And the whole thing is done with splat stick humour on the side, which helps the characters develop.<br/><br/>The special effects such as the Spidey's suit and the Green Goblin is excellent against the backdrop of set.<br/><br/>A couple of minor criticisms about the film, which stopped me giving it a ten was that some of the special effects were a bit cliché in places noticeably when Spiderman is flying and character development like with JK Simmons could have gone further.<br/><br/>But pushing that aside. This is a highly entertaining superhero blockbuster that captures the tone and essence of the comics and what promises to be a new and exciting era for Spiderman!"

","This movie was an excellent movie that did much more than I thought it could! <br/><br/>It was the very first superhero movie that I ever saw and it was such a great movie it got me hooked to Marvel! The idea and the story are both great but also the special effects were good for 2002. This is a movie that I still love watching and watch over and over again. If you are looking for a good superhero movie I would recommend this over many things, such as X-men or even Wolverine. The way they also stuck to the comic storyline was amazing unlike many movies that forget the comic books story. This movie was also was the very best of the three in the series so far. Spiderman 2 was almost as good as this movie but still not the same. Spiderman 3 is the worst of the series and I personally do not like it. <br/><br/>But I would still recommend all three of these great movies to people wanting to watch some good films!"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","7","0","1","7 August 2009"," Well-done doesn't equal good
","I'm not saying I'm easy to please. And I will admit that this is well-produced. I won't go over everything in this that's potentially bothersome. They do get a lot in there, including the main point of the character. J. Jonah Jameson is perfect. May and Ben are pretty good. Maguire isn't satisfactory in my opinion, as either part of the role, though he is not as bad as he could be. Mary Jane is OK. The Osborns are fairly accurate. Dafoe's performance does bring up something important about this film, however; there's a lot of ham and camp in this. Perhaps not enough to turn a meat-eater vegan, or make you call your parents and beg to come pick you up, but it still gets to be *painful* at times. Also, the comedy... is it meant to be funny? It almost invariably isn't. The effects are generally nice-looking, although that whole thing about the actual costume of Spidey looking just like the CGI version... yes, and that's because it always looks fake, so it appears, in spite of that not being the case, as if every time we see the hero, he's animated. Plot is fine, and as an origin story, this certainly gets the job done. Pacing is reasonable. The action is cool enough, and the cinematography and editing are inventive and creative. Overall, this ought to please most of the audience, casual viewer and fan alike. There is a little potentially disturbing content. The DVD has TV spots, trailers, music videos, a comic/feature comparison, four special tracks for the movie, one with webisodes, a pop-up factoid one and two commentary tracks, one with Raimi and producers, and the other with VFX people, and finally the option to record one of your own. I recommend this to those it appeals to. 7/10"
"Sirus_the_Virus","7","0","1","4 August 2009"," The weakest of the films.
","The first Spider-man is probably my least favorite. I don't like it as much because it's kind of boring, and the film mostly focuses on Spider-man. In most comic book films, I want to see more of the villains. We do see plenty of the villain, the Green Goblin, but more of Spider-man. With Spider-man 2, we get both. I liked that. The plot: This film shows how Peter Parker was bitten by a radioactive spider and turned into Spider-man. His best friend's father turns into The Green Goblin, who is living a double life. Peter is in love with a crush of his named Mary Jane, but his best friend is dating her. The first Spider-man film is entertaining. The last ten minutes where Spider-man is getting beaten by the Green Goblin is cool. It sounds wrong I know. To think this is from Director Sam Rami, who did the Evil Dead Trilogy. Occasionally in the Spider-man films, Rami tries to make us jump. Because it's Sam Rami. All of the Spider-man films made me jump, I hate to say it. The first Spider-man film is entertaining, but not the best of the trilogy. I can't wait until Spider-man 4 in 2011. Spider-man is a fun thrill ride that will spin your head around."
"kosmasp","8","0","1","21 July 2009"," Best one yet
","I know that many regard Spider Man 2 as the best Spider Man movie to date (part 4 and 5 are on it's way, but not here yet). For me personally, Spider man does the job. It's a fun (even quite a few times dark) intro into the world of Spider Man. Tobey Maguire seems so perfect in his role, it would be a shame, if someone would replace him for future installments (even though in part 3, he seemed like a mess, I do think it was the script that let him down on that one).<br/><br/>Of course we are talking Spider Man here and not Batman, so the Origin story is lighter and more teen/kids friendly. But having Sam Raimi at the helm of the movie, it still crosses some small boundaries. The story, the character arc, the beginning, the villain ... everything fits together. It's simple, it's fun ... and it even has Bruce Campbell in it! ;o)"

","'Spider-Man' is a great example of a comic book based movie.It has plenty of style,action,heart and has a great message that everyone can swing to: With great power comes great responsibility.For example,if you wake up one day and you find out that you have superhuman strength,use it for the good of mankind.Don't use it for evil.When something great lands in your laps,use it wisely.Don't take advantage of it.That's why Spider-Man is such a great superhero.Well,many superheros use their powers for good,but Spider-Man is still great.So everybody should sit down and enjoy this wonderful superhero movie that's a feast for the eyes and imagination.But don't just watch this movie.Watch the sequels.They're even better."

","Spider-man, Marvel's most popular superhero was finally made into a film in the early part of the 2000s after years of development hell. Many people were attached to the project, from the great and good like James Cameron, David Fincher and Tim Burton, the average Chris Columbus, to down right awful Yoram Globus. It was horror expert and Spider-man fan Sam Raimi who got the go ahead for the Spider-man project.<br/><br/>Spider-man tells the origins of our favourite web-slinger. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is the high school geek who is bullied had has a unrequited love for Mary-Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). After a school trip to Columbia University our hero is bitten by a genetic modified spider and as a result he ends up with spider powers. He uses his these newly required powers to try and raise power for a car to impress Mary-Jane. He ends up fighting in a wrestling tournament where the promoter screws him over. As a result Peter's beloved Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) is killed. After that tragic event Peter pleads to fight crime as Spider-man. A new super-villain also comes to being, the Green Goblin. He is a major industrialist Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), the father of Peter's best friend Harry (James Franco). Norman struggles with the guilt of his evil deeds, but is a man who is facing the lost of his company. After Spider-man gets involved he develops a hatred for the super-hero.<br/><br/>There are a lot of positives to this film. They is a decent storyline which is a much for any film. They is great action scene and Sam Raimi has a flair for the direction for this superhero film. But the winning feature is character development, from Peter's early reluctant and his longing for Mary-Jane, to Norman Osborn's guilt and duel personality. The supporting characters are also great, Mary-Jane, Harry, Uncle Ben, Aunt May and J. Jonah Jameson. The casting is fantansic. Raimi pick actors from indie backgrounds. Tobey Maguire is excellent as Peter, playing his geeky qualities and has a good dose of humour. He is an excellent actor. Willem Dafoe is also an excellent actor and makes a great villain playing the Green Goblin. Kristy Dunst and James Franco are good actors and grow into their roles in the later films. J.K. Simmons was perfect as J. Johan Jameson, adding humour to the film and Cliff Robinson and Rosemary Harris are great as Peter's aunt and uncle. David Koepp is a man who knows how to write blockbusters and excels himself here and Sam Raimi is a man who cares about the story and characters.<br/><br/>Sadly some of the CGI is a little ropey, but Spider-man is a great start to the series and Spider-man 2 is even better."

","Comic or marvel lovers will definitely favourite this one. A nice and simple adaptation to a legendary cartoon to a soon to be legendary movie. A delightful action film to watch with your family or friends. It's a fun action, adventure with some dilemmas and romance. A not so ""big familiar cast"" have to step up for this one and even though they are not formally the talk of the town, they did a very decent job in playing there roles. Partically Tobey Maguire, He gave that touch that the ""Spider man"" character needed.<br/><br/>Even though it made an outstanding achievement, it lacked on something quite big. But we can discuss that later, for now let's discuss the good: The plot was quite the one. A nerdy young adult, a pushover and a victim for the bully's. Get's bitten by a spider which combines the special feature in the spider ( like the ability to climb, jump further, speed, spider strength and obviously ability to make webs.) with the human features ( human strength. etc) So as you surely should already know Spider Man is obviously a hero with super hero powers. During the movie spider man comes across with a villain as you would expect, so yes loads of fighting and limited action. Yes very limited, no real gore, swearing or shooting. But the action is well panned out and executed well. Some effects were quite cool too. The designers did very well indeed, costumes were perfect. The script was also good, it was witty and clever especially a scene towards the end and the famous line ""With great power comes great responsibility."" <br/><br/>Now.lets discuss the one main thing it lacked. Without spoiling it for anyone that has not yet seen this movie. Peter Parker comes to use his powers a bit to quick. There should be a 10 to 20 minutes were Peter is still trying to test his powers and realising what he is capable off. It is some doubt in his head about his powers as he confused on what's going on. But his knowledge of the powers come a bit to quick. Nothing really major, but still something that could have made the rating go up 2 more! Overall I'm sure many of you have seen this film already but if you haven't. It's wonderful in many ways. It's cool, funny/witty, its got a decent amount of enjoyable action and some nice special effects. The best super hero movie of it's genre and great adaptation and a highly enjoyable flick."
"jerekra","9","0","1","4 April 2009"," Best Marvel Film I Have Seen So Far.
","Spiderman is the best Marvel Film that I have seen in my life. It does a good job showing how Peter Parker becomes Spiderman and lays a good foundation for the series.<br/><br/>Peter Parker is a smart student who is often picked on by other kids at school. However, after he gets bitten by a radioactive spider he becomes Spiderman his life changes. Soon Parker learns that with great power comes great responsibility.<br/><br/>I think this film has a great flow to it. Not even ten minutes in Parker gets bitten by the spider that turns him into spiderman. That is good because then the rest of the film consists of Parker learning how to use his powers and get in a lot of great action.<br/><br/>The action is great in this film. They really did a good job of using CGI in this film. At times you can tell that spiderman is not real and is computer animated, but for the most part everything looks good.<br/><br/>I think Tobey Mcguire does a pretty good job as Spiderman. In the comics Spiderman is really funny, full of a lot of great jokes. However for the most part SPiderman is not that witty in this film and I think that a lot has to do with Mcguire not being a really funny actor. Good actor, but not humorous really. I do think that Mcguire makes a better Peter Parker than he does Spiderman. Overall I would give him a seven out of ten as spiderman.<br/><br/>I think that the main villain in this film, the Green Goblin, was actually really good. I wondered who they would use as Spidermans first film villain and I think they made a good choice. Goblin gets to do a lot of fighting with Spiderman and also has a good back story, so he is a deep villain.<br/><br/>A few complaints. I did not like how they had Spiderman get the ability to shoot webs from his body. I think it is better how in the comics he made his own web shooters. Just my opinion though. The comics of Spiderman are better than the film but that is the case for most super hero films I think.<br/><br/>So this is the best Marvel Film that I have seen. Great action, good flow, and also a good villain. Highly recommended."

This was the first film I ever obsessively tracked on the internet up until the very moment of the film's release. When I finally saw the film on opening day, I was blown away and ended up seeing the film again three more times in theaters. The main question now is, is the film just as good now as it was back in 2002? The answer is yes.<br/><br/>Spider-man was always one of my favorite superheros growing up, and in that sense I am a little biased towards this film, but it actually is a terrific film. This is one of those few blockbuster films that I think was able to transcend its stereotypes and actually become simply put a good film. This film had all of the action and thrills in which you expect from big budget blockbusters, but it also had this genuine emotion and heart that made it resonate with me more so than many other similar films. As well, not only is this a very heartfelt film, but it is actually quite funny and the action is extremely exciting to watch, as well it gets quite dramatic near the end.<br/><br/>Overall Spider-man is a good film with a terrific story, awesome acting, and genuine heart.

"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","1","7 January 2009"," Look out, here comes the Spider-Man!
","""Spider-Man"" was one of the movies that really got the ball rolling for superheroes on film. Kicked around Hollywood for years, Spider-Man finally hit the big screen in the summer of 2002 and became a huge hit. It has spawned two sequels so far and has helped to pave the way for a bevy of comic book films (most of which pale in comparison).<br/><br/>The story begins with teenage social outcast Peter Parker, who, following a bite from a genetically enhanced spider, gains super powers and is presented with the question of what he is going to do with his newfound abilities. The story sticks close to the comic book origin and does a fine job of setting up the character's personal struggles. These struggles have always been integral to the character because they help to make Spider-Man more human and therefore more identifiable.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the producers assembled an enviable cast to populate this story. Tobey McGuire, Kirsten Dunst & James Franco, despite their relative youth, already had some fine performances to their credit and do not disappoint here. Then there's two-time Oscar nominee Willem Dafoe, who really sinks his teeth into his villainous dual role. The film also features Oscar winner Cliff Robertson as Peter's uncle Ben and Oscar nominee Rosemary Harris as his aunt May. J.K. Simmons is also memorable in his role as cigar-chomping newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson.<br/><br/>Director Sam Raimi does a good job of bringing the story to life, ably handling both the dramatic elements and the action set-pieces. The special effects are well handled, as is Danny Elfman's score.<br/><br/>I could nitpick and say that a few things are perhaps a little too comic book-ish but that seems inappropriate. Overall, the film's mix of action and drama is a cut above the usual superhero fare. In any case, I've seen the movie at least four or five times, including twice in theatres, so that should give an idea of the film's lasting appeal."
"davidcinnella","10","0","1","15 December 2008"," truly the Amazing Spider-man
","I saw this movie back in 2002 when I was still a kid at our local cinema. The one we have may not be the best in the world, considering it's also not even that big and has only one screen. But that didn't matter. I saw it for the first time with three cousins of mine that summer right after school ended, and since it was a movie about a superhero I thought that I would've liked it, maybe even a lot, but nothing more. And so I entered the movie theater to enjoy the movie of a superhero I honestly never even took much into consideration. When I came out all of my nerves and senses had been burned. I walked out into the open again and I was actually convinced that I could spin spiderwebs from my wrists and that I could've climbed walls! I was so excited from what I had seen that I talked about nothing for the whole day (and probably the next too). Every single aspect of this movie is almost perfect in every way. Maybe today it could be considered less important or good since it was from 2002 and the special effects are less good and more flaws are evident, but apart from all the action, the real success of the movie lies inside it's heart. The story about a young high school student --who lives with his uncle and aunt who aren't doing all that well economically but who love him very much (great sense of family here), high I.Q., with just one friend and in love with a beautiful girl-- who suddenly gets superpowers from the tiniest of creatures ,a spider ,that will make him the enemy of his best friend's dad and, from a terrible mistake that will haunt him forever and that can happen very easily in everyday life, learns the importance of the responsibility that comes with any kind of power, and the importance of growing up in a society that is cruel, unfair, very tough and unpredictable. There is also a whole mix of betrayal and love between the characters (each different from the other) that makes it also look like if it was a Drama. Another interesting thing, from a superhero point of view, is that Spider-man isn't even a hero that is completely invincible. All in all he's just a bit stronger and faster than normal, walks on walls, spins webs from his wrists and has higher reflexes... not that much really, he's not an invincible Superman with just one (green) flaw. He has thousands of weaknesses. And yet, in spite of all that, he always manages to save the day in a unique fashion and every time with some sort of sacrifice and with always something or someone dear to him at steak. He always manages to save the day, study, work and occasionally take out the trash with a lot of effort but in the way every normal person does, with no real advantage or without even getting that much in return. I think Spider-man is a very realistic character that can be identified with anyone of us in any part of our daily routines. He also has a continuous sense of struggle in life that is very true (pretty much like Batman, but more on a common level). Also, from a cinematographic point of view it is also stunning and innovative. There's always a wonderful play with characters and their psychology in their own reflection in the mirror; great direction; more and more scenes that have now become classic ones, like Peter Parker's transformation in one night or the forever classic upside-down kiss; (for the time) great special effects and action sequences; great acting; wonderful screenplay by David Koepp; superb Music by Danny Elfman who manages to act emotions through his score; and much much more. Spider-man is, in my opinion, one of the masterpieces of movie history, one that absolutely anyone can enjoy, be amazed, loose into, cry, laugh and love. It has been Marvel's most famous superhero and, so far and for me, the best movie of all time.<br/><br/>... your friendly neighborhood David Cinnella"

","When Batman spoke that answer to a scared thug in 1989 he dealt a blow for every Comic character, not just the Warner's backed DC characters, to the major studios in saying 'We belong here.'... Unfortunately for Marvel, they couldn't compete till now. Sure, 'Blade' came off huge, but very different than his comic origins though for the better. 'X-Men' was a surprise hit and great comic book film, again, if not following the comic lore page by page. 'Spider-Man' does so nearly panel for panel right from a grand splash page. Updated for the times, the story still holds true. ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility..."" and the film conveys Stan Lee's basic message with oomph.<br/><br/>In true Marvel fashion, not over the top or straying from the character, it hits home. A normal teenager dealing with extraordinary circumstances and walking the high wire ever so carefully along the way. Perhaps the most cinematic anti-stereotypical ending in film as Boy meets Girl, Boy chases Girl, Boy saves Girl, Boy rejects Girl!!? Yes, that one closing scene where Peter turns from not only Mary Jane but from a part of himself indeed epitomizes what Comic Heroes have done for nearly 70 years... sacrifice. And in one instant, it is made clear. Perhaps the perfect Comic to Film example... where 'Batman Begins' was 90% dead on, 'Spidey' reaches 99%. <br/><br/>With this film, its not Marvel vs. DC but another example, a shining example, of 'We belong here.'... 'Nuff Said."
"brando647","8","0","1","1 September 2008"," Raimi Sets the Standard for Future Superhero Movies
","In 2002, the world was treated to the second big budget treatment of a Marvel comic book in the form of Spider-Man. Bryan Singer had opened the doors for major comic book adaptations two years prior with his adaptation of the X-Men, and he proved such movies could make major earnings in the box office. Well, along came a spider and proved just how true that was when Spider-Man grossed $403.7 million in the United States alone. The film introduces audiences to the origins of the hero, when Peter Parker is bitten by a genetically-altered spider and is given extraordinary abilities (i.e. web-slinging, wall-crawling, his ""spider-sense""). After the death of his uncle at the hands of a car-jacker, Peter becomes determined to prevent crime and evil forces from ruining the lives of others and his first real test arrives in the form of the Green Goblin.<br/><br/>My favorite aspect of Sam Raimi's film is that it FELT like a true Spider-Man movie. While I did enjoy Singer's X-Men, it didn't have the same feel as the comics/cartoons. It was the X-Men, but it was Bryan Singer's X-Men. Watching Raimi's film, it feels as if it's ripped straight from the pages of the comics. It faithfully depicted all of it's characters with a couple exceptions; some liberties had to be taken to fit 40 years of comic book history into a 2 hour movie. Just as in the comics, Peter is troubled by having to juggle his life as a super-hero with his life as a normal person, and one of the lessons our hero learns over the course of the film is that he can't have both. Raimi also gives us some great character development on the part of the villain, Norman Osborn/the Green Goblin. He takes the time to build up the father/son relationship between Norman and his son, Peter's best friend Harry, which builds up for further stories in the future.<br/><br/>In addition to having a fantastic filmmaker at the helm, the movie benefits from near perfect casting. Tobey Maguire is more than capable of pulling off the meek, nerdy Peter Parker as well as his web/one-liner slinging alter ego. Kirsten Dunst, while not overwhelming in her performance, was a great Mary Jane Watson and James Franco was a solid Harry Osborn. As I said, the casting was pretty much perfect across the board, right down to Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson as Peter's aunt and uncle. The best (and I know of many who agree with me) was Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn. Seriously, I can't think of another actor who pull off such eccentric, insane roles like this man. He WAS the Green Goblin and I couldn't see any other actor having stepped into that role.<br/><br/>The movie contains plenty of action with seamless CGI inter-mixed into real-time stunts, and the story also contains a strong plot with more than enough heart to make this more than just an action flick. Aside from a few slow moments, there really isn't much to complain about with Sam Raimi's Spider-Man and I think he was the first to set the standards for what the comic fans should expect from big screen adaptations of their favorite heroes."

"retroguy02","8","0","1","27 August 2008"," ""Spider-Man"" makes its first translation to the big screen with both style and substance...
","As a fan of the 1990s Spider-Man animated series, I was naturally eagerly awaiting the release of Spider-Man. Being directed by Sam Raimi (known for horror films) at a $100-million budget, and the lead characters being played by relatively unknowns, one may be skeptical, but Spider-Man proves again and again that one should not judge movies from the outside.<br/><br/>Unlike some other superheroes, Spider-Man's origins are fairly rigid, and the movie takes an appropriately straightforward approach to it. The one thing that irked many fan-boys, Spidey producing webbing from his wrists rather than inventing it, wasn't a problem with me because it didn't change the character of Spidey at all, and besides, it does make more sense; Raimi himself put it best in an interview with something along the lines of ""how can a high school student invent something in his spare time that scientists or government agencies haven't been able to?"". The movie's main villain, the Green Goblin, is also introduced slightly differently than he was in the comics, but it's for the better, makes more sense, and isn't very radical.<br/><br/>The movie's plot smartly plays it safe by limiting the scope to only one villain, one love interest, one tragedy (Uncle Ben's death), and a narrowed supporting cast. This allows for some deep character development and keeps the story cruising smoothly without any convolutions. Although superhero movies are rather prone to screwing up the climax, Spider-Man builds up very well all the way towards an appropriate and deserving climax. The action elements are also well-choreographed and surprisingly visceral for a superhero film of this scope; an overwhelming majority of the action sequences feature kung fu style, one-on-one combat action between the Green Goblin and Spider-Man. The scenes of Spidey web-swinging through New York are also beautifully shot in a way that lends an appropriate sense of 'speed' to them.<br/><br/>The one element where Spider-Man takes most liberty from its source material is the costume design. Spidey's traditional red-and-blue costume, which doesn't show up until halfway through the movie, is enhanced with raised glossy webbing, reflective silvery-white eye lenses, raised spider logos, and a brick pattern on the fabric  this gives the costume a more realistic feel. However, it would have been better to show some glimpses of Peter making his Spidey costume, because it comes on screen out of nowhere and leaves behind a few untied knots; for example, those not familiar with the comics may argue that ""whoever made the costume would know the identity of Spider-Man"", and the costume looks pro enough to be misleading. <br/><br/>While Spidey's costume is slightly altered for the better, the Green Goblin's suit is overhauled completely, and looks very high-tech and robotic compared to the comics' organic design. But what struck me most is that the Goblin's mask is stationary, so nearly all the emoting is left to body language. Where facial expression is needed from the Goblin, the eye lenses are lifted and Norman's eyes convey the emotions. At least the mask should have been non-stationary, because I was quite irked by how hard it was for the Goblin to emote.<br/><br/>Although most of the cast gives an impressive performance, Tobey Maguire easily takes the top spot; he perfectly fits the nerdy teenager's role with his youthful looks and voice, his body is supple enough to be Spidey's, and his soulful eyes are able to convey emotions with little effort  in fact, Maguire does for Spidey what Christopher Reeve did for Superman. Willem Dafoe was sometimes a little over-the-top moody as Norman, but otherwise gave a fine performance. Kirsten Dunst's expressions also seemed either overdone or flat, never in that 'sweet spot' in the middle (unlike Tobey), while James Franco was stiff throughout. J.K. Simmons' stints as the brash Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson were solid hilarity and without doubt the best minor role in the movie, while Rosemary Harris and Cliff Robertson also shine in their roles.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man"" does have its shortcomings and takes some liberty from its source in some places, but all the changes except the Goblin's redesign work in its favor. Despite that, some great combat action and character development, Danny Elfman's epic soundtrack and a lead actor that couldn't possibly have been better make ""Spider-Man"" a thoroughly impressive superhero film. RATING: 8/10."
"kalendra274","8","0","1","26 July 2008"," Peter's almost got the best of both worlds
","I've seen this movie a long time ago, there are only a few parts that I can remember which is ; a scene from the beginning, when he is chasing the school bus, when he got bitten by the spider and when he was bullied at school. Weird isn't it? It was such a long time ago, but I still can remember how great the movie was! It had such a excellent comic adaption, as I am a big fan of Spider-Man and read the comics, all I can say that movie is a bit different to the comics. One thing is because it illustrates Spider-Man fighting against the Venom and then we come to the end of the comic and it says Spider-Man saves the world once more. I know boring, eh. What I'm saying is that you can't compare the whole movie to the comics, because the movie also has terms which do not related to saving the world or fighting against a villain (I'm not saying Spider-Man don't save the world at the end and fight against a villain, of course he does!) I'm just saying there has never been a comic about Peter's high school life, so you can't compare some of the movie to the comic, his school life is way different from his other life (saving the world as Spider-Man) in his school life he is a very shy, geeky boy who is the laughing-stock of the school and gets bullied by people and when you look at Spider-Man's life, it's way different. Enough about the comics and the movie, the performances from the cast were throughly effortless, especially by Tobey Maguire who, as we all know, plays the shy, outgoing Peter Parker and also plays the kick-but superhero Spider-Man. The plot was great too, completely solid from start to finish, and I thought this movie is going to have too many characters that it starts to get a bit confusing, well I was certainly wrong about that! So if you're a Spidey fan, want to watch him do some superhero action, why not watch this? It might surprise you!"
"I_Love_Spielberg","10","0","1","13 May 2008"," Sam Raimi proves himself worthy of Spider-Man!
","I had never heard of Sam Raimi when I saw ""Spider-Man,"" but I was not disappointed. This film amazed me. After learning about the other movies Sam Raimi has directed, I was shocked to see him take on something like this. His movies in the past consist of ""The Evil Dead"" trilogy, ""Darkman,"" ""For Love of the Game,"" and ""The Quick and the Dead."" Quite the resume for someone like him.<br/><br/>Anyway, the action in this movie is fantastic, the acting is dead on, the drama is there, and you really can't expect more out of anything else. I especially love the scene where Tobey Maguire is trying to shoot webbing out of his hand but can't do it because he's doing the wrong hand gestures. It was funny! Kudos to Sam Raimi and everyone who was involved in ""Spider-Man."""
"Anonymous_Maxine","9","0","1","7 May 2008"," Great comic book fun!
","Sam Raimi has truly come a long way since his work on the infamous Evil Dead trilogy. He had been making major motion pictures for several years at the time that he began the Spiderman trilogy, and has made movies even better than this (A Simple Plan seems clearly like his best work since moving into ""mainstream"" movies), but Spiderman is a surprisingly fun adaptation, coming amidst a seemingly endless barrage of disappointing comic book movies. I have to admit that I was immediately put off by Toby Maguire as the title character (and he still doesn't at all match my original impression of what kind of person the comic book Spiderman was, but his performance is so good that he embodies the character in a way that enables you to overlook the difference between what you seen and what you always imagined. This is a major obstacle to overcome, and if it's done right, you are in for a treat.<br/><br/>New York City is captured with a brilliant reality that reminds me of great films like Do The Right Thing, but retains a sense of excess and hyper-reality, namely through some of the characters, like the loud-mouthed Jonas Jameson (played with hilarious overkill by J.K. Simmons), the editor of the newspaper Peter Parker works for.<br/><br/>Admittedly, some of the flying through the city streets scenes are less than convincing with their total reliance on digital effects, but amazingly it doesn't look at all out of place here, probably because the only Spiderman we've known until now has been nothing but drawings. The only real complaint I would make about the movie is the costume of the villain, The Green Goblin, played with cartoonish craziness by Willen Dafoe. For all of the sheer size of the movie, it is amazing that they chose what looks like a plastic, dime-store mask for him, and a lot of the battle scenes between him and Spiderman seem genuinely contrived.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, the movie is one of the best examples of good popcorn fun that I can think of in recent memory. It is pure, fun entertainment and even features a love story that doesn't seem forced into a movie where it doesn't belong. Kirsten Dunst gives a warm-hearted performance as the increasingly fascinated and fascinating Mary Jane, as her relationship with Peter Parker evolves but never feels predictable. The opening of the movie, where we learn what mishap created Spiderman, is wonderfully presented and lends a sense of fascination to the upcoming adventures. Sadly, the film is easy to pick apart, but overall it's just good fun. Nice work!"
"Stampsfightclub","8","0","1","20 April 2008"," Thought provoking and entertaining superhero fantasy
","This adaptation of the Marvel comic about an ordinary guy being turned into a spider brings out some wonderful stories, a great tale of the human spirit in Sam Raimi's 2002 box office hit.<br/><br/>Tobey McGuire (Seabiscuit) stars as high school student Peter Parker who gets bitten by a super spider on a class trip and with issues regarding the love of his life, school and his family, Parker's life is changing dramatically.<br/><br/>Having never read any of the comics but seeing the odd cartoon episode on the TV I wasn't quite sure what I was expecting when I first rented this film out but it was a very pleasing watch, filled with action suspense and a good plot for the whole family to enjoy.<br/><br/>McGuire fits the role of the stereotypical teen brilliantly. He plays the role quietly and through the narration we get a sense of his true feelings. I wasn't a fan of this technique but it was good to get more depth to the intriguing character as he goes through very difficult and interesting changes.<br/><br/>Dunst (Interview with the Vampire) plays Parker's love interest Mary Jane. There is good chemistry between the two actors and although the dialogue is cheesy and predictable, it is kinda sweet. The infamous upside down kiss was very well directed and probably the best on screen kiss I've seen.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe (Shadow of the vampire) is excellent as Norman Osborne, perhaps the best performance of the film. His portray of good and evil makes his performance varied and intriguing. The mirror scene was a brilliant acting moment to emphasise the contrasts.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly consistent. The drama behind scenarios involving Uncle Ben and the change into Spiderman are brilliant whereas some of the teenage school scenes are conventional, predictable especially the opening scene on the bus.<br/><br/>The direction and special effects are great and the whole ideology of the hero is brilliant making it an enjoyable and thought provoking superhero fantasy."
"scott-sw","8","0","1","21 February 2008"," Pretty good start for the franchise
","I had been looking forwards to the Spider-Man movie since the mid 1980's. I started collecting Amazing Spider-Man at the age of nine and had all from #150 to 400 along with all other accompanying titles. I was so anxious to see how film maker Sam Raimi would do it. He did not disappoint, although he took the mythology a different direction. Instead of a radio active spider born out of the fear of nuclear holocaust, we have a genetically altered born of the fear of genetic tampering. Also, instead of Peter Parker creating his web from science, his body creates. We follow the same predictable plot line of Peter wanting to use his powers to wrestle in order to get money. When a robber takes the money winnings, Peter has a chance to stop him but doesn't. Later, when he tracks Uncle Ben's killer, he finds the same robber. Now we have to hear ""with great power comes great responsibility."" Peter is now driven by guilt to be responsible and stop the bad guys. Unfortunately, one of those bad guys is very powerful. The Green Goblin comes in with his glider and explosives to wreck havoc on New York. It is up to Spidey to stop him. First, Tobey McGuire was perfectly cast as the nerdy, smart, and introverted Peter Parker/Spider-Man. He gives the character depth, charm, and wit. Peter finds a lot of self confidence through his super hero persona. Also well cast was James Franco as Harry Osborne. He is the good friend embarrassed by excessive wealth on his father's part. Even better was G.K. Simmons as Daily Bugle Publisher J. Jonah Jameson. He is the fast-talking opportunist who uses his rag with more abuse than Joseph Putlitzer and William Randolph Hearst combined. Willhelm Defoe plays Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. He is the entrepreneur and scientist who is driven to the edge by his own obsession. My only gripe is that his mask prevents us from seeing the emoting from his eyes and face. Kirsten Dunst makes Mary Jane believable, strong, and forceful. She made the role her own and made it work well. Also, a congratulations must be given to Rosemary Harris who gives the Aunt May a personality that was never strong in the comics. Director Sam Raimi gives us a real story about real people, which is what made the comic a gem. The audience can identify with the different characters. They have precedence over the special effects, which are outstanding in their own rite. While the original X-Men got the super hero to movie craze started, this one put the idea on the map."

","Now that we have 3 of the Big Screen, Blockbuster SPIDER-MAN films, it's a safe thing to write a few lines about the inaugural film. Anytime that you undertake bringing the public an adaptation of a Comic Book Feature, who has had literally hundreds (Or even thousands?) of stories via Comic Books, you're in for some special problems.<br/><br/>He has also had a: 1) a long running Spider-Man Newspaper Comic Strip, 2) Multiple Television adaptations, both Animated and Live Action Series, and 3) huge numbers of licensed Toys, Games, Lunch Boxes, Pencil Sets, etc. Yet, no matter, the series still must be given the Royal Treatment in its Maiden Voyage.<br/><br/>That means ""back to the drawing board."" And even in a strictly written origin story that stays close to the original, there are bound to be variation or elaboration on the original. This is demanded by the march of time itself. For example; would you depict the origin of Superman, rendering it in the same style of 1938? Depictions that were valid and in one day just would not be in another. A little updating of the idiom is in order.<br/><br/>Spidey's screen origin was adapted from the earliest days of the character dating to 1962. The film got the origin out to this early 21st Century Audience; while bumping it up just a trifle;yet the original spirit is intact.<br/><br/>In the Spider-Man Origin Story, we see a loner and unhappy nebbish, one Peter Parker. He excels in his student, but lacks physical prowess in anything athletic endeavor. He suffers low self-esteem, having no faith dealing with the others, especially the opposite sex. <br/><br/>Peter gets bitten by a radioactive spider finding himself suddenly endowed with all of those Spider-like powers and abilities; such as strength, climbing ability, speed and the all important ""Spider-sense."" Having little or no interest in using his powers and abilities for the betterment of all mankind; but, rather to make himself wealthy via exhibiting himself like a common, vulgar entertainer. It is at this time where his failure to act in aiding a robbery victim proves to be a fatal mistake; as the same thug turns out to be the one responsible for killing Peter's beloved Uncle Ben.<br/><br/>Thus our Spider-Man learns a bitter lesson in that just a little bit of getting involved would have spared Ben's life. This spectre of guilt hangs over Spider-Manall of his life.<br/><br/>Jules Feiffer in his breakthrough work, the collection: ""The Great Comic Book Heroes""*, described Spidey as the ""Woody Allen of Super Heroes"", reasoning that just because one is endowed with these neato Super Powers and has established his alter-ego/secret identity/Super Hero, that he wouldn't have trouble with dating girls or being plagued by acne, excessive B.O. or even a case of the ""Zackleys."" <br/><br/>The difference in the dual tellings of the tale involve the venue in which that the young Mr. Parker was using in his quest in cashing in on his new-found talents for some old fashioned, cold ca$h. The comics' origin in Spiderman # 1, had Peter's being booked on a Nationally Televised Big Time Network Variety Show. It was the Comics Pages equivalent of THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW, the Sunday variety show. <br/><br/>By contrast the first SPIDER-MAN had change of venue, making his $eeking riche$ from Show Biz to a ""Taking on all comers"" Wrestling Promotion. The Wrestling angle was probably more easy for today's movie goer.<br/><br/>Our own personal favourite bit of casting is J.K. Simmons as The Daily Bugle Editor, J. Jonah Jameson. Mr. Simmons, who is possibly best known for his recurring part as Psychologist Dr. Emil Skoda, on Law & Order, really gets to ham it up in this role, which is really a sort of caricature of all of those hard-boiled Newspaper Editors that have been so prominent in our Hollywood Films for the last 70-80 years or so.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Mr. Simmons is of the right age to have grown up with the Spider-Man saga; and doubtless would have to be well acquainted with his personality.<br/><br/>We thought that the casting was over-all at least adequate, with most parts being manned by actors (and actresses) who were excellent in their roles. We are especially pleased with Toby Maguire in the lead & title role. We kinda woulda liked it if they woulda let Peter Parker use his glasses a little longer, as the specs were an everyday part of the wardrobe to the early Spidey Stories. (But that's just a small and very insignificant point.) <br/><br/>The biggest boner was their making the ability to spin his web to being a part of his own biological metamorphosis, rather than its being a mechanical dispenser worn on the wrists. They will get by with it as long as they don't dwell on it. So, just pretend it never happened; and we'll all feel better.<br/><br/>The screen version of The Green Goblin as portrayed by Mr. Willam Dafoe is quite energetic and an excellent choice for their inaugural Spidey venture. The theme of the over accumulation of power by the Military-Industrial Complex, in keeping with the words of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, as well as a true to life problem.<br/><br/>NOTE: * In 1965, the publication of Mr. Feiffer's THE GREAT COMIC BOOK HEROES, books on Comic Strips and especially ones about Comic Books were unheard of. The big book stores in Downtown Chicago; like Kroch's & Brentano's, didn't know where to display the books for sale; as they, at this point, had no such designated ""Comics"" section."

On the other hand I thought the villain in the Spiderman No.1 was far better than the one in Spiderman 2. Williem Dafoe was superb as the Green Goblin, he was terrifying. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst was also superb as Peter Parker and Mary Jane. If the responsibility of bringing the web slinging Superhero had fallen into the wrong hands it could have been a whole lot worse. Not a bad effort at all."

","Spider-Man is set in New York where nerdy high school student Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) lives with his aunt May (Rosemary Harris) & uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), while on a school field trip to the research laboratories at Columbia University he is bitten by a genetically engineered spider. Over the next few days Peter undergoes an amazing transformation, he gets stronger, develops the ability to climb sheer walls & shoot thick webbing from his wrists. Peter has turned into a spider-man, the physical appearance of a man but with the strength, agility & web shooting powers of an ordinary spider. However tragedy strikes & uncle Ben is killed by a thief, from that moment on Peter decides to use his amazing spider like powers to fight crime in New York. Calling himself Spider-Man Peter's first big test comes in the form of the evil Green Goblin...<br/><br/>Directed by Sam Raimi this was the first time the hugely popular Spider-Man superhero comic book character appeared in a film despite having featured in various cartoon & live action TV show's, a huge box-office hit when originally released back in May 2002 in US theatres I actually remember going to see it when it was released here in the UK a month later in June & I specifically remember not liking it that much. Having watched it again last night for the first time in over 5 years I actually enjoyed it a lot more but I still didn't think it was the 100% solid gold classic many make it out to be. The script by David Koepp tries to have it's cake & eat it, it tries to present a very serious world where Peter Parker has all the usual teenage trouble with girls, bullies & family in some really rather dull & dour drama yet at any given moment it can shift into over-the-top fantasy comic book mode with Spider-Man swinging between New York skyscrapers & the Green Goblin flying around on his glider. I personally thought the transition between the two at times is quite jarring & badly handled & I just often thought the serious drama & the fantasy comic book action didn't sit that well together. At a good 2 hours in length I also felt there wasn't really enough story here & it could have used a bit of editing to quicken the pace up. Then there's the Green Goblin, was anyone else throughly disappointed by him? In the comic books & cartoon series the Green Goblin is just that, a green creature rather than a guy in a green outfit & silly mask. Also what was the Green Goblin's ultimate plan? I mean I know he killed the board members so Norman could take complete control of the company but what was his purpose after that? Did he have any more plans? I don't think so, he just seemed 'there' for Spider-Man to fight but why? To me the Green Goblin after he had killed the board members seemed like a totally pointless & motiveless character.<br/><br/>Director Raimi has fun, there are some truly outstanding CGI computer effects & action scenes. The end in particular is impressive as is the fight between the Green Goblin & Spider-Man in a burning building, the shots of Spider-Man swinging through the streets of New York are majestic & look most impressive. However there is one goof that I noticed the first time I saw it, it's a shot present in the trailer & it really annoyed me last night as well, there's a scene when Spider-Man rescues Mary Jane from the collapsing balcony & she is holding onto him while he swings across the street. Well, if you look at the shot they are swinging from left to right but her hair is blowing to the right when it should be blowing to the left, it's like standing in front of a wind machine & your hair blowing in the direction the wind is coming from. The Spider-Man costume looks really good actually, several were made & they apparently cost $100,000 each. The film has some stylish moments & is fun to look at during the fantasy action sequences but not so much during the drama scenes.<br/><br/>With a budget of about $100,000,000 with another $30,000,000 on top of that for advertising Spider-Man was a well funded film & it comes as no surprise the production design, sets & special effects are superb. Although set in New York it was largely filmed in Los Angeles. The acting is OK but no-one stood out as being great, even Maguire wasn't anything special although Willem Dafoe puts in quite a good performance. Nominated for two Oscars, Best Sound & Best Visual Effects, it ended up winning neither.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is almost a great film, not many comic strips make good films but Spider-Man nearly pulls it off, a slightly slow pace, a disappointing villain & some slushy sentimental drama stop it from achieving greatness. Definitely a god film worth a watch but it's not the flawless piece of film-making many make it out to be. To date this has been followed by a further three sequels, Spider-Man 2 (2004), Spider-Man 3 (2007) & Spider-Man 4 (2009) which is currently in production."

","I've always liked super-heroes like Spiderman, Superman, and Batman. And I've always loved action films. So I went to the theaters to see it. I came out with a huge grin on my face. Well worth the $6.50 I paid.<br/><br/>The movie starts out at the beginning of the first Spiderman Comic. With Peter Parker (played by the talented Tobey Maguire) getting bit by the spider and transforming into Spiderman. Peter is in love with the beautiful Mary Jane (casted Kirsten Dunst who plays everything perfectly) and hopes to win her over.<br/><br/>Of course Peter keeps his spider-y ways to himself and doesn't tell a soul. But soon trouble arises with the Green Goblin (Willam Dafoe) when he makes his appearance and soon causes turmoil in New York City.<br/><br/>The whole thing is beyond great. Visual effects are awesome without being distracting, the plot is so entertaining, and the acting is superb.<br/><br/>This is a great movie that you should definitely see!! 9 stars"

","As a kid I've always enjoyed spider man. I feel the first movie was a great adaptation of the comics. Sure a few things were changed but overall it was still pleasant to see. This was one of the first well done superhero movies I've seen. Enough time was spent on character development to have things smooth out efficiently. Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker was a great choice. Despite his age he still easily passes off as a teenager. Also William Dafoe was great as the Goblin. It took time to get used to MJ. Kirsten Dunst with red hair at first seemed awkward to me. I eventually got used to it. I was too used to the cartoon MJ.<br/><br/>Overall, it's definitely something I recommend watching, even buying."

Now, Spider-Man was being brought to the big screen for the first time, and it's perfect in every way. The cast is perfect. Tobey Maguire can easily fit into the nerdy role of Peter Parker and brings a convincing turn as Super-Man. Kirsten Dunst is a great Mary Jane, and really brings the romantic side of the film in. Willem Dafoe is a sinister Green Goblin and you can see that he is really enjoying the role. James Franco was well cast and look likes Dafoe's son. The story is very well written and doesn't drag on, and although there are a few odd shots, the CGI is very impressive.

","I am a huge fan of Spiderman and I have been an avid reader for many years, so to see my favorite superhero of all time come on to the big screen for the first time was a huge and satisfying thrill.<br/><br/>The film is a great comic book movie and perfect beginning for a series of spiderman movies in the future, the plot is an origin story and is always usually the hardest story to do. The story is of Peter Parker a nerdy high schooler, whom is bitten by a radioactive spider and his life changes in a way he couldn't have ever imagined. He acquires a muscular physique, ability to cling to surfaces and crawls over and up walls and shoot webs from his wrists. But the fun has only just begun as rich industrialist Norman Osborn administers a performance enhancing drug on himself and becomes the crazed psychotic The Green Goblin! now Peter has to become Spiderman and go at war with the Goblin whom has chaotic plans for new york and wants to ruin the spider.<br/><br/>The acting of this film is above par and Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin steals the show and delivers a brilliant and manic performance, James Franco does an exceptional job portraying Harry Osborn showing a wide range of emotions, J.K. Simmons was perfectly casted as J. Jonah Jameson and delivers some hilarious one-liners, Cliff Robertson gives a heartwarming performance as the gentle Uncle Ben and Rosemary Harris is as sweet as ever as Aunt May. Tobey Maguire did a great job with the Peter Parker side of the character but I had a hard time believing him in the Spiderman role at times, and Kirsten Dunst was very dull and weak as Mary Jane and miscast in my opinion.<br/><br/>The action sequences of this film are great but rather short, and some of the cgi is laughable but the film overcomes that. Compared to films like X-Men or Batman Begins this is a considerably lighthearted superhero film, but doesn't suffer for it and works better that way anyway.<br/><br/>I will note however that a major downer on this film was the costume of the Green Goblin, now the costume in the comics wouldn't have worked either but this costume was like a bad power rangers costume and they definitely could have tried harder than that.<br/><br/>Some great scenes were the Unity Fair attack scene, the burning building scene and the final fight between Spiderman and Green Goblin which was quite gritty and graphic.<br/><br/>A great film and definitely worth seeing if you're a fan of this genre and I would recommend it to casual movie gowers as well."
"jma5072","Null","0","1","13 August 2007"," Has Its Flaws, But Still a Sure-Fire Success
","Spiderman is really the last notable comic super hero to make the transition to the cinemas. Luckily, the finished product proves to be worth the wait. Spiderman is better than all the Superman movies, every bit as good as X-Men (2000), and way better than three of the first four Batman films. Spiderman is, of course, a telling of how a nerdy high-school kid named Peter Parker transforms into Spiderman, and thus, a superhero. One day, while on a museum field-trip in New York City, Pete receives a bite on the hand by an exotic, unidentified, spider, that winds up giving him all the characteristics of an arachnid itself! But in this story, Parker isn't the only one undergoing a transformation of sorts. So too is a prominent scientist/engineer named Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe), whose flawed science 'experiment' leads to the creation of his fiendish alter-ego: The Green Goblin. And yea, you guessed right- it's up to Spiderman to save NYC. There's a lot to like about this movie. Yea, Toby Maguire is one of Hollywood's most overrated actors, but he did do a pretty good job here in portraying Peter in as nerdy a light as possible, maybe even a little too much so. Much like Michael Keaton was with the Bruce Wayne persona, Maguire is successful in transmitting Peter's overwhelming social ambiguity and awkwardness. Kirsten Dunst is surprisingly impressive in her role as Mary Jane Watson, Parker's girl/obsession, but aside from standing there (including in the rain) and looking simply amazing, she really doesn't have much to do. She does, however, get to play ""damsel in distress"" three separate times in the final forty minutes of the film, a new Hollywood record. With the exception of James Franco, whose lifeless as Harry (Pete's friend), the supporting cast of Spiderman is very good, and features an unforgettable performance by J.K. Simmons as Parker's boss at the city newspaper. The Green Goblin, however, is the big letdown of the picture. Willem Dafoe is certainly sinister and even Anthony Hopkins-like creepy at times, but the Goblin itself is an absolute joke. He's marred by a corny script and an even cornier cackle, not to mention a costume that reminds us of a power-ranger. Still, Spiderman is a job well done, with good New York cinematography, above-average CGI graphics, and a decent storyline featuring dimensional and personable characters. Unlike other superhero films, the quality of it's script stays pretty strong, only wavering during the Spiderman/Goblin fight scenes. Spiderman is a perfect summer-time movie, with enough excitement and stuff going on in it to please viewers of all ages. Two thumps up.<br/><br/>Rating: 3 stars out of 4"
"Winds_of_Destination","8","0","1","10 August 2007"," Good movie with scenes connected by flawed and boring links
","Since the 80's, I believe, Spider-Man has been trying over and over again to hit the silver screen. James Cameron got close, writing a script for the movie but the idea was thrown out. Spidey material sat silent in the dust for 8 years before Sam Raimi picked it up.<br/><br/>The first 45 minutes are near flawless. There were some forgettable scenes (GG attacking some air force base), and the whole wrestling scene was ridiculous, but it was all a build-up to the defining moment in Peter Parker's history; his Uncle Ben gets shot, and he seeks revenge immediately. And through this he learns the true meaning of ""With great power comes great responsibility"".<br/><br/>The second act begins right after he avenges his uncle's death. He soon becomes Spider-Man and begins to pursue the girl of his dreams, Mary Jane. Spider-Man has given him confidence, but things aren't so great for the hero for long. A new menace is on the scene, going by the moniker Green Goblin, and he has a fight- actually three- to pick with Spider-Man. His first fight is entertaining, his second a bore, and his third a cinematic marvel. He is played by the cunning Willem Dafoe, who gives a very credible role in this film.<br/><br/>All the performances of course, are good. Tobey Maguire does a great job as the heroic webslinger, doing justice for the emotional scenes and giving a sense of triumph in the red tights. James Franco is equally good, although he only has a couple of cameos as Peter's best friend. His final scene is promising. Kirsten Dunst does a good job as well as Rosemary Harris and Cliff Roberston. Every character is believable and fun to watch, whether it be on the silver screen or on your TV.<br/><br/>This movie is flawed though. While still managing greatly on the entertainment level, some of the bigger scenes can only be shown by introducing a new storyline, and it is usually done through a boring scene (Spidey's second fight with GG leads to something I don't want to say as to not spoil the film). There are plenty of scenes that are entirely forgettable, but each one leads to something more important, something bigger.<br/><br/>The main highlight, though, is the final battle at the end, composed of two major scenes. Both are spectacular (the Queensboro Bridge and GG vs. Spidey in the old warehouse) and do wonders for the film's presentation and credibility. And it is only followed by a great ending, leaving you wanting to watch it again.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is the promising opening of a good trilogy (would've said great if Spider-Man 3 wasn't part of that trilogy), and I give it a 7.2/10."
"greenheadjawsuniversal","9","0","1","3 August 2007"," Here Comes The Spider-Man!
","Spider-Man is one awesome comic book adaption. I think they got it right after years being held in development. This film displays great acting chops from Maguire as Peter Parker and a great menacing performance by Willem Defoe as Norman Osborn. Sam Raimi certainly knows the Spider-Man origin story very well. The film does have a couple of minor inaccurate changes, but this Spider-Man film is executed very well so in some ways it works, for example like his organic web shooters.<br/><br/>Tobey MaGuire was the right choice for the nerd teenager Peter Parker. The moral of the story as long with the origin of the story, and it is very well told. I didn't like Kirsten Dunst as MJ. Shedid an okay job, but any other actress could have done better. WillemDefoe as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin, was superior! Defoe's characterwas very menacing and evil, and so mean and nasty, he did a fine job there and there was nothing wrong with his part of the movie, I also like the way how Norman would treat Peter more like a son he would have than his own son Harry Osborn played by the amazing James Franco. Rosemary Harris as Aunt May has a full screen time, not just a cameo, and Cliff Robinson as Ben Parker, Peter's uncle, has a really great scene with Tobey, ""With Great Power Come Great Responseiblity.""<br/><br/>Spider-Man is filled with excitement and a lot of cartoony fun, although the visuals look sort of out of date, but it is not something to take away from the movie. The visuals got a lot better when the sequels came along, as did the action. X-Men may have started the superhero genre, but Spider-Man really set the standard and popularized it. <br/><br/>Director Sam Raimi is a master at pacing, and is able to move the story without any subtle changes and disjointed plot holes. The film moves at a right pace and he certainly has an eye for action sequences. <br/><br/>This is one comic bookfilm they got right. Spider-Man is a well told superhero movie which brought super-stardom to Tobey MaGuire."
"Electrified_Voltage","8","0","1","29 July 2007"," Superior superhero flicks have been made in recent years, but this is still a good one
","A good bunch of live action adaptations of superhero comic books have made it into theatres so far in the 2000s. There has been the ""X-Men"" trilogy, several ""Spider-Man"" movies, ""Hulk"", ""Catwoman"" (a Batman spin-off), the first ""Batman"" movie in a while, etc. Some of them have turned out to be excellent, while some have failed. This first installment in the ""Spider-Man"" movie franchise, which turned out to be an absolute success upon its release in 2002, isn't the best superhero movie of the decade, but it certainly isn't the worst.<br/><br/>In the beginning, Peter Parker is a very unpopular high school student who is often picked on. However, while in a laboratory, he is bitten by a genetically mutated spider, and after that, he is no longer the same! He suddenly becomes very strong, and soon discovers that he can climb walls, shoot webs from his wrists, and swing around the city! He uses his new powers to swing around in a new costume to hide his identity, and fight crime in the city, going by the name Spider-Man! Meanwhile, Norman Osborn, a local scientist and the father of Peter's best friend, Harry, has created himself an alter ego as well, but an evil one, as a result of taking the performance enhancer he has developed! As Green Goblin, he begins to wreak havoc in the city, and makes Spider-Man's job as the local hero more difficult! <br/><br/>I have seen ""Spider-Man"" several times since seeing it in the theatre, and have basically been impressed every time. Mind you, certain moments in this adaptation of the popular comics are a bit cheesy. The part where Peter Parker enters a wrestling match looking like a kid in a Halloween costume is a tad awkward, and some of the lines in the movie are ridiculous, including some things Peter says to Mary Jane Watson. So, this 2002 blockbuster may have a few slightly embarrassing moments, which is why it's inferior to certain other superhero flicks that have come out this decade. However, this movie also has a good amount of action, as well as some gripping moments, and maybe some occasional humour.<br/><br/>While this first installment in the ""Spider-Man"" franchise may be just a tad overrated, it sure beats ""Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers"" (even though there may be some slight but unfortunate resemblances), and overall, it's a good action/superhero movie. It's really not surprising that it was such a big hit. For those who are generally into movie adaptations of popular comic books, whether you're into those comic books at the moment or not, ""Spider-Man"" should be fun. As long as you can get over the shortcomings, and don't expect perfection, it shouldn't be a major disappointment, if a disappointment at all."

"zardoz-13","8","0","1","11 July 2007"," Despite its narrative flaws, ""Spider-man"" hangs tough.
","""Evil Dead"" director Sam Raimi spins an uneven but entertaining web of excitement, suspense, and romance in Columbia Pictures' new live-action ""Spider-man"" movie based on the venerable Marvel Comics character. Although it lacks the depth and intelligence of Bryan Singer's ""X-Men,"" ""Spider-man"" compares favorably with Richard Donner's standard-bearing epic ""Superman"" (1978). Each poked fun at themselves in straight-faced fashion, but neither let their villains overshadow the heroes as Tim Burton did in his Michael Keaton ""Batman"" yarns. The offbeat but inspired casting of Tobey Maguire as Spider-man and Willem Dafoe as the villainous Green Goblin virtually compensates for two unforgivable flaws which neither Raimi nor veteran scripter David Koepp resolve in an entirely satisfactory manner. Meanwhile, John Dykstra of the original ""Star Wars"" serves up some credible digital special effects that allow audiences to websling their way vicariously through the Big Apple with Spidey. Happily, these CGI sequences seamlessly integrate with Maguire's dialogue scenes in his red & blue, body stocking costume. Shrewdly, Raimi and Koepp obliterate the ""Spider- man"" mask during the climactic fight, so Maquire's personality enlivens his heroic posturings. <br/><br/>""Spider-man"" follows the ""Superman"" formula about Spidey's origins, so you need not be a Marvel Comics arachnophile to enjoy this blockbuster. The action unfolds in a high school setting like ""Can't Hardly Wait"" with dorky protagonist, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire of ""Wonder Boys"") warning the fainthearted about the trials and tribulations that confound a superhero. When we meet him, Peter is obsessed with class beauty Mary Jane Watson (cleavage-baring Kirsten Dunst of ""Small Soldiers""), but she doesn't know he exists. They live next door to each other and attend the same senior high in the New York City borough of Queens. The jocks harass Peter unmercifully, but he survives their ridicule with no ill effects. Things change dramatically on a class field trip to Columbia University. A 'genetically designed super spider' bites Peter. When he awakens the following morning, Peter discovers to his disbelief that he no longer needs glasses and has a weight lifter's physique. Miraculously, he finds he can squirt webs out of his wrists and scale walls. Not long afterward, the Green Goblin, a power-hungry maniac on a jet glider who wreaks havoc wherever he flies, confronts Spidey and invites him to team up as his partner-in-crime. Of course, Spider-man refuses, and Goblin attacks Spider-man's aunt and his girlfriend Mary Jane.<br/><br/>The worst thing about ""Spider-man"" is our hero cuts a rather dull figure when we cannot see Tobey Maguire's expressive countenance. The only time Hollywood conceals movie stars is when stunt men double for them. The first half of ""Spider-man"" surpasses the second half, because the complexity of the former abates during the latter. Inexplicably, Goblin neglects to unmask and/or kill Spidey after he captures him! Later, during a standoff involving a detached cable car, Goblin forces Spidey to choose who to rescue: his girlfriend Mary Jane or the cable car passengers. Predictably, Spidey saves both with one strand. Nevertheless, despite its narrative flaws, ""Spider-man"" hangs tough."

Although both sequels are superior to this one, it's still a hell of a good movie. I like the Green Goblin costume in the movie a lot more than the one he wears in the comics.

"Lord_Crypto","8","0","1","17 June 2007"," The Amazing Spider-man makes An Amazing Film
","Sam Raimi has taken perhaps one of the most popular comic book characters and turned him into a movie star. The result, a huge franchise that has launched into a huge success. Spider-man is a terrific movie with good casting, a good story, a good theme song (courtesy of The Amazing Danny Elfman), and amazing special effects.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire fills the role of Peter Parker perfectly. He has the appearance and the attitude of a young Peter Parker. His appearance is enough to convince me he is good for the role. He looks like he was born for the part and he does a fantastic job of filling it. I have been somewhat skeptical about Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. I never pictured her as being the Mary Jane type physically although she does a good job with the part. I have always been skeptical with James Franco as well. I do not think he did a fantastic job as Harry Osborne and I still ponder on him being cast (although he had a much better portrayal in Spider-man 3). His character just seems to outgoing, to selfish, and almost annoying(?). Willem Dafoe, in my opinion, stole the show. He plays Norman Osborne and the villainous Green Goblin. An absolutely perfect choice for the character. He has the anger to play the character and the ability to transform characters (From Osborne to the Goblin) easily and perfectly. His mental psyche is absolutely perfect for the character. I will admit, I did not really like his costume, but that is just his costume! His character is perfect! And there is some comic relief in this film, J.K. Simmons plays an unforgettable and perfect J. Jonah Jameson (editor in chief of the daily bugle).<br/><br/>The story is very good though I feel the movie starts out awkward. I do not like how they really rush into Spider-man's transformation and the movie seems somewhat off tempo to start. The entire initial movie sequence up to when Peter's Uncle Ben confronts him in the car seems just rushed. After that, it seems like the movie moves more smoothly. Other than that, there is little I have to dislike about the film. The special effects are amazing and the design work done on Spidey's costume is terrific. The fight sequences are great and the final showdown between Spidey and the Goblin is awesome. The entertainment in this movie is high quality. Spider-man is a hero people feel they can relate to. He has duties that he feels he must commit to as a superhero and he faces real life challenges and personal problems outside of that life. This movie does a great job of capturing that.<br/><br/>Whether you think of Spider-man as being ""Amazing"" or ""Spectacular"", either of these words can be used to describe the Spider-man film."

","Spider Man, the genesis of the now comic book superhero trilogy. It's a trilogy now, but it is supposed to become the Harry Potter or Police Academy of comic book movies. The first one is the best more often than not, and that holds true for Spider Man as well. It was so fresh, so new and Peter Parker was young and carefree, making Spider Man a much more endearing character.<br/><br/>Spider Man was super hyped, and for the most part it delivered. If it did not deliver, it would not have been the first nor the last overly hyped movie to bomb. Fortunately, Spider Man was an excellent movie from both a story standpoint and a cinematic standpoint. Spider Man and X-Men are the blueprints for the correct way to convert a comic book to a movie."

","Based on Marvel Comics' superhero character, this is a story of Peter Parker who is a nerdy high-schooler. He was orphaned as a child, bullied by jocks, and can't confess his crush for his stunning neighborhood girl Mary Jane Watson. One day while on an excursion to a laboratory a runaway radioactive spider bites him... and his life changes in a way no one could have imagined.<br/><br/>Peter acquires powers a spider has... but the fun isn't going to last. An eccentric millionaire Norman Osborn administers a performance enhancing drug on himself and his maniacal alter ego Green Goblin emerges. Now Peter Parker has to become Spider-Man and take Green Goblin to the task... or else Goblin will kill him. They come face to face and the war begins in which only one of them will survive at the end.<br/><br/>I don't know why I didn't like this film as much as everybody did. I think it lacked something. No, I liked the character's origins. No, not the action, since they were great with breathtaking special effects. Maybe they could have done more with the action or more with the villain (although I didn't like the Green Goblin as a villain).<br/><br/>Everything good in the film isn't great, comparing to great superhero films like its sequel, Spider-Man 2 and 3, Daredevil, or Hellboy. I liked the action sequences in the film, and I liked the humor from some scenes.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire playing Spider-Man was relatively good, as well as Willem Dafoe and Kirsten Dunst. The score was good, as well as the cinematography. Maybe I was expecting more than they showed in the movie. This film was good, but it wasn't anything great. It fell short with my expectations. I didn't like the ending. Just expect what you want."

","This review is the opinion of a film fan who is not very familiar of the original Spider-Man comic books. I judge this movie not on its faithfulness or differences to the series of illustrations and books that got it all started. I judge this just as an action movie. To start off, I'll just say that it's a great way to start a film trilogy. Somewhat flawed, weak at a few small points, but overall, a fun summer blockbuster. It's a good way to kill time on a rainy day.<br/><br/>Not everything in ""Spider-Man"" is entirely original for a film. The main character of Peter Parker sort of develops in a way that has been seen on the screen numerous times before in other films, super-hero movies or not. Going from a somewhat less-than-average person to a figure of great importance. There is a love interest, a best friend, tragedies in his family life, and ultimately, the greatest secret of all. Tobey Maguire is first rate as Peter Parker, he can portray him as being a total college loser and the great Spider-Man at the same time. I am also fond of the performances done by Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. And don't forget Willem Dafoe as the nemesis of the film: the Green Goblin, who I am sure started out in the comic book series, although I can't say for sure.<br/><br/>In this era of nearly flawless CGI and special effects, ""Spider-Man"" stands out as an average achievement. Everything shown in it is believable on screen. There are no spots where a viewer will say ""Gee, how fake"" or ""oh, yeah sure, that's convincing...not"". Our two main ""super"" characters Spider-Man and the Green Goblin were portrayed in great battles through both real performances by the actors and stuntmen, and through the process of bringing them to life using CGI. Overall, a good blend to entertain the audience.<br/><br/>I did feel however, that the film's beginning rushed a little fast to be clear on its points. The same thing goes for the ending. It wasn't until ""Spider-Man 2"" where I found out the real purpose of the ending of this film."
"vivianlabertew","8","0","1","23 May 2007"," I was a comic book nerd girl...
","To say I had been anticipating this movie would be a severe understatement. Since my days in elementary school I had day dreamed of a live-action Spider-man movie. I was one of few girls who loved reading comics. One would think that a product of Hollywood would have no chance of living up to such lofty hopes but this does. The special effects are perfect. The plot is original enough to remain interesting but doesn't throw the ideas from its comic book origins out the window. Every character and every relationship is exactly as it should be. Even what some would consider background characters like Jameson are like they stepped directly from the pages of the comic. It's also very well acted. I actually start to tear up when Uncle Ben dies sometimes when i watch it now. I don't know what else to say except I love this movie and it is a true benchmark for movies of its kind."

","I was about 6 or 7 years old when I first saw this movie. I remember that I was a bit crying when I saw that Uncle Ben had been killed. Sam Raimi had expressed many dramatic scenes like this one very explicitly, so explicitly that I cried. And I usually don't cry when I watch movies.I was given the VHS in Christmas 2002, and I still like watching it. I don't know why, but I liked the Green Goblin character. I found him hilarious. The ending is really cool: The Goblin's board going towards Spidey, and Spider-man doing a backflip in the air as the board's spikes hit the goblin in the chest. And it's so dramatic when Harry Osborne says that if he ever finds Spider-man, he'll kill him. Man, I liked this movie. As I am writing this, I wonder what I will write for the other Spider-Man movies. So good, 2 thumbs up! And Tobey Maguire, James Franco, Kristen Dunst and William Dafoe are really good in character. GOOD JOB!"
"EijnarAmadeus","8","0","1","8 May 2007"," The most amazing superhero-debut in cinema history!
","Spider-Man is probably the most amazing superhero-debut ever made. Tim Burton's Batman was entertaining, slick and had a great comic book look, and Richard Donner's good-ol' Superman was a uniformed and catchy, but none of them has got Spider-Man's depth and power. Everything from Tobey Maguire's geekish charm to Williem Dafoe's evil-minded bad-guy is perfect, and although the movie is pure entertainment, it is as good as it gets. Sam Raimi took the responsibility of making the movie about one of the most beloved superhero-characters of them all, and after watching this you realize that he couldn't have succeeded more. Combining great action with witty romance, comic book textures with thoughtful characters this is simply put a great movie! Peter Parker is a nerdy but very behaved boy who lives with his uncle and aunt. He always gets picked on at school, doubling the problem is the fact that he is in love with his neighbor and class-mate, Mary Jane. One day everything changes, Peter gets bitten by a spider and becomes very ill, but only for a few hours. The next morning Peter discovers that he's built up an extraordinary physical condition and that he has taken the spider's powers, easily climbing walls and spinning webs. Developing this talent Peter draws his new persona, Spider-Man. But that doesn't make life easier, 'cause with great power comes great responsibility."

","When you are equipped with a resource one of the things that you need to watch out for is the proper and controlled use of the resource. Spider-man had this resource called ""computer graphics"" on its side. And this was over used. Sometimes the animations appear a little cartoonish. Sometimes, it becomes a little too obvious that the character is too stationery and the background is moving way too fast. May be some of us would like it that way, blurry graphics are being liked too but they are not ideal at least.<br/><br/>The story of the origin of powers of Spider-man is done pretty well. They slightly deviated from the original concept of the comics but the deviation was positive. But Peter Parker was a bit too over-painted with colors of sympathy. Sam Raimi is known for his skills to make his audience involve in the movie and the one trick he does seem to use here is that he actually makes the audience sympathize with the character. That has of course added to the success of the film but takes away a little bit of the heroism out. Peter Parker hardly looks strong and determined and looks a little bit too sad. I would find it cool to be Spider-man but definitely not Peter Parker.<br/><br/>And Mary Jane's character cannot be liked. I am sure that the masses do not agree but Mary Jane is shown to be a little cruel and self-centered raising a question as to what is it about her that drives Peter mad. More than anything, it convinces me to control myself before ""falling"" for anyone.<br/><br/>The Goblin character seriously looks like he was taken out of one of those 3-d animation movies. There is very little in this character that looks like it is in flesh and blood in a world we can identify with. This is the cartoonish effect I was talking about. The Green Goblin looks cartoonish. Perhaps modification of his suit and especially his helmet might have brought a bit more realism. And yes, slow down the camera. Bring in a few close ups. Speed is not everything! Overall, the movie is filled with fun and can be enjoyed a lot. But it does suffer from over-use or rather improper use of computer-graphics. A very decent adaptation of the comic book but there was a lot of room for development."

","Spider-Man(2002):<br/><br/>Starring:<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/The Green Goblin James Franco as Harry Osborn<br/><br/>Plot: You should know the story by now, but nerdy Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider, which gives him all of it's powers. This makes him Spider-Man. Deciding to be a hero after the death of his Uncle Ben, he soon finds his hands full thanks to the Green Goblin, who is Norman Osborn, the father of Peter's friend Harry.<br/><br/>I've been a Spider-Man fan for years. I grew up with everyone's favorite wall-crawler. I watched the 90's animated series, I read the comics. Spidey and I have been through a lot together(like the Clone Saga) but when I knew there was going to be a movie? Directed by Sam ""hey I made Evil Dead once"" Raimi? I was excited, to say the least. All my childhood memories swelled up and I was a kid again sitting in the theater opening weekend.<br/><br/>I've avoided doing these movies simply because I thought I'd be biased. But here I go, attempting to be unbiased. Doing so, I'll list this movies faults first. For starters, the script can be kind of cheesy. There are some lines here and there that can be groan-inducing. It could be added up to the comic book aspect of it. Because if you've read a Spider-Man comic, that text can get silly. Another problem I had was the Green Goblin. Don't get me wrong, Willem Dafoe was wonderful, but that suit could not have been more wrong. It's been compared to Power Ranger villains, and even though it's not that bad(really, have you SEEN an episode of that?), robotic Green Goblin was not the way to go at all.<br/><br/>Luckily they had a strong actor in Dafoe to pull off the maniacal Goblin or the whole thing wouldn't have worked. He played crazy well and made Goblin a strong nemesis for Spidey. And what of our webbed hero? The character, along with everyone else, was fully fleshed out and made you care for them. That went a long way to getting you involved in the story.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire does a credible job as both Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst is cute and has a strong character. James Franco does well as Harry Osborn. And the supporting cast(chosen perfectly, in my opinion) is really what holds this thing together. JK Simmons as J Jonah Jameson? PERFECT! I never thought Jonah would be my favorite part of the movie but the way he was casted and the way he pulls off the character make him a welcome addition.<br/><br/>Last, but not least, the special effects were top-notch. But they'd pretty much have to be to pull of a Spider-Man movie of this epic proportions. The suit looks good, the fight scenes are spectacular, and the movie itself flows together nicely.<br/><br/>When everything was said and done and all the webs were spun, Spider-Man delivered a well-done comic adaptation. I'd say Spider-Man is definitely worth your time, in spite of some flaws that were present in the movie.<br/><br/>Rating: **** of *****"

I think that spiderman all in all was a pretty good movie for the first time around. But it seems in spiderman 1 and 2 that both villains get killed. At least leave one of them alive! But it's a movie so the heros always win and good always triumphs.

","More and more Marvel comics characters are coming on the big screen. ""Spiderman"" was worth the watch. I pretty much know the story of the origin of the hero.

This Spiderman has no web-shooters. So Peter has to find out how to shoot the web from his wrists. That was funny. When gets the costume worked out, it's amazing. The people around Parker makes a difference: Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst); Peter's squeeze, Aunt May Parker(Rosemary Harris); a strong mother figure, Harry Osborn(James Franco) Peter's friend who he and his father, Norman(Willem Dafoe) are very disturbing.

When I saw the movie it didn't blow my mind but, I did very much enjoy it. I consider Spider-Man as a better hero then batman, and Superman. Spider-Man along with X-Men are really the only Super Hero Movies/ Cartoons that I paid attention too.<br/><br/>Spider-Man had great action, the plot in my personal judgment was good, dialog was good and the introduction to Peter Parker, his life and how he became Spider-Man was well done and well shown. <br/><br/>Before Peter Parker became Spider-Man he had no chance with any one and then he was given an gift. A Gift that would change his life. Because of his gift he was able to get the girl that he likes to notice him. Although she did not know that Spider-Man and Peter are the same person it still lead Peter to be closer to Marry Jane.<br/><br/>Because of his Uncle Bean's death Peter began to realize the responsibility of being a Super Hero and he became a stronger person.<br/><br/>When he meet ""The Green Goblin"" whom became his arch enemy he then had to find out a way to defeat him and still stay on top as New York's Super Hero.

"oneloveall","7","0","1","29 April 2007"," Superman for todays crowd
","Delivering nearly all the blockbuster potential it held, Spider-Man burst onto the public consciousness in 2002, surpassing even the most generous sales expectation to become one of modern cinemas highest grossing films. Basically a catalyst behind the never ending glut of comic book franchises today, the movie proved to be an extremely agreeable update of essentially the same qualities which made Superman just as endearing in the old days. Borrowing a little heavily from that prototype, as is the original Stan Lee based comic, lies the same geeky alter ego who works at a newspaper while pursuing crime and the girl he loves in secret. Nothing really strays too far from that quintessential superhero lore, but if anything, puts it all in one very entertaining and accessible package for all shapes and sizes to enjoy.<br/><br/>Part of the winning strategy behind this success story was the smart idea of putting veteran gore hound Sam Raimi on the case. Raimi was a fixture with 80's cult horror, providing the wonderfully crazed Evil Dead series amongst other demented fare. Having graduated with flying colors from the clutches of low budget horror, Raimi went on to direct more standard Hollywood fare, but it was the great stroke of casting him as director of this franchise that really made him a household name to middle America. Whoever knew that Raimi would be the right man for the job must have known what they were doing, for there was hardly a hint he would be capable of sustaining this kid-friendly, adult-entertaining film while retaining the integrity of the original comic books which it's based upon, though after a few frames of this easy to swallow comic adventure it becomes clear he was ideal. Raimi walks a fine line between Marvel geekdom and general audience appeasement, crafting a balanced piece of work that should appeal to a surprisingly large and varied demographic.<br/><br/>The action is intense but bloodless, conveying the painful struggles Spider-Man endures facing his enemies, but never making the violence mean spirited so a younger crowd may enjoy as well. The much touted CGI effects still retain a wondrous sense of physicality five years later, articulating the most romanticized superhero homage since the original man of steel whenever the camera takes flight with Peter Parker. Spidey himself could not have been better cast; Tobey Maguire silenced nearly all critics with his powerfully introverted but accessible performance, filling out plenty of shiny sequences with a greater sense of depth then the genre usually provides. J.K. Simmons offers some wonderfully crafted comic relief in a brief supporting role, but Willem Dafoe oversteps a cartoonish boundary when portraying murderous alter-ego Green Goblin.<br/><br/>All in all, a triumphant accomplishment for this team, worthy of the big interest it initially received due to Raimi's winning approach. Spider-Man still suffers from many of your typical Hollywood clichÃ©s, especially if one still holds the fossilized Superman franchise in high regard, but there seems to be enough passion coming from nearly all involved to take the crown as current champ of superhero productions."

","I never had an interest in seeing Spider-Man. But it came on TBS tonight and there was nothing else on TV so I decided to watch it. And to my surprise I thoroughly enjoyed it. I've never been a fan of comic books but I love the Batman and Superman movies and now I'm a fan of the Spider-Man films! Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker, a shy, nerdy, high school student who is in love with Mary Jane, played by Kirsten Dunst. One day Peter is bitten by a genetically altered spider and instantly gains spider-like powers, such as climbing walls and shooting webs out of his hands. Once he becomes Spider-Man, the name the townspeople gave him after he rescues them from fires and robberies, he has to battle the Green Goblin, aka Norman Osborn, played with creepy perfection by Willem Dafoe. Norman becomes the Green Goblin after being fired from his job and taking revenge against his employees. Norman's son Harry, played by James Franco, is one of Peter's closest friends and competes against Peter for the affection of Mary Jane.<br/><br/>The best parts of the film is when Spider-Man and the Green Goblin are battling one another. They are wonderfully choreographed and edited. One of the best battle scenes is right towards the end. Willem Dafoe was great as the Green Goblin. No one could have played him better. He just has that creepy look to him and how he even used a different voice when he was becoming the Green Goblin was effectively eerie. Tobey Maguire was good as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Even though he is a little too boyish looking for me he still had that unique charm about him that made you love Peter Parker. He was sweet and made you wonder why Mary Jane would never give him the time of day! I know a lot of people didn't like him as Spider-Man but I did! Kirsten Dunst was also good as Mary Jane. To me she seemed to play all the other characters she plays in her other films but I liked her. She was sweet. And James Franco was sweet and charming as Harry Osborn.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is a great comic book based movie and I really enjoyed it. I'm glad I actually sat down and watched it. The action scenes were spectacular, the costumes were cool, and all the characters were lovable. This is a great movie. Thanks for reading my review!"

I liked the changes Sam Raimi made from the source material, especially the organic web shooters.<br/><br/>The origins of Spider-Man and his nemesis the Green Goblin are also very well told. I especially love how the origins parallel one another. I also enjoyed the Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde complexity they gave Norman and the Goblin.<br/><br/>The cast is absolutely brilliant. I totally believed Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker and Spider-Man. I could definitely tell Willem Dafoe was enjoying himself playing Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin. Kirsten Dunst was perfect to play Mary Jane Watson. Cliff Robertson was so good as Uncle Ben, that I nearly cried when he was gone. I could go on...<br/><br/>Danny Elfman's score does it all: It's full of action, adventure, romance, mystery and angst. I especially love the creepy quality of the Green Goblin's theme. It definitely felt like Elfman was sneaking in some of his love of Bernard Herrman into the picture. Not that there's anything wrong with that, mind you.<br/><br/>The visual effects were absolutely fantastic for the time that this film came out. That final swing at the end really made me feel elated, yet I was also filled with a sense of wonder as to what they'd do in a second film.

He calls himself Spider-man and he fights crime all over New York City. Unfortuanatelty there is a new villain in the city. It is Peter's friend's dad. He becomes evil after an experiment.

After that, Harry, which is the name of his friend, think that Spider-man killed him and he develops a grudge against Spider-man.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very well-done superhero movie. In fact, it is probably the bets superhero movie. It is also very fun to watch anytime, anywhere. Also, I think the actors did a wonderful job portraying the characters in the comic books, or at least I think they did.

The story of how Peter got his powers and his family life were perfect. The loving home and a very well cast Uncle Ben and Aunt May was superb. Even Flash Thompson was brilliant! The one thing that makes a superhero movie is not just a believable hero, but a believable bad guy. Willem Dafoe was horribly cast as Norman Osbourne. The guy is wimpy, small and just not frightening. Norman in the cartoons is tall, well built and super intelligent, married with the fact that the serum makes him mad makes him a very interesting character. All this nonsense of 'voices' talking to Norman was never in the original story. Speaking of original stories, where was Gwen Stacy? I believe she's in the third. Next complaint, Mary Jane. Kirsten Dunst did not suit the part. Mary Jane is supposed to be a strikingly beautiful supermodel and actress. Kirsten is neither..... All in all a disappointment but the second was superb!"

","I have to say that this used to be one of my favourite movies of all time.<br/><br/>Some may have criticized it for being too slow in starting but its the opening scenes which really help the audience build an emotional link with Peter Parker (played to perfection by the excellent Tobey Maguire) and help us feel his feelings- you kind of began to get a crush on MJ yourself.<br/><br/>After the poignant and funny opening the film presents us with some thrilling and intense action scenes, such as Peter chasing down the carjacker- we genuinely feel the elation he feels when first webslinging.<br/><br/>Best of all the movie proceeds at a great pace and is never boring. Also worth mentioning is Willem Dafoe who suits the role of Norman Osborne down to a ""T"", his performance is sublime, particularly in the scene which he talks to himself in the mirror- incidentally they filmed this scene all in one take.<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing more than once. PS I also want to say, how can IMDb users say that Spiderman 2 is better than this one?! It's clearly not. While 2 has more glamorous action scenes this one has far more emotional depth and far stronger performances (by the way i'm not saying the 2nd one was bad,just that the first was better)"

","Finally, a super hero movie that I can sink my teeth into. Not since Christopher Reeve's ""Superman"" movie have I been so amazed at what modern technology can achieve on the big screen. As a child I loved comic books, and without a doubt my favorite character was ""Spiderman"". This movie seems to bring to life the hero that I wished I could be growing up in a small town. The only reason I don't give ""Spiderman"" a 10 is that the Green Goblin's costume was overdone. Willem Dafoe looks more like the goblin without the mask. His character would have been more believable if his mouth could move. They should have just painted him green and used prosthetics to enlarge his ears. Aside from that, the story of Peter Parker becoming the ""Spiderman"" is just like I remembered it in the comic books. This made the movie that much more enjoyable. Also, Tobie Maguire cast as Spiderman rivals Christopher Reeve's turn as Superman. I just hope that if the Goblin resurfaces (and he probably will - being Spiderman's arch nemesis) in any upcoming Spiderman movies, they change the costume to look more realistic."

","I have to say I really do love watching this movie. It is completely entertaining, and is worth watching. But i think that Spiderman does have some major flaws. For instance, I think Kirsten Dundst is HORRIBLE, not . just as Mary Jane, but in general. She is an OK actress, but she always looks like she is either falling asleep, or completely possessed. And i don't think she knows the meaning of posture. I think if opened her eyes stood up straight, takes some more technique based acting, she would be just wonderful. Too bad though.<br/><br/>Tobey Macguire is fine, he doesn't seem as strong minded as i thought he was, more of a superman. Also his faces when he is running over buildings just really make the movie amazing because they are so melodramatic and over the top its hilarious.<br/><br/>I of course love James Franco, but i think his character was a little pointless, i know they needed to lead up to him hating Spiderman and such, but he seemed just so weak and sallow most of the time, instead of this strong school boy.<br/><br/>The scripting some times was a little ... cheesy. Especially some of the goblin's lines, not that i don't think Willem Dafoe is a great actor, I think he had to work very hard to make his character not a Power Ranger.<br/><br/>I am very glad that they did do some back ground, though there was a little much. I personally did not know the back ground story of Spiderman, though i know many people do, i thought it was interesting to know. I just thought he was Spiderman because he was, not so much of the spider biting and his uncle and stuff.<br/><br/>Also the CGI sometimes is great and sometimes is HORIFIC! As i watch the movie i get very confused because i think i am watching a cartoon. But it does make you laugh and i like to laugh so it is a bitter sweet goof.<br/><br/>But through all this, the movie is entertaining and i like to watch it. And i am very excited for Spiderman 3."

","The first time I saw the trailer for this film at the theater was amazing. Now the trailer I am talking is the one that was banned because it had the twin towers in it, where this helicopter gets stuck in this giant web in between the buildings. This was before the 9/11 attacks. Everyone was amazed and awed at the fact that a studio was making a film about Spider-Man. I on the other hand, when I came upon the giant web I started to believe that the movie was going to be about giant spiders in New York City. Then when Spider-Man came on, it was a whole different story. I did not know who this person was. I had never heard the name ""Spider-Man"". But when it was finally released and I went to see it, Spider-Man was the most amazing movie I had ever seen! It was breath-taking! I couldn't stop talking about Spider-Man and now it that has come back to bite me in the butt several times. Now everyone I know stereotypes me as a comic lover and a superhero fanatic. I don't even know an local comic stores where I can buy these things. And I tell people that but they keep on staying with their beliefs. But over Spider-Man is a great film and if you haven't seen it, go now and rent it or buy it, I don't care how just watch it!"

","To say I had been anticipating this movie would be a severe understatement. Since may days in elementary school I had day dreamed of a live-action Spider-man movie. One would think that a product of Hollywood would have no chance of living up to such lofty hopes but this does. The special effects are perfect. The plot is original enough to remain interesting but doesn't throw the ideas from its comic book origins out the window. Every character and every relationship is exactly as it should be. Even what some would consider background characters like Jameson are like they stepped directly from the pages of the comic. It's also very well acted. I actually start to tear up when Uncle Ben dies sometimes when i watch it now. I don't know what else to say except I love this movie and it is a true benchmark for movies of its kind."

I know Spidey like the back of my hand. The film and it's sequel and that ones sequel are true to the comics. Best acting since Christopher Reeve, Margot Kidder, and Gene Hackman in the Superman Movies. Tobey Maguire brought Peter Parker and Spider-Man to life (ignore the CG.) He was hysterically funny, straight out of the comics. Kirsten Dunst (my favorite actress) brought my favorite character Mary Jane Watson to the big screen with a bang! She was the perfect actress for that role. She portrayed MJ straight from the comics. Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborn and the Green Goblin was sweeet! He pulled off Norman and the Goblins evil so stinking well, better than Kevin Spacey in Superman Returns. Willem stands proudly next to Gene Hackman (Lex Luthor in Christopher Reeve's Superman Movies.) I would give Tobey, Kirsten, and Willem all grammys and take them out to dinner. It is a must see! Spider-Man 3 will be out on May 4, 2007! Bryce Dallas Howard is going to be playing Peter's second girlfriend Gwen Stacy, his first in the originals was Betty Brant.

","What makes this movie special is the personal touch. There is no big ""let's destroy the world"" plot, it's just a grudge match between two polar opposites with superpowers. Willem Dafoe gives a brilliant and creepy performance as the Green Goblin, really the best villain in the Spiderman comics, and Tobey Macguire knocks it out of the ball park, pardon the pun, with his performance as Peter Parker. Really, this movie isn't about solving some global crisis, like in Singer's X-Men flicks, but is about simply doing the right thing. That's what gives this movie such a great feeling. People don't really remember the springy high-flying fun of the webslinging so much as the personal story. And, one especially interesting aspect of this film is the almost invisible direction and cinematography. Sam Raemi has an invisible direction style that makes everything seem more real as opposed to staged. The cinematography never calls attention to itself so you're never left feeling detached from the story or characters. It, Spiderman, is an impressive and singularly brilliant achievement."

","After James Cameron was rejected for Spider-Man, everything with Spider-Man seemed a bit quiet. Sam Raimi revived him.<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire stars as our hero, Kirsten Dunst as his love, and Willem Dafoe as his nemesis...the Green Goblin. David Koepp, a writer of thrillers, penned the script and did a good job.<br/><br/>Peter Parker is a student struggling with friends, when he is suddenly bitten by a radioactive spider. He begins to change, and then his life changes when his uncle is murdered. He then dedicates his life to fighting crime. But is Spider-Man any good? It certainly is. Spider-Man does not have the average feel most superhero films have. Most superhero films, like X-Men and Superman, do not show any sign that this stuff can happen in real life. Although we all know that Spider-Man cannot exist in real life, you still feel the possibility of him truly existing. The film is mild-mannered, with the perfect balance of lighter scenes and darker scenes. The actors are outstanding and you can feel an emotional pull in you during some of the sadder scenes. The film's photography also has what I call a very ""70's feel"", so it doesn't look very modern but it doesn't look old either. While the film does great on all of this, it has a couple of flaws.<br/><br/>Spider-Man includes some scenes that seem rather pointless or just randomly put-together, such as when the Green Goblin attacks J. Jonah Jameson, or whenever Green Goblin talks to his alter ego in the mirror. The second fight between Spidey and GG occurs so quickly and randomly, but it does foreshadow the third fight on the Queensboro Bridge. The fight on the Queensboro Bridge is the best Spider-Man fight scene, with the train fight in the sequel in second. It is my second favorite superhero scene ever, only beat by a scene in Batman Begins where the Scarecrow sets Batman ablaze. Those randomly put-together scenes don't fit comfotably in the rest of the film, and they take away from a great movie on the verge of sinking to being good, leaving the movie somewhere between good and great.<br/><br/>Other than that, the film is just such a classic not even I can believe a film could be so well-done. It is the start of a great series, one that does not disappoint! 7.5/10"

I was expecting just another fun silly summer movie. I'm pleased that I got far more than I expected.<br/><br/>The action scenes and the fights with the Green Goblin were, for me, the least interesting parts of the movie. The most interesting parts were when the characters were just talking to each other, and the emotional drama that came from these scenes. During the final conflict, I found myself wanting more such scenes as opposed to more action sequences. Don't get me wrong; the action scenes in Spiderman are fantastic. They're just not as interesting as the drama of the characters' inner lives. Much of the time in these movies, such scenes are often just bridges in between action scenes.

","This is obviously one of the most influential films of the 2000's, because of the impact 'Spider-Man' had on the nation. This film was the first true blockbuster to come out since 9/11, and this film gave the country something to hold on to, even though he doesn't exist: a hero. Spider-Man means something to the American public more than any of the heroes, because the film makes him out to be just like us: human. He is just a human being fighting for the good of mankind, saving people left and right, not to mention risking his life all the time. The USA public attached so much to this character and this film after 9/11, and I think that is one reason why it has the second largest opening of all time. Tobey Maguire is brilliant as Spider-Man AND Peter Parker. There are actors that can play Spidey. There are actors that can play Peter. Maguire is the only one who can do BOTH. He provides the most likable character in the entire superhero realm with a great touch of dedication to the role. I'm indifferent on Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, as she could be better, and there's moments where she can get annoying. She does have her moments though, especially in the end of this film and its sequels. The villain of the film is Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin, who is utterly creepy and scary in every sense of the word. He gives a truly chilling and classic performance. The visual effects are not as good as one would hope, as you can clearly see when voiceovers and computers are used to get the desired effect, but this is a non issue. Spider-Man remains one of my all time favorite movies, through and through. An explanation of the plot is not necessary, but a short synopsis would be this: Nerdy Peter Parker gets bit by a genetically altered spider, giving him amazing powers mirroring those of the arachnid, and he becomes the web-slinging vigilante known as Spider-Man. It's great film that the whole family can enjoy, no doubt. There are some scary moments, but no use of foul language, so I'd say the film is appropriate for kids ages 10 and up. I really love this film and its sequel, and I know I'll love the three-quel.<br/><br/>9/10 --spy"

","Spider-Man is so far my biggest disappointment when it comes to super-hero movies.<br/><br/>Okay, the film had great action-scenes, special-effects and fairly good humour. Problem is that the whole film seemed too distanced from the original comic-book. I didn't mind Spider-Man's web being organic, what I had wanted was to actually hear Peter's internal monologue, similarly to the 90s Spider-Man cartoon and the original comics. It could have provided so much insight and second narrative type energy to the film. As is, it feels like the film-makers exiled me from Parker's mind.<br/><br/>Another problem was the villain. Okay, it's true that Spider-Man doesn't exactly have the best villains-galore around, but the film-maker's attempt to actually make the Green Goblin cool just felt like a wasted effort. I just don't find the Green Goblin to be a particularly interesting villain.<br/><br/>As such I really felt that this movie did not succeed in bringing the comic to the big screen, and I am only going to see another Spider-Man flick once they give me what I really want, which is Venom."
"theshadow908","8","0","1","13 July 2006"," Not since Superman has a comic book film had this much impact.
","Spider-Man, based off the Marvel comic book, tells the story of geeky high school student Peter Parker, who is bitten by a genetically altered spider, and wakes up the next morning with amazing new powers. At first he attempts to use these powers for personal gain. When a wrestling promoter screws him over, he lets a criminal rob him. Later, his Uncle Ben is shot and killed by the same man. He realizes that he can't let that happen to anybody ever again, so he becomes Spider-Man. Not long after, his first big threat arrives, the maniacal Green Goblin, who, unbeknownst to Peter, is the scientist father of his best friend.<br/><br/>The reason Spider-Man was such a big hit is because it had the same epic potential as Superman. The fan base was huge to begin with, so hype for the movie was unequaled by anything else. The reason I liked it so much was because it followed a perfect superhero movie formula. Adequate time was spent on all the aspects of the story. The origin, the honing of his special powers, a few fights with petty criminals, the first fight with the villain, a small confrontation in between, and the final climatic battle. In between all of this is the personal drama. Sam Raimi was able to successfully tie all that in and make it work in the 2 hour time frame. He was able to show how Peter Parker's life changes when he becomes Spider-Man.<br/><br/>Raimi set the world of Spider-Man in a realistic world. A lot of people didn't like the Green Goblin in this movie, stating he looked like a Power Rangers villain. I disagree. Norman Osborn created an armoured flight suit for soldiers to wear, so the armoured green suit was perfectly fine with me. Spider-Man is, in my books, the most accurate comic book movie out there, besides Sin City at least. Another thing some fans missed was Spider-Man's trademark wisecracks toward his enemies. While this is a part of his character, I thought it made him more serious. I mean, who can really think up that much stuff to say while deep in battle. Also, the situation isn't that funny, so why make jokes? What disappointed me most about the movie was the campy dialogue in some scenes. Some of the lines that come out of characters' mouths in this movie are way too cheesy. Also, the CGI is really underdeveloped. Other than that, this movie has nothing wrong with it.<br/><br/>The acting is really good. I hated the idea of Tobey Maguire playing Spider-Man until I saw the movie. Now there's no one else. He really shocked me with how well he played the role. I didn't know he could be tough when he wanted to! Willem Dafoe is great as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. He plays the perfect bad guy, and plays a great nut case too.<br/><br/>Overall, Spider-Man is a great comic book film, and if the dialogue was 100% cool throughout the movie and the CGI was flawless, it would get a 10 out of me. I recommend this movie to anyone that was ever remotely a fan of Spider-Man.<br/><br/>8/10"
"BCantor89","Null","0","1","29 June 2006"," Astonishing but has some minor errors
","Spiderman was a great flick that would appeal to most people and most ages. It was fun original and stayed almost as closely accurate to a comic then most superhero movies do. The film had enormous hype and it lived up to most of it's expectations. Their were however a few things that ticked me off. I for one am a huge fan of spiderman and I remember very well the comics I have read. The whole movie I was waiting for spidey to say ""my spidey sense is tingling"". That didn't happen kind of a bummer but not a big deal. The second thing that ticked me off is they didn't use his spidey sense to the full potential. Example- Spidey is fighting Goblin> Spidey shouts something at Jonah Jameson> Goblin puts out spidey in a matter of seconds with some kind of drug that makes him Drowsy. For one Spiderman's spider sense is supposibly able to detect anything minutes or even hours before it happens that's the whole point of his spidey sense. Anyways besides those 2 things the movie is great Tobey Maguire is Peter Parker, know one could have played him better. His acting was phenomenal as it is always. Will Dafoe was also great as The Green Goblin and the dialog, script, and special effects were fantastic. Spiderman deserves a 9/10 for being a truly great superhero and staying as true to the comic as most of these superhero movies do. Despite my few problems with the flick I really enjoyed the movie and I suggest everyone to see it."

","When young social outcast peter parker is bitten by a genetically modified spider he gains incredible powers that allow him to climb walls, shoot web from his wrist and jump huge distances. At the same time, noted scientist Norman Osborn uses a human genome system modifier on himself and ends up with incredible strength and a very large dose of insanity. The way that these two men use their powers is the crux of the story as parker becomes crime fighter Spiderman and Osborn steals a secret military designed suit of armour and advanced glider and begins a trail of destruction throughout New York as villain the Green Goblin.<br/><br/>Spiderman is probably the most lightweight of the comic book films we have seen so far, in that it is not dark and has an abundance of primary colours. It is firmly marketable as a touching and character building film, and has little sense of danger for any of its protagonists. Director Sam Raimi, best known for directing episodes of cult hit Xena: warrior princess has delivered a standard formula superhero flick in the vein of Superman. He has made the film as accessible to a mainstream audience as possible, with no blood or gore, flashy violence and only two deaths (one off screen). As such, for those wanting to see Spiderman in pain or distraught, they will have to watch Spiderman 2.<br/><br/>At school, parker is an outcast with only one real friend (Harry Osborn, son of the Green Goblin) and has a long time secret love for fellow student Mary Jane Watson (played easily by the beautiful and talented Kirsten Dunst). Parker has never told anyone about his love for Watson, but it is painfully clear to Harry and his aunt and uncle. His Aunt is Aunt May, played gently and softly by Rosemary Harris who is easily able to show Mays courage and strength when peters uncle is killed. His uncle, Uncle Ben, is portrayed equally well by Cliff Robertson who shines in the few scenes that he has.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the main four characters are all good in their own specific ways. Tobey Maguire, who looks very boyish despite being around 26 years old, is perfect as your local nerd with the heart of gold. He is quiet and insecure until the powers he inherits give him much more confidence. Dunst is able to play a teenage girl any day of the week, and she expertly shows Watsons growing affection to parker. James Franco, at first naive, grows as the film progresses and when his father dies at the hands of Spiderman he swears vengeance.<br/><br/>That of course brings us to Norman Osborn/the green goblin. Willem Dafoe is charged with bringing the goblin to life, and without doubt provides a weak link. Talented as he is when simply playing Osborn, he slips into panto villain mode when he becomes the goblin. He isn't helped by the mask he is forced to wear, which looks like a reject from an episode of the power rangers.<br/><br/>On the supporting cast is JK Simmons as J Jonah Jameson, head of the daily bugle (where peter gains a job as a photographer after taking pictures of himself as Spiderman and giving them to Jameson, who puts them in his paper). Jameson is exactly the same as he is in the comics, hating Spiderman to such an extent that he uses the Bugle to turn the city against Spiderman.<br/><br/>Effects wise, we have some great scenes of Spidey swinging through the big apple (with the best saved till last) but we have the occasional dodgy shot (Spiderman using giant inflatable balloons as trampolines in one of the action scenes) but the effects are adequate enough. Danny Elfmans score is great (with the opening signature tune stunning) and the sound effects such as the sound of the web coming out of peters wrist are done well.<br/><br/>On the whole, everything is done with great care, but no real verve. Its a suitable film for all and has great performances from ninety nine percent of its cast. It doesn't push any boundaries or try to delve too much into the darker aspects of superhero life, but as family entertainment and a great story it succeeds admirably.<br/><br/>A good film but beaten by its superior sequel which builds on everything here and makes it better."

","I did like this film, I though it was cleverly made and well done. My problem was with the actors. I thought the casting of Aunt May was superb, she was what I expected of her, as was the green goblin, however, Tobey McGuire and Kirsten Dunst as the leads? I don't think so. I'd always imagined Peter Parker as butch but sweet-centred, McGuire was far too sensitive, however, I do think that he played it well, creating Parker that way, I just feel he was the wrong type for the role. Again, Kirsten Dunst was a strange choice I feel, she portrayed Mary-Jane as very needy and desperate, and on a more personal level, I didn't think she was really pretty enough to play her either. Howver, it was a well done film and worth a watch on a rainy afternoon."

I saw the first SPIDERMAN in theaters when it first came out and I remember just being surprised by how entertaining the whole thing was... and though knowing what comes next does ruin some of the fun, SPIDERMAN is still a really great comic book adaptation.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi's SPIDERMAN tells the story of Peter Parker (played by a perfectly cast Toby Maguire) and his origins as Spiderman. As Parker gets used to his new role as a superhero, he also struggles with his feelings towards his life-time crush Mary-Jane (played by Kirsten Dunst). To complicate matters, New York suddenly finds itself in danger of the Green Goblin (played by a perfectly cast Willem Dafoe) who only Spiderman can fight back.<br/><br/>SPIDERMAN isn't like a typical action/superhero movie. The film certainly takes it's time between action sequences and thrills... and upon reflection the film is rather tame in comparison to other blockbusters when it comes to action. This isn't to say SPIDERMAN lacks excitement however. Actually, it's a good film because it excels so much in it's story driven scenes.<br/><br/>The story they are telling in this movie isn't the most complicated or realistic ever captured on film... but it is filmed with an exuberance and energy unlike many films. It is like a young boy's vision of what a comic-book should be, told with the master-craftsmanship of a skilled director. Instead of choosing to show blood and violence all the time, Raimi creates extended sequences of Peter Parker's sheer joy and excitement discovering he can jump over building and swing throughout New York. Raimi perfectly balances both the dark side and the lighthearted side of this story.<br/><br/>Sometimes a film doesn't have to have an important message or a revelatory story to make it good... it just needs to be told well. SPIDERMAN succeeds at taking it's material and making everything out of it it possibly could. Peter Parker is both an incredibly endearing hero, while the audience also sympathizes with his demons... and I can't wait to watch the follow-up next time I go to the video store.<br/><br/>...

As Peter Parker, Tobey demonstrates the ""science genius"" and the whole ""self-constrained-never-on-time-for-anything"" thing accurately, he just lacks acting capabilities to portray a superhero with such a huge reputation. Actors like Willem Dafoe and Cliff Robertson were needed to keep this movie from flopping. Willem Dafoe was the perfect choice for Spiderman's arch enemy the Green Goblin and couldn't have played the part better. Cliff Robertson was excellent as Ben Parker and even though he was only in it for a short part of the movie, he really allowed audiences to feel apart of the movie and not just watching acting. I'm not saying Spiderman was a bad movie because I liked it overall, but I am saying that it was rushed and it did not live up to the true potential it had."

","While ""Spiderman"" may be the darkest, most morally ambiguous, (and probably the best), superhero movie since ""Batman Returns"" it's hard to shake off the feeling that it is nothing more than a reprise of the Superman franchise rather than something original and out there on it's own. Director Sam Raimi may have given the film the look and feel of a Batman movie, down to the sets and Spiderman's tight-fitting costume but his derring-do, his heroic rescues and his inability to tell the girl he loves who he is, all belong to ""Superman"".<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is a nicely oddball bit of casting as Spiderman. He makes the teenage avenger a more morally ill-at-ease character than an older actor may have done and Kirsten Dunst is a plucky, spirited, if under-written heroine but as the Green Goblin Willem Dafoe doesn't quite cut the mustard even if he does get the best special effects."

The producers of this film obviously wanted to add class to this film and certainly did with such a fancy man. You could actually feel the raw monster rain emotion in his line. I really feel that this man could have made iteven bigger if it wasn't for the fact that he has the muscle tone of a paraplegics legs. I feel that they should of used more of him but oh well.

But real kudos goes to James Franco as Harry Osborn (I look forward to his character being developed in the sequels).

","If you like comic book characters who perform acts of superhuman strength, then this movie is for you. Unfortunately, the movie offers little else which warrants commendation. The story is simplistic and superficial, the characters two-dimensional; the acting, with the exception of Willem Dafoe's, is mediocre; and the special effects contrived. Any story involving a human being becoming transformed into a spider-like creature should evoke a sense of terror and horror over such a change, especially when the human knows what is happening. Yet this movie offers none of that. (Compare Spiderman to the Jeff Goldblum character in ""The Fly"" and you know what I'm referring to.) Instead, the movie remains essentially a comic-book story about a comic-book character. That being the case, why not just read the comic book?"

","The movie seems to be based on Spiderman issues #39 and #40 where Green Goblin captures Peter Parker and reveals to him that he is actually Norman Osborne, Parker's room mate Harry Osbourne's father. Director Sam Raime focused on one of the most intriguing episode of early Spiderman series, and he was right on target with choosing Spiderman's most colorful arch enemy into the first Spiderman movie.<br/><br/>If there was bit of a stretch was Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker and Kirstin Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. Peter Parker is a hard core New Yorker, and Tobey Maguire really didn't look like he's from New York at all, and Mary Jane Watson is supposed to be a real happy go lucky ""Me Generation"" type individual, not a muted Gen X character portrayed by Dunst. Also, role of Liz Allan (Somewhat of a love interest to Peter in high school) and Mary Jane seems to be merged into one character.<br/><br/>Given that Spiderman is not an easy character to bring to the big screen, overall the movie captured the essence of Spiderman pretty well. If they portrayed the people around Peter Parker bit more in detail to bring out the kind of world he lives in the movie would have been even better, but for a first try, it was pretty darn good."

","Spider-man is the best marvel comic superhero and it was time to give the character a decent film, and there can be no complaints. Sam Raimi has made the film about how Peter Parker handles the powers and not about how he uses his powers, which benefits as the other superhero films show how the character uses the powers.<br/><br/>The film shows how Peter Parker becomes Spider-man and how he handles the powers ""with great power comes great responsibility."" After an accident on a school trip Peter Parker is bitten by a genetically altered super-spider this making him Spider-man. His identity must remain a secret otherwise if Spider-man's enemies find out who his loved ones are and if they got hurt, then Peter would never be able to forgive himself.

"Bogmeister","9","0","1","31 July 2005"," The Amazing Heroics of Peter Parker
","It's amazing that now, only 3 years after it first opened, Spider-Man the movie has already reached legendary status. But, it's not really a surprise, because the film utilized all the legendary aspects of the comic book character as presented since 1962. It's also amazing that I'm old enough to have started reading his adventures in the late sixties, when he was a relatively new super-hero. He was already famous by then, however, as the mythical qualities of the hero who sacrifices all his personal comforts for the good of humanity had propelled him to the forefront of modern super-heroics.<br/><br/>This quality is very evident in the film's story thrust. It seems as if the entire world is against Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire). Even when he first dons a mask to enter a wrestling match and no one in the vast audience there knows who he is, they're all shouting for his downfall. Even his uncle (Robertson), one of the only 2 people in the world on his side, seems to turn against him just before he's killed, though that's more a function of Parker's immaturity. Someone in Parker's place could (and should) very easily turn into a major villain with a major chip on his shoulder. One could argue it's easy to become a hero if you have a billion dollars (Batman) or be invulnerable to harm (Superman). Parker has nothing and he bleeds profusely in this film. None of this deters him - he is so focused on his mission, a life mission which has him looking forward to a lonely and painful journey for year after year.<br/><br/>It's also painful to see the unrequited love for Mary Jane (Dunst). MJ in this version is a combination of both the Mary Jane & Gwen Stacy characters of the books. Rightly so, as the flip MJ of the sixties wouldn't have been a good love interest. The bottom line is do we care when the villain drops her to her possible death near the end (an eerie recreation of the most tragic instance in the books). Sure we do; she's the hero's girl, she deserves happiness (she does have a miserable existence, to some extent). All the other characters are well-drawn, as well. Harry (Franco) craves his father's respect; Aunt May (Forsythe) struggles with various pains associated with one's twilight years; even Osborne (Dafoe), who is merely driven insane by an experiment - he twitches in megalomania and is truly creepy. Then there's Jameson (Simmons), transposed faithfully from the 4-color pages - he's a caricature, sure, but that's what happens to someone who wraps himself in his work. They become the work; selling papers - printing ink is in his blood.<br/><br/>Would this film have been as successful if not faithful to the character? I'm not sure, but it's hard to imagine a 2nd weekend of $70 million in that scenario. The filmmakers, director Raimi in particular, stuck to the core of Spider-Man. The one big deviation, his organic webbing, was just another intelligent decision (a high school kid developing a product beyond all the high tech companies? uh-uh). It even served as a metaphor for Parker's teen-age development. A funny thing about Maguire, too. A few months before the picture opened, I saw his likeness on the poster of another film and I thought immediately - that is Peter Parker!"
"policy134","9","0","1","31 July 2005"," Can you spell box office gold?
","Like so many have mentioned in their comments, to think that Tobey Maguire would be the best choice for a role as a superhero would have been highly unlikely if you judged him solely on his performance in ""Cider House Rules"" or ""Pleasantville"". But let us not forget that Spiderman's alter ego, Peter Parker is somewhat of a nerd and that is something that Maguire really does resemble (not to insult him).<br/><br/>The film itself is a high concept FX extravaganza in the highest form but the story that goes along with it is very compelling. The best scenes are the ones that describes the relationships between the characters, be they between PP and MJ, or between PP and Harry Osborn. It is rare to have a movie that mixes these elements and somehow makes the both work. Superman was quite boring when you didn't see him battle the forces of evil. And speaking of Superman, Peter Parker chooses a similar vocation as Clark Kent, although it is as a photographer, not reporter. That is also somehow connected to Peter Parker's character because before he develops his sense he is more of an observer than a man who interacts with anybody.<br/><br/>As for the villain, (there must be an interesting one to make a superhero movie) Willem Dafoe couldn't have been a better choice. The scenes where he shows his affection for both his son and Peter Parker are in sharp contrast to what he will become and it shows that he can play both sides equally well. However, the scene where he talks to his lord and master is annoyingly silly and that somehow makes the dilemma he faces later on less serious because everything is explained beforehand.<br/><br/>Peter's love interest MJ (played by the luscious Kirsten Dunst) is nothing short of inspired casting. Instead of having some ultra-glamorous movie queen, we have the girl-next-door and she still seems sexy. Peter Parker's decision at the end regarding her was also the one great surprise that many would say is not that great but that I found totally believable.<br/><br/>I haven't seen the second part yet but if rumour is true that it is better than the first one, I can only be glad."

Spiderman was one of such movies that was expected to explode and cause such frustrations how right were we. Especially when in England it was a 12 rated movie meaning nobody under that age could see it (Spiderman was of course the movie that brought around the new 12a certificate which also led to the movie being rerun.) Tobey Maguire is Peter Parker, the school know-it-all who just happens to be in love with his neighbor, Mary-Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) the most popular girl in school. Not all is well, because of his brains he is constantly teased by the jocks and nothing can go his way. When his science class goes to a research center one day he is taken aback by the incredible displays of a genetically modified spider, one that has the unique aspects of a whole host of different spiders and as his whole class marvels at the ten blue and red arachnids Peter notices one is missing. Now as the year book photographer he was to take photos of M-J posing by the spiders when the missing eight legged freak (sorry not too keen on spiders after I found two black widows in my pool whilst my 14 month old daughter was in there) webs down from the ceiling and plants a bite on the hand of the soon to be valedictorian. Many changes begin to take place, Peters body becomes more buff and he no longer needs his glasses add to the fact that somehow he's able to know when something is about to hit him and Parker starts to become very confused but also excited by his new found powers. To say his ideas were to fight crime straight away would be well..a lie. His whole reason for the red and blue suit was to win a wrestling match to make money for a car. When the promoter screws him he decides that the robbery that takes place of the promoters money just seconds later is nothing to do with him. Then it all starts to change, Uncle Ben is killed and suddenly Peter wants to take revenge and use his powers for the good of making sure nobody else is in that position again. Add to the fact that his best friends father also suddenly gets powers and goes insane to become the Green goblin (Willem Dafoe) and you get what by most at least is still described as the best super hero movie around right now.<br/><br/>Of course this movie has already spawned a sequel and probably more to follow, not only that but it has helped forge the release of other superhero movies (Dare Devil, Fantastic Four, Superman Returns and Batman Begins) Whether the trend will remain or not you can see Spiderman staying around for a fair while."

Likewise, I had very little (positive or negative) to say about Kirsten Dunst since her performance in the Tom Cruise vampire flick eons ago, but Dunst does a terrible job as Spidey's love interest.<br/><br/>However, it really is the director's care in nurturing a very solid (and not so cheery) story that makes the film last behind its final frame.

Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a science-geek who doesn't fit in at school, and whose only friend is Harry Osborne (James Franco), the son Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe), a scientist and head-honcho of his own company. On a field trip (to genetics laboratory of all places), Peter is bitten by a spider (a genetically enhanced 'super-spider' no less). Naturally, instead of any negative side-effects, Peter finds he now possesses spider-like powers. Meanwhile, on the evil side of town, Norman Osborne is working on a chemical human performance enhancer. With the threat of his funding being pulled, Norman tests the prototype out himself, and it works perfectly, save for him going rather insane. With a super-hero in town and no super-villains in sight, Norman dubs himself 'the Green Goblin' and runs off to cause some chaos.<br/><br/>Any movie based on a comic is going to have mess around with the facts of the comic, the story, characters, order of events can't stay exactly the same. 'Spider-Man' is no different, but the core is the same. The reason for Peter Parker to be Spider-Man is there, the original moral of 'Spider-Man' is maintained throughout the whole movie - ""with great power comes great responsibility"". It was good to see the message was still there. Don't discredit it either, I can think of various examples where this message can be applied to the real world (American foreign policy, for instance).<br/><br/>The acting is the strongest point movie. Tobey Maguire does the whole geeky Peter / uber-cool Spider-Man thing so well. If I said to Randy Savage, a pro-wrestler and rapper, what Spidey did, I'd probably be killed straight away. Willem Dafoe is great as the insane Green Goblin, ditto Rosemary Harris as Aunt May. Better yet, was J.K. Simmons who seemed to be J. Jonah Jameson to a tee, and Jameson is cool. Speaking of cool, Bruce Campbell has a cameo. It might not be as Ash, but its still the King, baby. Bruce Campbell is awesome. I'm not even talking about the movie anymore, am I? <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the action scenes are the only real down point of the movie. Most of them very heavy on not-so-good CGI effects. I'm probably being a little unfair, as I think nearly all CGI effects are poor. That being said, I still enjoyed Spider-Man's showdown with the Green Goblin. Honestly, 'Spider-Man' never really seemed all that violent to me anyway, so it isn't much of a problem.<br/><br/>Action aside, 'Spider-Man' is still one of the best super-hero movies out there. Worth a look for anyone - 9/10"

","This is definitely a great movie. It has action, romance, and outstanding acting. Tobey Maguire does a great job, and manages to maintain the appearance of a hero, hunk, and nerd all at the same time. (Why couldn't high school boys be like that? LOL!!) Anyway, Kirsten Dunst was beautiful and fit into her role so well. I can definitely see her appearing in other super hero movies. She gives off the same vibe as actresses like the talented Nicole Kidman, and Michelle Pheiffer. I never got into Spiderman comic books growing up, but I loved the movie. It really met my expectations very well, and though many people may disagree with me, there's something about the Spiderman movies that holds my interest even more than the Batman movies. I guess you could say Spiderman is my favorite super hero. Go figure! I don't even like spiders!"

","Even though i am a grown man spider man is one of my favorite movies. I watch it over and over again for it has everything a film could ever want. It has a great cast including the likes of Toby Mcguire, Kirsten Dunst and William Defoe. It also manages to pull off being sad, frightening and wonderful all at the same time. For women who like love stories you will find what you want in a complicated love triangle with Peter Parker aka spiderman in love with his next door neighbour MJ who goes out with his best friend. Another great aspect of the film is the stunning computer graphics. It shows you just where our films really are today. And last but not least it is one of the only ever films to make me shed a tear and in my opinion is the best film ever made."
"noizyme","7","0","1","4 December 2004"," Good portrayal of a classic figure in comic book history
","I found myself reluctant to go to the theater and see this film because of its franchise possibilities and overall questioning of the film-maker's motives on making this film. I think it hit people hard as a hero film for the modern day, post-9/11 crowd who felt that there needs to be a figure who stands for hope and overcoming obstacles. Also Marvel Films needed a comic movie about a classic character to move their ideas forward after stirring endlessly about their idea to do the Fantastic Four film.<br/><br/>I thought that Toby Maguire did a great job as the innocent, boyish Peter Parker whose obstacles were overcome through the (un)fortunate bite of a rare spider (which the film makes seem unbelievable) which allows him to mature both physically and mentally much faster. After a ton of things happen to those he loves throughout the film, he grows up much faster than he ever thought and learns to take on these responsibilities of society to the utmost degree by becoming the hero for the city (which I believe is New York City). When his best friend's father develops a performance-enhancing process that changes him into the much-feared Green Goblin, Maguire's Spiderman has to juggle those that he loves, hates, and is obliged to save from harm in the city.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst played the lovable Mary Jane (too bad Rick James couldn't license his song for the movie...that would've been funny.) She plays the sappy love-interest-role quite sappy indeed, but she's hot enough to get your mind off her acting. Willem Dafoe played a schizo-green goblin whose mind was torn between what was good for himself and what might potentially gain him solace for losing his company and lifestyle forever. Seeing J.K. Simmons as Mr. Jameson, the newspaper boss, was great because he looked like he always had in the comic book. He also respawned the attitude from the old 70's cartoon of spiderman as well.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi did a beautiful job directed this film, with all the twists and turns that Spiderman could achieve with the camera angles and everything. It confuses me how he was picked to be the director of this type of film after making hits like Evil Dead and Darkman, but he did a good job altogether. Danny Elfman's musical score was (and is) always great to hear...spooky and foreboding with a heroic standard sound built around every piece.<br/><br/>I don't like the fact that this character and movie just builds a basis on marketing and getting pop-songs out to the market (as this did with Nickelback's Chad Kroeger's song and Corey Taylor's song ""Bother"" which go success from this movie but was never played in the film). Also I wish they would've kept some of the older qualities to Spiderman and this movie, like keeping the old Green Goblin looking the same...I hate the metallic look. I didn't like the sappiness of the love story, but it was good to see a different take on the same man loving Mary Jane (Spiderman and Peter Parker).<br/><br/>I gave it a 7/10 because it's not a great film that needs to be remembered always, but it does have moments that make you appreciate what work went into it. It took balls to put this out because the industry sometimes gets saturated with these comic-book-to-movie ideas, but this is a classic character who needed his own film at sometime. Batman and Superman were done and overplayed, and now it's Spiderman's turn. If the director, composer, and actors stay the same, they'll have a hit for awhile, I think."
"BaronBl00d","Null","0","2","7 November 2004"," Masterfully Woven
","Sam Raimi does a more than capable job bringing the webbed super hero Spiderman to the screen in this big budget film. Spiderman has it all: great action scenes, decent plot, good, solid acting, a sense of humour, and heart. Young Peter Parker is bitten by a spider...oh, hey, you know the rest. Tobey MacGuire does a very good job bringing Parker's character some dimension as does Kirsten Dunst. Those two have some apparent chemistry. William Dafoe is as always very good as the villain. His Green Goblin is quite menacing. Oscar winner Cliff Roberston gets the oft-repeated tagline that"" with great power comes great responsibility."" Seems hokey, but it worked for me. J.K. Simmons and Rosemary Harris excel as what you think Jonah Jameson and Aunt May should be. Raimi really works his magic with the special effects. He uses just enough live action in the film to not make the film look like nothing more than a CGI film(see the abyss-mal Hulk if you are not sure what I am talking about). The scenes with Spidey flying through the streets throwing one web over another was just mesmerizing to me. Most of all in the film I liked the message it gave. Good can defeat evil. Spidey, Peter Parker, is a young hero with scruples and morals. You rarely see the likes of him on screen today."

As usual, Kirsten's acting was good, but she's been in a lot better films.<br/><br/>The plot line was also very predictable. Of course we all knew the basic 'radioactive' spider plot - but come ON!! The rest of it didn't have to be just as predictable!!!<br/><br/>And I know this is what Spider-man is about - but there was too much action!

","I know that audiences and critics alike loved this film, but it just didn't do it for me. It starts out good enough and has a nice thing going up until Maguire actually starts being Spider-man.<br/><br/>As soon as he gets into those tights, the film plummets. Instead of interesting characters, we get poor CGI (Spider-man looks very much like a cartoon, which doesn't cut it in a live action version), a wafer thin plot, and a villain that's completely wasted. Why put an ugly expressionless mask over such a charismatic face like that of Willem Dafoe? (By the by, it looks like they decided to use the same mask for Dr. Doom in the upcoming Fantastic-Four film.) And the ""you mess with one of us, you mess with all of us"" ending was nothing short of vomit inducing. <br/><br/>In short, a disappointment that doesn't live up to its reputation. [3/10]"
"Boba_Fett1138","7","0","2","30 October 2004"," Great visual style but disappointing movie.
","The movie tries to be more than just a superhero movie. It tries to give the characters and the story more depth and emotions just like in Sam Raimi's other 'superhero' movie ""Darkman"", it didn't impressed me. At least ""Darkman"" still had some fun moments and characters. ""Spider-Man"" is a movie that looks great from the outside but is empty and shallow on the inside.<br/><br/>There is nothing wrong with the casting in this movie. Tobey Maguire is a perfect nerdy Peter Parker and James Franco is equally good as Harry Osborn. The relation between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson is nicely done thanks to the chemistry between Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst. Rosemary Harris and J.K. Simmons are also examples of some good casting.<br/><br/>The villain however is disappointing. Willem Dafoe is a good actor but he is overacting too much in this movie. His shiny Green Goblin costume looks also very laughable, especially his mask that can't move at all, with as a result that he looks like a ""Power Ranger"" villain. Not only his mask looks ""Power Ranger"" like, also some of the action which I also found a disappointing aspect in the movie. The final showdown is also a disappointment and contains one very cheesy scene involving some New Yorkers on a bridge...<br/><br/>Danny Elfman's music stands good on it's own but doesn't really fit the movie since there is no real 'superhero' theme like ""Batman"" or ""Superman"" had.<br/><br/>Still ""Spider-Man"" is kind of a cool movie. Nothing beats seeing Spidey swinging through the streets of New York.

And is from there that Peter decides to fight against the crime in the skin of the Spider -man. The villainous greater of the story is the rich magnate Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) owner of the Osborn Corp. that finishes exactly testing in itself a complicated experiment and finishes if becoming the Green Globin, one them worse enemies it arachnid, who more perhaps supports it is its son Harry Osborn (Willem Dafoe) exactly being rejected for the father.

","After viewing ""Spider-Man 2"", I'd discovered that it was POINTLESS to create the first Spider-Man film. This film has many powerful scenes, the death of Uncle Ben, Spider-Man defeating The Green Goblin, and the final scene when Peter Parker tells Mary Jane that he can't be with her.<br/><br/>THE WEEKEND THAT MADE HISTORY<br/><br/>In the summer of 2002 I watched every trailer of ""Spider-Man"". It was a great summer, women, going to high school, but I was afraid that ""Spider-Man"" would tank, and people would hate it and it would be the most controversial film ever, why was Sam Raimi directing this film, why was Tobey Maguire playing ""Spider-Man"". This didn't make any sense, Tobey Maguire is a dramatic actor, not an action hero. My cousin and I were thinking this film is going to suck, why didn't James Cameron take a chance to make this film, besides he wanted to write and direct ""Spider-Man"" ten years ago. Oh I forgot, he hasn't directed a film in 8 or 7 years, and it still seems that James is still in love with himself, I mean he's achieved everything that he ever wanted to achieve in cinema.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg, now there's a great director, ""The Color Purple"", ""Shindler's list"", what a director, HE'S Achieved EVERYTHING, and changed cinema forever. But there's A.I., that film wasn't a disappointment, but who can trust Spielberg now, he may kill Spider-Man by probably the third film, who knows. Martin Scorsese, well he would probably put gangster's in ""Spider-Man"" and that wouldn't be pretty. My cousin and I were contemplating until we had no choice but to wait and see for ourselves.<br/><br/>114 million dollars<br/><br/>I took my mom to Regal Cinemas, and it was a great day, it reminded me of the day I saw ""Jurrasic Park"", and ""Titanic"", that peaceful silence, I couldn't even speak, I was so nervous that this film would suck. In fact I was begging it to suck, I expected Maguire and Raimi to fail. My mom and I got there three hours before the movie started, the longer we stood there, the more the line got longer and longer, and longer. I saw people that were my age and baby-boomers that had waited for ""Spider-Man"" to come to the big screen. I walked in the movie and I was surprised, I was actually happy to see a film, I hadn't felt that way in years. I sat in my seat, the lights got dimmed and the film began.<br/><br/>After about 2 hours, I realized this was an incredible film, I said that at the time, but after seeing the sequel, ""Spider-Man"" was just an action film, there was no plot, I already knew the story. ""Spider-Man 2"" was a crowning achievement, it will set the new generation of superhero films, and now I'm looking forward to ""Batman Begins"" cause I want to know more about Batman than any other superhero. ""Spider-Man"" made 114 million dollars in three days and it grossed 403 million dollars in its total run. I think the ""Spider-Man"" saga will probably end up like ""Harry Potter"", the darker the saga gets, the less money the saga makes. Roger Ebert's view of this film was false, this was just the tip of the ice berg, it was setting you up for the epic fights in the sequel and the dramatic scenes that have even surpassed ""Superman"", and will change cinema forever. <br/><br/>PS: I was wrong about Tobey Maguire, he's gonna be the best Spider-Man until he reaches age 50.<br/><br/>I give this film ***1/2(out of 4 stars)."

Following the huge public interest in Superman, Batman and the Incredible Hulk to name but a few, it was only natural that the dexterity and agility of Spider-man hit our silver screens. Peter Parker is the average guy-next-door. He isn't the stud or the icon that our heroes often appear to be, rather he is goofy, rather conflicted and shy. The film explores his difficult time as a bookworm at high school. However with a little help from a radioactive spider, he is soon transformed into a marvelous hero. One who soon realizes that with great power comes great responsibility. The first film laid the platform for the ultimate success of the second, however the first is a better film in many aspects."

Before i saw Spider-Man i was surprised (In a good way) of the actor-set. Especielly with J.K Simmons (Also actor as Schillinger in one of my favorite shows, Oz.) as Jameson, Tobey Maguire from The cider house rules and Wonder boys), and, of course - Kirsten Dunst (Remember her from the one year earlier movie Crazy/Beautiful and early years Jumanji).<br/><br/>I've always had an appeal for long movies, and this movie is about 2 hours, (as you probably already know) and i wasn't surprised over the choosing of Villain - Green Goblin. Even tho the connection between Spider-Man the Movie and Spider-Man the Comics is very thin, its still was a great movie, one of the best I've ever seen, actually.<br/><br/>The thing i'm missing in it was the humor that Spider-Man showed in the comics, - Now, i know that increased in Spider-Man 2 - But that's not the point. Where's the jokes? A big minus for that part.<br/><br/>I also read that Tobey didn't even read a glimpse of any Spider-Man comic before, so i'm very, very surprised that he could act Peter Parker without even knowing his style. The 2 of them are the same (in some restrictions, that is.)<br/><br/>Well, That's all i have to say, plus i rated the movie 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>Cheers!"

Look at all movies that have succeeded with few exceptions, and you'll find her there. The girl. This movie had the guts to say it outright. It set you up to expect that it would be a question of whether or not he gets the girl. I guess he did, but then he left her ungotten, if that's a word, and left us hanging.<br/><br/>Maguire started out the nerd without a hope in the world to have his lady love... and through one series of events after another, finds that in reality he could, at least with the mask and spidy suit on. This movie is every true nerd's fantasy turned reality. Toby's cuteness only added to the fun of watching that nerd turn into the super hero. <br/><br/>Okay... forgive me for sounding catty, but for reasons that I don't want to have to explain, Kristen Dunst disappointed me a little in this movie. Not really her, but her role. The girl could have had a bit more personality and she might have seemed a little less clueless or spacy all the time. Sometimes I just wanted to shake her and say, ""Wake up!""<br/><br/>Anyway, I did think it was well worth the time spent, and would love to see it again.

"beatnick49","9","0","1","7 July 2004"," A very good movie
","Not a fan of comic books I find that the movie adaptations are very entertaining (with the exception of The Punisher) and rather than be simple beat'em up flicks with no story and little talent, they are in fact quite the opposite, and this movie is no exception. While the concept of the weak rising to be strong is a very common theme, it makes a welcome change to what could have been a plotless action flick.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie are all likeable. They are quite human for movie characters, they are vulnerable and their appearances conceal their realities, Peter Parker may acquire superhuman strength, but is quite lonely, Mary Jane Watson maybe popular and pretty but comes from a broken home, and the Osborns maybe rich but there is little amity between them. They pursue hard to reach targets with Peter pining after Mary Jane, Mary Jane gets a drab start to her acting career, the Osborns try to understand each other but can't take the initiative, while corporate success for Norman Osborn proves elusive. In a movie it's a good thing to have sympathetic protagonists, and this movie delivers.     <br/><br/>The actors are all well picked, and play their parts well. Tobey Maguire gives a good, sympathetic performance as Peter Parker, who you jusy feel sorry for, and I was happy to see him pound that Flash. Kirsten Dunst gives a good, sympathetic performance as Mary Jane Watson, and is cute too. Willem Dafoe plays Norman Osborn (who is sympathetic at first but then becomes a total jerk-wad) well, he is also very good as Osborns alter ego the Green Goblin, he's not an overblown villain. James Franco is pretty good as well, as Harry Osborn. Rosemary Harris plays a sweet Aunt May, and J.K.Simmons is amusing as Peter's employer.<br/><br/>The scripting is good as well, it's a solid story that doesn't detract from the narrative. It's well directed by Sam Raimi, with the story moving along at a steady pace (helped along by the good cast) with the special effects and action ,which are impressive to watch, complementing the story rather than the other way around. The movie doesn't forget that it is an action movie, yet balances the visuals and character interractions very well; combined with the scripting it proves to be an engaging flick. It also goes at just the right amount of time at two hours and one minute. There's also some funny moments such as Peter trying to release the web, and Harry's end of the conversation with MJ after the fair. I certainly got my money's worth at the cinema, and I have seen it repeatedly on cable, yet have not got bored of it.<br/><br/>In all it proves to be an entertaining, watchable movie.

","""Spider-Man"" is an exceptional superhero movie that's good fun. As far as superhero movies go, it's not as good as ""Batman"" and the first two ""Superman"" films, but it falls right behind them.<br/><br/>""Spider-Man"" is based on the Marvel comic books about nerdy teenager Peter Parker, who gets bitten by a mutated spider and then slowly turns into the crime fighting hero of the title. The movie's special effects run hot and cold throughout, and the story could have used a little tightening. But still there's much to enjoy here. The action scenes are exciting and held my interest. Tobey Maguire is very good as Spider-Man/Peter Parker, and he gets terrific support from a very good cast. Director Sam Raimi has come a long way since directing ""The Evil Dead"", and I think he'll be a major directing force to reckon with in years to come. ""Spider-man 2"" is proof of that.<br/><br/>

","I do admit that i didn't have high expectations when i saw this movie. I have seen a lot of superhero movies and they are never any good. I think Tobey is actually good for the role as Peter Parker. At least when i read that Leonardo DiCaprio at some point was suppose to play that part. The only thing that is good about these sort of movies is when the character get the super powers and you see the change for the first time. After that, it is really downhill. It is a shame to see a class actor like Willem Dafoe playing in this movie, at least when he is wearing a mask that seems to come from Toys 'R' Us. And the fact that Kirsten Dunst plays in this movie is for me enough reason to dislike it. And the ending with the bridge is just well... bad. Really bad. One good thing about this movie is the cameo of Bruce Campbell. Oh and the end credits so there is two things that are good about this movie. I rate this movie 4/10"

","Spider-man was a brilliant movie. Sam Rami (director), being a spider-fan from the beginning helped the franchise superbly. The crossover from comic to film was done in the best way I could have imagined as it introduced the villain on a more emotional level as peter parkers best friends father. The story was well paced and developed well through to the end. The characterisation of comic characters were perfectly portrayed, especially that of J. Jonah Jameson by the wonderfully talented J.K Simmons. One of the best moves I think, contrary to many fans, was the updating and realism they gave to the Green Goblins costume, incorporating Normans military and machine background and collection of tribal masks. Willem Dafoe as the green goblin, I think stole the show and outdone the superbly talented Toby Maguire. The scene where he has a delusional discussion with his alter ego through the mirror is wonderfully portrayed in a psychotic manner and adds to the realism of Dafoe's schizophrenia. I also think the end paved perfectly for the 2nd film leaving Harry a bitter man, and a shadow of his departed father. Spider-man in close league with 'X-men' is definitely the best comic turned film we have seen. With the arrival of spider-man 2 however it will crush 'X-men' to dust!"

It's just a cheap trick to cash in some more dough from the Americans, who were all shocked at the time. Also the line ""Aunt May, aunt May, is that an angel? "" makes me vomit every time I see it.

I just loved the way that Tobey Maguire portrayed the emotionally torn and socially outcast Peter Parker, and Kirsten Dunst the emotionally abused Mary Jane Watson.  They both seemed to bring to life characters that have been read of by readers for years who were finally brought onto the screen.  And then there was the score.  Danny Elfman truly captured the feel of this movie in the writing of the music.  It makes you cry and laugh at the proper times.

","*mild spoiler alert*<br/><br/>Spider-Man lives up to his title: ""The Amazing Spider-Man!"" Spider-Man is one of the best comic-book movies ever made. It is a hyper-kinetic thrill ride. When Spidey zips through the city, it feels like you are flying through the air with him. It has it all, great action, amazing Hong Kong style fights choreographed by Chuck Jeffreys, intense drama, and a wonderful cast! Tobey Maguire delivers a great performance as Peter Parker/Spider Man. He represents the average guy becoming a great hero, which I respect a lot. Spider-Man is a very hard role to play along with many superhero roles, but Maguire played it flawlessly. Willem Defoe was incredible as corporate C.E.O. Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. His performance playing a villain with double personalities was amazing to watch. You could feel his pain trying to get resist the murderous intent of the Goblin. Green Goblin is one the greatest villains it greatly shows in the movie. Kirsten Dunst was beautiful and great as Mary-Jane Watson. Her portrayal of the alluring girl next door was great to watch and she looked incredible in the rain! The most accurate comic book portrayal was John Jonah Jameson played by J.K. Simmons. He played J.J. down to a T, he had it all: the cigar smoking, the ordering around, the cynicism, and the haircut! Sam Rami is one of my favorite directors ever since I saw Army of Darkness. He directed the movie perfectly, the camera angles, the emotion, everything. His trademarks are seen in the movie, such as the ""whip-pan"" camera technique. It was also great to see Bruce Campbell in a cameo role as the ring announcer, funny stuff! My favorite scene is when Peter Parker final stands up to Flash Thompson and beats his with his newly formed spider-powers. Awesome scene and a great moment for all comic-book fans! Great supporting performances by James Franco as Harry Osborn, Rosemary Clooney as Aunt May, and Cliff Robertson as Uncle Ben. The theme song ""Hero"" by Nickleback is a very uplifting and inspiring song. It makes you want to become superhero. Spider-Man is one of my favorite movies and I can't wait to see the sequel!<br/><br/>

Spider-Man is one of my most favorite Marvel Superheroes because of all his web-slinging powers and plus his spider senses. This movie is pretty much the whole story of how the whole Spider-Man legacy started. A guy named Peter Parker (Maguire) is a school photographer and one time when going on a field trip he gets bitten by a new spider species and later he discovers it and gets all these fantastic super powers! Peter Parker then starts becoming Spider-Man and one of the first bad guys he stopped first was the guy who killed his uncle. Harry Osburn's father works for this one company and he later becomes the very first and memorable Spider-Man villain of all time, Green Goblin. The only one thing I thought that didn't seemed right was probably the Green Goblin's costume, it looked like nothing compared to the costume in the comics! The movie reminds me a whole lot of the 1994 Spider-Man cartoon that used to come on Fox Kids.

","Spiderman may go down as the most refreshing movie of the last decade. Refreshing amidst the three Batman debocles as well as countless summer big-budget disgraces.  Attempting not to win the top honors at the Sundance, Spiderman manages to take an icon that is worshipped within a certain domain (those who follow comic books) and lets it flow to anyone who would give it an eye.  Director Raimi sticks soundly enough to the original story not to offend the loyal while at the same time allowing notions of a more popular culture to intervene without blurring the purpose of the film.  The action sequences are superb, computer-aided and not, and while the characters may not be unforgettable, they certainly all work on the same page, which is a true rarity in film today."

","Not bad: Spiderman is one of the best movies produced from Marvel yet! It's packed with intense fights, excitement, great effects, superb actors/actresses and (a little) love. It is definitely better that Hulk, and almost as good as X-men. Some of the characters could have been played by people with more experience, but the rest of the cast succeeded in making this movie into something worth to remember.<br/><br/>
Not good: But! Unfortunatley with all the crap that's around these days, you can easly get bored watching it, because it's clear what will happen: As the good guy (Spiderman/Peter Parker) starts to think that his life is turning into something good, it tilts. The uncle die (Ben Parker) and suddenly a villain comes (Norman Osborn/Green Goblin). The villain makes the good guys life a living hell, he tries to kill him multiple times and he kidnap the girl (Mary Jane ""M.J."" Watson) which the good guy is in love with. And then the good guy takes out the villain, and he gets the girl. But not here. In Spiderman he ""rejects"" the girl because he is afraid that she could get hurt.

Willem Dafoe is a incredible Green Goblin, he is a frightening villain (like Jack Nicholson as the Joker). Kirsten Dunst also is good as MJ (although Mary Jane, in the movie, seems more Gwen Stacy than MJ). And the rest of the principal cast (James Franco, Rosemary Harris, Cliff Robertson and J.K.

","Being a long time fan of the comics, I was very interested when hearing they were creating a Spider-Man film. Though to be honest, my expectations of this film were not very high. My only hope was that the movie would at least respect the comics' origins, continuity, and personalities of Peter and the rest of the characters. I was both impressed and pleasently surprised by how well this was done.<br/><br/>The plot is exciting and dramatic, and doesn't get boring even if you know the story inside and out. Tobey Maguire does an excellent Peter Parker, nailing the role perfectly; from the sharp intellect to the cheesy jokes. I was equally impressed with almost all the other actors. The special effects were beautifully done, and truly succeeded in adding excitement to an already superbly crafted, suspenseful script.<br/><br/>This movie stays true enough to the comics to satisfy even the most devoted fan, while at the same time delivering action, adventure, drama, suspense, and romance, making ""Spider-Man"" an enjoyable experience for all. My only complaints; the mediocre actor who played J. Jonah Jameson failed to portray the character convincingly. I was dissapointed with their interpretation of the character, and even more dissapointed with the flawed, overexaggerated acting used to convey the character.<br/><br/>I also felt that not only was it unneccesary to go against the comics by having Peter's webs naturally produced by him, but that it was detrimental to the character of Peter Parker; as him creating the web-shooters on his own showcased his intelligence and creativity, qualities that the movie could've shown in greater light. I thought the Green Goblin could've been made to look a lot more authentic, I wasn't very impressed with the new, sleek, cheesy metallic-looking Goblin. Also, while the actor who played Norman Osbourne did a great job of acting, once again I think the character could've been captured better.<br/><br/>Though all in all, ""Spider-Man"" makes for a great movie. Far better than most of the garbage being put out nowadays. It's certainly refreshing to see a movie which succeeds in using modern film technology and special effects to tell a superb story. For the most part, excellent acting and screenplay. Though my only dissapointment is this movie could've easily been so much better than it already is, if only a few minor details in the screenplay and choice of actors were altered."

","I have to say for a mainstream blockbuster this was really quite good.<br/><br/>I usually try to avoid mainstream successes, but as a fan of Spiderman since early childhood, I simply had to go see this production. I figured that I would end up dogging it, but in fact, I found it to be a very effective adaptation of Stan Lee's work.<br/><br/>The main (and only real) problem with this movie was the treatment of the villain, the Green Goblin. The make up effects, costume, and CGI were not what I call good. (For a perfect example of CGI at its best, check out the water-horses Arwen calls to save Frodo in ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring."") The action sequences of this work are really rather muddled and messy. The CGI is obvious and was not the effects work of art 2 Oscar nominations (one for best special effects) would indicate.<br/><br/>Other than the arch-villain's being this campy old piece of crap (about as bad, but not quite, as the Scorpion King in ""Mummy Returns""), the rest of the movie was very good.<br/><br/>But does that element alone ruin the feature? In some unimportant way, yes, as by far, it did not live up to its potential. <br/><br/>But in the major way, no. The performances were realistic, believable, and solid; the story was faithful to the original comic book line first written by Stan Lee; and the sets and props were all meticulously detailed and crafted. All in all, still a very good production. The action elements were well placed (if somewhat sloppy), the comedic factors were delivered properly and timed perfectly, and the dramatic methodologies were carefully directed and enacted.<br/><br/>The plot of this story was creatively written, and executed with a fondness, inspired by a thorough character development indicative of a director who loves this comic book legend.<br/><br/>It rates an 8.0/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

","Hugely entertaining from the outset, Spiderman is very much the big screen Marvel equivalent to DC's Superman. Both have  a bright outlook, both films aren't too dark, in the way that Tim Burton and Bryan Singer would do it, while there is a sense of humor along the way that does not border on camp (take note Joel Schumacher). Where Sam Raimi succeeds, in much the same way that Richard Donner, Richard Lester, Tim Burton and Bryan Singer succeeded too, is that while remaining faithful to the source material, he isn't afraid to put a little of his own spin into it, so we get some of the trademarks such as Bruce Campbell and at times some horrifying violence (not to horrifying mind, the film is a 12 certificate), but he retains the charm of the comic book and does a faithful adaptation of the source, especially with regards to the back story of the character, which is where this film works the most. Yes the action sequences are spectacular, but it is the smaller character moments where Raimi really succeeds at, surprising considering he is the film maker behind the Evil Dead films.<br/><br/>The portrayal of Peter's love for Mary Jane is superbly done, further enhanced by Tobey Maguire. Sure he may not look the part of Spiderman, but he is Spiderman. This quirky piece of casting works in much the same way that Micheal Keaton did in the first Batman movie. He may not fully look the part, but playing it can be a different matter. Maguire is superb, particularly when playing out the reason that he becomes Spiderman, in a scene that does not flinch away from the most important part of the back story of the comic book. Likewise Willem Dafoe is wonderfully over the top as the Green Goblin. While not immediately a scene stealer in the way Jack Nicholson was in Batman or Ian McKellen in X Men or even Gene Hackman in Superman, Dafoe is an actor's actor and the excellence of the scenes where his split personality comes to the surface are over the top in a wonderful comic book movie way. As for Kirsten Dunst, how could you not fall in love with her. Talented and beautiful, like Maguire this is perfect casting and Raimi has good ingredients to work with here.<br/><br/>When Parker does become Spiderman the film dips into traditional comic book fare, he saves damsels in distress while the Green Goblin makes his a choice between saving M-J or some kids to which he does both, but nevertheless the film remains constantly entertaining and Raimi isn't afraid to be that little bit brutal with the final confrontation between good guy and bad guy. Even better is that while the ending is open, it doesn't have the the aura of sequel hunting that X Men had. In fact it is more in line with Batman and Superman. Parker will always be around to fight evil and the film's story is resolved.<br/><br/>The film is fantastically entertaining, never bores and is undeniably one of the best comic book adaptations to hit the screen.

","Spider-Man falls into a mix of Batman/Superman style of film.  It wants to be memorable, but it is too shallow.  If any film since 9/11 has bashed the whole ""We are United"" theme too hard into its script, this is it.  I am disappointed in Sam Raimi for this.<br/><br/>David Koep is one of Hollywood's biggest garbage writers, this is just slightly above par for his work.  The main problem is that the movie starts to build up steam, but with nowhere to go.  By the finale, the audience doesn't care what happens, just so long as the movie ends.  Unfortunately, it is obvious that this was made more with financial concerns in mind as opposed to quality film.<br/><br/>Willem Dafoe is a good actor, but his performance is too limited here.  He needs to be more vibrant and expressive to contrast the underacting (and lack of talent) on behalf of Tobey Maguire.  He never changes mood in all his movies.  <br/><br/>Raimi's camera is its usual unhinged self, but this time it isn't as poignant as in Army of Darkness or even Darkman.  Sound suffers big time as everything boils down to either big noises and small noises.  Poor sound design on this movie's part is not a bonus.<br/><br/>Overall, not the best superhero flick ever made.  Sometimes I wonder where they are planning to take the genre with this stuff.  2 out of 5 stars."

","Though spider-man was an excellent movie i have to say there should have been more action and humor. Although this movie is 100% better that crappy 103 million daredevil it totally sucked. Behind Spider-Man is X2 which was totally sweet better than x-men. The hulk which is highly bad to marvel fans the movie made only 132 million domestically i thought it was going to match spider-man's level but i was wrong. X2 was the closest one ever to hit big.The biggest disappointed marvel comic ever was daredevil it only made 103 million domestically and it was totally  boring it had no action and humor like spider-man or X2. I think spider-man 2 will be tremendous and it will make at least 450 million domestically. Though i am waiting for sequels to daredevil X2 and spider-man this movie is the best action-marvel comic adaption ever!!!. I give 10/10 A+. And i also have to say that Tobey Maguire was very good in this movie no one could have done it better than him. Although he looked kind of lazy in some scenes, he was good. I can't wait for Spider-Man 2 and 3. I recommend marvel fans don't go see daredevil do not waste your money on trash like that."

","I loved this movie!  The actors all seemed destined for their roles. Tobey Maguire had the perfect amount of nerdy boyish charm and conflicted hero-in-waiting.  Kirsten Dunst WAS MJ!  (Although some of the 'attitude' she had in the comic series was lacking in the movie; the rest was pure 'MJ').  Willem Dafoe I thought could have been saved for 'Doc Oct' but was not too surprised in the Green Goblin he pulled off.  (I have loved his acting since first seeing him in Platoon). He (as always) showed great range from conflicted father to raging demon.  He, as well as Maguire, Dunst and Robertson were all superb.<br/><br/>The special effects were excellent and added to the story rather than upstaging it as seen in many sci-fi movies these days.<br/><br/>I grew up on 'Spiderman' comics and felt that Sam Raimi and Stan 'The Man' Lee put together a great movie of a classic comic book.

This film's plot--a mix of elements from the comic stories involving Spidey's origin and The Green Goblin kidnaps Gwen Stacey (although here Gwen is replaced by Mary-Jane Watson) epic was I feel just right for the first Spider-Man film. There's loads of action and one can easily get lost in the fun of epic of Spider-Man as easily as if one was reading one of his classic comic book adventures. <br/><br/>However everything in this film is not roses...for one thing, they weren't being anywhere near careful enough about Spider-Man's secret identity as it should be obvious to a good many in this film who Spidey really is (and not just the Green Goblin either) and another the CGI is haphazard...sometimes it looks great, other times it just looks too cartoony and fake.

","****Excellent<br/><br/>***Good<br/><br/>**Fair<br/><br/>*Poor<br/><br/>After years of development, most notably by director James Cameron Spider-Man finally makes it to the big screen. Like it's predecessors Batman and Superman, Spider-Man is released in it's 40th anniversary and with the help of director Sam Raimi and screenwriter David Keopp the film makes a magical leap into the big screen. Raimi successfully takes us into the world of Peter Parker/Spider-Man and makes this a fun, exciting, and loving story. The phrase `With Great Power comes Great Responsibility' is what inspires the film. And we see how much responsibility Peter Parker has by not only saving the city but protecting  his family and love Mary Jane. At the same time battling his best friends father. <br/><br/>The film is magical and captures your imagination but what I found a bit interesting was all the references to Batman and Superman. True that the character of Spider-Man himself is a combination of the two like for instance both Spider-Man and Superman work in a newspaper company: Daily Bugle, Daily Planet. Both Batman and Spider-Man became motivated after the death of a love one and they both fall in love with a cat: Black Cat, Catwoman. Who both happen to be a thief<br/><br/>Some of the references are the attack in the parade. When the Green Goblin blows up the building and Spider-Man has to save Mary Jane who's falling off. Another is when Peter attacks the robber, the way he appears from the shadows is very similar to the opening sequence in Batman.<br/><br/>
Also like Batman and Superman the film is full of great performances by Tobey McGuire, the sexy Kirsten Dunst, and Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin. What I loved about this film is that when I was viewing it I felt like a kid again. Watching the film reminded me of when I was a kid and I would watch the TV shows and read the comics and be fascinated with his adventures and the problems he faces and how he solves them. Like Tim Burton's Batman and Richard Donner's Superman. Sam Raimi successfully puts you in the center of his world and makes you understand who Spider-Man is and what he stands for.<br/><br/>

","Spiderman was far better than what i expected because i was getting a little weary of these super hero movies about a man getting hit upside the head with a radioactive skillet or drinking some milk that just happened to be contaminated with special powers. Tobey Maguire does a good job with providing the Peter Parker character with the innocence and kidness that gives him his great qualities. I enjoyed veteran actor Wilem Defoe as the Green Goblin even though the mask wasn't needed since Defoe already looks like the Goblin. Kirsten Dunst was hot as hell and she got the biggest nipples in the world! But overall Spiderman was a good timeless movie with sublime acting and fight sequences that are mind blowing.

","A few liberties were taken with the origin of the web slinging hero, but a dated character will need a little help making it in today's world. This created a modern day Spider-Man that took block-buster to a whole new level, shattering box office records in it's opening week. Adults and kids alike could finally experience a big screen adventure with Spider-Man. He's a character that's been in comic books for decades. It even crossed gender lines as many girls flocked to the theater, perhaps because of the kookie little love story. Spider-Man's CO-creator Stan Lee had a cameo in the film. The special effects were great and the action was almost nonstop. Don't analyze the movie just enjoy it. Millions of dollars in sales can't be wrong. Lets hope the sequels turn out to be half as good.<br/><br/>
Superman and Batman were products of DC Comics, Marvels biggest competitor. Did anyone notice that only the 1st Superman and 1st Batman films were really big hits and their sequels all were huge disappointments?  Hopefully this curse will not befall the Amazing Spider-Man. Spidey has a few things going for him though. First of all he is Marvel's flagship character and not to take anything away from DC, but Marvel super villains have always been a whole lot cooler. Second advances in special effects can do almost anything today so we can expect to see spidey do a lot of really neat stuff. Finally Tobey McGuire actually looks like Peter Parker making him a perfect fit. Batman suffered changes in 3 lead actors throughout 4 movies which got consistently worse and none resembled Bruce Wayne the man behind the mask.<br/><br/>Spider-Man appears on the screen exactly the way you would expect him to be in the comics. They captured that image perfectly. The liberties I already mentioned, work a lot better in an updated version recreated for the BIG screen. This must be Marvel's decade as we await more super powered action flicks such as, The Incredible Hulk, X-2 and sequels to Spider-Man. Keeping comics cool with movies is a great way to enjoy your favorite childhood super-heroes all over again!"

"khouston86","4","0","1","27 January 2003"," Too long, very little happens
","This movie is way too long--over 2 hours, and it seems very long--for its simple, uneventful plot.  I have read here that the movie deviates from the comic story in major ways.  Some of the things left out--the whole Gwen Stacey thing, for example--might have helped here.  Much of the final half of this movie just feels like empty space.      It is as if the pacing of the movie was determined by James Franco, who is unbelievably irritating and slow in his role here as Peter's best friend. (I realize that he is probably supposed to play a kind of loser, but he didn't have to be that dim-witted, I don't think.)      <br/><br/>   The teenage angst stuff at the beginning worked well.  But the movie was way too long, very little happened, Kirsten Dunst looked unattractive, the Goblin was boring, and the tone was sometimes too flighty.<br/><br/>
****Possible Spoiler**** Because the tone is not sufficiently serious, and the characters are not well-developed (the whole prior dead lover guilt Gwen Stacey thing is left out) and because the movie wears out its welcome, Peter's declaration of non-love to Mary Jane at the end comes off as not only disappointing, but also as cruel, annoying and inexplicable. ***end of spoiler***"

I've loved the comics for years and I even liked the cartoon series. Upon hearing 'Spiderman' was to become a movie, I was thrilled. But seeing the movie made me sick.

Soon after he can shoot webs from his wrists climb walls and he also has spider senses  ( I'm sure we all know what the spider senses are right? ok for example if a bullet is coming for him his spider senses will go off and warn him like that he has time to dodge it) Meanwhile Willem Dafoe ( Norman Osborn) has performed a risky experiment on himself at his lab and turns himself into a crazed maniac( The Green Goblin), with super-human strength, who pretty much only cares about world domination. Soon after Peter's uncle dies and Peter lives by his uncle's words ( With great power comes great responsibility ) and becomes the superhero Spiderman. Now Peter has to defend Manhattan against the evil Green Goblin.<br/><br/>Opinion: Spiderman was the best comic book adaptation in a long time. I loved every minute of it. Sam Raimi did an incredible job at directing this movie, he's gone a long way he was the director that directed the legendary Evil dead series which I have seen many times. Sam Raimi deserved to direct Spiderman and wow did he ever do a good job. Let's move on to the acting. The casting of this movie was phenomenal. Tobey Maguire is a really talented actor, he was put on earth to play Spiderman. He did a great job and I'm glad they chose him to play the web slinging hero. Kristen Dunst I can't complain she did a great job also. Willem Dafoe I loved the most, his acting is just incredible and he is really talented. James Franco who played Harry Osborne did a good job also. Aunt May and Uncle Ben were  also not bad .<br/><br/><br/><br/>Now let's move on to the movie itself. The cgi was cool in this movie. I actually know someone that was complaining that it was too fake, what are they going to do throw someone off a building and make him swing with a rope? Also when Spiderman was fighting the people at the armour truck I heard that was cgi, I didn't even notice. Now one thing I really like about this movie is the opening theme with the Danny Elfman song. Danny Elfman is just incredible I love his music from Nightmare before Christmas to Batman he even did the main theme of The Simpsons. Yes ther was a lot of good things in this movie but there were also some flaws for example The Green Goblin's mask what was going on there. When he spoke his lips didn't move his face was still. Its Star Wars all over again ( Darth Vader). Still Goblin was cool with me, his suit was crazy besides for the talking thing its all good.<br/><br/>Now I've been waiting to get this out of me. For you comic book geeks, you all start crying because the director made little changes from the comic book. Well I liked it a lot better that he did it this way, the only thing he did was make it more believable do you really think a teenage boy could make web that could hold a train cart full of people come on... you know I'm right even though he is nerd ( well he used to be). Its much better that the web comes out of his wrist and its cool.<br/><br/>So over all this movie rocked. Its one of 2002's best movies. Its definitely  worth picking up a copy on VHS or DVD.

They're fantastic, but by 2002 any A-List, Big Opening Weekend movie better nail the cool effects, Hell, even mediocre movies are doing a damn good job at this nowadays.<br/><br/>No, I felt three things set Spider-Man apart. First was the casting. Tobey Maguire was perfect for Peter Parker. Willem Dafoe never climbed over the top with his Norman Osborne aka Green Goblin role. Kirsten Dunst as the love interest, James Franco as the rival, and Cliff Robertson as Parker's grandfather; all excellent choices who deliver the goods.  Second was the dark edge to the story, reminiscent of the two Tim Burton Batman movies. Not everything is perfect in this comic book, good people die, and good deeds are not always rewarded. I like this. And lastly, and related to the dark edge, is the end of the movie. I don't want to spoil anything, but the movie has a very satisfying although not entirely happy ending, which leaves the door wide open for the sequel."
"Spleen","Null","0","1","12 November 2002"," A mostly successful throwback
","At first it looks as though the title sequence lets us know what we're in for: the kind of hyperkinetic visual display you'd expect from a fourteen-year-old boy who'd just been handed a cheap (but nonetheless overpriced) computer animation program and who was determined to use every misbegotten one of its features at once. I thought I was watching the end result of an arms race in which studios vied to combine maximum glossiness with minimum creativity.<br/><br/>Not at all, as it turns out. ""Spider-Man"" is the kind of fantasy we haven't seen since the 1980s: sweet, sincere, straightforward, and thrilling  or at least, if and when it fails to be thrilling, it at least makes an honest attempt.<br/><br/>The movie works even though Raimi gets more wrong than he gets right. The main problem is that there's little real zing. But in addition: the dialogue is often awful, too many characters (the aunt in particular) are under-written, under-described clichés, and the montage Raimi throws at us as Peter Parker comes up with his spider suit design is just too goofy for words. What's more, when we get within fifteen minutes of the end it becomes clear that everyone stopped paying attention to the movie they were making and started thinking about the money to be made from a sequel. I won't say what happens Okay, I WILL say what happens, so stop reading if you must. Peter gives up Mary Jane  fails to tell her identity even though the entire narrative is structured around, is crying out for the moment in which she finds out - for no better reason than to facilitate a sequel. (Thus the most likable character in the film, on whom so much time had been spent, is given nothing to do, no real role to play in the story.) The misunderstanding over the identity of Norman Osborn's killer has been crudely pasted into the film for much the same reason. Is there any reason why Harry had to happen to see Spider-Man standing over his father's body, and then jump to an obviously wrong conclusion? None whatever, but it DOES provide him with a sudden overpowering ""motivation"" which will, alas, result in all manner of tedious plot complications in the sequel, perhaps even  who knows?  the sequel's sequel.<br/><br/>The final image, by the way, is every bit as bad as the opening ones. It just goes to show that nobody has ever made a movie better by including a shot of the American flag, in any context whatever.<br/><br/>But don't forget what I said earlier, about this being a sweet, sincere, simple  and for the most part competent  fantasy. Kirsten Dunst is charming."
"mpofarrell","9","0","1","8 November 2002"," A Superhero With Heart And Soul
","On the surface Sam Raimi's new film adaptation of the 1960's Marvel comic book SPIDER-MAN shares all the ( by now ) familiar elements of your standard , big screen Superhero movie : up-dated surroundings to give the story an identifiable , contemporary look that young audiences can relate to ; a fairly straightforward re-telling of the original source peppered with a few hip ""in-jokes"" to give the movie a ""coolness"" quotient ; and last but not least a dozen or so nifty special effects sequences to make the movie worth the price of admission. SPIDER-MAN possesses all these things but it has that little extra something going for it that places it on a higher pedestal than most of the generic action hero adventures of the past.<br/><br/>As with 1978's SUPERMAN , the new film has a very likable hero who has two distinct personalities : the nerdy , unassuming good guy in ordinary , everyday life and the transformed , nearly invincible righter of wrongs. It also shares with 1989's BATMAN a colorful , creepy nemesis who hangs out in a Gothic-type mansion and battles the hero in a rousing fight -to-the death finale. SUPERMAN benefited from Christopher Reeve's affable portrayal in the title role , while BATMAN boasted Jack Nicholson's scene -stealing turn as the evil Joker.<br/><br/>SPIDER-MAN is blessed with two wonderful actors who infuse the movie with a rare sense of humanity atypical of the genre. Tobey Maguire plays Peter Parker , the introverted Queens high school student who gets bitten by a ""new"" species of spider during a science class field trip. Kind-hearted and sensitive, he is the butt of jokes and an easy target of classroom bullies. He silently pines for the pretty girl next door , who happens to be the love interest of the chief bully. When young Parker is bitten by the runaway spider , he goes through a strange metamorphosis that dramatically alters his life. In the movie's greatest scenes, an expert series of sequences depicting Parker's transformation from intimidated weakling to a force to be reckoned with, director Raimi and his film technicians pull out all the stops. When Parker sits down at his bedroom desk and takes pencil to paper to design a makeshift costume to wear for a wrestling match , the fusion of cinematography , graphics, sound and a mesmerizing music score add up to commercial movie making at its best. The icing on the cake, however , is the unexpected power of Maguire's performance. A veteran of some of the finest American movies of the past several years , including THE ICE STORM and PLEASANTVILLE , Maguire on the surface can seem to be very bland. One of the very few screen actors who doesn't announce his presence with a huge chip on his shoulder, his seemingly placid exterior is deceptive. When Parker suddenly finds a loved one in grave peril , the emotion that Maguire summons up catches the audience off guard. With tears welling in his eyes and a look of stunned grief that in a flash turns to anger, this remarkable young actor raises this action/adventure fantasy to a higher level.<br/><br/>The other standout performance is given by Willem Dafoe as Spider-man's adversary , the enterprising scientist Norman Osborne whose evil incarnation into The Green Goblin dominates much of the second ( and weaker ) half of the picture. Because Dafoe is such a strong actor and a tremendous screen presence, he is able to tide the movie over the more conventional story-telling elements that dominate the film's final hour. Dafoe really doesn't offer anything new here , but he is so adept at personifying evil that this viewer finds him compulsively watchable. He may want to reconsider playing this type of role in the future. With his gargoyle-like countenance Dafoe is a popular choice for off-beat roles, especially villains ; however , he is an actor of brilliant diversity and has played everything from the poet T.S. Eliot to Jesus.<br/><br/>The enormous success of SPIDER-MAN assures a series of sequels in the up-coming years. Maguire has already signed on for the next production , which certainly can't hurt. But lightning rarely strikes twice, and no matter how good or financially lucrative the next movie might be , I doubt it will have the nascent power that makes the present SPIDER-MAN so distinctive."

","So many friends had told me that this `wasn't your average cliched superhero film' that I wondered whether I'd seen the same movie as they had.<br/><br/>Utterly predictable and utterly cliched, this is a film that could have had the visual and emotional impact of Tim Burton's `Batman' films but instead has little more depth than your average half hour cartoon.<br/><br/>It's dreadful to see such a talented cast work with so little. Kirsten Dunst, a fine and feisty actress, cannot help but be dull as Peter Parker's passive love interest Mary Jane. Tobey Maguire (accurately labelled `Tobey Mogadon' by one Australian radio team, for his complete lack of animation) spends most of his time blinking into space as if he just woke up after a nice dream. I found myself wondering if the tears that fell down his face in the sadder scenes were merely another computer effect.<br/><br/>The plot is no help at all, with nary a single surprise the whole way through. The jocks-vs-nerds, nerd-wins-jock's-unobtainable-girlfriend storyline is so, SO very old and predictable that my attention had already lapsed in the first hour, and there was very little in the second hour to encourage it to return. Willem Dafoe's villain, The Green Goblin, is so unfrightening that I expected his climactic final showdown with Spidey might be a game of chequers or Go Fish.<br/><br/>The visuals have a shiny, soul-less quality, perhaps an attempt to convey a heightened `comic book' atmosphere (as was achieved far more successfully in 'Dick Tracy'), but instead having the effect of emotionally distancing the viewer. Some of the CGI effects are substandard, which is inexcusable in a film of this magnitude. And, as is becoming sadly common, the screen is crowded with product placements.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi has proved himself in the past to be anything but a mediocre director, which makes it all the sadder that this film is such a dire disappointment."

","I just bought the Spider Man film and I must say I like it a ot more than when I first saw it. Willem Dafoe`s performance is great and the character he plays ""The Green Goblin"" is an awesome villain! Great voice and everything! It was so neat to see the wrestling match featuring legendary wrestler he Macho Man Randy Savage (Randy Poffo) and Bruce Campbell as the ring announcer.The slow motion and fast paced action scenes are dandy!I did notice a couple errors Though it seemed like it took forever for Mary Jane to find out who Spider-Manwas after Peter Parker said something to her and then Spidey said the same thing and even when M.J. and Spidey were hanging on for dear life near the end Spidey called here M.J.When did she introduce herself to Spidey?Ohwell.I can`t wait for the sequel!"

","This is a good action movie featuring a very popular geek icon, so much like with Lord of the Rings, said geeks are swarming the IMDB to give it 10's up the wazoo.<br/><br/>It IS a good movie but people seem to be ignoring all the flaws that bring it down from the ""great"" status because it's a movie remake of a part of their childhood that doesn't suck. I'll balance that out with a quick summary of the bad things:<br/><br/>The special effects are in all-too-obvious CG. In most movies this is pretty hard to notice, but here the action is entirely in CG, so it's very obvious in the way Spiderman is animated. In one scene he has the normal, human running animation, then in the next he has that videogame-looking animation, and then in another scene his costume is a different colour depth and lighting. It detracts from the movie.<br/><br/>Then, there's the acting. I thought the only stand-outs were the ones playing Green Goblin and Jameson the newspaper editor (probably because they're interesting characters). McGuire as Spiderman does a decent job, but when he talks as Spiderman he still talks like a geek, it feels out of character. Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane is probably the lowest point of the movie, she constantly has that annoying, goofy smile on her face that just makes you want to reach into that TV screen, pull her out with one hand, and slap her as hard as you can with the other. <br/><br/>Finally, when it's not a plot-advancing scene, the dialogue is usually uninteresting. It's a good movie, just don't be fooled by the high score and expect something great.<br/><br/>(For my own personal curiosity, could someone reading this and about to write a comment of their own tell me if Peter Parker is supposed to be an 18yo? I've never read the comics, but I always assumed he was a twenty-something at least.)"

","What a disaster, this movie! Is it just not possible to give priority to a good story and not an overkill of special effects? Two hours of wrong acting, a very thin story-line, bad comic-research (oh god, the webshooter...) and a real drag of a romance, we were already looking on our watch halfway the movie.<br/><br/>Indeed the movie is better then the eighties-version, but no wonder with computer effects nowadays. Still we missed the charm that makes Spiderman nearly the best superhero on my list. Together with Thing from the Fantastic Four, Spiderman makes the funniest and sarcastically remarks in comics. In the movie they totally overlooked this strength during the fights, pity.<br/><br/>
To give just one positive remark; the webslinging in NY were great. To bad you see it not more frequently in the movie.<br/><br/>We were very interested what kind of replacement was put into the movie after the Twin Tower incident but we could only detect the Stars and stripes-flag on the Empire State at the end of the movie, that's it? The movie was now again haunted with bad luck because the US Army didn't want to do bussiness with the Oscorp-company of the Green Goblin but instead did business with...Qwest! Bad choice after that fraud.<br/><br/>Hopefully the directors of future superhero-movies have more heart for the comic itself. The Batman-movies didn't reflect the real Dark Knight character also.

","Who find this to be the most painful moviegoing experience in recent memory? I don't think I found one redeeming piece of filmmaking in this overproduced piece of garbage and it was just torturous to watch. Do I have to be a Spider-man fan to get what all the buzz is about? I doubt it because I had only seen the hackney, corny 60s Batman before the movie came out and that was a great piece of work.<br/><br/>Comnparisons to Batman aside this movie cannot stand alone on its own two feet. This film is two-hours of anti-climax without an interesting or even developed character in the lot of them. While Tobey McGuire is a decent actor he's always had a boring screen persona, in fact, I couldn't find a vibrant personality in this film to liven it up. <br/><br/>David Koepp, who has written or co-written some exciting films such as Jurassic Park and Panic Room couldn't have come up with a more boring and I'm guessing faithful storyline. There wasn't anything to punch it up or make it more lively. Of course, a slow paced story can be made more interesting and Sam Raimi is also largely to blame even though he's made some great movies in the past this most certainly is not one of them.<br/><br/>Even if the story was designed with cliches in the comic book couldn't they have been avoided? I won't even go into them but they're all over the place. Willem DeFoe is also boring and the fights are lame and contrived and there wasn't an original or even a clever move in any of them. It goes without saying the special effects were awful and they go hand in hand with the trite motionless storyline. I don't think I've seen a worse studio film in six years. I didn't have to stand in line to see this one and I sure as hell won't be standing in line to see the next one."

By the end I was running to the exit and felt like I spent a week in that seat. <br/><br/>Tobey is great, Kirsten is great, James Franco will be great..just not here. The screenplay is horrendous - all the actors have impossible dialogue to negotiate. Several of the set-ups are ridiculous - Peter Parker at the wrestling match was the height of stupidity; Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe, in a performance which tops his embarrassment called ""Body of Evidence"") is a stupid character at best and his Green Goblin was worse; and the romance between Peter and Mary Jane lacked everything you need in order to believe these two actors are really in love.  There are dozens more..<br/><br/>Cliff Robertson gets a break by being dispensed with early on.  Rosemary Harris has the best line in the whole movie when she says to Peter, ""You're not Superman"".  J.K. Simmons breathes some life into the movie as a manic, hair-dyed version of Perry White, but then he goes overboard needlessly. <br/><br/>
I am so sorry that this was an ordeal for me.  I wanted to like it but there's not a chance in the world that's going to happen.  There is also not a chance in the world I will see the sequel, which already has a new villian in place in Harry Osborn (Franco) but will do it all with one less audience member - me.  3/10. <br/><br/>PS  Trivia fans - Dafoe and Harris were in ""Tom & Viv"" together; at least they had that decent screen pairing on their resumes.."

","Review: This movie was in fact on my list of wanted to see movies of 2002, and after just seeing it, it lives up to all expectations and probably more. Although there are some week lines and slow points in the movie, it flows still very smoothly. Going into to the movie with the same expectations and knowledge about the characters as I did with X-Men I was again impressed. Toby McGuire was an excellent choice for the role of Peter Parker, of course there we some doubts coming from the comic book fans, I'm sure those doubts were laid to rest 5 minutes into the film. We have all seen this type of film before when the main character is having fun with discovering their new powers, but this seemed to work once again. I am quite sceptical of the numerous other comic book adaptations in the pipeline seeming a lot of them have the same `discovery' feature of the main plot. Anyway to the film.<br/><br/>The location being New York, which film goers have seen many many times, was filmed in a different light to normal for eye candy reasons. New York, for a change seemed to be very colourful, and not the dull browns and greys normally associated with the city. This added an extra element to this exciting superhero film. <br/><br/>Special effects wise this film has its high and low points, smoke from the Goblins glider was very fake and also a lot of the spiderman animation was on the `over motion blurred' side, a lot like the flying broomstick sport scene in Harry Potter. Most people however will not be disapointed in the effects, as they are going in a direction where no others have been before, ie swinging man in city. So we do expect better for the second.<br/><br/>
Final comments: Overall this film was definitely one of the best films I have seen so far this year and is great for all ages."

","He zips through the air with ease. He extends his sticky webs from out of his wrists. He climbs up walls without any effort. He protects the good citizens of New York from the bad ones. He's none other than your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Spider-Man is a grandiose motion picture, full of imagination, humor, suspense, and some great high-flying adventure.<br/><br/>
Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire, The Cider House Rules) is a nerdy student who is trying to make his way out of high school with the help of his best friend, Harry Osborne (James Franco). Peter is completely in love with the girl next door, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), but tries to hide it. During a school trip to a laboratory, Peter gets bitten by a genetically enhanced spider while partaking in some innocent flirtations with Mary Jane. This spider passes on its traits to Peter. Peter becomes able to see perfectly without his glasses, he's in perfect physical condition, he can climb walls, he can jump great distances, and he is able to shoot webs out of his wrists. Peter transforms into Spider-Man to help fight crime in the streets of New York. Meanwhile, Harry's father, Norman (Willem Dafoe) is testing a new formula on himself. When the experiment goes awry, Norman is mutated into the psychotic Green Goblin, who only wants to wreak havoc on the city. Can Spider-Man stop the evil Green Goblin before he destroys the entire city?<br/><br/>Most movies that are out right now are busy trying to pile in the special effects, the stunts, and the action, but Spider-Man also makes sure to take its plot into consideration. The film doesn't throw endless fight scenes and battles at us. It only gives us fight sequences when they are needed and, more importantly, when they are necessary. There is no fight sequence that is in the film that shouldn't be there.<br/><br/>It's obvious that David Koepp was meant to write the film's screenplay. He's an extraordinary writer, who knows what to give the audience and knows when to tease the audience. He has knack for writing incredibly suspenseful scenes, such is evident in his other work, Jurassic Park and Panic Room. Koepp reaches deep inside every character and pulls out his emotions. He adds drama and romance in between all of the action that occurs throughout the film. We see how Peter uses his powers in everyday life, and how he explores and discovers what he is capable of. Director Sam Raimi chooses to use cartoonish special effects to depict Spider-Man flying through the streets of New York and beating up criminals. This adds a comic book atmosphere to the movie. This is a comic book movie, but Raimi also adds a level of realism to the characters and their surroundings.<br/><br/>
Tobey Maguire is the absolute best choice to play Peter Parker. He captures every essence of the character. Maguire, in fact, is geeky and nerdy. A stronger actor couldn't have possibly matched the quality of Maguire's performance. Willem Dafoe is also an excellent choice for the Green Goblin. Dafoe is scary enough in real life, but here he comes off as terrifying.<br/><br/>Spider-Man is first-class entertainment. The film spins a web of thrills, chills, laughs, and exuberance.---------8/10"

Otherwise, you will be drowned to death in cheese. Basically, that's all it is - a pummeling of your senses with endless tacky one-liners, predictable plot twists, and absolutely terrible costume design. But somehow, it works.  I don't think it will ever be on my list of favorites, but you have to give credit where it's due, I suppose, because it could be worse.  When you disregard the notion that maybe you *shouldn't* try to transfer a comic book feel into a motion picture, the film-making techniques provide for a decent movie. <br/><br/>Just remember two things: 1) the cheesiness will suffocate you if you're taking the movie too seriously, and 2) Chill.

","I went into 'Spider-Man' expecting the worst, and left it slightly surprised that it wasn't anywhere near as awful as I'd expected. But that's about it, and is that really enough? While a cut above recent blockbuster embarrassments like 'Star Wars Episode 1', this movie is still just glorified teen fare, and NOT the great comic book movie we're all hoping for. Maybe one day if Terry Gilliam ever gets his 12 hour adaptation of Moore and Gibbons 'Watchmen' to the screen we'll be suitably knocked out, but until then 'Spider-Man' is really not all that special, no matter what the hype machine and renta-quote crowd are trying to make you believe.<br/><br/>
The two things this movie has going for it is Sam Raimi's direction, and the casting of Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe. Raimi has made some juvenile crap in his time (see 'Army Of Darkness'), but 'Evil Dead' is still a classic, and even his ""failures"" like 'Crimewave', 'Darkman' and 'The Quick and the Dead' are highly underrated enjoyable popcorn movies. (and it must be said, all better than this) Tobey Maguire may not be the greatest actor of his generation but he personable enough when given decent material to work with ('Pleasantville', 'The Wonder Boys'), and suits Peter Parker's likeable nerdiness. The charismatic Willem Dafoe has given some brilliant performances over the years in overlooked movies ('The Last Temptation Of Christ', 'Wild At Heart', 'Light Sleeper'). He isn't required to do all that much here in a duel role as Norman Osborn, driven scientist/businessman, and nutjob super-villain The Green Goblin, but he gives it his best shot, and is always watchable at the very least.<br/><br/>There's not much more to be said about 'Spider-Man'. It does what it is sets out to do, no more and no less, and you'll be hard stretched to remember anything much about it in two years time, but that seems to be all that we can really expect from this kind of movie these days.

","I wanted to like this flick, I really did, and Sam Raimi is an innovative director, whose career I have avidly followed since EVIL DEAD. I have to tell you however, this is light years behind ARMY OF DARKNESS, even DARKMAN (another comic caper for Raimi!)<br/><br/>Toby Maguire was straight-up excellent in the role of Spiderman. He handles the role of science nerd, fortuitously bitten by a missing genetically engineered spider, just perfectly. The early scenes during which he road-tests his new found arachnid skills are deftly handled and at this point, I had the film categorised a 7 or 8. The first set-back was the appearance of Kirsten Dunst, supposedly the ""girl next door"" but in reality more like a brain-dead 27/28 year old with less appeal than the original spider. The supposed great ""love scenes"" just never happen and even Maguire himself by the film's end doesn't look that interested either (admittedly, he does have various sequels to worry about!). The film is irredeemably sunk however by the appearance of the Green Goblin. Looking like a retarded piece of junk from an old LOST IN SPACE episode, the film quickly degenerates to a 6. The second half becomes increasingly more stupid and rushed and simply unravels!<br/><br/>The fx and CGI are for the most part (In NY) deftly handled but towards the end, during the cable-car-under-the-bridge sequences, they become laughable and insultingly bad. The entire ending is rushed and unsatisfying. That this flick is currently running at an average user-voting of 8.2, elevating it to midway up the top 250 films of all time is simply lunacy - a triumph of marketing hype over intelligence.

","This movie wasn't awful, but it wasn't as great as the critics want you to believe. The plot after Peter Parker's fateful encounter with a genetically altered spider is essentially taken from the original Batman movie, except it's not as dark. The special effects are circa 1999 but they do offer the audience the feeling of what it's like to swing through NYC. The acting was solid, especially from Macquire, who I was concerned about before seeing the film. On the whole though, even though I've waited for a Spider-Man movie for what seems like a lifetime, the movie took no risks and accomplished nothing new for the genre. The first two Batman movies are still the best superhero movies ever made and, if you've seen the first Batman, you've basically seen a darker, better version of this movie.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Don't believe the hype.

","*Possible Spoilers Alert!*<br/><br/>Good grief. I must be person number 12,438,957 to write a review, but I'll do it differently and won't use caps at all. Promise. Ok...let's get started.<br/><br/>This movie was done plain wrong. Firstly, Danny Elfman's score was irritating and very OTT. Couldn't they have got someone with some talent? The CGI was annoying to laughable at times, especially during the first part of the movie with Spiderman swinging across the city. He looked like a rubber doll. It actually rivaled ""Blade 2"" in the 'laughable' stakes. Admittedly the CGI did get a lot better later on. However, when Spiderman catches MJ when she falls from the balcony and swings through the air with her, I thought we were watching the original Superman again. There was quite blatantly a blue screen behind them when we go close up.<br/><br/>
Onto the acting. Willem Defoe's portrayal of the Green Goblin was adequate enough, and I believe they chose him for the part because of his acting ability, especially in ""Shadow of the Vampire"" for which he was Oscar nominated at the time. His performance in ""Spiderman"" was similar in its sinisterness to his role in ""Shadow of the Vampire"".<br/><br/>Tobey Maguire is an astonishingly boring actor. Yes, he was good as Peter Parker because Peter Parker IS incredibly boring. Maguire is phenomenally lacking in charisma though, and I'm not sure he's that great a Spiderman. The feeling just isn't quite right.. That one is definitely open to argument though.<br/><br/>Kirsten Dunst had a 'nothing' part. I'm not even sure it's worth even mentioning her. I found it quite sad that a lot of people went to see the movie just for the 'wet top scene.' Perhaps it's because Dunst realises her lack of acting talent and needs another way to attract pre-pubescent boys. Her speech at the end of the movie is so hammy and poorly acted as to make the entire audience burst out laughing.<br/><br/>Strangely, the best portrayed parts of the movie belong to Peter Parker's aunt and uncle, who played the comic book parents perfectly. I thought they were excellent.<br/><br/>Now the movie...oh dear where do we start? There were so many problems with it! So many plot holes! So many! Why didn't MJ remove Spiderman's mask? Why didn't the Green Goblin remove Spiderman's mask when he had kidnapped him?! My oh my WHAT a plothole! What about the fact that Tobey can hold an entire box car with one hand, but can't kick the Green Goblin back to Neverland without a ton of difficulty. Also, the 'thwipping' through the city never fulfilled it's potential because it all moves so fast. Why couldn't they keep a static camera ever?! It just all moved too fast.<br/><br/>
Another scene that stands out is when the Green Goblin 'vaporised' all the members of the board on the balcony - which too was ridiculous. There was no real feeling in that scene at all...they just all turned to skeletons. So pathetic! How about the slow motion punch at Spiderman which smashes the pillar, or the way Spiderman dodges the shuriken-like projectiles. ""The Matrix"" anyone?<br/><br/>The NY bravado on the bridge when Spiderman is holding MJ and the box car was also a waste of time and completely ridiculous, - as was the ending where Spiderman leaps onto the US Flag. I'm tired of this patriotic junk. I realise the bridge scene was added in to demonstrate the togetherness of NY after September 11th, but please...I just found it idiotic that they would throw fruit at the Green Goblin.<br/><br/>*Beginning to cry*<br/><br/>(at times) Sub par special effects, hammy acting, pathetic storyline. Since when can Parker shoot webs from his wrists? Perhaps Stan Lee was paid too much money to care for this adaption. I however, was less than impressed.<br/><br/>A wholly forgettable experience. As I look, Spiderman is number 84 in the top 100 films of all time and will probably rise higher as all the 12 year olds who see it in the coming weeks -  rate it a 10. The world has indeed gone mad.<br/><br/>5/10"

He gets up to speed just in time to save New York City from a succession of two-bit hoods and one evil mastermind. <br/><br/>What separates SPIDER-MAN from most action/special-effects movies is this one has a well thought out script! Special-effects are used to illustrate the story rather than the story being written to showcase the latest special-effects. And there's plenty of humor to go around. I really enjoyed this light and airy approach to depicting a superhero. This will likely be the beginning of a long series."

","Sam Raimi's done a marvelous job of capturing the spirit and integrity of the classic comic. The first half is pure joy as we see nerdy Peter Parker transform into the human spider. The pacing and plot development is great and Raimi throws in some neat unique cinematic devices to show the development of Peter's power. Tobey Maguire is, dare I say, perfectly cast in the roll. His awkwardness, the bewilderment in his new powers, the realisation that he has become obligated to do great things, all come off in a genuine and moving progression. Equal to the task is Willem Dafoe as Norman Osborne/The Green Goblin. Raimi does a nice job of building up his character's decent into madness which lets the audience fully understand why he becomes bad. Dafoe even gets some really great 'actorly' moments that truly sell the character in an inspired way<br/><br/>There is a bit of a letdown in the back half, largely because they're trying to juggle and wrap up a fairly complicated story. While not dissappointing, some scenes, especially the final, come off  forced, but they all serve a purpose for future installments so one can't judge too harshly."

","I don't know whether he had to do The Gift and For Love of the<br/><br/>Game to get the opportunity to do this, but after seeing SpiderMan, those two duds were definitely worth it.

I was going to get my expectations too high and believe all the hype only to be delivered another piece of Hollywood junk.  As high as my expectations were, they were no match for this film.  From the opening title sequence I knew I could sit back and enjoy the ride.  With the exceptions of not enough Spidey one-liners and M.J. looking stoned when I think she's supposed to be romantic, it's an absolutely flawless (well, except for those 2 previously mentioned things) masterpiece!  Good going Raimi. Now make another one of those studio Spider Man flicks and start working on Evil Dead 4!  Bruce Campbell ain't gettin' no younger."

I knew it would be cool with lots of special effects and cool fight scenes, but I had no idea the movie would be as full as this one was.  I understood why the Green Goblin was blowing things up, it wasn't just mindless mayhem.  I knew why Spiderman had the obsession with helping the innocent, not just because he was a good person.

"fearfact0","8","0","1","3 May 2002"," how can a movie be so good but still lack from time to time?
","Spider-man is the kind of movie people wait a while for.  Not because it's a 40 year old comic icon, or because it's the tentpole picture of the summer season, or because it's guaranteed to be huge, or even because Kirsten dunst is in a wet sleeveless shirt (my favorite).  Spider-man is the kind of movie people wait for because it is guaranteed fun.  From the origins of Spider-man, to the Macho Man cameo (Bonesaw?  rock on), to some of the choreography, Spidey swings.  Now onto complaints.<br/><br/>Special effects lacked in numerous areas.  for instance (minor spoilers alert) there is a scene reminiscent of The Matrix where Spier-man is dodging pumpkin bombs.  While impressive, I couldn't help but notice the lack of joints on Spider-man.  The most obvious special effect in the movie.  In fact, you can tell without even paying attention when Tobey ends and CGI begins...for shame.  Same goes for The Green Goblin.  Dafoe and CGI create a viable villain, but they're like fraternal twins instead of one person.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi is a brilliant director, but if he can't keep track of Spider-man in the webslinging scenes, how is the audience expected to?  Raimi tries his best to keep up with the CGI effect, but eventually he just resorts to filming Spidey in a circle, obscuring the background in favor of trying to keep the hero on screen.  This is a suffering point.  Near the end, he seems to have the hang of it a little better, but for the first hour and 40 minutes, I was annoyed.<br/><br/>New York is pretty clean in a lot of the scenes.  why?  Because they were obvious sets.  The balcony was terrible looking.  I kept waiting for Mary Jane's friend Juliet to appear, but nothing ever happened.  Honestly, it's not that bad.  But man, if you look, you'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>I admit that I had a lot of fun with the movie, and I'll watch it again. but I can also admit that i'm not the biggest spider-man fan ever--I preferred X-Men.  I gave the movie an 8.  It was terrific and fun, but it wasn't flawless."

And we were all in there watching Spiderman together.  This movie really crosses boundaries and no matter who you are, there is something in this movie for you.<br/><br/>As the movie progressed, some teary moments came and there wasn't a dry eye in the house.  For just a brief moment in time, everyone got a glimpse of what it is like in Peter Parker's everyday life.<br/><br/>When the phrase ""Go for the ultimate spin"" is used in advertising the Spiderman movie, know that they are telling the truth.  It is the ultimate spin.  And the Spiderman line ""With great power comes great responsibility"" was demonstrated flawlessly.<br/><br/>As a matter of fact, even Stan Lee has been quoted as saying that the movie was actually an improvement on the comic book.

","I had obtained an advance screening pass for this movie two days before it was to be released.  The theatre was packed with kids, comicbook geeks, and so forth.  I did not know what to expect, but having watched many of Sam Raimi's other films, and having recently seen the Cider House Rules also starring Tobey Maguire, and just loving the idea of Kirsten Dunst with red hair, I was highly optimistic.  And righteously so. The movie was great fun. It extrapolates a lot based on Spider-Man's origin tale, and tells it in a fun humorous way.  Very bright and fun for a comicbook movie.. Very rare these days when every comicbook based movie aims for a darker .. batman/dark city look.  But thats just not spidey.<br/><br/>There were some parts of the movie that were ... lacking.. The opening credits were way too long (WE WANT SPIDER-MAN ALREADY)  .. not that the Danny Elfman score wasnt great.  They always are.  But you can only watch neat-o graphics of peoples names for so long.  But truly, I don't think that anywone else could have done a better job.. It was the perfect cast, the perfect team to do this movie.  I have to say Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin was also great.  I still don't like the helmet mask thing, but I can't complain.  A minor quibble.  All in all, a great movie that I certainly plan to get on DVD the moment its out."

"longliverock955","8","0","1","4 May 2002"," Greatest super hero movie to date!
","Going into the Spider-Man movie, one cannot expect to see some sort of artistic opus.  But that's not to say that this can't be a great movie.  In fact, Spider-Man delivers alot more depth than most action flicks.  The story line actually makes sense.  In so many super hero movies (cough cough Batman cough cough) the rationale used to explain why the superhero or the villain chooses the life that they do seems far-fetched, but you excuse it because its a superhero movie.  In Spider-Man, however, we can really believe that Peter Parker would be compelled to become the Amazing Spider Man because of the series of events that led to his Uncle's death.<br/><br/>The casting was excellent as well.  While many people said that Toby Maguire was wrong for this role, whoever chose to cast him knew what they were doing.  People forget that Spider-Man is essentially a nerd.  A skinny and innocent looking actor is perfect for this role.  William DeFoe did an amazing job with his role, especially the scitzophrenic conversation he has with his own reflection.  The rest of the cast does a good job as well.<br/><br/>Something that my friend pointed out to me about this movie that I thought was very interesting was that Spider-Man never kills anyone.  All the villains die by their own actions, which makes sense since the character of Peter Parker seems too harmless to actually kill anyone.  He's out to defend people, never to take the offensive.<br/><br/>There are some problems.  There are plot holes, like the fact that the police come to arrest Spider-Man when he hasn't done anything, but they are forgivable.  Every now and then someone shouts out a cliched line like ""We'll meet again Spider-Man!""  And the love scenes between Toby Maguire and Kristen Dunst get to be a little over the top from time to time, but otherwise the movie is excellent.  This will be added to my DVD collection as soon as it comes out, and I highly reccomend it."

","Greetings again from the darkness.  Disagreeing with the masses ($114 million opening weekend), I say this was quite the disappointment.  It is a little confusing to note that there is a decided lack of action in a movie that also has way too many CGI graphics.  Goblin's costume looked like it was directly off the Haloween shelf at Toys 'R Us.  The bulk of the action was spidey swinging through the streets of the city like a kid on a jungle gym.  Sam Raimi directs this to the best of his abilities, which seem to be quite limited.  He is no master of storytelling.  Enough bagging, let's talk positive.  Kirsten Dunst may be on her way to becoming the next Julia Roberts.  She has a wonderfully likeability about her and is plenty cute - just needs a touch more maturity and she should become highly sought after by movie-makers at the next level.  The rain proved to be quite complimentary to Miss Dunst during one particular scene.  Overall, very mediocre and I hope lessons are learned for the filming of spider-man 2."

","My son works in a movie theatre and we were able to go to an advanced screening last night. <br/><br/>Wow! It was kind of funny being a theater where they were smoking, drinking beer and eating Wendy's. It actually didn't bother me, despite being an old fart, I kind of enjoyed being with a rowdy crowd  <br/><br/>It was a terrific movie, a real crowd pleaser. If you don't like this film, you have no business being at a movie based on a comic book. The movie reminds you a little of the first Batman film, partly because Danny Elfman did the music for both films, partly because of the awesome use of visuals and a city as a virtual character in the story, and partly because of similarities in the storyline.  Overall, this is a much better movie than Batman. It's witty, well acted, has state of the art special effects and puts the effects to the exactly the right use.  <br/><br/>Most of all, the movie captures the essence of the Comic. On the surface, Spider-man is just a blending of the Superman and Batman story. What made it unique, however, was that behind the hero was a less than super everyman who didn't always have his personal life in order and was misunderstood by the public. <br/><br/>The film gets this just right, and has a lot of fun with it. The transformation of Parker from high school geek to Spidey is handled perfectly, with great humor. There is also a parallel transformation of upright businessman Norman Osborne into the insanely maniacal Green Goblin.<br/><br/>
In lesser hands, this could seem stupid and trite. Instead, the fast pace, great visuals, awesome score and solid acting make it easy to set aside the implausible premise and just enjoy the ride.  <br/><br/>The music and special effects should get top billing, but they aren't just thrown at you for their own sake. They are there to advance the story. The makers of this film were smart enough to employ an excellent cast, and give them just enough to do to make you care about the characters.<br/><br/>
The movie ends with the premise for the sequel all setup. I can hardly wait!"

","I'm generally not one to bless the internet with movie reviews, but this one was simply too good to pass up. It makes absolutely no sense: the special effects failed to impress me, at points I felt that the story was moving too slow or too fast, the villain seemed more or less a modern rip-off of Jekyll and Hyde, the opening credits dragged a bit, and yet all the same I enjoyed every moment I spent in the theatre. There was something about the story that just made this movie untouchable, regardless of the blatant flaws. Was it Tobey Maguire's wonderful portrayal of a normal, naive guy who suddenly is blessed with something special? The Spider-Man experience as a whole? Or the intricately woven web of superhero action and a portrayal of a common boy in love with the girl next door...<br/><br/>I don't know. It could be all three of those. At any rate, I recommend this movie to both young and old, Spider-man fans and those who haven't ever opened a comic book. It's a worthwhile several hours that will have the audience yearning for the sequel (I, personally, cannot wait), and exiting the theatre with a thoughtful outlook on how and why the events in the film unfolded as they did. 8/10"

","This movie was for real.  No this wasn't a ""shoot 'em up, action movie,"" though it had some of that.  It starts off with a dork of a high schooler -- someone you know existed in your high school -- and ends up with a superhero who knows what he has to do.  As they say, ""with great power comes great responsibility.""  Peter Parker starts as a genius with no social life. His love is for one of the most popular girls in school and he has only one friend who happens to be incredibly rich.  This movie touches on adolescent love, changes, and the more foreign experience of having amazing abilities over the rest of us.  Tobey Maguire does a good job as Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst is clearly the beautiful Mary Jane and James Franco plays Harry Osborn, the son of a very wealthy Norman Osborn.  Willem Dafoe does an excellent job of playing the successful businessman, yet tortured, supervillain.  Simply put, this movie has realistic interactions amongst its characters, and shows the arrival of a superhero.  It is a great film."

","I was very impressed with this movie, and I give it a perfect 10.  I must say that I am normally very critical of movies, and am typically hard to please - for example, I did NOT like Lord of the Rings, for several reasons (such as poor character development).<br/><br/>SpiderMan was essentially flawless to me.  I did read SpiderMan (and other comics) when I was younger, but I don't think that has swayed my opinion. The acting was excellent, from everyone, and the storyline and direction was superb.  It IS a fantasy-type movie, so if you don't like movies where you have to suspend some disbelief, then perhaps you won't like it as much. However, the characters are so compelling, it really pulls you into the story.<br/><br/>I thought SpiderMan was considerably better than X-Men.  The latter was too short, and the acting - particularly Cyclops, Jean, and Storm - were not nearly as good (I did love Wolverine, though.)  SpiderMan, at just about 2 hours, had enough time to develop the characters and story to much greater satisfaction.<br/><br/>Bottom line:  Unless you really dislike this type of movie, I think you will enjoy SpiderMan.<br/><br/>'Nuff said"
"Mr. Pulse","8","0","1","3 May 2002"," Here's thoughts after one viewing (bound to change)
","Spider-Man fans will like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man; in translating the comic to the screen he's done little more than take the best parts of forty years of history and plastered it onto a movie screen for two hours.  For die-hards, the best part is the perfect tone and great characters. Newcomers will enjoy the great visuals and Maguire's fantastic portrayal of everyman Peter Parker.  It's a fun movie.<br/><br/>Readers will know the story, and those who don't will be able to predict most of the twists anyway.  Peter is a likeable, shy nerd with a crush on the (literal) girl next door Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst).  He's bitten by a genetically engineered spider just as he makes his first advances toward MJ. As Peter tests out his new powers, his classmate's father, Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe), is performing his own experiments, using a vague strength-enhancing serum on himself with rather nasty results.  The two gain alter-egos and are brought into colorful conflict.<br/><br/>In any movie like this, the special effects are bound to hog the spotlight, but Maguire and the supporting cast do a wonderful job of making you care about the people surrounded by the explosions and spandex.  Dafoe's Green Goblin is clearly in the vain of Jack Nicholson's Joker but Dafoe manages to give a memorable turn as the more human half of his character.  Dunst as Mary Jane is great at subtly showing you the stuff going on behind her initially giggly facade.  And J.K. Simmons steals all his scenes as Daily Bugle chief J. Jonah Jameson.  If any character is the complete essence of his comic book counterpart, its Simmons as JJJ.<br/><br/>Like the rest of Raimi's best work, the camera in Spider-Man is completely unchained; it follows him through the air, out of windows, dive bombing with a joy that translates beautifully on the screen.  Some shots of Spider-Man in action are, for a long-time fan, breathtaking.  Raimi as director was a bold choice that really pays off.  His handiwork is all over the film; devotees will recognize touches from Darkman and Army of Darkness among others.<br/><br/>The movie works for the same reasons the comic works.  Some people might not like the frenetic changes of pace and tone but it's a touch right out of comic books, where pathos, action, and comedy mix every twenty-two pages. The movie hits all the right notes until it pauses after the conclusion of Spider-Man's origin.  It loses some steam in its middle third, before it cranks up the juice for a great climax and a perfect epilogue that summarizes all that is great about Peter Parker: no matter his successes as Spider-Man, he will always be deficient as Peter Parker and vice versa. Throughout, the movie has the guts to remain true to the character, both in the costume and out.  And they don't even use the silly cartoon theme song."

Seeing the previews I was blown away. The costume looked great and you can't beat the Green Goblin as a villain. Going into the theater last Friday was great. There was a huge buzz and everyone was geared up. Everything was going as I had expected...then the movie began. At first I fought off the obvious on screen actions because the story of Peter Parker becoming Spider-Man had to be told, but it got old really quickly. The corny one liners were too much to take. The Green Goblin's costume looked like a really good Halloween costume. The way Spider-Man and the Goblin interacted was painful. It was like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I really think the 5 year old behind me had a better time than I did. He was laughing at the funny parts...what does that tell you? I really think this could have been a marketing ploy for Marvel. I see it has pleased long time Spider-Man fans due to the 186 ranking it already has on this web site, but I am not one of those. The sequel better be a big improvement.

It follows VERY closely the original comic book story, with just a few minor changes.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie - as is generally the case with Marvel characters - are real and you can relate to them.  Tobey Maguire (who I still believe is too short to play Spidey) was pretty good as Peter Parker. Dunst was excellent as Mary Jane.  Willem Dafoe was fine but the costume they stuck him in as the Green Goblin was criminally bad; you couldn't see anything of him except his mouth - very lame.  J Jonah Jameson was portrayed very well; VERY funny.<br/><br/>The special effects here were simply great. The web-spinning, cameras moving with Spidey, and especially the costume will leave the TRUE Spiderman fans happy.

","Sam Raimi has pulled off what every director would like to: He has presented the struggle between good and evil in a plausible manner without betraying the broadstroke style of the cartoon genre - and he's done it without anything schmaltzy, anything cliched, anything formulized. Quite simply, he has produced the finest cartoon movie ever made. And he's accomplished this despite the overproduced and self-indulgent(hit every sound effect cue)score by Danny Elfman. There is a naivete, rare in Hollywood, in Raimi's handling of what might otherwise be considered pure popcorn fare. With SPIDER-MAN, in spite of the huge franchise this movie represents, Raimi has managed to remain true to his heart felt visions. This seems like a movie made by a director who, like spider-man, has remained an idealist even though he has come up against the forces of the Glittering Goblins of the major studio machine. Let's hope that Raimi continues to deal with material like this, material which pleases the people in its sincerity rather than the material which gains the approval of the critics (like A SIMPLE PLAN)in its austerity."

","I just saw this movie a few hours ago and I must say that this was an excellent movie! Well what can you expect from a Sam Raimi film? You got your action, comedy, drama, and of course the usual Raimi corniness. They couldn't have done better with this film. If you're going to see a film at the theater, forget The Scorpion King, Changing Lanes, or Jason X, go see this! Definetely one of the most satisfying pictures out now!"

","This movie was, what can i say, INCREDIBLE! I was expecting as much from a spider-man movie, seeing how he is one of the greatest comic book/comic legend ever! Aside from some cheesy lines in exchanges of Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire, it was simply amazing. It was your classic comic book hero story, and i am happy to say it RULED!<br/><br/>Along with the amazing adventure, came a message that many should remember when rising up in life- ""Great power comes with great responsibilty."""
"Jeff M.-3","9","0","1","3 May 2002"," Exciting, well-put-together story almost cheese-free
","I haven't had any contact with Spider-Man since the newspaper canceled the comic strip in 1993, so I went into this without many if any preconceived notions.<br/><br/>The credits at the beginning are a little long, but when it starts into the story it starts right away.  The first thing that happens is the trip to the lab.<br/><br/>As Spider-Man first develops his senses, he seems to get a handle on them a bit faster than you might expect, leaping from roof to roof the next day.  Perhaps it's a little too effortless, but you get the idea that he is trying out his new powers (and it takes him a bit to master the web thing).<br/><br/>His costume in the wrestling ring is hilarious, although you later wonder just how it goes from sweatpants to Spandex.  The filmmakers tie the wrestling story nicely in with Uncle Ben's death, as the robber Peter lets go past him at the arena kills Ben in a carjacking.<br/><br/>After Osborn becomes the Green Goblin, the internal conflicts of personality are portrayed very well.<br/><br/>Spider-Man's fight to become a hero is attacked by the editor of the Bugle and others in the city, and the headlines certainly help show that.  Peter Parker does a great job of taking pictures of Spider- Man, if you know what I mean.<br/><br/>The city scene at the end with Spider-Man swinging between the taxis to the skyscrapers seems like a bit of SFX ego-building, but it also helps show that Spider-Man is here to stay.  If you watch fast enough, the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center are still in the background. (Note: A mention of ""the bombing"" in an earlier scene is NOT a reference to Sept. 11, but to the Green Goblin's first attack on Quest Aerospace.)<br/><br/>The character of Peter Parker himself is a wonderful Everyman, full of human emotions, and Tobey Maguire is cast well. Kirsten Dunst is a good MJ, and that first kiss is one to linger over.  In a slight twist at the end, MJ is confessing to Peter her feelings, and he sort of brushes her off, because it's part of his curse that those he loves are in danger.  But the comic books tell us how that turns out.  Willem Dafoe is at his best when holding dialogue with himself, in the Jeckyll/Hyde good/evil scenes 'with' the Green Goblin.<br/><br/>It's alternately a movie to sit back and think, and sit back and enjoy the action.  With great power comes great responsibility; use your power to enjoy this movie wisely. 8 1/2, maybe 9/10."
"ledorky","10","0","1","3 May 2002"," Must-see
","This is a great film. Sam Raimi and the rest of the cast has done a wonderful job in the comic book adaptation.  There is far more than action in this film.  Sure, the explosion scenes are great but it's even more wonderful to see some character development. I won't bore you with the usual plot summary of an awkward teenage boy given super-powers and his struggles with fame.  This is faithful enough to please the die-hard nerdy comic book fans young and old yet will give enough of a story for those with no previous knowledge. It has enough twists and turns that even the comic book fans will enjoy seeing how the ""new"" story unfolds. This is comic book at its finest.  I can't recommend it enough."
"Ic0n0clast2","10","0","1","3 May 2002"," Marvel's emerging heroes....
","Spiderman, action packed and thrilling, is a pleasure to see on the screen. Although the story seems slightly incomplete to the knowledged Marvel fan, the movie does manage to pack in a large amount of Peter Parker's past and history. Conforming to its original script (i.e. the tv show, the movie follows the Stan Lee plot wonderfully and delights the educated viewer. What really was great about this movie was the Spiderman flying/webslinging scenes through New York. The CGI is just spectacular plus the fighting manages to remain Spiderman-like, and doesn't try to rip off Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, or asian like martial art sequences (i.e. The Musketeer). The actors are believeable, with Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker and William Defoe as the menacing Green Goblin, each person , except for Bonesaw McGraw aka Randy ""Machoman"" Savage, belongs in their part. I would highly recommend any one to see this movie, it is a delight. In the future, I hope they will add more major and eviler villains such as Venom and Carnage. That would really spice things up!<br/><br/><br/><br/>

"LaCarde","10","0","1","3 May 2002"," Wow!
","Spider-Man has been my favourite super hero since I was four years old.  So needless to say, I was excited to see this movie.  However, I wasn't going in with any high hopes.<br/><br/>The trailers looked great.  Spidey's moves were perfect, but they didn't tell you anything about the story, and that left me a bit worried.  Were they hiding something?  Was this going to be another one of those f/x driven plot movies?  NO!  The story was the best part.  Oh sure, it was exciting to see Spidey flipping around and swinging past buildings, but the story was great.  Even my wife, who usually rolls her eyes and puts up child like enthusiasm when I talk about Spider-Man, enjoyed the film. She was laughing and enjoying the ride.<br/><br/>Spider-Man was a great tribute to the comic.  It made me feel like a kid again.  Heck, it even made me a bit misty."
"seawasp","10","0","1","3 May 2002"," The best superhero movie yet made.
","The trailers for Spider-Man looked impressive. In keeping with some prior disappointments, I tried to keep my expectations low -- telling myself cynically ""they always choose the three good minutes for the trailers"", and other similar things.<br/><br/>I could not have been more wrong. This IS Spider-Man. Finally, after all these years, the technology is available to do the effects and has met with a director, scriptwriter, and team of actors capable of doing the entire thing justice. The original Superman was good (and Christopher Reeve will always be Superman to me); the Batman movie touched on the essence of the Dark Knight; and the more recent X-Men (to use modern vernacular) kicked ass.<br/><br/>But none of them even APPROACH Spider- Man in terms of making a comic book LIVE -- making it acceptable on the big screen, without sacrificing one iota of what made that comic a classic. Peter Parker -- stammering, graceless geek -- appears onscreen in the first few minutes. And he's exactly what we knew he used to be. True, the radioactive spider which gave the original Spider-Man his powers is switched for an updated, genetically-engineered spider. But everything else is perfect. <br/><br/>The movie takes us through ALL the essentials of what made Peter the hero he is, and somehow does it WITHOUT feeling rushed. The tragedy of his Uncle Ben's death, the angst surrounding his failure to act at a critical moment, his inability to act in private life while almost indecently extroverted as Spider-Man, the origin of the Green Goblin, the conflict of superheroic power with protecting those you love... it's all there, and not one bit of it skimped.<br/><br/>The Green Goblin's updated look is excellent -- frightening and creepy. One of the true triumphs of the movie is the movement and combat; no prior attempt at Spider-Man, even the animated ones, has managed to capture the smooth, impossible, sometimes alien movements of the Web-Slinger, but here they're not just attempted, but pulled off with a virtuoso flair that makes it look easy. The fight scenes work -- and this is no small thing, when you're dealing with people who are doing impossible things to begin with. Finally, they somehow manage to make the classic Spider-Man costume look GOOD on-screen, even though one would have thought that there's no way it could avoid looking hokey.<br/><br/>Laying aside the effects (and that's hard to do, when they're as amazing as the ones here), the other critical part of Spider-Man is the people. We have to believe in these people as being real, no matter how ludicrous the situations are... and we do.  Tobey Maguire and William Dafoe put on stellar performances, Maguire as Parker and Dafoe as the tormented Norman Osborne. The rest of the cast don't fail the main actors -- it's hard to tell whether they measure up to the standard the other two set simply because no one else, even Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane Watson, is really given a role that challenges their abilities as much. It's not easy to make a raving lunatic supervillain convincing, but Dafoe manages that difficult feat, just as Maguire makes us believe both sides of Peter Parker.<br/><br/>If you've EVER enjoyed superheroes at all, do NOT miss this movie."
"HHHVixen","9","0","1","3 May 2002"," So Awesome!
","I went and seen Spiderman tonight and thought it was great. The acting was awesome especially Willem's and Tobey's. The story was great and i thought it didn't drag for a moment. When i left the theater i was like that went way too fast. The action was great especially the fighting scenes. Even though at some parts you could tell it was CGI it didn't take away from the movie. The Ending was great leaving the door open for many sequels. I totally recommend this movie. Everyone clapped at the ending scene between Mary Jane and Peter and then after the movie everyone applauded and was hyped. Go SEE THIS MOVIE! AWESOME!"
"ron.lenore-2","Null","0","1","1 May 2002"," Toby is too weak; Bombing NYC buildings insensitive
","I enjoyed the movie, the special effects were well done, DaFoe looked truly evil, and NYC looked good.  But Toby was just too wimpy to be a hero.  His romantic scenes were just plain humorous.<br/><br/>I thought the scenes involving NYC buildings being bombed and collapsing hit just a little too close to home after 9/11.  There are other ways to accomplish what needed to be accomplished without this insensitive action.<br/><br/>Lastly, the movie seems a bit violent for kids...overall I give it a C+"
"Phil_H","6","0","1","4 May 2002"," The curse of Marvel Movies has ended!
","I said to myself, ""Self, this movie better be better than any of the previous Marvel crud.""<br/><br/>""You said it,"" came the reply.<br/><br/>I wasn't long in discovering that this movie does live up to the hype, and that Spider-Man is a worthy summer blockbuster, what's more there *WILL* be sequels, you can believe that, True Believers.<br/><br/>Is this the best it could have been? Well, no. Because the sappy ending seemed tacked-on (I bet you've read that before someplace.) And some of the action editing was a bit glaring, and I could tell when the Spider-Man was CGI and not a human...<br/><br/>But still, the curse is indeed over. This movie rocked. If you're a Spider-Man fan, you'll love the integration; if you have no clue who Spidey is, then you'll learn and you'll love him. This is good stuff.<br/><br/>I had misgivings that Tobey McGuire would be bad, that he wouldn't make me think he was Peter Parker. But actually, he did ok. I was concerned that he might not be animated enough to pull off the wise-cracking web-slinger. But he kind of grows into the role, as if Peter's new-found confidence is letting him take off a bit more. I see that as a positive thing.<br/><br/>Go see Spider-Man, it's good. I give it a solid ""6."""
