","I saw the film at FrightFest in London a couple of days ago, and was pretty well sure I'd be seeing something special - but I ended up seeing a film that is downright extraordinary. Brutal but beautiful, magical yet earthy, it has a remarkable cast, with standout performances all round.<br/><br/>A special mention must go to Sergi Lopez, whose 'Captain Vidal' is indeed one of the most sadistic film creations ever seen. Yet he manages to make the audience understand why he is the way he is ... an astounding performance. Maribel Verdu's quiet but rebellious housekeeper is one of the strongest female roles I've seen in many a year, and she is supported by a wealth of talent. Young Ivana Baquero is surprisingly self-assured as 12-year-old Ofelia, and I especially liked her almost Alice-like approach to the magical creatures she encounters in the labyrinth. The icing on this warped fairy tale is Doug Jones, who gives a towering performance - and in this case literally, as well as figuratively - as the guardian of the labyrinth, a faun, full of grace and charm and latent menace. Although dubbed, his Spanish is perfect (Jones speaks not a word of the language), and his physical presence is incredibly powerful as his character teases, cajoles and harries Ofelia to fulfil her tasks. He also plays the devastatingly creepy and disgusting 'Pale Man' - a creature that almost equals Vidal in his terrorising habits.<br/><br/>But the cast is just one facet of this gloriously photographed film, with Javier Navarrete's hauntingly simple score weaving itself into the fabric of a film perfectly edited and written. The brutality of post-Civil War Spain contrasts with the world of magic to which Ofelia is drawn, yet everywhere she goes she has choices to make. In fact the film is about choices, good and bad, and one discovers that no matter how desperate a situation becomes, a choice is always available - although that choice may mean one's death. The film is violent - very violent, but each moment of brutality, although graphic, has a purpose - nowhere is it gratuitous.<br/><br/>I loved it - as I knew I would - and if the Oscar voters don't give this film at least a nod for Best Foreign Language Film next year, then I will know that they have lost any sense of reason or comprehension. Because this film is truly a masterpiece, and Del Toro's greatest work to date."
"Wesley-Wang","10","93","107","27 May 2018"," In Depth Analysis of Interpretations
","Sixth viewing: My appreciation only grows. Interpretations-<br/><br/>1st interpretation: Ophelia's world is real- happy ending.<br/><br/>If this interpretation is valid, we deal with themes of war and disobedience. Here, Pan's Labyrinth serves as an allegory against the totalitarian regime of Fascist Spain, symbolized by Vidal. Vidal is represented in the fantasy storyline by the Pale Man; they both sit at the end of the table at the feasts, and they are both violent and cruel. Furthermore, the Pale Man is an allegory to ""Saturn Devouring his Son"" by Fransisco Goya, as both Cronus and the Pale Man eat the heads off of their victims first. If Cronus represents the Pale Man, and the Pale Man represents Vidal, and Vidal represents Fascist Spain, Del Toro implies that Fascist Spain is just as cruel as Cronus; like how Cronus devours his own sons, Fascist Spain kills their own people.<br/><br/>2nd interpretation: Ophelia's world is her imagination- tragic ending (or is it? Some might say that she was better off dead than having to live with her terrible hardships).<br/><br/>If this interpretation is valid, we deal with themes of self-deception and how reality and fantasy can coexist. Here, Pan's Labyrinth explores how Ophelia creates a fantasy for herself to deal with the harsh realities of war. In this case, we can interpret the final fantasy sequence as Ophelia's imagination, her creation and the world she wished to live. Besides, you can tell she is still alive, as Del Toro shows her lips quiver right after the fantasy sequence.<br/><br/>Observations-<br/><br/>*The film features many smooth cuts, which Del Toro hides with trees and black screens. This could imply how reality and fantasy intertwine, supporting the second interpretation. BUT smooth cuts never go from fantasy to reality or reality to fantasy, only fantasy to fantasy or reality to reality. This could suggest the first interpretation, where reality and fantasy are separate.<br/><br/>*Vidal sees the monster under the bed, which supports the 1st interpretation. Yet at the same time, he does not see the faun at the end, which supports the 2nd interpretation. But again, Vidal has just consumed some kind of poison, so it may be his hallucinations in which he does not see the faun.<br/><br/>*Del Toro never cuts away from the violence, emphasizing the brutality of war.<br/><br/>*Cinematography is magnificent- dark, gloomy, blue colors in reality sequences to depict its dreariness, while bright, vibrant reds and oranges to depict enthusiasm. In the final scenes, the reds of blood and explosions stand out because the blues have become so common with the eye. Del Toro consciously had the blood and explosions to stand out to emphasize the violence of war.<br/><br/>*Notice how Del Toro establishes tension between Ophelia and Vidal; When Ophelia shakes with the wrong hand, Vidal points it out, forming an uneasy tone between them. This first encounter between the two main characters in their respective storylines is vital for their relationship in the future scenes, especially the climax.<br/><br/>Bottom line is, both interpretations are valid, and Del Toro utilizes both of them to deliver both of their respective themes.<br/><br/>As magnificent as this film is, there may be authenticity flaws. For example, why didn't Mercedes kill Vidal after she escaped? Is she still obedient to Vidal? Then why did he directly disobey his order at the end when Vidal asked to tell his son the time of his death? For me, it's clear why Del Toro left these authenticity flaws: to drive the story forward. Attempting to patch these flaws would've been at the expense of pacing, and the audience's engagement is more important than plot holes.<br/><br/>After all, these flaws are more or less hidden; visible only to those who know where to look."
"j30bell","9","722","888","23 November 2006"," A fey, beautiful and dark masterpiece
","Set during Franco's mopping up exercise after the Spanish Civil War, Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth is a wonderful, dark fairy tale that, in a metaphor for Spain itself, teeters on the edge of nightmare dreamscapes of corruption, violence and the death of innocents.<br/><br/>This film is definitely not for young children. Although the fantasy sequences are gorgeously realised, and are fairy tales in the truest sense (in that they are dark, fey, dangerous and violent), most of the story (about three quarters of it, in fact) exists outside of the dreamland, in the even more frightening (and sometimes shockingly violent) world of a real life struggle of ideas and ideology.<br/><br/>Sergi Lopez is excellent as the brutal (and possibly sadistic) Falangist Captain tasked with routing out the remaining leftists from the woods and hills of Northern Spain. Into this precarious situation come his new wife (a widow of a former marriage, who is carrying his son) and his stepdaughter Ofelia (played to absolute perfection, by the then 11 year old, Ivana Baquero).<br/><br/>Uncomfortable with her new surroundings, suspicious of her stepfather and desperately concerned about the worsening condition of her mother, Ofelia uncovers a strange alternative world, and the chance to escape forever the pain and uncertainty of her everyday life.<br/><br/>Thus the film alternates between the world of Civil War Spain and the increasingly bizarre, dark and frightening world of the Pan's Labyrinth. As the twin plots progress, they intertwine, with the tasks of Ofelia becoming the choices faced by a Spain at the crossroads. The poignancy of the film lies partly in the fact that the victories of the child are reflected so starkly by the failures of the adult world.<br/><br/>Apparently Pan's Labyrinth won a 20-minute standing ovation at Cannes, when it was shown. This may be a little bit over the top. I suspect when the furore has died down some will choose to swing the pendulum back and criticise it for its more obvious faults. Much of the film is derivative. There are few ideas in the film's magical dreamworld that haven't been seen before. There are also few ideas in the film's depiction of the Civil War that can't be read in Satre or Orwell; can't be viewed in Picasso's Guernica; or can't be watched in Land and Freedom.<br/><br/>For all the evident truth of these observations, to accept them would be to entirely miss the majesty of Pan's Labyrinth, which doesn't lie in its originality but its absolute mastery of execution. People will watch Pan's Labyrinth in a way that most won't watch Land and Freedom. In doing so, they will also discover a world of fairy tales which existed before Disney sunk its claws into them: a dangerous world, where nothing is as it seems and every step is a possible death  a place which may leave even adults shivering under the duvet, part in terror, part in wonder. And all this backed up by the finest cinematography I've seen.<br/><br/>The only real faults I am prepared to allow for this film is a slight tendency (particularly at the end) for a Narnia-like moralism, and the fact that the faun is, perhaps, is not quite wild enough! These are eminently forgivable, though. This is easily the best film I've seen this year, and a must see on the big screen."
"dontslityourwrist_yet","10","470","597","14 December 2006"," Unexpected brilliance.
","This is a movie with a simple and straightforward plot which contains layers and layers of intelligent writing, metaphors and message.<br/><br/>To speak further about the script will end up in spoilers and that would be pointless since my very purpose writing this review is to encourage people to see it.<br/><br/>This is no small feat, interpreting fantasy as something of a product of a real world, cross-referencing how the child acts to her real surroundings and the ""other world"", metaphors that describe the accelerated state of growing up some of us are put through... Incredible. Simple, straightforward yet there is so much to be appreciated.<br/><br/>Those who are saying how it's predictable and thus not enjoyable, I ask of you, which movie nowadays aren't predictable? Hell, even 21 grams was predictable but so damned good. It's not about how it ends, you can always predict how a movie would end if you've ever taken a half-decent script writing class or have some common sense. It's always about how well you tell a story.<br/><br/>I'm grateful there are still directors who aren't tied down to this new epidemic of including a plot twist simply because they need a plot twist.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth features some of the best storytelling and attention to detail without being affected by the now ever-popular opinion of cameras having to be put through several technical difficulties to make the shots eligible to be called a brilliant shot.<br/><br/>I am also grateful for them not dubbing it. Watching it in its' original language is much, much more rewarding even if I had to rely on the subtitles for most of the time.<br/><br/>This is a brilliant movie. Watch it."
"dante_leebo","9","571","733","25 August 2006"," Beautiful, violent, magical and sad....
","I was fortunate enough to catch Pan's Labyrinth last night as part of the 'Fright Fest' programme in London and was completely blown away. Guillermo Del Toro himself was present to both introduce the movie and to answer questions afterwards. He spoke very passionately about the film, and it was easy to see why. Guillermo Del Toro has created something very special - part war movie, part fantasy, that everyone should see. The film features a fantastic performance by Sergi Lopez as Captain Vidal and as central character Ofelia, newcomer Ivana Baquero delivers the performance of a seasoned veteran. If you are the type of person who is put off by subtitled movies, don't be. This is a very 'visual' film that does not rely overly on dialogue. This does not open until 24 November in the UK and 29 December in the USA but already I am looking forward to seeing it again (and buying the Special Edition DVD).This is the first time I've felt the need to write a review on here. Do yourselves a favour and go and watch it on the big screen."
"allan-117","10","563","723","12 September 2006"," The best fantasy of the past decade
","Everyone's been raving about this. My opinion doesn't differ too much. It did however suffer slightly from the overwhelmingly high expectations I'd developed based on how brilliant everyone said it was, and the whole ""20min ovation at Cannes"" thing. Really, who stands for that long? That said, it's an amazing work.<br/><br/>Skipping the plot recap (find the briefest synopsis you can if you need to be filled in), I'll go straight to the tech specs. I'm not a huge Del Toro fan, Cronos was interesting but lacked something for me. Mimic was dross. Hellboy was enjoyable and Ron Perlman is always great on screen. But here, the director really outdoes himself. By far. He has wrapped together some amazing elements and somehow maintains a balance, that doesn't tip into the mundane or the ridiculous for a moment. And this is no mean feat. The story is part historical drama, part fantasy, part family melodrama. When it dips out of the fantasy, it still enchants.<br/><br/>Sergi Lopez and Maribel Verdú really drive the story in the historical drama scenes. I haven't seen Lopez in anything other than a film called Lisbon, in which he played a character so completely opposite from the Captain. He is a fierce and terrifying guy but actually comes across as sympathetic in a couple of scenes. Verdu is incredible as Mercedes, the head housekeeper (or something) who is Ofelia's closest friend in the house. The scenes with these characters and the civil war subplot never fail to hold your attention. Ivana Baquero is excellent as the main character Ofelia, her performance is very mature and believable and she shares some beautiful scenes with her mother and Mercedes.<br/><br/>When the fairy tale elements return, it's astounding how naturally they fit into the story. I think that is the real magic of this film. The war drama and the fairy tale stem so naturally from each other.<br/><br/>One thing that most reviews haven't mentioned is the violence. I think it's been firmly established that this is an adult's fairytale, but at times it is a very intense and brutal film. There are a couple of scenes in particular which are very disturbing and difficult to watch. These do not distract from the tone and theme of the film however so they don't seem exploitative at all. If you are squeamish, it may get a bit much for you.<br/><br/>A final and obvious point I spose I can't get away without making: the set design, costumes and effects are superb. That's all.<br/><br/>I was perhaps expecting a little more fantasy, but the unique blend of genres is absolutely compelling. There wasn't a false note anywhere or a plot hole, which are too often present in fantasy films. I can't recall a good, original fantasy film from recent years. Fortunately this blows MirrorMask out of the water. It doesn't share any of the contrivances, vagueness or ineffectual characters with that film.<br/><br/>I just wish I'd seen it without already having read so much. I've tried very hard to not reveal any plot details at all as it does go to some surprising and unexpected places. Fortunately most of the reviews have done the same. I'd urge anyone with the chance to see it to do so immediately, and try not to read too much more."
"Chris_Docker","10","205","279","22 November 2006"," A masterpiece
","1944. Franco's authoritarian fascist regime is a horrid world for a child, barely into her teens. Ofelia retreats into herself, finding in her fantasy world the lessons of courage, self-discipline and integrity she will need. With her, we travel beyond outward appearances, through a labyrinth of fears and uncertainties, from which Spain will not escape for several decades.<br/><br/>A dark, brutal fairytale, chillingly set in the real world but full of hope and warmth, Pan's Labyrinth accomplishes a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Our film opens with a momentary shot of Ofelia, blood from a nosebleed disappearing as the frames are introduced in reverse. A voice-over takes us back to the time of the Spanish Civil War. Ofelia arrives (with her pregnant mother) at a nationalist military base in the woods and is introduced to her stepfather, a vicious commanding officer. Capitán Vidal dispenses arbitrary justice to anyone he suspects is against him. Two suspected rebels caught by his men are summarily executed. Only afterwards is a rabbit discovered in their bag, proving their claim that they are just woodsmen (and maybe also a throwaway reference to Alice in Wonderland). <br/><br/>Ofelia is unwilling to accept this harsh adult world. She retreats into a labyrinth where she meets a strange Pan-like creatures, Fauno, who gives her a set of tasks where she has to face some of her darkest fears, winning a key for her next task. <br/><br/>The story becomes more intense, both outside the labyrinth (where Vidal is busy torturing people) and inside, where Ofelia has to face the Pale Man - a creature that has plucked out its eyes and can only see by placing them in the stigmata on its hands. Around the walls of the room are pictures of people being cast into hell by the Pale Man (From inference or the director's comments, it is apparent that the Pale Man represents authoritarianism, whether that of the Fascists or the Church). In Pan's Labyrinth we have a parable about the journey of Spanish society from the 1940s to post-Franco, a magical fairytale of stunning beauty, a story of the struggle and character development of a child on the edge of puberty, and a tense story of battles between Nationalists and Republicans. That they are all welded together seamlessly and precisely in a multi-level narrative is a remarkable achievement and thrilling experience. The sheer artistry recalls Cocteau's La Belle at la Bête. Del Toro sweeps us into a dreamlike, poetic vision, with a minimum of CGI and a grasp of dialogue that seems almost transcendental. <br/><br/>In a brave decision, an actor (Ivana Baquero) who is only as old as her character has been used to play the young Ofelia. But as the ethereal figure between two worlds, she is also there to cast the earthy characters involved in material battles into more visceral contrast. Editing is crisp throughout, without a single frame wasted. Rich colours and unflinching camera-work keep us rooted in the experience, whether it is Ofelia crawling face-down in the mud and covered with insects, or a hapless victim having his nose smashed in by the Capitán. Yet scenes of tenderness and beauty are equally as moving - Ofelia retreating into her mother's arms, a nursemaid powerless to help her republican lover, or a doctor performing an act of mercy.<br/><br/>The movies, like our dreams, folklore and imagination, are rich with symbols and images that can strike a chord in our deepest being. Artists, as well as creators of myths and religion, have long employed such symbols to guide and inspire, knowing that the conscious mind may accept a sign more easily than rational argument alone.<br/><br/>In watching a movie, we combine ideas of the real, the imaginary and the symbolic to find an inner affinity. And, if the filmmaker has done his job properly, will feel truly moved.<br/><br/>One of the things that can make or break a movie that makes extensive use of symbols is whether those symbols echo in the collective unconscious, often through time honoured association, or not. Knowledge of mythology or Jungian psychology can make all the difference. Much has been made of the title. Originally 'El Laberinto del Fauno', the translation at first appears sloppy, but Del Toro has done his research well. While quipping that it 'just sounded better', a little investigation of classical authorities shows Faunus as a form of the ancient god Pan (Lempriere). Pan, the goat-like god that represents a totality of possibilities, together with goat-like stubbornness and independence of thought, is the perfect symbol. In the film he says, ""I've had so many names... I am the mountain, the forest and the earth. . . . I am a faun. Your most humble servant, Your Highness."" In Greek Mythology, Pan also won the affections of a princess under the form of a goat. The freedom of thought (and sexuality) he advocated, with the rise of Christianity, caused him to be portrayed as the Devil; but we learn his intentions are good, whereas the holy-looking Pale Man offers temptation only as an excuse to rip his victims apart. As an aspect of the creative power, fauns in mythology also symbolise firm aspiration and human intelligence.<br/><br/>The one symbol that Del Torro is less adept in using is that of dying. He tends to use the valid, if flawed connotation of redemption-through-death promoted by the religions he disavows, but it is a small point that in no way spoils the story.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth leads us through parallel stories and themes without once losing its internal consistency. Some audiences may be put off by the idea of using flights of fancy in such a blatant way or, sadly, by the fact that it is subtitled. Such minor monsters should not get in the way of enjoying the film on a simple entertainment level. Cinephiles, on the other hand, will not want to miss such a rare treat of talent."
"davidcapa","10","295","419","12 October 2006"," Innocence and brutality
","I saw the movie yesterday in the Spanish premiere and I confirm: it's one of the best Guillermo del Toro's films (if not the best ever). Innocence and brutality, fantasy and reality, together in a wonderful fairy tale about the power of magic in dark times. The performances are great, mainly from Sergi López, Maribel Verdú and the big revelation of the film: the 12 years girl Ivana Baquero. Del Toro repeats the context of the film ""El Espinazo del Diablo"" (""The Devil's Backbone""), the Spanish Post-Civil War, with the same philosophy: the supernatural invading the daily life in a depressive environment and the innocence of children trapped between both world. But ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is most compact, most mature and best done in very aspects, and perhaps it's the most personal movie from Del Toro."
"areatw","9","18","21","4 February 2018"," Wonderful combination of fantasy and reality
","Few would dispute that 'Pan's Labyrinth' is one of the best foreign language films of the 2000s, but I would go one step further and argue that it's also one of the best modern day fantasy/adventure films in general. There aren't many films that manage to blur the lines between fantasy and reality as effectively as 'Pan's Labyrinth'. The effortless transition between the real world and the underworld and the way the two worlds are interlinked really is something special and I've never seen it done as well before.<br/><br/>The combination of a convincing and easy to buy into storyline and the magical fantasy underworld works perfectly. The fact that both parts of the story could easily stand alone without the other, and yet go together seamlessly, is an indicator of just how good it is. The horror elements also bring something completely different and unexpected to the film, though they are tastefully added and never overdone. Overall, a wonderful film and one of the best fantasy/adventures of the 00s."

The little girl carries pretty much the whole film on her shoulders and does so with the skill of Atlas himself! <br/><br/>The violence is graphic and the monsters are scary but it is probably one of the most gorgeous and personal films from a director for a long time!<br/><br/>Give it a go if you can get to a screening, DON'T WAIT FOR DVD, it really does need to be seen on a big screen!"

Del Toro gets a brilliant film but also superb performances from all involved, particularly from Sergi Lopez as a brutal Fascist army captain Vidal and Doug Jones (Abe Sapien from del Toro's Hellboy) as the Pan and the wonderfully disturbing Pale Man. But the real find is Ivana Baquero (12 years old) as the young heroine Ofelia. She gives one of the best performances from a child actor we have seen since Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense.

"luckyfay","9","282","418","19 June 2006"," A labyrinth you don't want to leave
","I saw this film toward the end of the Cannes Film Festival; it edged out all the others I'd seen, 30 of them, because of its wonderful story; history, politics and fantasy woven into a fabric spun by a superlative creative team headed by Guillermo del Toro. In comparison to this, his latest effort, del Toro's other films only hinted at the depth and breadth of his talent. In this film, much as I pride myself on foreseeing the outcome of most stories, I could not guess what would happen next. The film is quite long, yet suspense is sustained throughout. The music is some of the best I've heard in years, so well suited to the action that you almost don't notice its specific effect because of how well it is intertwined with the visual, emotional and intellectual experience.<br/><br/>In my opinion, del Toro's ""...Labyrinth"" deserved to win at Cannes over the Ken Loach film, ""The Wind That Shakes the Barley"". Actually, everyone I knew at the Festival who had seen both agreed with me. And the 22 minute ovation speaks clearly for the effect on the audience. It's hard to imagine that any film could beat it in a context other than Cannes where they have marked preferences, bordering on obsession, for certain directors.<br/><br/>Let's hope that the late December opening favors an Oscar nomination which it should win hands down, unless some other work of genius appears on the horizon. That doesn't seem likely because at Cannes the somewhat disappointing array of films was attributed to the fact that not much great product is being released this year. I might add that I had already seen Volver prior to Pan's Labyrinth, and I maintain that Pan is the better film. For me, it displaced all three of my top films of the year. I do love The Departed but, luckily, that's in another category which does not threaten Pan's access to Oscar. If I had to choose the very best picture of the year, without limitation by category, it would most assuredly go to Pan's Labyrinth for it demonstrates del Toro's originality and brilliance as both writer and director."

","You would think that, with 1000 or so positive reviews, one more would not matter? However, this is not only one of the most extraordinary films ever made, it is also a personal fave which I have seen many times.<br/><br/>Comments include: <br/><br/>* can Guillermo del Toro actually make a bad film? I don't think so. Because of his name on the credits I have checked out many films of his that, while not in the same class as this one, were nonetheless flawless in execution.<br/><br/>* of many film I have seen about war (too many to count) this one manages to humanize the condition to a greater degree than I can recall. Each character is perfectly cast with perfectly written dialog to bring home the metaphor of trying to live your life while chaos reigns around you. A little girl with a sick pregnant mother who just lost her father and finds her step-father to be a monster ... perfect!<br/><br/>* many films deliberately strive for that special ""ambiguous"" ending but this one nails it. I remember couples coming out out the theatre arguing over what the real purpose of the film was, what the real ending was, what the intent was, etc <br/><br/>* the one single scene where the young girl has to enter a subterranean land and retrieve artifacts WITHOUT EATING THE FOOD ON THE TABLE is in many ways scarier than the scariest horror films you could name. Moreso because the audience knows how hungry she was and empathizes. It reminded me of the Cyclops scene in the 1950s 7th Voyage of Sinbad, considered a classic of its own.<br/><br/>* the scenes of violence (and there are many) are done so well you can almost taste the copper in the blood on screen <br/><br/>One of the best films ever made"
"ejavignon","10","38","59","28 February 2007"," It really deserves all the acclaim
","The negative reviews of this film on IMDb seem to fall into two categories: a) it was too violent b) the fantasy element was too muted<br/><br/>Without getting too political, worse things are going on in the world at this very moment than were depicted in this film. While many people prefer entertainment that insulates them from the harsh realities of this world, one shouldn't get so indignant when a film portrays the world for what it is. Capitán Vidal was a fictitious character, but there are plenty of people exactly like him. Humans are capable of terrible atrocities and looking the other way does nothing to improve our nature. If violence offends people so much they should do something about real violence rather than writing nasty reviews about depictions of it.<br/><br/>The violence set a tone of desperation for Ofelia. Fairy tales themselves are extremely violent, and Disney cartoons are nothing like the stories they were based on. This film was rated R. What were you expecting?<br/><br/>It is easier to understand people who thought the fantasy element was eclipsed, and were maybe hoping for another Narnia or one of the other countless fantasy flicks that has come out in the wake of LOTR. This film touched on many of the most fundamental themes of mythology, such as parallel worlds, dangerous tasks, hidden identities, sacrifice, and death. It did something more than the standard fantasy movie, which is part of why it was such a great film."
"zetes","7","132","229","21 January 2007"," It's good, but nowhere near as good as the reviews would have you believe
","I had unsurmountable expectations for this one, and, alas, they remain unsurmounted. It didn't even come close. It is an entertaining film, but, as a whole, it feels half-baked. Near the end of the Spanish Civil War, a little girl, Ofelia, is taken with her pregnant mother to an old mill, where her new husband, a sadistic army captain, awaits. At the mill, she meets a fairy who leads her to a faun, who asks her to perform three tasks so she might take her place as princess of a magical kingdom. It's less a fantasy film than a fairy tale. In that way, I suppose I'm obliged to forgive that its fantasy world goes completely unrealized and remains paper thin throughout. Honestly, except for a couple of sequences, there really isn't a fantasy world. Most of the film takes place in the real world, where the Captain is trying to rid the area of some pesky rebels and Ofelia's mother is struggling to survive her difficult pregnancy. What is much harder to forgive, though, is that Guillermo del Toro extends the two-dimensionality to the Spanish Civil War setting. The Captain is a completely cartoonish bad guy, and the situation is seen completely in black and white. I mean, we're talking about a real conflict here where many people died. It's kind of insulting. If this were an American made film, people would be railing against it. It's also insulting to Spirit of the Beehive, on which del Toro has said he based the film. Where Spirit is a gentle yet effective study on the nature of human cruelty, Pan celebrates human cruelty with extremely violent sequences which are meant to be enjoyed as they are in action films (the director did, of course, previously make Blade II and Hellboy). Wow, it sounds like I hated this film! I didn't, really. I have some ideological problems with it, obviously, and I wish it were better than it is. But it is an enjoyable little horror/fantasy film. You could do better, but you could do worse, too."
"stob88","6","159","293","6 February 2007"," Good, but not as good as they'll have you believe
","I went into this movie with no expectations, except that I'd see a Spanish-language, adult-oriented fantasy film with English subtitles. I think unmet expectations can hurt people in two ways: either the film disappoints them and they are overly critical as a result, or they are disappointed but too biased to admit it. I think the latter has led to an exceedingly generous rating for this particular film. Is it good? Yes. Is it the 65th best (according to current IMDb ratings) movie of all time? Not even close.<br/><br/>It is an interesting, original story. Virtually every actor appearing in the film is superb. The imagery is magnificent. Like I said, it is a good picture. However, I am puzzled as to why it is praised so highly. I would have a greater appreciation for the film if its adult-oriented nature was due to its substance, such as an intellectual, sophisticated and enigmatic storyline. It is adult-oriented, however, merely because of a few choice phrases and displays of graphic violence. This is not a film that is breaking new ground. It is too simplistic throughout, becomes fairly predictable, and lacks fluidity. The unimaginative way in which the fantasy elements come and go was a real put off. The 65th best movie of all time should have the fantastic elements blended seamlessly with the human elements. It should continue being original throughout. It should challenge the viewer in new and engaging ways. It should not merely curse, show some blood, and have pretty imagery.<br/><br/>Please, see this movie and enjoy it. I truly did. I also, however, allowed myself to make a realistic assessment afterward. I expect that the rating will come down as the novelty of an adult-oriented fantasy picture wears off. Maybe I missed something, but I doubt a specious film like this can conceal such intricacies."

","Carmen has married Captain Vidal and, pregnant with his son, travels with her daughter Ofelia to join him in his woodland barracks where he is trying to quash the small bands of rebellion against the Fascist regime. Carmen is not well and Vidal immediately puts her into the care of Dr Ferreiro who confines her to her bed after a short time. Vidal is a cruel man, perhaps hardened by the battle he fights and the beliefs he holds and Ofelia finds him to have no time for her and her no interest in him. While she tries to cope with the reality of her new life she also finds herself taken by a fairy into a dark underworld where a faun offers her a new life as a princess if she completes a series of tasks for him.<br/><br/>With all the papers and amateur reviewers here putting this film high up the list of best films of 2006 I rued that I missed my chance to see the film when it originally came out but got the opportunity recently on holiday in Cornwall at what my girlfriend called the ""smallest cinema on earth"" (it wasn't but it must have been close). Perhaps the weight of expectation on the film played a part but I confess to have enjoyed it but not found the masterpiece that the majority have claimed. The film works pretty well and has a very strong central narrative which, contrary to the marketing, is actually the real world and not the fantasy. This is an engaging real-world horror that focuses on the struggle between guerrilla fighters and the fascists led by Vidal. On the other side of the coin we have the fantasy involving Ofelia where, like the real world, she finds a world of darkness where she is not entirely sure who to trust. Now my main problem with the film is the overlap between these two elements and how they fit together.<br/><br/>I have read others say that the fantasy echoes the real world but, as much as I want to see this, it just didn't ring true for me. On a very basic level I get it but that is different from the film cleverly weaving them together and making it work. This separation detracted from both aspects of the story (although less so the real parts) and also saw the fantasy be only partially explained and harder to become really engaged with. My girlfriend said she felt the story was simplistic enough to work best for older children and that the ""horror"" part was therefore too harsh as it prevented this audience getting in the door (in the UK this was rated a 15). At first I agreed with her but on reflection it actually works the other way because this is much more of an adult tale but just doesn't quite have the intelligence and complexity in all parts of the story (again specifically the fantasy).<br/><br/>By this point my review will have been slated by all readers who are not used to a dissenting voice but for those who have made it this far let me just say that it is a very good film overall and that I did enjoy it. Outside of the plot there is much to enjoy as well. The writing is very good and the dialogue (albeit subtitled) interesting and never clunky or obvious even if some of the scenes would have made it easy for it to be so. The fantasy world is wonderfully created and engagingly dark with the creatures a mix of wonder and menace. The faun himself is good and well used although it was a shame to see such a terrifying vision such as the pale man so briefly used and with little expansion beyond a lurching menace in one scene. Del Toro directs well across all aspects of the film and keeps this sense of dark menace across everything. I also liked the references scattered across the narrative, such as Alice in Wonderland to name one in particular. He directs his cast well too, drawing a very good performance from Baquero in the central role. López could have hammed it up but, while he doesn't really make a person here, he avoids being a pantomime baddie. Verdú is strong as Mercedes while Gil is good but left with little to do outside of suffer and worry. Jones does well within his creatures to deliver the potential within the design.<br/><br/>Overall then not strong enough in important ways to make it the classic everyone is hailing it as but certainly interesting and engaging enough to be one of stronger films of 2006. Visually impressive and very well delivered, I'm afraid I just found it hard to get over the disconnect between the two aspects of the story no matter how much I wanted to find it."
"zgamer-1","10","30","49","23 May 2007"," Closest Thing To Art That Film Has Experienced In Years
","I just finished the movie today and I must say that this is by far one of the most artistic and beautiful movies I have seen in years. The producers of the film were right to call this a modern fairytale, since it has all the ingredients for an authentic Brothers Grimm story. Just don't expect there to be lots of happy faces in the film. This is a real, bloody (very bloody), moody, emotional fairy tale just like the ones in the past.<br/><br/>First of all, I have to say that the technical design in this film was astounding. The art direction was spot on for all the locations, whether its the imaginary world of the labyrinth or the mill that the fascists call their base. The music is some of the best I've heard in a film for a long time, drawing that fantasy feel of the movie perfectly and inspiring so many emotions in one chord than other films could in their whole screening. The sound was top notch as well, never sounding like just a compilation of reused sound effects. And of course, the make-up design is flawless and imaginative. The biggest shock was the cinematography. Now, I personally thought Children of Men should have got the Oscar for this, but understand now why this won. Each shot is beautifully staged, colored and detailed in a way that they cease to be movie shots and become portraits of art.<br/><br/>Guillermo Del Toro really surprised me. Not only did he assemble a surprisingly talented cast, but he was able to make you really connect with the situation. The characters are all well developed and the symbolism, though subtle, is so delicious that it makes me tingle with the thought of it. The dialogue is natural and authentic and he handles the film expertly to convey that timeless feel even through some of the film's harsher moments. You really feel this is a labor of love, since it bears its fruits at every scene. I didn't even mind that I had to read subtitles (which I think Del Toro knew that he would have to use it wisely, since the scenes are designed so you are not distracted reading the text to enjoy the scene).<br/><br/>If I had any complaints, its that some of the visual effect designs were sometimes inferior. They weren't bad, but they had some rough edges that should have been addressed.<br/><br/>I recommend this for anyone who has a strong stomach, an eye for art and a heart. It deserved all its Oscar wins and noms and should have won for its amazing music. This is the new standard for film art for the modern generation."
"Galina_movie_fan","6","81","149","26 May 2007"," Entartaining but not one of the very best movies from last year
","When I heard first time about the movie made by the Mexican director Guillermo del Toro that was a mixture of many genres, including drama, fantasy, thriller, and fairy tale for adults that takes place in Spain of 1944 in two parallel words, one of unbearable bleak and horrifying reality, and the other of deliciously dark magic fantasy, I wanted very much to see it. I knew that the movie has been praised by many critics and has made hundreds top lists of last year, that it was nominated for countless awards including six Academy awards and it won three Oscars, and that it had received 20 minutes standing ovation at Cannes. The main reason for me was the fact that I love del Toro's earlier film, ""The Devil's Backbone"" (2001), the ultimate ghost story that goes beyond the genre and very successfully mixes horror, suspense, and coming of age during the war time story.<br/><br/>I hoped and expected ""Pan's Labyrinth"" to be as compelling, insightful, interesting, and engaging as ""The Devil's Backbone"" was. I finally saw ""Pan's Labyrinth"" couple of days ago and I was disappointed. The movie has an interesting concept, even if not original one. It brings to mind many famous works of literature and the earlier movies about the little girls escaping their dreadful realities of war or death of the loved ones or all sorts of abuse in the world of their imagination such as ""Forbidden Games"", ""Spirits of the Beehive"" (which ""Pan's Labyrinth"" tried to be but never was), the later also takes place in Spain during the Civil war, as well as ""Wizard of Oz"", ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Legends and Myths of Ancient Greece"". <br/><br/>One movie that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" has been often compared to is Terry Gilliam's ""Tideland"", his fairy tale for adults, his ""Alice in Wonderland meets Psycho"" which also tells the story of an 11-years-old girl and her world of imagination. ""Tideland"" was released last year and was either ignored or hated by majority of critics and left many viewers puzzled and confused. I am not completely in love with ""Tideland"" but I found it much more interesting that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" in all aspects. The main difference between the two - Gillian does not present reality in his film in the simplistic way and does not divide his characters to devilish monsters or shining knights the way Del Toro does in ""Pan Labyrinth"". <br/><br/>I am not sure what the target audience for Del Toro's film is? Its story (the writer/director was nominated for the best screenplay and I found his writing the weakest and most ridiculous part of the movie) is so naive and primitive that you would think the movie was made for children but its shocking violence and horrifying tortures are not easy to watch even for adults. Another problem is with the characters. I know I should sympathize with Ofelia, and who would not feel empathy for an 11-year-old girl who had to live through the death of her mother and to confront her monstrous step-father but if frankly, her character is not very interesting. As for visual effects and cinematography, the film looks good but not especially spectacular or breathtakingly beautiful. Of five Oscar nominated films for best cinematography from last year, at least three seemed to be more interesting. Gilliam's ""Tideland"" that was completely ignored by the Academy, is always technically superb, visually arresting and much more impressive than ""Pan's Labyrinth"". <br/><br/>I should admit that at least one scene in ""Labyrinth"" was absolutely brilliant - dark and scary it came directly from Francisco Goya's terrifying painting, ""Saturn Devouring His Children"" and it was extremely imaginative. I would not go as far as calling ""Pan's Labyrinth"" a bad movie and give it one star. It is not bad; it is just not as great as I thought it would be. As for all the awards, ""The Devil's Backbone"" is much more deserving than ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and that's the film I would give a standing ovation to."
"williejk","9","13","19","18 February 2016"," A Gothic Masterpiece
","Playing moments of true wonderment off scenes of sadistic brutality, Guillermo del Toro has created an epithet for classical fairy tales reminiscent of the traditional stories which amazed - yet simultaneously frightened - children.<br/><br/>Del Toro offers us two worlds through the perspective of young Ofelia. The first - reality - is the cruelty of Franco's Spain; where Ofelia is whisked away to her sadistic step-father (played brilliantly by Sergi Lopez) who is attempting to root out the last remnants of the Republic. The second - fantasy - is the underground kingdom - or more precisely the promise of such a world - as Ofelia must complete three tasks for the beautifully constructed faun in order to prove her worth of being a part of such a utopia. What elevates Pan's Labyrinth above other fantasises, however, is the fact that its reality sequences are just as intriguing as its fantasy elements - a rare feat - and the two meld together perfectly.<br/><br/>For instance, the faun may offer interestingly ambiguous revelations about Ofelia's destiny, but only if she follows his orders. Yet he doesn't necessarily mean what he says, and the presence of the Fascists in Ofelia's reality suggests that blindly following orders is the complete opposite of what she should do. So, while there are trips into the magical world (including a disturbing yet inherently memorable scene with the hieronymus bosch-like spectre known as the 'Pale Man') they do not overwhelm the film.<br/><br/>The true horror and the meat of the story lies in Falangist Spain with the menacing Captain Vidal, who takes delight in torture - ritually preparing his tool kit and reciting his own speech to demoralise his victims - and who is equally obsessed with the continuation of his bloodline. The fantasy world is indeed where Ofelia's lessons are learned so that she may confront the terrors of reality; the most important of which being the need for courageous disobedience in the face of extreme oppression. Pan's Labyrinth therefore successfully and perfectly captures the essence of classical children's literature; combining fantasy with moments of horror, all with an underlying and ultimately crucial message which we must take head of in reality. The final scene is also a true whopper; with a killer of a send-off line and an ambiguous ending which still fuels debates to this day.<br/><br/>Thankfully, del Toro uses CGI sparingly, although it is very obvious when it is used (particularly in the case of the giant toad) but this doesn't detract from the film's overall brilliance. It's dark, at times disturbing, but nevertheless beautiful, a true Gothic tale if there ever was one."
"tomhbrand","10","42","75","14 December 2006"," A Truly Modern Fairytale
","Guillermo del Toro how to tell a real fairy tale. A fairy tale that isn't all princesses, princes, magical fairies and happy endings. It might have them, but the point that has been sanitised out of fairy tales over the last century or so is the fact that they were originally cautionary tales for children, handed down through generations of oral tradition to teach children what life is. And what is the one fact that children should learn as soon as possible? That life is nasty!<br/><br/>Laberinto del Fauno (titled Pan's Labyrinth here, though no mention is ever made to the faun in the film being Pan) is the story of Ofelia, a little girl forced to move with her pregnant mother to rural Spain to be near her step-father, a Captain in the fascist army during the Spanish Civil War. As she experiences first hand the horrors of war and fascism, she enters an ancient maze and meets a faun who tells her she is a lost Princess of an underground kingdom and must pass three tests to claim her place there.<br/><br/>I will admit that I went into this film expecting a nice, children friendly movie, but del Toro pulls no punches when it comes to the war, a war he experienced as a child. It's hard sometimes to decide what was more important to the director; Ofelia's story, or whether that was just a backdrop to highlight all the more the cruelty and brutality of the war.<br/><br/>There are no Indiana Jones style comedy Nazis here, the fascists are truly evil and we see it. Both the violence (which is just graphic enough to prevent us from being able to ignoring it without ever being gratuitous) and the mindsets of the people involved. What is more disturbing that any of the on screen actions is the attitude of 'pull the ladder up jack, I'm alright' of those who find themselves in privileged positions. Ariadna Gil, as Ofelia's mother showcases this perfectly. She knows full well what Vidal thinks of her only as a vessel for him unborn son, and that he probably killed Ofelia's father, but she never seems to resent him. Neither does she ever seem to love him. What you get is more a kind of relief, she knows that as long as he has a use for her she and her daughter are safe. It's purely self preservation, to know your place and survive, and that is more disturbing to me than anything else in the film.<br/><br/>Sometimes it's even almost as if Ofelia's quest is the subplot, as even fantastical tales of giant toads, fauns, a magical kingdom, the Pale Man (a horrific creature with it's eye in its hands) pale into insignificance when we're faced with the true life horrors that we see mankind inflict upon itself.<br/><br/>And that's one of the most interesting aspects of the story. Even as everything goes on around her, as the Civil War rages around her, her mothers life lies in Captain Vidal hands, what can the innocent do. Ofelia is not part of this world, she hasn't had a hand in creating it and she does not have a hand in affecting it's outcome. The faun and his quests are, to her at least, far more important as they are something that she is involved in, that are about her.<br/><br/>On the technical side this is a beautifully crafted film. The cinematography and sets are wonderful, never once setting a difference between the real and the fantasy. Both aspects of the film seem just as important to del Toro, some directors would have favoured one or the other sides of the story and that would have made the film unbalanced.<br/><br/>It's clearly influenced by many fairy tales, and a nice touch is, like many movie fairy tales, we never certain whether the fantasy is real. Is Ofelia really a lost princess from a magical kingdom, or are all her adventures and meetings purely from her imagination, one of the stories she tells to her unborn brother expanded to protect her from the nightmares of real life? What Guillermo del Toro has done with this film is to create a beautiful fairy tale masterpiece that harks back to the days when fairy tales were told around a fire to scare children, not read at bedtime to put them to sleep. But despite what I said earlier about this not being a children's film, take some to see it and I still think they'd enjoy it, even if it was from behind the cushion."
"tedg","Null","59","112","27 January 2007"," Thuggish
","I get annoyed at movies that preach one thing and are themselves another.<br/><br/>The story here has two components, a real and fantasy thread. The real world thread is simple. By that I mean there are no dramatic complications at all. The characters are theatrical cartoons. The situation starts out brutally and stays that way without any arc, development, evolution. It is in fact a formula movie, this thread, and one that follows a formula that is based on strict, strict boundaries. One would suspect it was written by a German, it is so regimented. One would almost believe it to be written by ""The Captain,"" the bad guy here.<br/><br/>It marches. Its unambiguous. Its final and brutal in its morality, just as the Captian is. There are only good and bad people and the bad are not only very, very bad but they get their deserts. Justice isn't nuanced here. In fact nothing at all is.<br/><br/>I suppose people celebrate it for its fantasy thread. Yes, the effects are good. Yes the creepy eyeless man was creepy. Yes the Tinkerbells were Tinkerbelly. But is this in any way better than ""Dark Crystal,"" which was similarly banal in its cosmology?<br/><br/>Look, I'm one of the ones who get depressed at things like ""The Matrix,"" but if lacking in imagination, is copying was deep, complex, manylayered. This is something that Franco would have written, and little fascist parents would have trotted to, because its all about absolutes and the inability of humans to be rich, subtle, varied beings.The best we can do, is be ""innocent.""<br/><br/>I often can see some good in any film. But not this one. The world is too close to intolerant extremism as it is.

"CineCritic2517","1","189","392","8 February 2007"," Recycled clichés in plodding storyline.
","I stuck around for this movie to serve something not yet seen or experienced in dozens of related films which I was so sure this movie would provide. Sadly, that moment never came.<br/><br/>Although I have no complaints with the acting and setdesigns which were on par with any quality movie, there are basically three things that deprive this movie of being anything great.<br/><br/>1. Though truly beautifully shot, Pan's two sided scenario with the Good vs Evil Children's-picture on the one side and a drama/war-movie on the other, provides no deeper layers. A 'what you see is what you get' type of film in which the fantasy part seemed more or less something that would look nice on the adverts in combination with a superabundance of very graphic violence in a foreign movie which offers a subterfuge to sell something slight and cursory as profound and insightful. <br/><br/>2. Since there is no thread running through both the scenario's it is like watching two different movies which bear very little to each other nor compliment the other. Because I liked the fantasy part zealously better than the war/drama bit, I was very disappointed that it had no follow-through and that it in the end just seemed like a shameless cloned-off short-impression of movies like Alice in Wonderland, The Wizzard of Ozz and The never Ending Story, to name but a few, but never with a meaningful reference of any kind. It is almost like the writers hit behind the fact that they never even saw these movies. <br/><br/>3.There is just nothing subtle in the story that draws you in, I found it all annoyingly superficial and cliché. It never invites you to share the little girl's fantastic world or truly reject El Capitan's actions because it is all far too black and white. Plus the film leaves no room for any other interpretation aside from the one which is already painted elaborately on its cinematic walls. Something I find quite odd since most true children's pictures have a lot underlying messages and symbolism. The more I think about it, the more this story just seems lazily written or without any terribly interesting thought behind it. -In the end of it all, there is simply no hope-..nothing more than a flipflop of any and all sappy-happy-endings Hollywood has been laying on us for years on end. <br/><br/>Furthermore, with style over substance as its forté the movie tends to plod tremendously at times. And since none of the characters are really focused on, they all just seem to be stereotypes and are hence neither likable nor unlikable despite their (too) obvious good or bad demeanors. Vidal is simply bad, mom is simply weak and Ofelia was nothing more than the little girl playing with imaginary friends in the corner of the room.<br/><br/>This film is alas just another example of a movie where they just don't seem to be able to get it both ways (powerful story AND powerful cinematography) which is the Achilles' heel of many a film lately but which oddly doesn't seem to bother the average moviegoer nor professional movie-critic who somehow seem to think that foreign+different=Masterpiece."
"siegewulf","2","114","234","1 February 2007"," A Terrible Misfire...
","I seem to be among the only people who consider this movie to be a terrible mis-fire, on a par with Shyamalan's *Lady in the Water* and Gilliam's ""The Brothers Grimm"".<br/><br/>So be it. I shall back that claim up.<br/><br/>Many people are reportedly enjoying the movie's ability to 're-interpret traditional fairy tale motifs'.<br/><br/>If only that was what del Toro was up to, here. He didn't re-interpret anything. He just grabbed a bunch of classic themes and plot points (the three tasks; the magical guide; the unexplained magic rocks that are the bane of an evil creature for some reason; the magic book that foretells the future; the golden key and the choice of key-holes; the prohibition against eating in the underworld that is broken simply because it would be no fun if it weren't; the magical creatures that adults can't see because they aren't really there; the young girl on the cusp of puberty who fears her growing sexuality and capacity for reproduction and so retreats into a fantasy world to deal with her traumatic environment; the climactic flight into a maze that is conveniently nearby) and threw them into a ridiculously drawn shadow of the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War. <br/><br/>On this front, Sergi Lopez and his lame impression of Ralph Fiennes in *Schindler's List* was particularly outrageous. The points which are meant to build him into a threatening character were always taken from elsewhere, and, even worse, always CAME ACROSS as points meant to build him into a threatening character: his vaguely harassing caress of Mercedes' shoulder; his rampant chauvinism; his graphic crushing of an innocent farmer's face; his slashing at his own reflected throat with a straight razor; his tortured relationship with his dead father's watch...etc. At no time did he seem like anything more than a caricature.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this was not unusual. <br/><br/>The overall weak characterization meant that any real sense of Fascist Spain was just entirely missing, and the brief fantasy sequences lacked any real resonance.<br/><br/>The dinner party was meant to relate the connections between the wealthy, the church and the Fascists, but it was too short to register.<br/><br/>The faun himself had few lines, and was entirely cryptic. If Ofelia was simply dreaming him up, this perhaps accounts for the fact that she was never, not for one second, surprised that a giant faun was offering her faeries and tasks, but not his complete lack of any helpful, world-building clues. And, since we are not welcomed into his world, the threat of its destruction simply doesn't matter to us. <br/><br/>The predicament of Mercedes didn't make any sense. Why was she not in the mountains with her lover? Was her ability to sneak mail and keys to (hilariously flimsy) wooden doors out to the rebels really so essential? In fact, having a few female rebels would have been more authentic and less offensive than having them all chopping potatoes for the Captain. Did anyone for one second think that she would not find some use for that blade she kept tucked into her dress? Why did she not kill Vidal when he was at her mercy? She had no trouble later on. (Was it really because he needed to live in order to continue driving the plot? Because that would be pathetic.)<br/><br/>Did Ofelia's mother actually say, out loud, that she married a cold, brutal psychopath who made it clear that he valued her only as a vessel for childbirth, simply because she was 'lonely'? What the hell was up with that? (I mean, as the widow of a tailor, it isn't as though she needed to marry a soldier in order to maintain her accustomed level of luxury. Why be so massively anti-feminist simply because you can?) <br/><br/>The death of the doctor, who tries to make a moral statement despite offering his skills to the Fascists whom he hates, was also hackneyed. (Hint: Don't turn your 'sympathetic' character into a cowardly Fascist collaborator who is so terrified of losing his sense of privilege that he would rather euthanize rebels than fight alongside them.)<br/><br/>The attempts to work in allegories of change (the death of Vidal, the fact that his son would never know of him, the sly glances at 'Red Propaganda' which claims that we are all equal) also caused me to frown.<br/><br/>Franco won in '39, the 'heroic' rebels (who were just as given to atrocity) were hunted to extinction, and the Fascists ruled well into the 1970s, ruining the lives of further millions; socialism in the Spanish-speaking countries turned out to be just as bad. Just what the hell is del Toro getting at? He seems very muddled. <br/><br/>Even the special effects, which are getting excellent press, were cartoonish and poorly executed. (The toad that vomited up its tongue wouldn't have been out of place in *The Phantom Menace*, nor would the fairies whom Ofelia never quite seemed to be looking at...and did I actually spot a goddamn elf-ear on Ofelia's resurrected mother? Leftover sets and props from the Lord of the Rings, I suppose.)<br/><br/>The overall lesson seems to have been that innocence is lost, and death is everywhere, so the only course is to delude oneself to the point that you are willing to trust 'the voices'. Ofelia needed psychiatric treatment, not a richer fantasy life. There was no value, to my mind, in her visions or her death. And that WAS a tragedy, of a different kind than the one intended. <br/><br/>I could go on but I'll stop there. <br/><br/>PS. If you thought that this film was excellent, just wait until *Coraline* comes out. Then you might see a truly re-interpreted fairy tale, with a greater depth of explanation, mystery and menace."
"fabulousrice","8","24","42","19 November 2006"," The Labyrinth of Del Toro
","Guillermo Del Toro shows an incredible amount of passion for his job. In interviews, in festivals, it is undeniable that this man adores making films, from one end of the creative process to another, and has tremendous energy and honesty for the activity. Nevertheless, there is something that doesn't function in his films, and as heartbreaking as it is to see someone with ideas and talent fail, this film isn't an exception and has a few weak points as well as his other ones. For some reasons explained further, it isn't even a ""true"" fantasy film. I have to stress upon how wonderful and magnificent the imagery - not just of this film but of all his films - is. Man-like creatures, caves, labyrinths, statues, puzzles, everything that contributed over the years to make Del Toro's imagery makes him a very powerful visual director, which times like these are in desperate lack of. The visions he projects onto the screen make him no less than a visionary. The thing that fails to give his film(s) the grandeur they need, though, seems to be always the same element: character depth / psychological analysis of his characters / the way the characters and their personalities blend into the rest of the film. Maybe we can attribute it to Del Toro having more patience to polish the sequences with special effects than the ones with actors, but in particular in this film, the characters seem to have no depth at all, they are grounded to feel one emotion at a time. Ofelia in the film is shown owning and reading books, but her relation to these books, what they mean to her, what they bring her, this relation is never shown or explained, we have to go by a stereotype and ""assume"" for ourselves that she has a wild imagination. The mother of Ofelia is also a faulty character of the story, we the audience have to fill a gap, and imagine for ourselves why shy would be attracted by Vidal, what brings her to be forced to stay with a monster like Vidal as opposed to remaining a single mother, etc... Vidal himself is very quickly presented: we know his lineage was military and that his father let him have his watch... not much of an emotional background for a man who tortures and kills with no hesitation! We know nothing of Vidal as a child, we only have this one-dimension, Manichean character. The list goes on, and none of the characters - Mercedes and Pablo, the doctor, etc, are presented or explained to the viewer. The same could be said about the elements of the illusory world. Usually, though, fantasy/horror films don't need any explanations (see Edward Scissorhands, Alien, Legend...), but this one would need to have some, and this is probably due to the state of psychological confusion of the characters (or, should I say, their irrationality). Ofelia, throughout the film, seems to live in constant fear of the tyrant Vidal, yet finds enough time and solace to go on imaginary journeys at night, and light-heartedly do anything the faun asks her, without even questioning or wondering where it will lead her. Mercedes, when given the opportunity to gut Vidal and be finished with him, leaves him alive half-way. And the doctor itself, whose side on the events is never clear, never poisons Vidal or puts himself in the way when given opportunities. Is Guillermo Del Toro cold? We might wonder. He has absolutely no scruples when he tries to shock the audience with violence towards nice characters, with monsters, with blood. Yet when his overall goal is to make a fantasy film, he remains a little bit too polite and shy to really break into the genre. To me, a ""real"" fantasy film would have had the imaginary break in the ""reality"". Yet Vidal doesn't see the faun, the faun doesn't save anyone or scares Vidal. Reality remains reality and fantasy remains inside the heads. The imaginary world in itself seemed a bit poor because of that, because of the film not really being a fantasy film, keeping the fantasy inside the head of its protagonist and reducing the spectrum of illusions (which are never directly opposed to the ""realist"" world). Overall, the film shows great academicism, not just by politely keeping the imaginary and the reality separated, but also by the decisions of the film-makers (the editing is gentle when it should be a bit punchier, the camera moves are scarce, the music is incredibly lame and boring, the camera angles are overall inexistent, etc).<br/><br/>I have no idea whether Del Toro will or will not provide better character depth and psychological progression in his next films, but it flaws the films he has made so far. Yes, there is a beautiful message, we've heard it before, of how monsters can be monsters on the inside and humans on the outside, while some monsters look like monsters and aren't all that bad after all. But until the characters and the story have a real depth and meaning to the audience, none of all the fantasy, violence or special effects will mean anything. The blunt reality as it is shown here, carries so much depression in it that the message of poetic escapism doesn't function in the end. The task is difficult to propel kids in wartime eras, it is even more difficult when fantasy takes part in it. Del Toro's next films will, hopefully, dig deeper into its characters."

Someone must have exaggerated the length of time by at least 18 minutes. That or those apparently ecstatic people were drunk. Don't get me wrong this is a good film. But the praise this is getting from critics and people writing here is way over the top. I was fully expecting a work of real vision and/or originality but what I experienced was a film that borrows from other films and admittedly gels everything together into a cohesive and impressive whole. A lot of great films do the same but 'Pans Labrynth' has other faults that prevent it from being put in the same category as the truly great films. <br/><br/>'Pans Labrynth' at times is too predictable - a side effect from borrowing from other films - therefore some scenes feel clichéd. Also the tasks the girl has to complete in order to take her place as princess could have been more imaginatively realized. Finally the message/point/allegory of the film is trite and simplistic. Still worth watching but is this really one of the top 100 films of all time? Not even close..."

","It is really interesting that a movie so enjoyed by some viewers can be so annoying for others. This is my general impression when I read reviews on IMDb. Pan's Labyrinth (PL) is the most typical example when it's completely incomprehensible for me how a movie can be so highly rated. The only amazing aspect of this movie is that so many viewers find it so great. OK, for sure it's visually beautiful and unusual in terms of story-telling technique, but the story is so unpleasant, one-dimensional and pointless that I just to wanted to get away from the cinema (which almost never happens).<br/><br/>Since I do not understand how anyone can find this movie enjoying, I will just try help you people who get disturbed by the same movie elements as myself. So if you often find the following aspects annoying in movies you should be careful before buying a ticket to this one.<br/><br/>* Over-simplification of evil through characters that are extremely bad for no obvious reason (black or white - no gray scales) <br/><br/>* Extreme violence that is completely pointless and makes you feel sick<br/><br/>* Sympathetic characters that you are supposed to sympathize with immediately without really getting to know them <br/><br/>* Two parallel story-paths (fantasy vs reality), none of which has any absorbing plot, and are completely unrelated to each other during most of the movie<br/><br/>Normally I hate when people express their anger and give a 1 star rating because they hate a movie that everyone else finds so great, so the only good thing about PL is that I can at least start to understand how people can become so angry with a so called cinematic masterpiece.<br/><br/>PS. My interpretation is that PL is a movie for artistic people that enjoy getting emotional through fuzzy fairy tales about good and evil, whereas it is not a movie for thinking people that wants to attain a higher understanding of the good and evil in man with some structure and logical congruence in the end. OK, PL actually has some congruence in the end, but this doesn't save a movie that is simply repugnant from start to finish."

","As I see movies made within the past 20 years climb the ranks of the IMDb top 250 with alarming speed, I wonder what on earth is happening. I see that this movie is at #41, higher than Chinatown, The Third Man, To Kill a Mockingbird, Alien, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Metropolis, and even The Wizard of Oz. Does Pan's Labyrinth deserve such high praise? Yes, it is steeped in intellectual metaphor and is crafted in such a Philip K. Dickian manner that the audience is left wondering what was real in the film. I applaud the filmmakers abilities in this manner, but regarding what they are willing to portray, they have the restraint of sociopaths. This movie contains some of the most wretched, horrific violence and psychologically uncomfortable character interactions I have ever seen in a film. Early in the movie, we watch as the cruel Captain Vidal crushes the face of an innocent young man while his helpless father watches. Vidal shoots the father moments later, after the man had to watch his son die in front of him. <br/><br/>Art is no longer on the minds of movie makers, instead they revel in their abilities to accurately replicate grisly murders and terrible nightmares. Suggesting violence gives way to indulging in the talents of the make up artists and the FX men. Subtlety and metaphor are discarded so the audience is not simply a witness to gruesome murders, but is forced to be a part of them. The story, fascinating as its concept may be, is buried under layers of constant uncomfortableness. There is no relief for the audience. Thanks to the movie establishing the evil of Vidal early on, the audience squirms in dreaded anticipation for what his next cruel act will be, and who he will direct his wrath towards. The movie ultimately delivers, committing the cardinal sin that a movie can make: showing the graphic death of a child. Pay It Forward tried this bit of emotional manipulation, and lost any credibility it had as a story. The narrative was lost, the escapism destroyed. Once the innocent little girl died in Pan's Labyrinth, the audience remembers that they're watching a story and their emotions are being toyed with.<br/><br/>I despise seeing such films because I ultimately feel anger not towards the characters in the films, but at the filmmakers themselves for presenting me with such atrocities. I know Pan's Labyrinth is based in folklore, but I don't believe for a second that this is any kind of fairy tale. When a parent reads a child Hansel and Gretel, the visuals are very cartoony and are relayed through the buffer of said parent. With this ""film,"" there is nothing but blood seeping from the mouth of an innocent little girl to tell the audience that the fairy tale is over. A fairy tale for adults? That's false advertising and I hope that all with weak stomachs are fairly warned."

","I was warned that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" had some violent content, but I was not prepared for the senseless brutality, cruelty, and depravity that this pointless horror film contained. It left me feeling disgusted and angry at the people who wrote this piece of trash. Beyond the sophisticated production and excellent special effects, I have nothing whatsoever to say in favor of this ultimately nihilistic, pseudo-mythic-poetic fairy tale. It has no grace, no wit, no soul. I would never even mention this film in the same breath as ""Lord of the Rings"" or ""Chronicles of Narnia,"" which are both on an entirely different level altogether. And yet this film is rated at #41 on the IMDb Top 250 film list--higher than ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" ""Alien,"" and even ""The Wizard of Oz""! This has a lot to say about the graceless and degenerate age in which we live, and about del Toro himself, who, by virtue of this film, has shown himself to be quite in step with the prevailing moral climate of today.<br/><br/>The reviews, marketing, and previews would lead you to believe that this film was a fantasy tale for both children and adults to enjoy, which it most assuredly is not. What you really have is an utterly grim war drama with a touch of fantasy thrown in for good measure. But both of these elements are not confluent and the juxtaposition only serves to muddle the film and create an incoherent whole. Graphic depictions of amputations, wanton killing, and what I consider to be the most reprehensible act of all--the senseless murder of an innocent childmake ""Pan's Labyrinth"" irredeemable in my eyes.<br/><br/>I think that any society that can embrace this psychotic and sadistic film as art is in danger of imminent decline. Anyone with a sensitive soul and kind heart will quickly see through the subterfuge parading itself as fantasy and recognize the beast for what it truly is."

I'm so glad I didn't see this in a movie theater, as it would have been severely traumatizing. Thankfully, this nightmare was a rental DVD from the local video store and I'm headed out the door to return it as soon as this review is posted. I don't want this sadistic violation of my senses and my spirit in my home any longer than necessary.<br/><br/>If you are a sensitive person with a kind heart, a vivid imagination, and a rich inner life, do yourself a favor and do NOT expose yourself to this psychotic splatterfest."

","Not sure what the point is here: cool graphics? This is a film with a child's fairy tale storyline and adult violence. Evil is pure evil, goodness is purely good. There is only one truly complex character in the film - looking out for the little girl though not believing in fairy tales, distrusting of the world, yet full of idealism and love.<br/><br/>Aside from adding realistic and violent imagery (in both the real and magical elements), I don't see that this is much of an update or significant (valuable) reworking of of a typical fairy tale. Perhaps it is in the ending where we get the true point: there is no hope in this world.<br/><br/>I, for one, don't buy it. And the cardboard cut-out characters who supposedly illustrate the point constitute the main problem. The film did nothing for me but leave me grumpy and feeling quite a bit cheated. All the great special effects and phenomenal acting simply serve to cheat us even further: it all serves the function of a facade. Strip it away and there's not much underneath. It is for this reason I am refusing to give this ""bonus points"" for all of it's excellent qualities. These are the very qualities that make the film that much more offensive."
"bdubstater4","1","70","151","6 January 2007"," I have had enough!!!
","I had an entirely different review for this movie written and posted, but after hearing more and more people comment on this ""mystical, haunted wonderland of a movie"", I had to re-write my comment, more out of anger than anything else. First, let me set some guidelines. This is a great movie. It was made with a lot of skill and talent, it is a different approach to story telling and there is a lot to be admired. However, one thing that I simply cannot stand anymore is how exponentially increasing masses of people keep calling this ""one of the best fantasy's ever"", ""a dark and horrific, yet wonderfully creative trip down the rabbit hole"". People, if this is one of the best fantasy's ever, or even of recent times, then all that means is our expectations of what a fantasy should be are sorely lacking. Throughout the entire movie, there are two, count them, TWO scenes that are pure fantasy, and neither one lasts more than perhaps four minutes. The rest of the fantasy takes place in real life situations with subtle hints of fantasy or one or two fantasy characters appearing to talk to the girl. Again, don't jump down my throat too quickly, these scenes are interesting to watch and for light touches of fantasy I think it was very well done, but by no means whatsoever can a movie that is 75% war drama and 25% fantasy, if that, be considered an ""enchanting and mysterious fairy tale"". If anything, it is a dark war drama with innovative and well crafted flairs of fantasy interwoven, but stop reviewing this movie in ways that are going to mislead people into thinking they are going to see a flood of creative and magical imagery!<br/><br/>Possible Spoilers<br/><br/>As a final point, I think the biggest flaw in this movie is that I couldn't help but feel all the mystical elements of the story were, in the end, pointless. They in no way connect to the real world and are more like interesting side notes into the delusions of a little girl while the real world ticks on around her. Say what you will about the themes about losing one's innocence, and how the fantasy might have been real, either way there is a feeling of disappointment when the girl drops dead at the end and we think, ""why did she do all this again? What does this have to do with ANYTHING else we've seen in the movie?"" I was looking for a greater sense of importance to the girl's story. Perhaps the writers weren't going for that, which is fine, but it would have made the movie more enjoyable for me."

It was the accurate typifier for the whole of the movie I was watching. A flat, pointless story with cardboard cutouts as characters which would not have been entertaining even if they had skipped the gore and wardrama and had made it soly a fantasy movie for children.<br/><br/>But no matter, there are two movies for the price of one to be seen.

","Why is it that the complete and total dog turd movies get all the raves? This is no different. If I had wanted to see a slasher flick, I would have gone to one. Unknowingly, I went to this one instead. Sadly, many have been tricked, scammed and lied to over this turd!!!!!! When you walk out of the theater, you'll feel as though you personally were tortured and flayed. Went Saturday night with the hubby and I was horrified, nauseous, angry and so awfully, incredibly disappointed. I kept wondering if I had seen the same ""wonderful"" movie others raved about! I WANTED to like this movie, the premise SOUNDS good. It could have been wonderful if some true imagination had been used. But the actual movie is so not good! The title of this movie should have been ""Spanish Torture"" or ""The Captain's an A-hole!"" I realize that the setting is WWII Spain and therefore the on-going horrors are not nice, but HOW LONG really does the movie need to bang us over the head with this concept??! The audience quickly learns that the Captain is a total heartless douchebag, so there's no need to keep proving it! But endlessly, they do. He kills, tortures, turns just about everyone around him into pulps of blood! They never spend enough time on this fantasy-land the small girl escapes to. For every two minutes of Labyrinth time, you get to suffer through yet another 25 minutes of the Captain's brutality! The violence/gore was persistent. Being a person who does NOT like blood and gore, this movie proved too much for my senses, much too graphic. Constantly, I was hiding my face from said gruesomeness. Every time they showed the Captain, I became nervous over what cruelty he would do next! Also this fantasy-land is not believable as something this girl would escape too. The creatures there were much too scary. A barfing frog, a monster that eats fairies head first, and the demonic faun are just too much! Do everyone you know a favor and DO NOT recommend this awful bloody mess to anyone! Save your time and money."

","Pan's Labyrinth, by Mexican director Guillermo del Toro (Mimic, Chronos, Hellboy), is a serious piece of work, making profound use of its fantasy.<br/><br/>It is Spain, 1944. The brave resistance continues the fight against the fascists. Carmen - Ariadna Gil (Alatriste, Belle Epoque, Revolver), travels to meet her new husband, the fascist Captain Vidal - Sergi Lopez (Dirty Pretty Things, A Pornographic Affair). With her is Ofelia - Ivana Baquero (Rottweiler, Romasanta), her daughter by her first marriage.<br/><br/>Captain Vidal wants his son to be born in Franco's ""new Spain""which he will create by brute force if necessary. The fascists' sadistic repression is demonstrated by violent sequences, such as Captain Vidal beating a poacher to death with a bottle.<br/><br/>Captain Vidal is only concerned for his son and orders the doctor to sacrifice Carmen, if necessary.<br/><br/>Full of fascist disdain for women, Captain Vidal fails to notice that his trusted housekeeper Mercedes - Maribel Verdu (Y tu mamá también, Belle Epoque), is spying for the resistance. He also fails to understand why Dr. Ferreiro - Alex Angulo (The Day of the Beast), does not simply obeyed his orders.<br/><br/>He also fails to understand why the democratic resistance opposes his fascist fantasies.<br/><br/>Ofelia is attempting to return to a fantasy world where truth reins and fascist lies are not allowed. There is a heavenly turn in the end, where the reward for passing the final test is her elevation to a throne alongside her father and mother. But, just like Spain, that is all fantasy as the Catholic Church was aligned with the fascists and there is no heavenly reward for the democratic unbelievers.<br/><br/>Fascists the world over, including those in our government are determined to crush all opposition and to demonstrate their victory. The themes of remembering the evils and the search for truth are woven throughout the film.<br/><br/>There may be only small pockets of truth left in America, as there are in Spain, but we can seek them out as we seek the remembrances of the Princess' life on earth. We won't find them among those who subjugate women or destroy democracy, but there is hope for all of us that cherish truth that we will find it.<br/><br/>As Franco destroyed Spain, and the Republican fascists attempt to destroy America, we than Del Toro for his beautiful reminder that hope is not lost."

If you want to see a good movie this year, go see Babel or The Queen. Something that actually makes sense. Or put in your Lord of the Rings trilogy and watch some excellent high fantasy.

","After reading all the positive reviews and being a great fan of Maribel Verdu (since her role in ""Amantes""), I had great expectations before seeing this movie. Quite honestly, I was disappointed. The characters lack depth. All falangistas are incredibly bad and sadistic, and all nationalists republicans are good in this movie. Stereotypic. If Del Toro wanted to make Capitan Vidal really terrifying, he would have made a little bit more sympathetic at times, like ""Landa"" in Inglourious Basterds - probably the most terrifying nazi ever on the silver screen. Vidal could at least have been a little bit concerned for his wife when she was bearing his unborn son. But now, he is a facha macho, so he can not show emotions at any time. Even the symbolism of the labyrinth is too easy : especially the end, where the self sacrifice of Ofelia is a clear sign of a Messias, including the invitation to sit at the right hand of her father in a sort of a pagan Trinity (with her mother). The cinematography however is wonderful and the actor perform well, but the scenario is just too shallow for my taste."

","This is the first time ever I felt the urge to post a comment here on IMDb and this is simply because most of the times I have more or less agreed with what was already written by others. But now, I simply cannot believe this movie has such a high user rating! Did we all watch the same thing? Reading your comments and posts my impression was that this was a movie for grown-ups. But, common! Sometimes the given ""reality"" of this movie seems more fairlytaleish than the actual fantasy bits. The villain could not be more plastic and banal if this were a 007 movie (kills innocent elderly people and little children, beats women, tortures little animals and alike). I mean the Nazis from Indiana Jones and those Frank Capra Why We Fight WWII propaganda movies had more character depth than this one! And the good guys are good guys for the sole premise of being human vs this ultra-evil devilish opponent. There is no solid argument why we should support them apart from the fact that the alternative is a sadistic monster. Now, this movies main idea, or so it seems, is to contrast the actual world of reality to the imaginary world of fairy tales. But they don't differ! At all! The ""reality"" has as little to do with reality as the fairytale. They're as archetypal, as brutal and as imaginary. And seriously, it takes a master film artist to kill a kid and get away with it (like Brian De Palma in the Untouchables, perhaps? or whoever did the movie version of the Lord of the Flies for eg). Otherwise, it seems just pathetic. Like the easiest way to appeal to emotions. For me, this death felt ""undeserved"" because the script was so badly crafted. It felt even offending in a way.<br/><br/>OK, the cinematography is great and Del Toros imagination, as we all know by now, can sometimes be stunning. But is that enough to deem it a masterpiece? I'm giving it a 2 instead of a 1 for the sole reason that its heart is in the right place.<br/><br/>There is a topic in the discussion board on weather the girl really died or just went back to her kingdom. I couldn't care less. There's this other movie, Ghost World, with a similar ambiguous ending. If anyone skipped it, rent it and spend a great evening watching it.

","(Watched in Toronto)<br/><br/>Although ""Pan's Labyrinth"" didn't win the Palme d'Or in the 2006 Cannes Film Festival (neither did ""Volver"", incidentally), it's quite obvious that this movie is a major contender in various subsequent awards competitions, having got 8 wins and 22 nominations to-date, including Best Foreign Language Film nomination for the Golden Globe. Expect it to be similarly honoured at Oscar.<br/><br/>What sets this movie apart from other political fables and children fairy tales is that it dares to be as emotionally intensive as it is. The movie is shot almost entirely in a beautiful, Gothic, gloomy hue that makes you feel that you are watching something in a trance. A lot of film award judges obviously like it, looking at the several best cinematography awards the movie has pocketed. Meticulous attention has also been given to editing. For example, there's one scene of a conversation in a room, as the camera moves to let the back of a character cover the entire frame, then pans across, revealing the forest where the ensuing scene takes place.<br/><br/>The plot is a chilling and bewildering combination of enchanting fairy tale and brutally cruel reality, interlocked through 11-year-old Ofelia who, in the darkest day of the Franco's fascist Spain, accompanies her pregnant mother to live with her step-father, a military commander that is absolute personification of a blood thirsty sadist. The ""reality"" side of the story evolves around two threads - the heroic deeds of the freedom fighters and the delicate, risky childbirth. Director del Toro is not afraid to show such brutal cruelty and violence that will make even some sturdy-hearted among the audience flinch. But he is also playful enough to push things to such an extreme that the audience burst out in uncontrolled laughing, at the expense of the villain.<br/><br/>Caught in this cruel reality, Ofelia wants out. While it's next to impossible to get her mother to leave her step-father and she is too young to run away herself, she finds her escape in another world where she is a lost princess trying to return, through the help of a faun, Pan. But even in this fantasy world, there are beings, grotesque and cruel, that will give children nightmare.<br/><br/>The tapestry of the two threads is woven together just as skilfully as the art house and mainstream aspects of the movie are combined. Even better is the duality of Ofelia's fantasy world  whether it does exist or is only her imagination is left entirely to the audience's interpretation. I see a clue in the ending shots that might indicate that it's intended to be only Ofelia's imagination but I may be totally wrong. And it really doesn't matter because even if I am right, there is nothing to prevent those who find the cruel reality too much to bear from seeking solace in a happy fairy tale ending.<br/><br/>The entire cast is wonderful but it is Ivana Baquero who will capture the heart of the entire audience with her portrayal of Ofelia."

The fantasy elements of the movie are pointless and shockingly boring. They are full of unexplained sickening creatures, insects, fairies, and FX hamming.<br/><br/>The stupid insurrection fleshes out scenes of the real world. But the picture is reasonably interesting when the Captain is pursuing his cruel regime and investigations. A servant and some others are sympathizers with the Resistance while working in the Captain's own household. Ofelia's pregnant mother is carrying the Captain's child. The Captain himself is compelling and is clearly no coward. The movie is at it's meager best when he is on screen.<br/><br/>Why is the insurrection 'stupid'? Well, we know, of course, that the Franco regime survived and the insurrection did not. So, we cannot hope to see the rebels prevailing in the long run. This makes their cause and their actions meaningless.<br/><br/>The movie commits the cardinal sin that a movie can commit: the death of a child by violence. Try though they might to dress that up with a scene of Ofelia's reunification with her (by that time dead) mother and natural father in the hereafter, the fact remains that this child has been killed.<br/><br/>The movie is well-shot and well-acted.

We are already well-worn out and often reminded about the trauma Europe has suffered, as any country has in any war and also about terrible people doing terrible things to those who cannot defend themselves.

It offers nothing more than a meandering tale about the evil of men (set in the easiest of environments to make it work, namely war), which's obvious message is brought far too straightforward and clunky to make any impact whatsoever. People that spout off this movie being a fairytale should consider watching the movie again with a timer. Perhaps only 7% of this movie deals with what can vaguely be described as a fairytale, although I would rather like to call it fable-imagery. We didn't call Kill Bill a Manga movie either just because it had some Manga scenes in it, now did we.<br/><br/>Although it was beautifully shot and occasional featured some good acting, this movie was rather vapid and over the top in it's depiction of violence at the same time. At no point are you required to think because the movie overexposes everything it tries to touch. The characters are all, note all, two-dimensional which makes it impossible to relate to them. If this movie had been made in Hollywood in the same quality with an English-speaking cast, it wouldn't have survived 4 weeks at the theaters.

The captain, for example, is pure evil, lacking a single redeeming character; his wife is a whiny weakling. The film intersperses the fairy tale with the account of the fascist army fighting insurgents, but the two threads don't complement each other. It's like watching two movies. del Toro's obsession with stomach-churning violence doesn't help matters."

","It seems to be much easier for the film director to create horrible visual monsters and situations instead describing the psychology of the hero's. The film was too much unrealistic even for a fairy-tale, I mean there was often lacking psychological grounding for the acts of the hero's, just things were happening. In the past time, the fairy-tales were created to bring some lesson to our life, but where is any idea coming from this film? In the scene where Ofelia comes under temptation nobody understands why she did so, the temptation just does not seem to be so appealing at all and the consequences could be disastrous. There are many miracle things we can meet in life, but this fairy-tale is vulgarizing them. I found the film so boring that only my friends made me to stay until the end, but we all didn't like it. It's made for audience lazy to think. Don't waste your time with this film!"

"ironhorse_iv","9","5","7","21 July 2016"," The door is locked. In that case. Create your own door. Open your mind and watch Pan's Labyrinth! It's an amazing movie. You just got to know where to look
","Director Guillermo Del Toro stated that he considers the story to be a parable to his earlier film, 2001's 'The Devil's Backbone', as both addresses similar themes. Set in Spain during the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) & influenced by children fairy tales from authors, L Frank Baum, Lewis Carroll, Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm, along with adult-driven fantasies novels from authors, Jorge Luis Borges, Arthur Machen, Lord Dunsany, & Algernon Blackwood. ""Pan's Labyrinth' tells the story of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a young girl who comes to believe she is the reincarnation of a princess from the kingdom of the underworld. However, her new stepfather, Captain Vidal (Sergi López) thinks otherwise; who believes, that Ofelia is becoming too unstable for his plan for a stable Falangism regime for both his country and in his household. Without spoiling the movie, too much, there are two ways to look at this movie. One is looking at it through a child's mind where everything and anything is possible, regardless of circumstances. The other is through, an adult's mind, where rational thought dictates our actions. It's these two ways of thinking, that make the film, so thought provoking. Is Ofelia telling the truth and Vidal is the one, losing touch with reality or is Vidal right about the world, and everybody else is living in the fantasy world? Its complex questions like this that makes this fairy tale movie, so interesting to watch, but far too sophistical for small children. Definitely, it's not for toddlers or anybody under 8 year old, unless, you want them, to see something profoundly graphic/violent and disturbing. Not only that, it's somewhat depressing with a tear-jerker type ending. It's not family friendly, despite whatever, marketing wants you to think. Despite that, the film has really fine-adult-driven acting, mostly from both Ivana Baquero and Sergi López. I have to say, Sergi for sure, as he's one of the best villains in modern day film history. The Spanish dialogue also well-written, even if it's a bit confusing at times. The English subtitles, was very helpful in trying to understand the story. The music by composter Javier Navarrete was very haunting & beautiful. The piano & violins really brings the sounds of our own mortality and purpose into question. Well-done. The film also has a supernatural horror tone to its fantasy sequences. While, the film employs some computer-generated imagery in its effect, it mostly use complex make-up and animatronic to bring its creatures to life. There is no greater example of that, then the characters of the Pale Man & the Faun, both played by the same actor, Doug Jones. One of the biggest misconception about this film is that the Faun is Greek-deity-Pan, when Del Toro, himself, stated out that he is not. Instead, he along with the Pale Man is both original characters, taken straight out of the legendary nightmares fuel of Greek, Japanese, Nordic, Christian and Roman mythology and mixed together into something new. Both creatures represented the goods & evils of authoritarian. First off, you got the Pale Man who represented man-made-control like fascism & communism. In a way, the juxtaposition of the Pale Man's table with the scene of frightened townspeople lining up to take the only food they could probably get, rations doled out by the Fascists or the Communism rebels, has some significance to the plot. If we are to believe, that the Ofelia makes this fantasy story, up, taken from multiple sources. Then, it's become very clear, that the Pale Man is supposed to represent the adults around her. After all, they are the one that trying to shatter Ofelia's trauma-triggered fantasy perception of her harsh reality. Like the Pale-Man eating children, they are the ones killing the youth within all of us, only allowing those mature enough to breed and survive. It's control 'survival of the fittest' at its scariest. A very strong Holocaust overtone. Then you got the Faun that represented phenomena or the laws of nature. Just as much, as we have to follow man-made authoritarians; we're also dictated by the harsh changing environment in which, we lived in; which we mostly have no control of. Yet, we try to be disobedience against it. We always trying to control death and childbirth. It's no surprised that Del Toro chose the character's look to invoke a certain 'light-bringer'. Like mandrake roots, free choice in small amounts us to have some control of our lives, but in larger doses might kill us. Being submissive to something out of your control is not a bad thing. The existence of the unexplained, ever make this, belief, somewhat stronger. Overall: Regards to whether or not the fantasy underworld was real or a product of Ofelia's imagination, it doesn't really matter, as long, as you get that message. However, I didn't like, how Del Toro kinda ruin it, by spoiling his answer. In my opinion, having a film so deliberately ambiguous, is a stroke of genius. It's better off that way. In the end, it's a must watch from me. Highly recommended."

"gjg304","10","18","35","20 November 2006"," A beautiful but hard-biting portrait of a girl's mental escape from the Spanish Civil War
","Guillermo del Toro thinks his latest production to be his best to date, and perfectly describes it as ""a powerfully moving story, profoundly human and dramatic."" Throughout the film there is a contrast between the fairytale land that the young Ofelia is mixed up in and the brutal goings on of the Spanish Civil War that surround her. One minute fairies flutter around her face, and the next minute we see her step father - ""el capitán"" - shooting two suspected propagandists at point blank range. The acting is very powerful throughout, with the perfect balance of innocence and enquiry from young Ivana Baquero as Ofelia, and a very convincing 'baddie' in Sergi López's Capitán Vidal, seeming to show absolutely no love for anything or anyone, other than his future child who he is sure will be a son - when the doctor says that it is not certain the baby will be male, the Captain replies 'no me jodas' (don't f*** with me). The film is beautiful from start to finish, with CGI perfectly fusing with the real rural images of a lodge deep in the forest. The film uses the horrific nature of the war to give added power without becoming overly politicised, for which del Toro must be commended. Overall a fantastic piece of film-making, and I look forward to seeing it again."

The Franquistas are displayed as unremittingly evil caricatures, the guerrillas as noble peasant types. Anyone who reads the history of the Spanish Civil War objectively has to know that it wasn't that simple.<br/><br/>We get a hint of that in the end when the guerrillas go around giving the coup de grace to the dying soldiers. This, however, is deemphasized, while the viciousness of the Captain and his men is graphically displayed.<br/><br/>It's also odd that a film that sympathizes with an anti-religious politics resorts to a fantasy world of immortality.

","I can't add anymore really, than some of the more realistic non-rose colored glasses-wearing voters/reviewers that I have read so far, have stated about this over-hyped, coffeehouse-artsy, brain drain of a movie.<br/><br/>This review may seem harsh, but I tend to judge ""theatrical"" movies with a MUCH harsher eye than Indie movies due to the budgets theatrical movies have (and Indies don't) and the much more experienced and influential directors that theatrical movies have - and Indies don't.<br/><br/>With that said...with GDT at the helm...I expected much more from this movie...especially since it was hyped like the best thing since sliced bread.<br/><br/>I guess that's why hype is not always a good thing.<br/><br/>I'm simply voicing my personal displeasure at hearing what a magical, well-done, purely fascinating movie this was, only be left thinking...'That's it? This was good makeup wise and the scenery was kind of cool, but THIS is it?' My main problem with this movie is the subsequent actions of some of the characters and how they are simply touched on and yet people are attaching huge amounts of symbolism to them.<br/><br/>I have heard people say that the only downfall to this movie was that it was in Spanish and they had to be bothered reading subtitles in order to understand it - and therefore possibly missing some important parts while they're reading.<br/><br/>Sorry...problems with this movie go beyond subtitles.<br/><br/>The disobedience of Ofelia is infuriating and makes the entire movie unbelievable as a whole, on any point. Until the end of the movie, she obeys the faun, this mythical character that would scare the dickens out of most kids (call me crazy, but in my opinion, he looked evil and I'd have run as fast as my legs would carry me had he appeared to me, no matter how many fairtyales I'd read!) without question and yet when it's MOST important (the scene with the child eating pale man) she completely abandons all common sense.<br/><br/>Okay, so she went to bed with no supper, that excuses eating the grapes when she was, in no uncertain terms, told that her LIFE would depend on NOT eating, no matter what she saw? I've read that she was in a trance, that it symbolizes this and that. Give me a break. She's just a typical kid that does what she wants when it suits her. No big mystery, meaning or symbolism there.<br/><br/>And what of Mercedes? She can gut innocent pigs with no problem (as she says when she has the blade in the Captain's cheek) but she can't kill a murdering Fascist creep like him, thereby freeing the rebels and herself from his oppressive and cruel grip? People say, ""Well, it's easy to say what you'd do if you haven't been in the situation."" True...but it's also easy to say what you wouldn't do in the same situation, if you haven't lived it. I just think the entire situation was unrealistically presented.<br/><br/>I resent all the ravings about this film and people trying to attach meaningless symbolism to this pieced together fairytale. Sometimes a movie is just a movie and I'm afraid this is one of them.<br/><br/>What a disappointment."
"marlene-34","1","38","85","23 January 2007"," A gore/horror movie - not a drama
","I strongly disagree with the majority of IMDb viewers, and I know Pan's Labyrinth received wide critical acclaim in the USA. I can only conjecture that this is due to America's love for gore/horror movies. The gratuitous violence in this film is not only entirely unnecessary (we already know that the Capitan is evil, and blood spurting is not poetry unless you are a closet sadist), it seems to have been included simply for the entertainment of audiences who appreciate gore. The assertion that kids may appreciate it is just plain wrong. My 8 year old nephew is quite used to seeing foreign films as well as cartoons, but refused to see Pan's Labyrinth and certainly would have walked out of it in the very first scene. Some have compared Pan's Labyrinth to the sublime beauty of Spirit of the Beehive, which my 8 year old nephew loved, and that is like comparing fine dining with KFC. Sure, both serve dinner, but what kind of dinner? Pan's Labyrinth is a horror movie for horror movie audiences, who would probably find it tedious to have to sit through the non-violent, non-fantasy scenes, which were the only parts which I found palatable. File this movie under gore/horror, not drama. And don't bring a child, not unless you are trying to acclimate him/her to a world of brutal sadism."
"tetanurae","3","23","48","1 February 2007"," A shallow gore-fest
","I was very excited to see this film. It got excellent reviews and looked incredible from the previews. The previews lie the the reviewers lie. There is nothing in this film worth seeing; unless of course you like gratuitous gore.<br/><br/>The film begins with young Ofelia and her pregnant mother Carmen traveling to a remote mill in rural Spain in 1944. The Spanish Civil War is officially over, but the fascist government is still fighting guerrillas in the countryside. They are traveling because Carmen has recently married a officer in Franco's army, Captain Vidal.<br/><br/>Early on in the film several characters are rather transparently labeled as ""good"" and ""evil."" We see Mercedes, a maid in the household, rather clumsily helping the rebels. And we see Captain Vidal brutally murder a farmer.<br/><br/>Vidal's men captured two farmers who were hunting for rabbits. They are interrogated, and then accused of being Communists. When the younger farmer pleads innocence, Vidal smashes him in the face with the bottom of a wine bottle. After two blows, the farmer falls out of the shot.<br/><br/>This where the film and I parted ways. Instead of continuing to show Vidal beat on the man just out of the frame, we're treated to a close up of Vidal smashing the bottle into the man's face at least ten times until nothing is left but a bloody pulp.<br/><br/>Vidal's men can look away in disgust. Why can't the camera afford us the same courtesy? After this gratuitous brutality, we're treated to a later scene where Mercedes, finally discovered by Vidal, pulls out a paring knife that she had hid in her dress, cuts the ropes that bind her wrists and then attacks Vidal. She doesn't kill him of course, she just stabs him in the back, in the stomach, and then cuts a gash across his face giving him a ""Joker"" smile. We're again treated to close-ups of this wound while Vidal's men look away in disgust. And then we're treated to an excruciatingly unnecessary minute long scene of him stitching up his cheek, and then drinking a shot of liquor that creates a great deal of bleeding (aparently for comic effect).<br/><br/>Ofelia's fantasy world (which is what the movie trailers claimed the movie was all about) account for possibly 15% of the entire film. Many people have claimed that the fantasy land is a metaphor for what's going on the real world, or her way of coping, yet Ofelia never witnesses the brutality of her step father.<br/><br/>In the end Carmen dies, Dr Ferreira dies, Vidal dies, Ofelia dies, and I couldn't really care."
"esilverh","1","35","78","29 January 2007"," Pseudo-indie, foreign Hollywood trash
","This review may contain spoilers, though I won't go into full detail.<br/><br/>The good: the cinematography, especially in the outside/afternoon and fantasy settings.<br/><br/>That's about it, for me.<br/><br/>Most of my brutal analysis of this film arises from its clichéd scenes, dialogue, and structure. The movie is PERFECT in that it flawlessly accomplishes the Hollywood tell-all and hide-nothing; the pseudo-emotional and super-predictable storyline.<br/><br/>But, everyone has their opinions on what they like. I'm an extremist for originality and did not like it.<br/><br/>To be fair, here is my non-extremist critique of the film.<br/><br/>The movie is advertised as a fairy tale. Every poster, commercial and review emphasizes this. Yet, only about 20-25 minutes of the entire movie are fantasy scenes. The end, the frog, the cool eyes-in-hands guy, and the faun's place (trying to be vague...) are the only fantasy scenes in the movie. There are a few mixed scenes, but those are predominantly real-life.<br/><br/>The movie is 80% war story. The advertised fantasy is only a sub-plot of an overly-graphic (Saving Private Ryan type) movie. And really it is. It's not that the switch from peaceful to bloody is too shocking, it just seems irrelevant and 'just-for-shock-value'- not important to the film.<br/><br/>BIGGER SPOILERS BELOW: Two big clichés in the movie that killed me were the 1) unkillable bad-guy, 2)The complete obliviousness of Ofelia to the monster. I mean, in almost every movie you see someone, somehow, 'doesn't hear a monster like 10 feet behind them even though everyone is pointing and yelling.<br/><br/>There are plenty more, but that should be left for the forums.<br/><br/>--------- For the summary, then, if you enjoy most movies you see at the theater, this movie will blow you away with goodness. If you're into more artistic, less-self explanatory films, then don't see it."
"mikezexcel","1","33","73","27 January 2007"," So disappointing
","Answer this question: If your life is so miserable, would you willingly step in front of a speeding train and just end it all? No, this isn't a scene in the movie, but it sums up why I dislike this movie so much. You see, the young girl character goes with her pregnant (and soon-to-expire) mother to live with her new, purely evil military stepdad. Her life becomes so unbearable that she creates a parallel imaginary world in which she can just die and join her deceased natural parents in heaven. <br/><br/>We all know that ours can be a cruel world, but to most of us the rewards of its earthly pleasures is enough to desire a long full life. However most religions since the beginning of time promise their believers the greatest peace and happiness in some version of an afterlife. And it is this devaluation of mortal existence in this movie that makes me cringe, not the gratuitous violence. Death is seen as some sort of gift.<br/><br/>So how does the movie rate, without getting into its philosophies? I had to wonder in which decade it was actually made. Shot almost entirely under a blue light, it looked like a movie that badly needs color correction after sitting in a can for 50 years. The ""special effects"" looked like something created by the Creature Shop (was that the name?) circa 1975. There is no dazzling state-of-the art CGI others have gushed about. The pitiful associations to ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND (rabbit holes, mad tea parties) and worse yet, to Dorothy's ruby slippers in THE WIZARD OF OZ, were insulting. Del Toro's message of ""There's no place like Heaven"" made me ill. I couldn't wait to wipe this movie off me as fast as I could."
"tia_wise","9","2","2","8 December 2019"," Worth the Watch!
","I strongly recommend Guillermo del Toro's film, Pan's Labyrinth. Although Toro did not fully involve all his characters, the film turned out great due to the many conflicts that kept me on my feet throughout the whole film.
Mercedes, my favorite character in the film, is very well developed as a kindhearted woman with a soft spot for Ofelia; however, the other characters are lacking development and attention. Guillermo del Toro introduces Mercedes as a full person by including her family, good intentions, and willingness to help. Because of Mercedes' actions, the audience can see that Mercedes has empathy and wants to assist her loved ones. Mercedes' brother is present in the film and she is constantly attempting to help him by retrieving supplies, medicine, and more to give to her brother. Mercedes looks out for Ofelia from the time Ofelia arrives at the castle until the end of the movie, attempting to shield her from the horror of the war. In contrast to Mercedes' well-developed character, the audience is never exposed to Captain Vidal's true self. He never seems vulnerable or anything other than an evil. Granted, Toro may have wanted to portray him as only a bad man, but it made for a lousy character. Carmen, Ofelia's mother, is also very poorly developed. The audience is able to get to know her a little at the beginning of the film while she is traveling to her new home, but after she arrives, the audience rarely sees her again fully awake. Carmen is sedated most of the time after arriving at her husband, Captain Vidal's, home. Because of this, I feel as if the only reason she lived throughout most of the film was to carry her newborn to delivery and create a surprise ending. Other than that, Carmen does not add much to the storyline and therefore does not have a reason to be in the film.
In Pan's Labyrinth, there are too many conflicts to count, which makes the film very intriguing and easy to watch. The most prominent conflict is the Spanish War. The war lasts throughout the entire film, but there are separate battles and instances that portray different parts. For example, Vidal's men kill rabbit hunters, the doctor, and go on a hunt for Mercedes. All mentioned scenes relate back to the war; however, they are completely different from one another, leaving the audience curious as to what's coming next. Ofelia has an internal conflict during the film. She is unsure if she wants to be a princess in an underground world or if she wants to stay mortal and support her mother. Ofelia is intrigued by the thought of being a princess, but she loves her mother enough to question it. Another conflict that is present in the film is Carmen and her unborn child. Carmen struggles with her pregnancy over the course of the movie and is on bed rest, constantly having complications, until she dies at the end of the film.
Overall, Guillermo del Toro's film, Pan's Labyrinth, is worth the watch. Even though most of the characters in the film were far from developed, the film keeps the audience interested from start to finish. I have never seen a movie with so many things happening at once, but it made for a nice attention grabber."
"pbcrackers","9","2","2","8 December 2019"," Thought provoking and intriguing despite genre confusion
","Although I felt this movie lacked a consistent genre, I enjoyed watching and analyzing 'Pan's Labyrinth' due to the symbolism Guillermo del Toro used throughout the movie. I would recommend it to anyone looking to watch an intriguing and fascinating work of art. It is considered a war, fantasy drama; however, I feel it is much darker than this. It is not only dark because of the war, but the gore that surrounds Ofelia's adventure as well. If I had seen this film the year it was released, as a child, I would have had nightmares for weeks about the Pale Man. I do believe this movie falls under fantasy and drama; however, I would go so far as to call it a horror movie as well. Toro intended for his audience to be frightened and shocked by many scenes throughout the movie. The murder of the rabbit hunters, Captain Vidal and Mercedes's fight, and the entire scene with the Pale Man are some examples of how this movie instills fear and disgust in it's audience.<br/><br/>Despite the lack of set genre, I did enjoy the movie for its symbolism and hidden messages. While watching, I came to the conclusion that the fantasy world in Pan's Labyrinth is a figment of Ofelia's imagination she created to help herself cope with the dire situation at hand. The faun symbolizes of the angel of death getting ready to take Ofelia away. She is a little girl in unimaginable grief. She has lost her father, is moving into a war zone, her mother is sick, etc. In the fairy tale she is reading, there is a father looking for his lost daughter. Because Ofelia is without a father, this is appealing. When her mother is sick, the faun provides the mandrake that ""magically"" makes her better. Towards the end of the film when the Captain follows Ofelia into the maze, we are shown the situation from his perspective. This is the first time throughout the film we encounter the magical beasts from the perspective of someone other than Ofelia. We can clearly see that the faun she is talking to is not there. While this could be taken that only she can see him because she has the soul of the lost daughter, I choose to interpret the faun as a figment of her imagination. As she dies, she sees her father and mother welcoming her into the afterlife, and the faun is there too, telling her she passed the test. For me, this was simply her finding a way to cope with and be at peace with her death. The faun, or angel of death, was prepping her for this in order to make it as peaceful as possible, almost like the Peter Pan theory where he is leading children to the afterlife.<br/><br/>Overall, I did enjoy watching and analyzing this movie. Regardless of the unclear genre, the movie itself was fascinating and thought provoking."

At first, I was skeptic toward to watch it because I thought it would be some kind of cliche fantasy movie. But I was totally wrong. Guillermo de Toro delivered a very beautiful yet tragic story. I said it is not cliche because first it is a dark fantasy with bloody scenes (I thought the movie was a happy-journey thing). And I love when the character is faced with danger there is not a suddenly-hero-come from nowhere to help him/ her. Mercedes is the character I favorite most. She is strong, brave and smart. I felt like clapping when she brutally attack the captain. Besides, I hate the main character most, Ofelia. Though it is still understandable because she is still a kid and innocent (or stupid? why do you eat the grape?!). Oh and the myth creatures are astonishing!
To sum up, this movie worth to watch. This is not a usual fantasy. This is rare."
"Buddy-51","7","11","20","24 February 2007"," somewhat less than the sum of its parts
","One of the cardinal rules of any good fairy tale is that, no matter how fantastical it becomes, it must make sure to keep one foot firmly planted in reality so that the story can more easily connect with the audience. In the case of ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" however, that foot may be so firmly planted in the real world that it actually prevents the movie from cutting loose and soaring into the stratosphere of imagination and enchantment in the way we wish it would.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in 1944, five years after the end of the Spanish Civil War that has left Franco in power and bands of defeated Leftist rebels hiding out in the Iberian countryside. Eleven-year-old Ofelia arrives with her pregnant mother to the estate of Captain Vidal, a vicious fascist who, in a clever bit of fairy tale role reversal, plays the part of the evil stepfather of the story. As Vidal busies himself with hunting down the pesky Communist outcasts, Ofelia discovers herself drawn to a strange alternate universe, unbound by the laws of nature, which frequently opens up for her to enter and to which she alone seems privy.<br/><br/>There's no denying that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is an extremely well made movie, miles above the average American fantasy film in terms of both sophistication and vision. Director Guillermo del Toro has fashioned a dark, violent, exquisitely realized world filled with secret passageways and awe-inspiring creatures to which Ofelia periodically retreats in an attempt to escape the even more brutal life around her. Like Judy Garland in ""The Wizard of Oz,"" the lovely Ivana Baquero is the perfect heroine for the tale: wide-eyed, curious and filled with an intense longing for a world better than the one that entraps her. The movie is a miracle of art direction, set design, makeup and special effects, and it boasts some of the most dramatic use of sound this side of ""Das Boot."" <br/><br/>Yet, for all its good points, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" winds up disappointing us a bit in the end. For much of its running time, the movie seems to be operating in two largely different spheres - that of reality and that of fantasy - and having a hard time bringing the two together into a unified, coherent whole. It spends too much time chronicling the conflict between the fascist general and the rebels in the forest - which might be interesting in a different context and another movie - and not enough focusing on Ofelia's otherworldly adventures. Even though the emotional pull back to Kansas was never far from Dorothy's - and the audience's - consciousness, Baum knew enough not to spend too much actual time there. Del Toro, on the other hand, seems not to be able to yank himself from the scene, the result of which is that the fantasy world never exerts the magical force on us that it might have done had it been more thoroughly developed and taken a more center stage in the drama. The magical world in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" lacks the sort of densely plotted, compelling narrative one finds in the ""Lord of the Rings"" saga or ""The Wizard of Oz."" We don't get a clear picture of what the land itself is like, who its various inhabitants are, and what Ofelia's real role will be once she gets there.<br/><br/>Thus, although the parts in ""Pan's Labyrinth"" are better than the whole, thanks to the quality of the film-making and of Baquero's performance, those parts are often indelible and unforgettable."
"Atreyu_II","3","17","34","13 August 2010"," Absolutely unnecessary violence
","This Spanish-Mexican film, also known by the title 'Pan's Labyrinth' (nothing to do with Peter Pan, in case you're thinking that because of the ""Pan""), is not what it seems. This films fools anyone who is expecting a fantasy film. It happened to me. I didn't hear about this movie until some time before I watched it. <br/><br/>Despite me not knowing very well what to expect from it, I expected a movie of fantasy and magic. Something in the line of 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'Labyrinth' but better than 'Labyrinth'. But it ended up not being anything of what I imagined. And not in the good sense...<br/><br/>Aside some beautiful backgrounds/landscapes and a relatively well made labyrinth, most of the movie is horrible. It is violent in the maximum sense of the word. No kidding. It's not a movie with just one or another brief scene of violence. There is brutal violence in many scenes. It's too much and that is something unacceptable on a movie like this. I wasn't prepared for the excessive violence in this movie and wasn't expecting it. <br/><br/>I mean, one thing is a movie being violent if its genre or story justifies so. By this, you accept better its violence, even if it's brutal. But not on something that is supposed to be a fantasy/magical movie suitable for everyone including children. I can handle violence in films (even if it's brutal), as long as it is in an acceptable level and not excessive. But this one was too much for me to handle. There are far too many shocking scenes that I could mention, but I won't go into that. See for yourself and judge for yourself, but be warned: this ain't pretty to view.<br/><br/>To tell the truth, only about 10% of the movie has fantasy and even those moments of fantasy have no charm... in fact, they are more dark (in a bad way) than a revelation. This is a strange film. It seems like 3 or 4 completely different films in one, all different in temperament and such. It's a disturbing and very bad movie.<br/><br/>The story takes place in Spain in the year 1944, a few years after the Spanish Civil War, during the early Franquist period. The character Captain Vidal is so tyrannical and brutal that he deserves his comeuppance, but his men aren't any better than him.<br/><br/>As for the characters that belong to the fantasy part of the movie, I liked the stick insects, the fairies and the mandrake. But the Faun annoyed me. Not only he looked repulsive and was irritating, but also his disturbing intentions about the baby were alarming. The Pale Man was so grotesque and disgusting that words are incapable to describe how much that thing disgusts me.<br/><br/>And this movie is as acclaimed as it is? And is considered one of the best foreign movies and even is on Top 250? I'm shocked. I'll never watch this again!"
"robertgsmith","1","41","94","15 May 2007"," I waited so long to be rewarded with disappointment
","I have read the wonderful reviews, waited in anticipation (could not make it to see it at the movies), and attempted to watch Pan's Labyrinth tonight. What a horrible disappointment. I was expecting more of the magic of 'The Devil's Backbone,"" but what I was rewarded with was a torture-fest that looked like it was directed by Mel Gibson. Much like 'The Passion of the Christ' took a holy subject and degraded it by turning into one of Mel's studies in male homophobic S&M themes, this movie was often tauted as an adult fairy tale. Only if we as adults have decomposed our standards so that torture and suffering constitute fairy tales. Fool me once, shame on you...I will not make any future efforts to see this director's works. Only a small percentage of the movie is dedicated to the fairy tale theme of Pan's Labyrinth, the rest is a poor version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre meets Passion of the Christ meets Apocalypse Now. Save your money."
"benoit-3","1","41","94","15 May 2007"," What they won't tell you, of course, is ...
","PRACTICAL PIECE OF ADVICE: IF YOU KNOW ANYONE WHO ENJOYED THIS FILM, DON'T LET THEM BABYSIT YOUR KIDS!!!<br/><br/>This highly critically praised ""magical fairy-tale"" is rated R for a very good reason. In its 120 ""enchanting"" minutes, I counted no less than 85 homicides, all extremely and graphically violent, many by the most sadistic and revolting means imaginable and all guaranteed to repulse. For good measure, this ""surrealistic escapade into a childhood land of imagination and wonder"" also has as many body fluid scenes as any Texas Chainsaw Massacre sequel: after the obligatory appetizers of vomit, muck and slime, blood starts pissing from open wounds, a pregnant woman has ""complications"", hatred and violence being the prime motivators of all characters, an innocent peasant has his face literally caved in with a wine bottle for no apparent reason in front of his father, who is also killed for no reason, a mandrake root is fed the blood of a little girl, squalor is rampant, there is a completely gratuitous amputation scene (what serious film could be without it?) and an equally gratuitous do-it-yourself plastic surgery scene, scenes of disfigurement, military executions and cold-blooded torture, and, for good measure, even cute little pixies get decapitated along the narrative way. In this sophisticated age, it is assumed sufficient for the viewer to know that this is ""an intriguing film"", made by someone from a foreign country and with an imposing-sounding name and that it is ""thought-provoking"". It would be considered in bad taste or simply jejune to mention that this kind of film can seriously harm a child and is certainly warping quite a few adult minds as we speak. Or that it is a seriously depressing and morbid gore-fest from beginning to end and a revolting and cynical misappropriation of the spirit of childhood and poetry by deeply troubled minds working under the banner of lowest-common-denominator CGI-augmented slasher horror and freedom of expression.<br/><br/>Everybody in America is falling over each other in praising this film but very few critics have noticed that what makes this film ""the ultimate fantasy film"" (i.e. totally cut-off from reality) is not its subject matter but the fact that it is set in Franco's Spain, yet fails to mention the Catholic Church in any way, shape or form (priests, rituals, imagery, symbolism, role in the repression of socialism), a feat comparable to making a film about Iraq that would fail to mention the existence of Muslims. Yet, its moral seems to be that ""there is no greater love than to die for those you love"", a Christian principle that is rather irreconciliable with the fantasy universe's pagan philosophy.<br/><br/>Although not aimed at children (its violence is much too repulsive for that), this so-called fairy-tale for adults is sufficiently childish on every other level to appeal to the lowest common denominator. It was conceived after all by a filmmaker who specializes in comicbook adaptations - the new ""literature"" of dyslexic America. <br/><br/>But I am mostly infuriated by the false advertising. This is a gory, harmful, snuff-porn, slasher film masquerading as an art film: Its tagline might as well be ""Hey, guys, it's got subtitles, so you know it's good for you!"" The people who are taken in by this trash are mostly young Americans, ignorant about history or the world around them, and who are fans of violent, sadistic cinema. It was conceived by a man with a troubled mind and no interest in reality, whose main obsessions are violent death and dismemberment. It would appeal to a people who has repeatedly failed to count the casualties in a war they have started in Iraq because it is good TV entertainment and good business and it is set in a faraway land they couldn't even pinpoint on a map of the world.<br/><br/>Historical footnote: The film also fails as history. Its simplistic Saturday-morning-cartoon fascists-are-bad moral fails to take into account the fact that the most egregious atrocities of the Spanish Civil War were committed by Communists and Socialists, which turned world opinion against their revolution. The pope still has 9,000 Spanish Catholic martyrs on his canonization roster. This film is an insensitive insult to the Spanish people who is still trying to come to terms with that horror in its daily life. Mr. Del Toro should definitely confine his talents to adapting comic books for slow-witted American teenagers."
"janthonyk","1","35","79","3 February 2007"," Love yourself and avoid this movie.
","Having seen the movie, I wished I hadn't and I'm inspired to alert others that the critical acclaim and 8+ rating is skewed. <br/><br/>Almost every scene in this move portrays graphic scenes of violence. I'm hoping that others see this movie for what it is, an attempt to profit off of the average moviegoer by baiting them with big reviews and misleading trailers, then delivering a gore-fest that a demented 3rd grader could have written.<br/><br/>The worst thing about this movie is that while this level of violence is expected in most horror flicks, I honestly expected an edgier version of the Neverending Story when I bought tickets. It was marketed to those who seek something artistic and unique... a diamond in the rough. Unfortunately this movie is the rough, yet there is nothing precious to redeem it. <br/><br/>Somehow this show garnered rave reviews, big crowds and revenues. Yet, it only serves to present something as morbid as the holocaust films, or Faces of Death. It's unfortunate that there isn't a special rating for this type of depravity in movies. Other films that would fit into this category include Reservoir Dogs, Cell, Silence of the Lambs, Pulp Fiction, and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Sure some of these movies are good to watch, if you're able to get into the right mood to stomach them. Because of this Laberinto de Fauno serves to overwhelm the viewer with horrific violence.<br/><br/>While the previews suggest the premise of the movie is of fantasy and the beauty of the human spirit, what is presented is a message that it's okay to showcase the worst aspects of man, that a wrong countered with a greater wrong makes things right. That even sweet innocent girls fall prey to temptation and hellish suffering, but so long as they're self-centered and committed to getting what they want they'll live happily ever after. May the rest of the cruel world be damned.<br/><br/>It bothers me that those who made this movie steal your time, your happiness and your hard earned money. If you do go see this film you're telling them you'd like them to stop investing in truly inspiring, artistic or entertaining films because there's a bigger return on investment for movies with shock-value.<br/><br/>==================================================== <br/><br/>Things portrayed in the movie:<br/><br/>1. The graphic slaughtering of groups of men, each finished off with a execution shot to the head.<br/><br/>2. The little girl protagonist's mother, pregnant with the evil step-dad's baby, is bleeding profusely through her nightgown, howling in pain. The girl, at the direction of a demon, uses a magical root fed by milk and blood, that becomes a fetid magic dish she places beneath her mother's bed. She's told this is to help her mom stop the bleeding during the pregnancy. The step-dad finds the root, hits the girl and burns the now-living root in the fireplace. The root, writhing, burns to death and as a result the mother dies during pregnancy (foreshadowed by the step-dad when he tells the doctor to let the mother die if it means saving the baby).<br/><br/>3. A man is tortured graphically by the step dad, but lives until he's put out of his misery by the doctor who gets shot in the back by the step-dad.<br/><br/>4. The little girl's ""fairy"" is a skittering preying mantis.<br/><br/>5. The little girl is supposed to use magic to gate into another dimension where she encounters a creature as sinister as Hellraiser who kills 2 fairies by eating them alive, ripping their bodies apart.<br/><br/>6. Graphic scenes of violent attacks where an innocent man's face is bludgeoned with a wine bottle until it caves in and then his innocent father is shot and killed at point blank range.<br/><br/>7. Ultimately the step-dad who has been a sadistic torturer, killer, abusive husband and step-father is stabbed and has his cheek graphically cut open, and is then shot moments after mortally shooting the daughter.<br/><br/>Since the positives have already been enumerated in the trailers, ratings and reviews, feel free to read them to gain a better sense as to all this movie offers. I didn't just think this was a bad movie, I feel sickened and traumatized after watching it. I don't regret feeling so affected. We should be sensitive to murder and death, it's part of why we value the lives of others, and that of ourselves."

","Is it a fantasy movie? I don't think so, 3 or 4 fairy ugly creatures (not like nightmare before Christmas lovable ugly though dirty ugly!) with an uncertain role in the film!

A stupid story of reading a book  finding a key a sword a drop of blood and then going back to heaven? Then why should we know a lot about Capitan, why should we know that Capitan fix his own watch, wax his shoes himself, Even do his own surgery? Who is Mercedes in the movie anyway? Is it a fantasy thriller movie? First, its not thriller, it's bloody-disgusting. Does he thinks he is so brave or so avant-guard to show cutting off a leg, distorting a face with a bottle, sewing someone's own mouth? Second, if so, why at the end of the film Capitan saw Ofelia talks to herself instead of a real creature? Should we think of it as a philosophical point (a very weak one though!)? We can't say this film can actually bring two completely different genres together.<br/><br/>Wanted to bring fairy tale in real cruel world with use of a little girl imagination? When exactly should we understand this fabulous fantastic new awesome idea? At the very beginning of the film when Ofelia thought she saw a fairy creature OR when her mother get healed after she put something under her bed OR when she goes through walls OR when Capitan saw her talks to herself? Boring? Yes! Evils and Angels, Goodies overcome. We hate Capitan, and nice-brave Mercedes gets our revenge from him! Ofelia? Was the story around her?!

"Eleven_Fifteen","3","20","42","5 July 2007"," Barely Okay, But Nowhere Near Great
","I always give a film credit for trying hard, and ""El Laberinto del fauno"" does try awfully hard (especially its visual effects), but it isn't even a halfway great film and nowhere near deserving of inclusion in the IMDb's top 250 films of all time list. One of the best of 2006? Maybe. One of the best of the 2000s? No. One of the best of the last 100 years? Not even close. <br/><br/>I can only assume that the people who rank it an 8 or higher have seen very few truly great films or they put an extraordinary weight on visuals and art direction (which are very good in this film) and don't care much about acting, characters, dialogue, or plot (which are all pretty average in this film). The fact that it's a foreign film probably makes it more appealing to some Americans.<br/><br/>A few of the many problems in this film: <br/><br/>The characters are basically one-dimensional and not nuanced or interesting in any way. For example, the captain is a sadistic brute all the time. Some sadistic brutes can show a charming side when they want to and keep their real nature hidden, but this captain never does. <br/><br/>Which leads to a plot problem: Why would the woman marry him? Okay, maybe women can't get along without a man in fascist 1940s Spain. But was there no other choice? Or maybe she had to marry him so there'd be a movie. <br/><br/>Next: The girl/princess is supposed to complete three tasks and if she fails, her chance to return to her fairy home is gone ... and she does fail, so the rules are changed to ""if you fail, maybe the faun will change its mind and give you another chance"". <br/><br/>And how can a toad, even a really big one, cause a tree to die? And why it have a key in its belly? <br/><br/>What is that monster with its eyes in its hands? Okay, it's ""whoa, dude, cool"" to look at, but does it have any internal consistency with the rest of the fantasy? Are any of the fantasy sequences internally consistent? Do the characters in the fantasy have any motivations or story of their own? Or do they all exist just to be ""metaphorical"" and impress the pseudo-intellectuals? Does the fantasy have any connection to the real world, or to the girl? If not, then the problem is we have two separate movies: a fantasy and a war story, neither of which is given the time needed for a complete telling. <br/><br/>And why does the captain put a razor against his mirror image? Is it supposed to mean something? For me, it seemed just another impressive visual that is essentially empty because it is unconnected to anything in the character, dialogue, or plot. <br/><br/>A Plot problem: Why didn't the housekeeper kill the captain when she had the chance (when he was on his knees with her knife in his mouth)? Why let him live? Oh, yeah, so he can appear in the final climax. Etc. <br/><br/>To sum up: Some cool effects to look, but not much else. Don't bother."

"sligguth","1","29","65","11 February 2007"," Repellant
","This film is an appalling attack on the senses with repetitive scenes of graphic murder and torture with no real purpose but to numb and desensitize the audience.<br/><br/>If the brutality were removed or lessened the film would still be lousy because the story telling is so poor. The main character is so detached from her own fate that her actions are just not compelling to watch. She's a child who deals with a horrifying reality by escaping into a fantasy realm. Here she subconsciously deals with reality through fantasy scenarios and dream symbology and takes action only when directed by her mythical pal, the faun.<br/><br/>Problem is, although there are many scenes of horror, there is no scene where she witnesses any of it. So what the hell is she escaping from? How do we identify with her if we are not made to see the ""real"" world depicted in the film through HER eyes? As an audience member I certainly wanted to escape the ugly real world depicted in the film but since the main character wasn't seeing anything I was seeing, I wondered why I was following her to begin with.<br/><br/>I would like to recommend the stunning production design and truly imaginative and effective visual effects (or the excellent performances of the cast) but the fear that I might inadvertently convince anyone to go see it would keep me up at night. The films high rating by critics and audiences not only confuses me but makes me very, very sad. The pointlessness of the violence in this film makes it pornographic rather than illuminating. It won't be long before audiences will be eating popcorn and watching snuff films. What's happened to us?"

","El Laberinto del Fauno is set in Spain in 1944 during the Civil War, a widow named Carmen (Ariadna Gil) marries Captain Vidal (Sergi López) the sadistic ruler of a group of Nationalist soldiers. Carmen & her 11 year old daughter Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) move out to an old Mill in the countryside where Captain Vidal & his men are stationed trying to crush local rebel resistance. There Ofelia is lured into an ancient stone labyrinth by a fairy & down some steps into a magical fantasy realm, there she meets a creature called a Faun (Doug Jones) who says she was once the Princess of the magical realm & gives her three task's so she can reclaim her rightful place once again...<br/><br/>This American, Spanish & Mexican co-production was written, produced & directed by Guillermo del Toro & after winning innumerable awards, accolades & critical acclaim I was expecting something a bit special which unfortunately wasn't forthcoming. Known more commonly under the title of Pan's Labyrinth in English speaking territories all the hype & advance publicity surrounding El Laberinto del Fauno stated that it was one of the best fantasy films of all time & like a fool I brought into it. The script by Toro is much, much more of a war time drama as it spends the vast majority of it's duration on the frankly depressing real life conflict between Spanish soldiers & rebels. In fact El Laberinto del Fauno is more of a drama than anything else, the quaint & sometimes charming fantasy elements are few & far between with only three or four notable sequences. When it focuses on Ofelia's fantasy world then it's often spellbinding but when it switches to the war time dramas it's horrible. When I watch a film I want to be entertained, nothing more nothing less. Watching El Laberinto del Fauno I was throughly depressed, it's hardly an uplifting tale & one that left me rather down. That's not what I want to feel like when watching a film, I'm sorry buts that the way it is. Some moments are genuinely unsettling & even upsetting to the extent that I sometimes found it quite hard to watch. The script leaves a lot of things open to the viewers interpretation but I thought it was pretty clear, the fantasy elements never really gel with the grim war time dramatics & the two make for uneasy bedfellows.<br/><br/>Director Toro does a great job although I must admit I don't quite get what he was trying to do here. It's a tale of a girls imagination & hope but in the end he seems to want to crush any hope of any uplifting message in favour of some truly horrible moments of real life brutality, violence, torture & death. Some of the scenes in El Laberinto del Fauno are very disturbing, from people beaten to death, tortured, sliced open mouths & lots of bad things happening to good people. Presented entirely in Spanish with English subtitles I don't know about anyone else but while I'm reading the subtitles I can't get a good look at what's happening on screen, it's impossible, very frustrating & annoying. The special effects are pretty good, some of the CGI effects are a little below par I suppose but the make-up effects & creature design is very good. I wouldn't say El Laberinto del Fauno is scary but some of the character's do some really horrific things.<br/><br/>Technically the film is very good, actually shot in Spain the production values are great & it's well made. The acting is excellent which makes it all the more powerful, whether that's a good thing I am not sure.<br/><br/>El Laberinto del Fauno is a film lots of people seem to like for reasons which escape me, I thought it was a throughly depressing & disheartening experience that I have no desire to revisit. It has it's moments on occasion & it's often quite powerful stuff but that doesn't mean it makes good entertainment which I happen to think it isn't."

","This movie suffers from a very poor script based on a fabulous idea. The real story is Ofelia finding out who she is and gaining access to the fantasy world. Sadly, only about 15 minutes of the film is about this story. The rest of the time is spent convincing the audience that The Captain is an evil, horrific person. Um, yeah, you made that clear in his first two scenes. The audience gets it - he's BAD. What at all does the captain or the underground resistance have to do with progressing the real story of Ofelia completing her tasks to become a princess? Simply ridiculous that 75-80% of the script is spent on the non-story. A brilliant core plot gone to waste.<br/><br/>The movie does have great cinematography and acting, but none of that is any good when you have a bad script."

","Synopsis: In 1944, against the backdrop of the rise of General Franco's fascist regime, a young girl on the verge of adolescence, tries to dodge the fears of growing and horrors of the historical moment through her magical fantasies.<br/><br/>While El Laberinto del Fauno definitely shows that the director has some skills (as it kept me involved for all of its duration), it's quite disappointing in itself. Why is that? The bulk of the film is about the horrors of reality, however those are depicted through extremely graphic gory sequences which do nothing to convey the plain, blunt, basic nature of true life horrors, because they all revolve around the figure of fascist Captain Vidal, who is basically manically depressed, a psychopath, and whose overstated displays of violence are really of no purpose in themselves, other than making it obvious for the most distracted viewer how sick the man is (and just look how much emphasis was put on the discovery of the connection between the doctor and the communists, it's like they're assuming you're not paying attention.) At some point the recurring, unnecessary outing of Vidal's sadistic personality started to feel trite, effectively neutralizing the power of the representation through desensitization.<br/><br/>In the end, the depiction of the fascist regime appears flat, simplistic and two-dimensional, too much like a kid's vision of history, bad vs good, black and white - almost Stephen King-ish in its oversimplification.<br/><br/>On the topic of the role of holocaust in movies (and anything else resembling that): every piece of film which deals, even remotely, with it, inevitably clads itself in self-importance, expecting the viewer to accept whatever is shown on the silver screen with a nod and utter respect for the sorrows the victims of those historical moments had to endure. So let me state this again: no matter the respect we owe to those victims, by no means your movie has a right to have this respect trasferred upon itself, unless it's _thoroughly_ _deserved_.<br/><br/>El laberinto is clever in sidestepping the overused holocaust focusing instead on a part of history which is connected to it but mostly unknown outside Europe. If El Laberinto had been any good in offering a believable representation of this close-to-forgotten memory, it would have restored it, thus gaining a right to be lauded, but as it is, it just used the historical backdrop to gain undeserved recognition, the filmic equivalent of an attention whore.<br/><br/>The fantasy parts, which revolve instead around the labyrinth and his ambiguous guardian, the faun, offer much more space for subtleties, which is quite likely an intended inversion of attributes, though lacking the flair Tim Burton has for this kind of device, and as a result this ambiguity feels only necessary to make the cardboard reality part more acceptable, but useless in itself. Subtleties for the subtlety's sake. The fantasy parts also come out as more genuinely disturbing than Vidal's outbursts.<br/><br/>A wealth of little details has been disseminated in the script, but not enough attention has been spent on interweaving them with the plot in a meaningful way. They just look a lot like the icing on the cake: 'look mommy how deep I am' rather than a functional part of story telling.<br/><br/>All of these elements persuaded me that El Laberinto is narcissistic exercise where all the movie maker has been thinking - You'll *have* to notice how good I am! - and for this very same reason ends up being shallow and fake, lacking a core of truthfulness.<br/><br/>PS: and for the 20+ minutes of standing ovation, either it was staged or a fantasy with no more substance to it than the ones of the main character."

","I just don't get it. The ""real"" world elements portrayed here make a satisfying story although somewhat obvious and lacking in subtlety. Nevertheless I could happily have watched a version of this film if it had no fantasy elements and at least had a cathartic experience based on the bad guy getting what he deserved. But the fantasy elements just did not fit here. Firstly they were strictly fantasy 101 - oh, the girl goes on the hero's journey represented by the journey into the underworld where she has to perform a series of tasks to prove her worth. Secondly they had no relationship to the real world events. Thirdly as the message was presumably that she escaped from the real horrors by fantasising, then why bother with the complex symbolism? If you want fantasy then ""Lord of the Rings"" does better than this at portraying the horrors of war. If you want the real horrors of war then there are a zillion things you could watch, staring with Apocalypse Now and working down from there. I'm a big fan of fantasy and I'm a big fan of realism but this attempted combination just does not work on either count. This film will appeal to those who fancy themselves as intellectuals and like reading magical realist novels that win literary prizes. I would think that most fantasy fans, who can discern the subtext of a story in a heartbeat, and most of those who are moved by a war film can only be baffled by the praise heaped upon this entirely pedestrian film that tries to succeed by bludgeoning the viewer with the obvious. I repeat; I just don't get it."
"WriterDave","7","14","28","22 January 2007"," Beautiful Decay
","Guillermo Del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth"" begins with a transfixing opening shot that completely transports you into a dark and mysterious world. The film has the look and tone of Del Toro's near-masterpiece ""The Devil's Backbone."" Whereas ""The Devil's Backbone"" was a ripping good yarn and old-fashioned ghost story where the haunting served as a metaphor for the fractured relationships of the people living in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" uses the same historical context to present a simplistic and damning Passion Play.<br/><br/>Much like the similarly well made but questionable ""Children of Men"" this film presents us with an array of characters who are nothing more than archetypes pulled out of the decaying mythology of both Paganism and Christianity. Del Toro attempts some character development by assigning each person a single detail to give them depth (i.e. the Captain's father's watch, Mercedes' hiding of the knife in her apron, or Ofelia's love of books).<br/><br/>Despite the lack of substance in the storyline, the film is not without its suspenseful and magical moments. Ofelia's escape from the horrifying ""baby-eater"" and Mercedes' escape from the Captain provide cracker-jack thrills and are expertly staged by the director. Del Toro masterfully handles the complex special effects, elaborate make-up and set designs, creating a hauntingly beautiful mise-en-scene that gives the viewer plenty of eye-candy without being overwhelming or reeking of hollow CGI design.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the film, saturated in Catholic overtones, becomes rather predictable once Ofelia's imaginary friend Pan reveals a sinister nature behind his tasks for the young girl. Ironically, this film will probably appeal to the same people who found great comfort in Mel Gibson's odious ""Passion of the Christ."" Those who believe in redemption through torture and self-sacrifice will heavily identify with the archetypes on display here. Ultimately the film presents a sadistic task-master ""god"" whose sole design is to trick an innocent into sacrificing themselves for the ""future"" and gives us a notion of ""heaven"" that may only exist in the mind of a wildly imaginative young girl. A film (like Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"") that presents the horrors of the real world as something for a person to survive and overcome speaks truer to the human condition than a film like ""Pan's Labyrinth"" that cloaks the real horrors of life in fantasy and myth and celebrates martyrdom over the innate will to survive. Del Toro dresses his falsity in beautiful garb, but the morality lurking beneath is rotten to the core."
"L. Lion","7","8","14","16 January 2007"," powerful story about the Spanish civil war - fantasy aspect the weaker side
","I believe Pan's Labyrinth to be misnamed. Although it is a clever title, and there is a faun and a labyrinth, the fantasy world is actually a very small part of the movie, which is mostly about a sadistic Fascist (Sergi Lopez, excellent as Captain Vidal)hunting partisans in the mountains of rural Spain during the second World War.<br/><br/>To be sure, the main character initially seems to be the Captain's unattended step-daughter, Ofelia (Ivana Baquero). Ofelia and her mother have accompanied the Captain while Ofelia's mother is dealing with a difficult pregnancy. The woman is not important to the Captain, only his legacy is and he will risk the mother's life to obtain his heir. In the meantime Vidal is not above executing anyone who even seems to be remotely suspect of aiding his enemy. This is bad news for the house maid, Mercedes (Maribel Verdu, who is also excellent) and the local doctor, both of whom are covertly aiding the rebels.<br/><br/>Ofelia seems to be dealing with this frightening situation by retreating into a fantasy world. A faun (Pan, played by Doug Jones) informs her that she is actually a lost princess from an underworld kingdom, and must pass several tests to prove her worthiness.<br/><br/>Here is where the weakness of the film comes into play. Both the fantasy world and the real one Ofelia inhabits are well evoked, but director Del Toro does not devote enough time to the fantasy world to make it the main arc of the story. Instead most of the time and focus (at least two-thirds) are on the Captain, Mercedes and the Captain's hunt for the partisans and their conspirators. When Ofelia does enter the labyrinth her tasks are usually straightforward (getting a giant toad to swallow a magic stone, stealing from a monster) and seem a distraction from the real story of the sadistic captain and the brave housekeeper. In particular on one sojourn Ofelia disobeys the orders of the Faun and awakens a child-eating monster from which she has to flee. This is out of character for Ofelia, who is shown as being canny and smart until that moment, and the Faun's pronouncements following this seem perfunctory. In addition, the fantasy adventures do not seem to gibe in any logical way with the story - I did not see a connection between the giant toad or the pale man with the actions taking place in the film. If the fantasy world is supposed to be an allegory for the real world Ofelia inhabits, then the connections were too tenuous.<br/><br/>Another fault I found with the film is that it takes the ambiguity away from the fantasy scenarios. Ordinarily in this type of story, the reality of the dreamscape remains in question, leaving the audience asking whether the character is actually experiencing the adventure or just imagining it. Here Del Toro removes the ambiguity - the dreamscape can only be real, or else the filmmaker is lying. I felt this was a cop out. If the girl is escaping her nightmarish reality by retreating into a fantasy world, then making the dream world real is unfair to the audience. What does it mean that this defenseless little girl can actually retreat into a fantasy world as a moral to the story? And if the opposite is true, that the fantasy world was just fantasy, then Del Toro creates too many contradictions - Ofelia uses tools and devices given to her by the faun to escape real world situations, and they are found by other characters.<br/><br/>The last criticism is the actions of Mercedes when she gets a drop on Captain Vidal. (SPOILER ALERT) Mercedes is very aware of how sadistic and evil the Captain is. She has the gumption to stab him and has him helpless, so WHY DOESN""T SHE FINISH THE JOB? Her leaving him alive has both immediate and far-reaching complications for herself and Ofelia and left me gasping in disbelief. This leads to the trenchant finale, where Captain Vidal, who has been stabbed at least five times, pursues Ofelia into the labyrinth. I had questions about this as well. During this climax I doubted Vidal's ability to go anywhere due to the brutality of the stabbings, but here he is, pursuing the little girl with the baby. I also questioned his actions toward Ofelia. Although he is shown as evil, he is never shown as anything more than dismissive of Ofelia. I doubted that his intentions toward a little girl he could easily overpower would turn murderous.<br/><br/>The ending is gripping and sad, but by this point too many contradictions had distracted me, and the explanation of the end once again made me feel the director was playing unfair games.<br/><br/>This is a strong, evocative film. If it sounds as if I am picking nits, it is because there are too many inconsistencies, and a distracted storyline, to prevent me from calling it great. People will be talking about this movie a long time, and I urge you to see it."

","Just seen the movie only now out on Swedish screens. What a disappointment. I prepared myself for a beautifully done fantasy movie (judging from the trailers and the awards) and instead... instead I had a few scenes of fantasy in the context of a pseudo-historical Z movie, with trashy violence (that I found completely non functional to the story) and psychologically inconsistent characters. The movie looses tracks so many times you start thinking you are watching something that has not yet gone through a serious cut. Yes, you will notice a lot of post-production, but what about the cohesion and the necessity of the different scenes... do they hold?

"dye-3","1","25","56","22 October 2007"," Don't Drink the Kool-Aid: Pan Sucks
","Pan's Labyrinth (hereafter ""Pan"") is, perhaps, the most disappointing film I've seen this year. This is so largely because of the sweeping praise the film has received by both critics and the general public. (As of this writing the film is at #47 on IMDb's top 250 list; how tragic).<br/><br/>The film is difficult to categorize because of its strange blend of seemingly incompatible elements. The grotesque violence -- akin to that of gangster films like Goodfellas and The Departed -- is an ill fit for a fantasy film that aims to charm the viewer with ferries and a plot driven by an adolescent girl's interaction with a fantasy world. This really is a film that scatters wartime action scenes amidst Narnia-style childish indulgences. To my ethnocentric American mind, this seems like a tremendous mistake. Does this strange mix work for the rest of the world? <br/><br/>Pan also fails to deliver a visually-appealing viewer experience. Most of the film feels soiled, dark, sticky, and unappealing. This might have worked if the foul scenery of Spain were contrasted with surreal fantasy scenes, but the film misses that boat entirely. The few minutes we spend in fantasy scenes are nearly as dismal as the time we spend engulfed in lackluster forests and a grungy military installation. The fantasy characters, too, are nearly as vile and detestable as the human villains in the film. The movie fails to give the viewer anything to hope for but the closing credits. This seriously inhibits any hope the viewer might have developed for a pleasant outcome for the film's more likable characters.<br/><br/>I concede that the story was not completely contrived and banal. But just because it wasn't familiar doesn't mean it was interesting. Unfortunately, Pan fails to engage the viewer enough that even unpredictable fantasy events can be found exciting. Where's the adventure in the little girl's trials in the labyrinth? Where is the suspense in her escape from the silly underground creature? Why do I find it so difficult to care for the girl's welfare as she is pursued by the evil Captain at the end? It is, of course, because this film is simply mediocre. But its European setting would suggest otherwise to the average American mind.<br/><br/>After watching the film I understand the current surge of film-lust I've seen for Pan. I think the fact that this film sports a more novel, albeit boring, plot than films we commonly see in this country helps some to inflate its better qualities. What would otherwise be considered just good performances are given high accolades. Silly special effects and awful c.g. become passable (seriously people, that frog character and the growing root effects could be generated on my P.C. over lunch). To be honest, I think this film benefited a great deal from its distribution in Spanish: to the starry-eyed American viewer it takes on an exotic feel. If presented in a more average American mode, perhaps its fan-boys would've found this film as empty and unengaging as I did."
"robertllr","1","25","56","29 June 2007"," ""Awful"" doesn't begin to describe it...
","This movie could well be one of the worst films ever made. I only wish I could give it the negative-ten stars it richly deserves. Indeed, I only continued to watch it (after the first graphic and brutal murder) to see the depths to which film making of this type can sink.<br/><br/>How deep can it sink then? Very deep...deeper in fact than you can possibly imagine. This movie has not the slightest speck of originality, wit, or even meaning in it. From beginning to end, it is no more than a sadistic gore-fest masquerading as an art film. As for its vaunted production values, I find myself astounded that anyone would find them remarkable. Design? It's all been done before in any one of dozens of modern fantasy movies. (Here I must admit, however, that I am puzzled that modern movie goers still find that sort of thing interesting. Special effects have now reached a level of sophistication beyond which there can be little technical improvement. As a result, no bizarre fantasy, no matter how gloriously depicted, will ever enchant the intelligent viewer--unless the images can engender something more than a ""gee, whiz"" responsethat is, unless the images mean something.) Creating images with meaning is what good film making has always been all about. But the images in this film mean nothing. The story is bankrupt, too, with characterizations that are laughably cartoonish, and implied values that are hopelessly vague, jejune, or even outright contradictory.<br/><br/>However, even worse than the movie itself, perhaps, is the moronic praise that this piece of tripe has garnered in what (I am now realizing) is a depressingly demented world of film criticism.<br/><br/>Alas, further words fail me. But there are a good number of well-written reviews on this site that take the time to painstakingly spell out some of the many shortcomings of the film. So, if you despise this movie as much as I do, I heartily recommend perusing those reviews as an antidote to the pain and outrage you are feeling at, A) having wasted your time on this stuff, and B) having shaken your head to the point of a headache at the critical praise that has been heaped on it."

"liberalgems","1","25","56","12 February 2007"," Gruesome Violence Ruins What Could Have Been A Great Movie!
","After the movie was over I felt outraged and shocked. The violence in this film is so morbid and intense it was overwhelming. In this movie you will literally learn the how to torture someone with the correct tools. You will see so many people have their brains blown out, most at point blank range, you will lose count. You will see the brutal murder of a father & son, a kindly teenage girl, a benevolent doctor, a man with a handicap, not to mention numerous young men. We get to see a rivers of blood while a women bleeds to death from childbirth. A man have his leg amputated due to gangrene. Another man (who is merely human, in case your wondering) is brutally stabbed in the back, heart and face, and he gets up a few minutes later as if he just stepped on a tack. (Some guys have all the luck!) We even get to see him stitch his face back together again in graphic detail. (Sorry, I can't tell you more, at this point I was looking away).<br/><br/>The world of ""fantasy"", on the other hand, is virtually devoid of all violence. This ancient Pagan world is, for the most part, quite loving and sane. A very sad commentary on Franco Spain during the early the 1940's. Unfortunately this magnificent ""fantasy"" world makes up less than a 1/4 of the movie, while the constant brutal violence and turmoil of the ""real"" world makes up the rest.<br/><br/>Here are some of my conclusions: If you bring a child or an emotionally fragile person to this particular movie they may end up needing the services of a psychiatrist. THIS MOVIE IS RATED R FOR A GOOD REASON - EXTREME VIOLENCE! The critics who raved about how great this movie is should be on the front line covering the war in Iraq. Pan's Labyrinth is a fantastic example of lazy film-making. It's cheaper to show flying brain goo than it is to create a magnificent fantasy world in all its complex beauty. Many of today's filmmakers and screenwriters think the general movie going public are idiots - nothing can possibly be left to the imagination. We need to be shown everything like a five year old child. The general public is divided in two very broad groups: One that either enjoys and/or could care less about watching intense violence and suffering - and those who find it troubling or annoying and do not enjoy watching people being maimed and murdered.<br/><br/>The movie ratings system in this country is a joke, and an extreme example of hypocrisy. When Al Gore's brilliant documentary, ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" received an ""R"" rating for an under five-second scene of a Katrina victim's corpse floating on his stomach, and a movie like Pan's Labyrinth gets the same exact rating - then it's time to radically change the movie rating system in the USA, pronto!! Perhaps, instead of an ""R"" rating we could have two new ratings: XV for extreme violence and XN for extreme nudity & sexual situations. P13 would become MV for moderate violence & MS for modest nudity and sexual situations. Meaningless PG would become G. Then those of us who don't want to read opinionated and biased reviews picking apart a film before watching it could get an honest indication of how much sex & violence one could expect. ( By the way, there is absolutely ZERO nudity or sexual situations in Pan's Labyrinth! I guess sickening violence is more profitable!) I know we don't live in enlightened times, and present day film-making is a graphic indicator of this unfortunate fact of life! But I have learned a valuable lesson - Expect an ""R"" to mean gruesome violence except if you are doing a documentary on Global Warming!"
"dbranan","10","11","21","20 February 2007"," A word about the violence
","After seeing the film, and after reading many of the comments, I would like to say something about the violence that has attracted so much attention.<br/><br/>This film is violent, but not in the adolescent vein of ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or ""Saw"" or other similar films. It is violent in a realistic manner that counterbalances the fantasy portion of the story in a non-gratuitous way. All the violent scenes are entirely appropriate to the telling of the story, although many of them are difficult to watch. What you won't see are fountains of gore and exploding body parts. The fact is that people don't explode in a burst of red mist when shot with a military-caliber luger. This is not cartoon/video game violence.<br/><br/>The CGI is done in an understated way that enhances the realism of the movie, rather than detracting from it. This is probably the single best use of GGI that I have ever seen. You truly walk away wondering if much of what you just saw was actually real.<br/><br/>I have read comments disdaining the creatures in this film, but I think these people have entirely missed the point. The fantasy scenes, although some of them are disturbing, are almost charming in their child-like simplicity. They are rooted in the fears and imagination of a young girl, not the jaded mind of an adult. As such, they are frightening only in a ""monster under the bed"" sort of way.<br/><br/>Finally, I would encourage anyone who loves fantasy films to see Pan's Labyrinth. I would not recommend it for any child under the age of 16, though I think that only the most mature 16-year olds should see it. It is a thought-provoking film that will haunt you for days afterward."

I would like to put out some theories on the symbolism and see of any one agrees:<br/><br/>The Tree and The Frog<br/><br/>The Tree is Womenhood and the Frog is Franco.<br/><br/>(After Franco took over, women could no longer get abortions or seek divorce.

","When I got into the theater I was expecting a better movie than 'The Lord of the Rings' or 'Narnia'. Any director, at this point, must have learned about doing a technically good movie, that's a fact. What we, the audience want, is a good story. But after a while, I was sure of something: I was going to be disappointed. But I waited longer and longer, and the sensation didn't disappeared, only got stronger. Del Toro made a movie about a fabulous tale, but fail on the point of telling the story of Ofelia, a girl taken to the middle of the Civil War in Spain -that actually never concerns or interests her-, and confronted to an evil man who is meant to be his stepfather. She finds a labyrinth that nobody has explored even if is located near the soldiers camp, she goes down and finds out that she might be a princess, but has to go through three dangerous tasks. The faun, Pan, doesn't look believable and the story, itself, doesn't, either. Is she is the lost princess and the king has lived for centuries waiting for her, why does she has to confront dangers and prove it? The movie seems to be conceived as a horror movie, full of creepy sounds, with an evil man (Vidal) in the main character who becomes, at the end, in the only half-developed character in the movie (the mother, Ariadna Gil, appears like a ghost, an empty character), and has dozens, hundreds of unnecessary violence, shootings in the face, torture, blood and only more blood. What a way to waste a good tale and a good story. The girl, at the end, doesn't have but very short encounters with the fictional world. The real and violent adult world prevails."
"theclarabellevilla","3","13","26","29 November 2009"," Represents the cruel delusions suffered by a young girl in brutal surroundings. CONTAINS SPOILERS**
","I have extremely mixed feelings about this film. Although the performances were excellent, the film itself relies on the 'gimicky' mixture of 'fantasy' and brutal wartime reality to make its mark. In and of themselves the wartime scenes and the fantasy scenes were nothing new until combined together. Each considered separately could be considered extremely derivative.<br/><br/>I disliked this film intensely for its cruel treatment of the young girl (its central character). This film's sole differentiating factor relies on a telling the tale of young girl's tragic journey into first escapism, then delusion and finally death. It is to date the singularly most depressing film I have seen in a good long while.<br/><br/>In the beginning (before we even arrive at the cinema) we are led to believe this a fantastical tale of a faerie world. This may bring to mind positive images for some. However Guillermo taps into the darker side of faerie, capturing the true menace and duplicitousness of that otherworldly breed. It is NOT for children. It is not for adults who expect something magical. Expect grotesque, twisted motives from equally grotesque characters both faerie and otherwise.<br/><br/>We are introduced to Ophelia as an precocious and creative child. Eventually cast aside by her mother in favour of her new baby, abused and rejected by her mother's demented new husband and bereft of all hope she invents a new world of faerie to escape into. So begins her moral, intellectual and mental decline.<br/><br/>As events unfold and and the adults win and lose their various battles, her descent into delusion goes largely unremarked until she steals her baby brother to sacrifice him and open the gates to the faerie world where she imagines she will be a faerie princess, beloved of faerie parents. You could be mislead into believing that this is actually the case yet, if you watch closely, all the signs that the world is entirely of her own creation and in fact completely imaginary are there.<br/><br/>The darkness of the world she creates is a reflection of her failure to truly escape the bleak brutality of the world she really inhabits. What is more, the 'sacrifice' demanded by the faun is a dark reflection of her own desire to reverse the reality where in fact she is the one who has been sacrificed (cast aside). At the last minute could we say that she changed her mind? Or could we say that she recognised her own immorality in such a way that she couldn't accept it and fled once more into her dark world seeking solace and reassurance.<br/><br/>We never discover. She is shot by her stepfather and dies. There is an extremely powerful moment where the maid (Mercedes) rebukes the step father and takes the baby after which justice is served. Then we see Ophelia in her dark faerie world being welcomed by her faerie parents just as she had imagined, a scene which even she must recognise with her last breath as too good to be true when the faerie parents so resemble her actual human parents.<br/><br/>The extent of personal delusion and the brutality of the personal consequences are worthy themes but they are far too adult to be justifiably played out through a child character. In so doing, Guillermo has achieved a shock effect, however relying on such tactics as the central driving force of the film seems cheap and to be frank, left a bitter taste in my mouth. This man should apply his considerable talent with more care and discernment.<br/><br/>We don't learn anything from this film. We simply suffer. And where's the magic in that?"

Del Toro opted to construct both an under-developed war movie and an under-developed fantasy tale, resolving each with transparent cop-outs and plugging holes along the way with murder. I am beginning to suspect the Spanish are a gullible and artless people. Their limp thrusts at profundity bring back memories of a biologically thwarted collaboration of sorts that followed a night of heavy drinking. But fret not, ladies: that was my last night as a Spaniard."
"swagner2001","8","10","19","16 October 2006"," An Ode to Disobedience and Free Thought
","PAN'S LABYRINTH is a strange hybrid film. For long stretches we are in Spain during World War II. And when that violent world becomes too stressful, we accompany Ofelia, a 12-year-old girl, into a fairy tale land. The fantasy lasts for one scene, and we find ourselves back to Spain again.<br/><br/>The real monster in this film, is human: Ofelia's stepfather, General Vidal. He demands complete obedience from everyone under his command. It is this unwavering, unilateral stance which filmmaker Del Toro attacks at every chance. Del Toro believes imagination nurtures one's spiritual being. If we do not develop imagination, and think for ourselves, we become mindless. And only the mindless follow all orders, no matter how inhumane, without thought.<br/><br/>The World War II Spain segments are a bit too polished to feel legitimately 'in period.' The uniforms look brand new; there's no wear to them. The lack of depth to these violence-prone characters reminded me of Sergio Leone's ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly."" Each person is either good, or bad, or good pretending to be bad. And to make things interesting: everyone has an individual quirk.<br/><br/>The fantasy sections, while very enchanting, and inventive, are nearly free of any real tension. The Pale Man segment is creepy, but - for me - General Vidal politely making a request is ten times scarier.<br/><br/>The make-up, animatronics, and CGI work in this film are amazing. There's a palpable reality to these creatures. Details like Pan's twitching ears made it easier for me to believe in the fantasy than in the 'historical period' scenes. The life-like flight movements of the fairies are captivating enough to make FX modeler Ray Harryhausen jealous.<br/><br/>Nice movie. But, realize that PAN'S LABYRINTH is about finding the strength and courage to rally against inflexible authority. It's about this little girl, Ofelia, coping with a rough life in 1944 Spain. The fantasy elements serve as sorbet between courses of a larger meal. It cleanses your pallet and keeps you optimistic even during the darkest of times. Imagination becomes salvation."

","If there is one thing I can guarantee with this review it's that you will not see another movie like Pan's Labyrinth the rest of the year. In English or in Spanish.<br/><br/>With its dark imagines, brutal violence and terrifying fantasy creatures, I challenge you to find a film on par with Guillermo del Toro's vision of a young girl in Spain circa 1944 who endures the growing pains of a new family while imagining a world where creatures that would give Stephen King nightmares surround her and coax her into various tasks of passage.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is a movie almost too complex to explain. There are two tributaries of plot. One involves the real world where Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her pregnant mother travel to their new home amidst the violence of the Post-war Fascist repression. While adapting to new father whose penchant for sadism is wiggle-in-your-theatre-seat cruel, young Ofelia takes comfort in her mother's arms. But when her mother has complications with her pregnancy, Ofelia quickly finds retreat with the unusual characters including nymphs and fairies that lead her on three tasks that suggest the offer of reclaiming a throne.<br/><br/>The second story surrounds this journey into fantasy and I have yet to find the words two hours after the screening to describe the various characters that include a huge toad with a secret key hidden inside its belly and a creature that eats young children and has eyes on the palm of its hands.<br/><br/>Creepy stuff. Think Big Fish is written by Clive Barker.<br/><br/>Writer and director Guillermo del Toro (The Devil's Backbone, Hellboy) spins a whimsical story that is as engrossing as it is repulsive. The war scenes are brutally realistic with bullets not being spared for the long suffering, and a torture scene that includes utensils marked for your father's toolbox gave me the heebie jeebies a la Hostel. Guillermo is able to walk a thin line with confidence and with this entry, he secures his spot as one of the most interesting directors working in the mainstream today.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth received a 22 minute ovation when appearing at the Cannes Film Festival in 2006. I can't in good conscious share the same enthusiasm. But on the other hand I can't deny that this was an incredible spectacle that definitely deserves multiple viewings to fully appreciate the beauty amongst the violence and the creativity of the storytelling among the dark corners where creatures lurk and adventures await.<br/><br/>www.robertsreviews.com"

","I recently saw this ""Masterpiece"" and must say that I am extremely disappointed. Everybody just talked about how great it was, we even talked about it in our Spanish class, but it seems to me that people really overestimate this film. At leas to me it seemed like a very weak story, and this was increased by the supposed ""fantasy"" genre. Fantasy films are for kids too, right? So why was there all that explicit violence, for crying out loud. And the ""Laberinto del Fauno"" turned out to be little more than just a subplot to the whole civil war story. I have the impression that here in Mexico there only was a hype because OH MY GOD a Mexican director, it was Harry Potter 3 all over again (Which I also found the worst of all, but is seen here like an incredible masterpiece). I give this film three stars for some good acting... Most people will probably disagree with me, but this movie was but two hours of boredom to me."

And one more thing, there is no beneficent entity that will ask you to sign or give your or others blood for a ""higher purpose""(Eg. give some blood for the Deadly nightshade-Atropa belladonna-root) so... this is a mixed story with, I would say, many demonic creatures.

"gaeanprayer","10","9","17","10 September 2007"," Not for children
","Pan's Labrynth deserves a spot as one of the greatest movies of all time, in and outside of its genre.<br/><br/>Many hearing of the movie's plot, its involvement with mythical creatures and a magical world through a child's eyes, might confuse this for a family fairy tale; I think, at times, I might have preferred that.<br/><br/>In actuality, Pan's Labrynth borders on horror. Ivana Baquero plays a young girl named Ophelia who struggles through a life rapidly spiraling out of control, one she as a child cannot influence. A sickly mother, a brutal step-father, and amidst a war in literally her own backyard, one can't help but sympathize with Ophelia's desire to escape. She finds just that opportunity within an entity, the Faun, straight out of the fairytale books she carries about with her. The Faun himself seems frightening, almost demonic, with a snake-like tongue that leaves you unsure of whether his requests of the girl are truly in her best interest.<br/><br/>Ophelia, desperate to escape into a world so like the fairy tales she's read, sets off through dangerous territories as the Faun's request. Yet, as dangerous as her quests are, her return home becomes a gradual descent into the brutal darkness of her own human people, leaving one to question just who is the real monster in the movie.<br/><br/>In the end, it all seems very bitter; it starts to seem that no one really cared about Ophelia to begin with. I found myself so wrapped into the movie that I felt my own heart-breaking despair. I kept hoping it would suddenly get better, that someone would rescue Ophelia and protect her from the darkness encroaching from every corner.<br/><br/>It's hard to say whether Pan's Labrynth truly had a happy ending. Losing the people who meant most to her, one was left behind, one last person who cared, and it seems no one in this story leaves without their wounds. The entire movie, from beginning to end, tugs at the darkest despair and deepest sadness you could only hope to avoid, with every happy moment tinged with poignancy.<br/><br/>I think, all in all, this is a very adult movie that a family can enjoy with some serious parental guidance; the horrors within are as fascinating as the wonders to come. The top-notch acting will draw you in and hold you despite any language barrier (cleverly overcome with subtitles) and when it's finally over, it's hard not to feel the shame, anger, and triumph, as if the trials were yours alone."

","Very early in this film, I formed an interpretation which I believe to be completely correct, and borne out by the plot, details, and symbolism in the film. I will not share that interpretation here. All that I will say about it is that despite knowing where the film would end up and why, I thoroughly enjoyed the journey, and was surprised by many aspects of the film along the way.<br/><br/>Written and directed by rising Mexican directorial star Guillermo Del Toro, Pan's Labyrinth is set in Spain during the Franco years. The story's heroine is a young girl named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and the story is told mostly from her perspective. Ofelia lives in two worlds, the miserable abomination that Spain has become under fascist control, and a world of magic in which she has learned that she may just be a reincarnated princess who has to undergo a series of trials posed by the faun 'Pan' prior to being reunited after several hundred years with her father, the king. These two worlds come together at several points in the narrative, where Ofelia needs the magic of Pan's world to resolve problems in her other realm.<br/><br/>Ofelia's other realm is populated by her pregnant mother, who is the only parent she has known, her reluctantly adoptive father (the father of the child her mother is to bear), who is a fascist commanding an outpost in which they reside. There are several other prominent characters including members of a resistance movement a caring housekeeper and a doctor employed by the fascists.<br/><br/>The acting is all excellent, especially the heavy (Sergi Lopez), Ofelia, and Mercedes the housekeeper (Maribel Verdu). But the story and the exceptional fluidity with which the camera and sound tell it are the real stars here. There are no wasteful scenes in this film though, to be sure there are some painful and disturbing ones.<br/><br/>Although I have enjoyed some of Del Toro's work previously, this is the most serious, intense, and well made film I have thus far seen from him. Everything about this perfectly coherent film works, from both an aesthetic and practical point of view. Pan's Labyrinth has reached my top 5 for 2006.<br/><br/>Very highly recommended."

Isn't this too much? Why? Was it the only way to express an explicit brutality? Of course, not - check Shindler's List to compare the sense of proportion in both.<br/><br/>At the same time ELDF is as naive as Snowflake with all those pans, and fairies. Yes, I've got that idea of paralleling, and contrasting the two dimensions. Bravo, huh, but so charmingly naive.<br/><br/>I do believe that real talent doesn't need employing epatage and shock, and ELDF strengthened my beliefs once again.

That blind creature will stay in my imagination for long. I only wish they had advanced in that surrealistic path some more...

I'm really looking forward to Del Toro impressing me in more positive way next time. Best regards."
"jpschapira","8","5","8","14 June 2007"," From the imagination of Guillermo Del Toro
","Guillermo Del Toro is Mexican. I clarify this because I know it, and I assured the fact to a friend who watched ""El laberinto del fauno"" with me; but when the movie began with a Spanish accent, I doubted. And it's because Del Toro is obsessed with the Spanish Civil War, and we the adventures of little children in the midst of this important historical event (watch ""El espinazo del Diablo""); but all of this comes from his obsession with fairy tales, those that are only for children.<br/><br/>But look at what he does: he invents the most infantile story of all, in a film that's everything except infantile. This is a double-edged sword; in fact, Del Toro is a double-edged sword himself. His obsessions come from when he was little, when he imagined creatures and monsters as part of his daily reality. He also has a photographic memory; these are all things that can as positive as they can be negative, and it is evidenced in his way of making cinema.<br/><br/>The man knows a lot about cinema: he has experimented with cameras since his teenage years; he studied make-upThis plays against him too, mostly in ""El laberinto del fauno"", which is one of the most technically perfect movies I've seen in my whole life. The impressive sound edition becomes present from the first minute; the images are exaggeratedly beautiful; the music is perfect, but only because it is directly connected to the plot.<br/><br/>All the particularities that can be found in this film's characters come straight from Del Toro; who wrote the screenplay of his fable himself. It is an enchanting script that commences with the telling of a simple fairy tale, revealing a main fact of the story immediately. We should remember something so fundamental, but this immersing quality of the script makes us forget. And it's not a complex screenplay, because it has its predictable points; but as we get lost in a world where reality and fantasy become one, we stop caring.<br/><br/>Reality can be so strong that sometimes we choose to escape. The images of this film are very strong, therefore the main character, Ivana, finds a magical world that keeps her constantly away from what's happening around her. And the point is not to ask ourselves if this 'magical world' is real, trying to analyze every moment to put them together and see if they fit. That's unimportant, because in this story there's nothing to resolveBut there's a lot to understand.<br/><br/>And I think that to really understand ""El laberinto del fauno"", you hace to understand its director. Del Toro's ability to bring incredible creations (from the same 'faun' to a monster with eyes in its hands) to us reflects the power of his imagination; maybe his only neutral quality. I think I'll never completely understand Del Toro, but I assume that his imagination is what makes him attractive to the people who work with him; and consequently makes them follow him anywhere.<br/><br/>In this aspect, ""El laberinto del fauno"" stands close to ""Letters From Iwo Jima""; because just like Clint Eastwood in that film, Del Toro is an example of how crucial and predominant is the influence of the director in a cinematographic piece. ""El laberinto"" is excessively long, but nobody cared; the actors become insignificant, as if the characters had taken over them (and not the other way round as it should be)Everything seems to be part of a bigger unit: Guillermo Del Toro's vision."

","I don't think this extraordinary film alternates fantasy and reality. Seems to me, it alternates two kinds of fantasy: the haunting and evocative world of fairies and fauns on the one hand, and a world of naturalistic but utterly unredeemed villainy vs. unqualified heroism and nobility--a world that, even though seemingly more real, comes off as rather two-dimensional, though no less effective. Both worlds have horrific, even upsetting, elements, so those with delicate sensibilities should be prepared for uncompromised ugliness on occasion. For some this is probably a deal-breaker. This was a stunningly successful realization of an evocative, often deeply disturbing cosmos. I gather some found it slow or boring, but I was absorbed throughout and think it ranks right up there with Coctaeu's ""Beauty and the Beast"" as a cinematic expression of imagination. The acting, design, direction, cinematography, music--all the elements came together brilliantly. But DON'T see this if your stomach is very easily turned. By the way--I trust that no fairies were harmed in the making of this movie."
"mentalcritic","10","8","15","18 August 2007"," Not the best film of 2006 by a long shot, but so close...
","It seems ironic that the films considered by many to be the best films of the previous year are both set in an episode of history long since past, but should never be forgotten. El Laberinto Del Fauno only misses out on being the best film of 2006 because Zwartboek took so awfully long to enter production, but its virtues exceed its faults by such a long way that it will always be a benchmark in storytelling. When I say it is based to a great degree on ancient fairy tales such as those written by the Grimm Brothers, it would be all too easy to mistake El Laberinto Del Fauno for being aimed at children. And that would be selling it oh so very short. Like all of the fairy tales that have been bastardised into something puerile by Disney, El Laberinto Del Fauno is a story that every adult should learn from. Children will be frightened and saddened by it, but intelligent or hyperlexic children (or both, such as I was), will get far more out of it than the G-rated tosh that they seem to expect intelligent children to enjoy nowadays.<br/><br/>Set in a remote farm outpost in Spain during the Civil War, a forgotten episode in what is indisputably the darkest days of the twentieth century, El Laberinto Del Fauno concerns itself with one extremely dysfunctional family. The mother has just married a Captain of the Spanish army, an incredibly evil man who is without redeeming feature. It is amazing to see another film in the vein of RoboCop, Total Recall, or Zwartboek where the true villain of the piece is so unremittingly evil that one is unafraid to hate his guts for the film's duration. It makes the payoff at the end of the film that much more satisfying. The torments and injuries the Captain endures through the course of the film are gruesome enough, but we are allowed the luxury of believing he deserves every bit of it. As a nemesis for his stepdaughter, the Captain is one of the best-drawn middlemen of evil since Darth Vader. Yet, in spite of how he can gouge a man's eyes out without pausing for breath, he is by no means the most frightening thing in the film.<br/><br/>El Laberinto Del Fauno, as you would expect with a film bearing such a title, is entirely in Spanish. This obviously necessitated the use of subtitles to translate the dialogue in countries where Spanish is not the primary language, but the nuances of the language would also make dubbing a crime. Even if you do not understand the phrases being spoken, their enunciations make the intent in every sentence plainly obvious. El Laberinto Del Fauno moves and plays like a silent film, where the combinations of body language and music allow the viewer to draw their own conclusion regarding the scene. One could even treat scenes like the Captain conducting his torture sessions as being a comedy if that is their inclination. Quite frankly, I feel it is a sick one, but that is the viewer's prerogative. To be quite frank, scenes in which participants torture one another have a much better aural quality to them when the dialogue is in Spanish. As a result, El Laberinto Del Fauno is the only film I have seen to date, other than Paul Verhoeven's Dutch-language efforts, that I feel uncomfortable watching at times.<br/><br/>Special mention must go to the special effects team who, for one reason or another, chose to make the film using practical effects for what amounts to a majority of the screen time. CGI seems to have been limited to such tasks as painting out an actor's real legs or other such fine details that could not otherwise have been accomplished. The faun is such a marvel of practical costume design, puppetry, and digital erasure that one wonders if the whole team did not suddenly become possessed by the ghost of Jim Henson. However, unlike Ludo, Kermit, or Animal, the production team in this case has mastered the one emotion that Henson was never able to invoke in an adult audience: fear. Yes, even this grown man who continues to stand in horror as the realisation dawns that we have not learned a thing from the time this film is set in feels a shudder of genuine fear when the faun appears to lose his patience with Ofelia. Perhaps it has something to do with the complexity of the character.<br/><br/>If you have not already seen the film, I advise skipping this paragraph, but it is necessary to discuss the final moments in order to illustrate a point. I must also praise the writers for the maturity and power of their story. The ambiguous nature of how the ending is phrased can lead the viewer to entirely different conclusions. If they choose, they can believe the princess was rewarded for her willingness to shed her own blood in place of her half-brother's. Conversely, they may also choose to believe the reward was little more than a dying hope on the behalf of yet another victim of a senseless war. Either way, praise is due to writer/director Guillermo del Toro for refusing to take the easy way out and simply throw a clearly happy ending into the audience's lap in order to appease them. This is a bold move that Peter Jackson especially fumbled by failing to execute in a satisfactory fashion. And that is partly the point. In spite of not being based on one of the most celebrated novels in the English language, El Laberinto Del Fauno will be remembered long after The Lord Of The Rings In Name Only is forgotten.<br/><br/>El Laberinto Del Fauno is a ten out of ten film that everyone, but especially those with an interest in storytelling, should see at least twice."
"Bob Pr.","10","8","15","6 February 2007"," Beautifully told, half fairy tale, half tragic reality
","The fairy tale aspects of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" resemble somewhat Lewis's ""The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"" in that there is a fantasy world one steps into and out of from a ""real"" world. But the film of ""...the Wardrobe's"" book was not the work of CS Lewis but of a translator (into film). <br/><br/>IMO ""Pan's Labyrinth"" has FAR more power and I suspect much of that comes because it is the director's (del Toro) fairy tale and his conception and realization was always in the grammar and syntax of film. Probably, for that reason, it is an EXTREMELY powerful, unforgettable presentation. <br/><br/>Some will despise it while many others will value it, often for similar reasons: there is not a single message or a single point of view. The film can be viewed from almost equally valid contrasting positions -- one, that the fairy tale aspects are a young girl's fantasy life boat she creates to escape a harsh, uncomfortable world. The other is that her fantasy world DOES have a reality and life of its own. <br/><br/>There is ample evidence distributed throughout for both points of view.<br/><br/>HELPFUL HISTORICAL POINTS: The time is 1944, shortly after the end (1939) of the last Spanish Civil War which was won by the fascist dictator, Gen. Francisco Franco, head of the Spanish army in Spanish Morocco. His fight and rise to power was supported by many factions: the Catholic church, many wealthy Spaniards, and other factions. Franco's bloc was opposed by the existing government (a republic) and a coalition of other factions with opposing agendas (such as decreasing the strong influences of the Catholic Church and the wealthy upper class, etc.). <br/><br/>Several autocratic regimes gave Franco support: Hitler and Mussolini sent tanks, dive bombers, and troops, flouting League of Nations efforts to keep others from intervening. Spain became Hitler's laboratory for his later Wermacht tactics. Socialists, communists, and anti-fascists in many countries provided volunteer soldiers to help the republic; the Abraham Lincoln brigade was composed of Americans who volunteered to fight fascism.<br/><br/>Franco's forces made deliberate efforts to crush equally all opposition and non-supporters by brutality, coercion, atrocities. The actions in this film deal with residual rebel forces unwilling to concede defeat.<br/><br/>I have no idea how representative Capitan Vidal's actions and attitudes would be for Spain in 1944, five years after the Civil war's end but they are symbolic of the approach used by Franco forces during the war (and possibly also by many of those who opposed him, maybe in retaliation? or maybe not?). <br/><br/>The photography, music, visualizations, directing, casting and acting are superb. It's said at Cannes the film received a 22 minute ovation; IMO every second was deserved.<br/><br/>There are some scenes of graphic torture that I could not bear to see and had to position my hands in front of my eyes so I could still read the subtitles while blocking the rest of the screen.<br/><br/>THIS IS NOT A FILM FOR CHILDREN. It is both a history lesson and a fairy tale for adults.<br/><br/>The preteen girl in the part of Ofelia is outstanding and carries a film that needs no carrying. The other main characters were also excellent -- Capitan Vidal, Carmen (his new wife), Mercedes (house manager & rebel), the doctor, and the Faun/Pale Man.<br/><br/>IF you can appreciate ambiguity in the dividing line between fantasy and reality -- and competing interpretations, IF you can tolerate holding up your hands to block acts of cruelty from your eyes, SEE IT -- it's destined to be an iconic classic. <br/><br/>BUT IF that sort of thing isn't your cup of tea, save your time and money, see something else -- and don't diss this for being something it isn't.<br/><br/>FWIW/FYI: at this time, with 19,000+ votes, over 85% rated ""PL"" as a 10, 9, or 8; fewer than 5% rated it 5 or lower."

His most impressive feat, however, is the ease with which he weaves the otherworldy elements into the central narrative conflict of anarcho-communist rebels fighting against fascist rule; either side of reality could have easily been cheapened, but the careful parallels and intertwining action form a remarkable symbiosis contained by the barriers of the fable. Dark and sometimes graphically violent, it is not a fantasy for children (unless they are especially stalwart), but the compelling storylines, fine performances, and glorious visuals should make all but the most hardhearted and cynical adults believe in fairies just as much as the open-eyed heroine.<br/><br/>90/100"

These scenes complement the main characters nicely, since they are either stupid, cruel or both.<br/><br/>Although you could be forgiven for thinking the film is a fantasy movie, the fantasy parts make up a surprisingly small part of the film, while the fascist-versus-rebels main plot is an incredibly childish story, an annoying insult to your intelligence.<br/><br/>Cinematography, special effects, and puppeteering are very good.

","This movie is the most over-hyped, underwhelming mess I have seen in some years.

I literally thought this was a joke for a while--how could millions of people be so in love with this mess--but apparently people are lemmings.<br/><br/>The central character is SO APPALLINGLY EVIL--so mean, so insane, so brutal, such a DICK--that it just slams the film into the wall. He is so bad that watching him becomes a chore, and silly at the same time.<br/><br/>Direction of the actors reacting to him is like something out of a junior high school production of ""King Lear"". Everyone either stammers and quakes and stares in abject fear at this schmuck or salutes him with a ""jahwohl"" that would have given Hitler a hard-on.<br/><br/>The art direction would be fine if we were all beetles and lived in humus in the forest. As I am not, it was barely discernible on the screen, with the saturation of darkness and the fuzzy lensing and the cobwebs and smoke and all the other crap he threw into every shot.

","Location is king. Not only in real-estate business but in film industry as well, at least when it comes to earning respect of posh film- goers, i.e. film critics and IMDb-ers.<br/><br/>If this film was done in Hollywood, just the way it is, everybody and their dog would hate it. If it was an ""indie"", it would've been ""okay"" and ""interesting"". But it was a non-English speaking film, with subtitles, directed by a Mexican, produced in Spain. And there you have it - it's a ""foreign masterpiece"" earning universal acclaim. Everybody seems to have lost their minds and I'll take as a consolation that at least general public didn't buy this crap. Not in droves anyway. Unfortunately the film was successful enough to assure the screenwriter/director behind it, Guillermo del Toro, further Hollywood gigs so we can be treated to more puerile fantasies he created living in his mother's basement. I mean, just take a look at his face, that's what mothers' basements residents look like.<br/><br/>It's not the first time that a pretentious and vile turd is held in a high regard. It's just that it was nowhere else as obvious as it is here, right from the start. A fantasy story of an underworld is gratuitously intertwined with a story from the Spanish Civil War. Gratuitously, because Spanish Civil War is not really topical these days (perhaps not even in Spain anymore), but what's worse and more important, the two stories almost never interact with each other throughout the film. The only connection seems to be the character of a little girl, who lives during the War, and the fantasy underworld, hiding beneath the Pan's labyrinth, may or may not be a figment of her imagination. Depending of what's the case, she uses it to either physically or mentally escape the brutalities of everyday life. She switches locations back and forth but appears to fall victim to circumstances in both the real and the imaginary realms, until the very end where she is bestowed with some bureaucratic powers in the underworld. By that time, nobody cares anymore, firstly because it's hard to relate to a constant victim, and secondly because the underworld was never given any meaningful purpose, not even as an allegory.<br/><br/>Another gratuitous thing is violence. The other character the film concentrates on is the girl's stepfather, a Spanish officer. Atrocities we see him commit throughout are so needlessly graphically gruesome to the point one can't believe what's on screen. Maybe the point was to show brutality of war, I'd go with that, but the sheer intensity and the grotesqueness of it throw the concept of parallel stories way off-balance. There is no way the Underworld story can parry. The difference is too jarring to be called ""juxtaposition"". It's more like changing the channels between two different films. Furthermore, some key scenes with the officer are shot from his point of view, thus inviting us to relate to a sadistic psychopath, who is, on top of all, poorly underwritten. He is just hundred percent mean to the core, without room for anything else whatsoever. Claustrophobic, really. To coerce the audience to relate to that reveals Guillermo del Toro as a sick, deranged psychopath himself. Kind of like Quentin Tarantino, but lacking any sort of wit that would redeem the experience.<br/><br/>What del Toro doesn't lack is the pretentiousness. He throws in the Civil War, as if that alone was supposed to *mean* something, but never bothers to provide us with the ""why"". He builds up the story as if there will be some great payoff for the viewers after all they've been put through. But it never comes. There is a closure, but it's such a one-note write-off, one wonders what the hell was the whole film for. Interestingly enough, it wasn't boring to watch. But, then again, getting your fingernails pulled out with a pair of pliers isn't boring either.<br/><br/>Set designs and effects are good. Too bad they were there merely to dress up del Toro's macabre onanism."

","This movie was horrible, definitely a waste of my time. In my opinion this movie has such a simple plot and structure to it that people tend to overrate it because it gives off a mystical complex idea of a plot that is easily understood yet requires the intelligence of a 1st grader to understand. I've noticed so many people calling it a superb and spectacular fantasy, what makes it such a great fantasy? is it the guy with eyes in his hands? the big frog? or the faun and his fairies? because those are the only fantasy elements in this movie, plus I don't understand why the faun would give her a second chance at immortality after she eats the food off that creepy thing's table, I feel it was just the failed attempt to add suspense and to integrate why that thing would chase after her. I've also noticed many people analyzing this movie's simple metaphors and themes if you're looking for a real movie to analyze check out Donnie Darko. Although I did enjoy the guy with eyes in his hands. Definitely a movie to watch just to say you've seen it, but it will be a waste of your time."

We were sympathetic to the child, but pretty much couldn't care less about any of the other participants.

But, given the choice, it's a no-brainer.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the movie is simple. It's the ketchup and ice cream analogy. Both are good, but they suck together. Here is a war movie with a child who lives in a fantasy world - presumably in order to escape her terrible surroundings. The fantasy was fairly interesting. The war was fairly interesting. Putting both together in the same movie is ketchup and ice cream. It is irrelevant to me that the reason the fantasy even exists is because of the war. The fact is, they don't mesh well in a movie.

","I don't want to sound like an intellectual snob, but when a movie attempts to tell a Hero Quest story and fails so spectacularly through incompetence, it's hard not to. Basically, the Hero Quest, as developed by Joseph Campbell, is a pretty rigid story structure with very strict rules. The Quest is supposed to be the archetypal journey every hero character takes to achieve a goal no one else can.<br/><br/>Del Toro makes it obvious pretty early on that the main character, Ofelia, is meant to go on this quest when she passes through a vaginal threshold in the beginning of the film and yet again when she's given a series of tasks, one of which includes finding a key. By the rules of the Hero Quest, that's all very by the book stuff.<br/><br/>But after the initial stages of the Hero Quest are completed, del Toro takes the movie in a whole different direction and has the main character defeat her own quest to become a hero. What's left is a mess of a story which completely contradicts itself and a main character who fails miserably.<br/><br/>It's a horrendously insulting movie. It's a dumb story with a horrible pay-off and no character development or structure."
"Philby-3","9","7","13","10 February 2007"," A Spanish fantasy for all
","I've not seen any of Guillermo del Toro's earlier films, but this one places him, along with Alejandro González Iñárritu and Alfonso Cuaron, as a Spanish-American film-maker with broad appeal. This film (unlike ""Babel"") sticks within one very specific cultural milieu, Franco's Spain in 1944 seen through the eyes of Ofelia, an 11 year old girl whose widowed mother has been desperate enough to marry a particularly zealous and nasty fascist army officer. Not surprisingly she escapes into her own world of fantasy, in which she is a princess of the underworld trying to find her way home.<br/><br/>The film is stacked full of good performances. Ivana Banquero, is stunning as Ofelia, and Sergi Lopez is completely convincing as her ruthless and single-minded stepfather, Captain Vidal. Maribel Verdu as Mercedes the housekeeper also puts in a strong performance, as does Alex Angulo as the doctor and Doug Jones as Pan and the Pale Man (aided by some terrific costume design).<br/><br/>It is interesting that while the fascists are portrayed as the bad guys del Toro makes an attempt to explain what drives them. In one dinner scene the local notables are entertained by Vidal to a sumptuous feast (while everyone around is on strict rations). After the third or so round of drinks he announces that all men are not equal, ""we won the war and therefore deserve the best."" His listeners (except for the doctor) enthusiastically agree. Vidal, desperate for a son, is also motivated by tradition; his father was an army general who died in battle, for Vidal ""the only way to die"". But he is also a sadist  his interrogations go long past mere military brutality. Perhaps the message is you don't have to be a sadist to be a good fascist, but it helps.<br/><br/>The resistance are of course portrayed as the good guys, but their tactics are as brutal as those of the military, shooting the wounded where they fall, for example. They also find it hard to accept that the war is over, and they are merely the subject of a mopping-up operation headed up by a real bastard very happy in his work.<br/><br/>Most of the action takes place in a gloomy and surprisingly wet forest so well evoked we can almost smell the mud. The fantasy sequences owe something to Lewis Carroll as well as Mervyn Peake - ""Alice in Wonderland"" meets ""Gormenghast"" (Pan has a little in common with the White Rabbit). Visually, this is a terrific film.<br/><br/>The good guys did win out in the end, but it took another 30 years, and happened peacefully. The speed at which Spain has left its fascist past behind tells us something, I think."

","Yes, this movie is a fairy tale. Yes, it deals with fairies, fauns, and ogres, with magic spell books and princesses. No, this movie is not at all for children nor those who dislike major violence.<br/><br/>Labyrinth takes place in Spain in 1944s, during a time of Spanish civil war. A ruthless Captain (Sergi López), has set up camp in a distant forest, and requests that his pregnant step-wife (Ariadna Gil) and her fantasy-obsessed daughter, Ofelia (brilliantly played by Ivana Baquero) join him there. As she tries to adjust to the country life smack dab in the middle of the battlefield, Ofelia runs into a magical fairy who leads her to a mystical labyrinth, where she meets a mysterious and suspicious faun, Pan (wonderfully played by Doug Jones), who tells her that she is the long-lost princess of an underground kingdom, and that she must complete three dangerous tasks to return to her throne.<br/><br/>While the movie closely follows Ofelia's tasks, spoken to her by a magic book from Pan, it is mostly about the war, double agents (Maribel Verdú and Álex Angulo), and the Captain's near-obsession with his expected son. The battles are extremely brutal (starting early with a couple of rabbit hunters) and made me queazy a couple of times. So brutal are these deaths, in fact, that you'll be relieved to see a simple shot to the head or back.<br/><br/>The acting is top-notch, and young Ivana Baquero has a huge and brilliant future ahead of her (picture Dakota Fanning, only a better actress and less annoying). The animation is phenomenal, but not nearly as breathtaking as the costumes or scenery. The labyrinth itself just sucks all the breath out of you when you see it at night for the first time. The ""pale man"" (also played by Doug Jones), is by far the most terrifying creature in the movie, most-likely to give even the most mature and grown-up adults shivers.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie does have sub-titles (it's in Spanish), but it's hardly noticeable at first, so much so that you forget about them by the tragic end of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is frightening and sad to the extreme, but it also gives you a sense of hope that magic does, in fact, exist. One of the best movies I've seen in a long time and truly the fairy tale of the decade!"

I came out, amazed and stunned on how well this movie was made and it truly lived up to my expectations.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth follows the story between a girl and his mother, meeting her newly adopted father during a Spanish war. Her new father isn't very nice, and all he wants is something (no spoilers). The girl, named Ofelia then meets up with Pan in a labyrinth, and he tells her that she can be a princess and be an immortal if she does three tasks for him. However, it doesn't turn out as easy as she thought.<br/><br/>A wonderful movie is all I can say! It's not an all fantasy movie, it's about 50/50. Half it it focuses on Ofelia and the labyrinth, and the other focuses on the Spanish war. However, it all links up to the ending, so both parts of the movie are important. All of the acting is excellent and the creatures in this movie are some of the best I've seen in a movie. Pan and the Pale Man looked absolutely amazing.<br/><br/>All of this topped up with a highly polished and well written story can guarantee this will be mentioned somewhere in the Oscars. Del Toro has truly made a masterpiece, and this is what you really call a fantasy movie. Yes, all of the language is in Spanish but that doesn't mean a movie can't be considered a masterpiece. I quickly got used to the subtitles and I kind of liked the Spanish language used in the movie, since it was set in Spain and would be kind of silly with English.<br/><br/>So, overall, Pan's Labyrinth lived up to my expectations. If you've been looking for an excellent, well made fantasy movie for 2006, then this is your answer. Even if you hate foreign movies, you've still got to see it! Well written, brilliant acting, and a creative movie makes this one a movie you can't miss. I'm glad I saw it, and you'll love it too."

","Film's like Pan's Labyrinth only come once in a decade! This film is absolutely wonderful. It is a fantasy/fairy tale drama set during the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War at the end of world war 2. The central character is a little girl played by the subtle Ivana Baquero, but it is not a kids film. It is very violent and is bereft of ANY compassion. What is gained from all the violence is a strong metaphorical answer towards the 'real world' and the 'fantasy world' which the lead character is slowly led into. The films central explorations are hope, redemption, sacrifice, faith, fate and what answers lie beyond life itself. Yet, it is not an escape into a fantasy world.<br/><br/>The set designs and costumes are outstanding. Doug Jones does a brilliant job of bringing Fauno and Pale Man to life. But the real star is Guillermo del Toro. With his great vision and excellent story telling, he brings the entire film to life. He knows exactly what fans want and works brilliant towards genre.<br/><br/>This is a flawless film.<br/><br/>""It is not a matter of agreeing or disagreeing. I've got to the point where it IS the Citizen Kane of fantasy movies. As soon as ANYONE says BUT, I don't want to hear it. It's like looking at the Mona Lisa and saying ""yeah, it's alright, gotta bit of a wonky smile"" NO... NO... NO!! It is a masterpiece"" - To that I agree and so should everyone else who watches this film.<br/><br/>I can not praise this film enough. It is almost impossible to explain the experience. You have to see it for yourself. Especially with poor fantasy/fairy tale films that we've received this year and last year (Chronicles of Narnia), this should bring back hope towards cinema in everyone.<br/><br/>If there is only 1 film you watch this year, watch Pan's Labyrinth."

It does, indeed, hearken back to the original Brothers Grimm, and the older form of fairy tale, which was violent and very intense. Contrast this with the dumbed-down nursery tales pumped out by virtually everybody else, especially Disney.<br/><br/>Disney fairy tale stuff is fine for 3 to 8 year-olds. And they do some great movies for adults, too. But Disney's over-sanitized cutsie-a-thons even troubled me as a child. My dad gave me the book 'Pinochio', published ca. 1900, when I was 10. It was a long, brutal, and scary story, very exciting and satisfying. Nothing like the treacle the Disney movie dished up to us. This is not to beat up Disney--- they do fine work, for what it is: morally ambiguous, maudlin, saccharine tales suitable for the uncritical. But do, do, DO understand that this movie is as far from anything Disney has ever even contemplated as possible. This is not for kids. It is for you. It is deep, serious, and as thrilling and exciting as any war movie, murder mystery, or family drama you'll ever see.<br/><br/>I was intrigued throughout, and uplifted and gratified by the end.

"jluis1984","10","9","18","23 October 2006"," Beautifully haunting masterpiece
","It seems as if it was just yesterday when a young Mexican director named Guillermo Del Toro sold his house in order to get enough money to complete his first feature length movie, ""Cronos"". Now, more than 10 years later, Guillermo Del Toro finally has created what many (himself included) call ""his masterpiece"", and to the surprise of many, they are not wrong. ""El Laberinto Del Fauno"", Del Toro's 6th movie, is truly a wonderful film deeply rooted in the director's favorite genres: horror and fantasy. A modern fairytale, ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is a remarkable achievement that probably, is just the beginning of a new stage in this courageous and imaginative director.<br/><br/>Set in Spain in 1944, five years after the end of the Spanish Civil War, ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is the story of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a young girl who travels with her mother (Ariadna Gil) to a rural area to meet her mother's new husband, the Captain Vidal (Sergi López). But Ofelia is not very happy with her mother's decision, as the Captain is a very strict and evil man who serves Franco's fascist regime and enjoys to hunt the remaining rebel forces. In the middle of this post-war nightmare, Ofelia finds an ancient labyrinth that is the path to a magical world of faeries and monsters.<br/><br/>In ""El Laberinto Del Fauno"", Del Toro once again dives into the fantastic genres he loves so much, this time exploring the nature of fairy tales, taking them back to its original roots, when fantasy tales were grim, dark and violent. The contrast between the post-war scenery and the fantastic world Ofelia is about to enter is just the first display of the duality motif, constantly present through the film. However, this is more complex than a mere ""good versus evil"" tale, it's about Ofelia's quest for her place in a world filled with the chaos and confusion of war. Deconstructing the hero's journey, Del Toro takes Ofelia through the classic outline of the three tasks she must complete to be able to enter the fantasy realm, with the Faun (Doug Jones) acting as judge and guide.<br/><br/>Visually, Del Toro's film is captivating and filled with a dark beauty that is both frightening and attractive. While the fantastic world Ofelia enters is considerably different than her reality, it's by no means less haunting, as it's also a violent world with scary monsters that may reflect the harsh reality of the post-war Spain. With many themes borrowed from Spain's folklore, ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is very fresh and Del Toro's direction shows a maturity not seen before. One can only wonder what's next for the Mexican director as this film is easily his best film to date.<br/><br/>The cast is simply excellent, starting with the young Ivana Baquero, who delivers a believable performance as Ofelia, carrying the film with power and making a very likable main character. However, the best performance comes from Sergi López, as the ruthless Captain Vidal. At first sight it may look as another typical villain, but López adds a lot of soul to a character that easily could had been a two-dimensional caricature in less talented hands. Maribel Verdú is also quite effective as Mercedes, a young woman who works as a servant and becomes Ofelia's only friend. She shows a lot of emotions in a character specially complex due to her role in the story. Doug Jones plays Pan, the Faun, delivering a very expressive performance under the heavy make-up he had to wear, making an interesting character even more mysterious than he already is. Finally, Álex Angulo and Ariadna Gil complete the cast with effective performances, although I found Gil a bit annoying. Angulo was simply excellent in a subtle low-key role. <br/><br/>""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is a movie that easily could had been a predictable fantasy tale like the rest, but Del Toro constructs a movie that, while clearly follows and respects the fairytale pattern, it's never boring or tiresome, and in fact it keeps increasing its haunting beauty to the unforgettable last frame. Some have criticized the apparently biased way Del Toro presents the Spanish Civil War, but personally, I think that he makes sure to show that, no matter what side you are, in war the ones that lose the most are the children. While the movie is of course very violent, I think the ""R"" rating is really unnecessary, as in the end, real fairy tales used to be that way too. <br/><br/>In the end, ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is a very moving film, moving back and forth between the horror and fantasy realms with ease creating a dark world that may just be a reflection of our own violent reality. Beautifully haunting, ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is a movie that can't be missed. 10/10. A Masterpiece."

","On the surface this sounds like a very intriguing and entertaining film. The juxtaposition of fairy tales and childhood innocence with the horrors of war seen through the eyes of a little girl sounds like a good backbone to a movie.<br/><br/>However, Guillermo Del Toro fumbles big time. with a directorial style that nearly put me to sleep. Del Toro manages to make scenes with faeries, Faun's and flesh eating monsters dull, that in itself is an amazing talent. The magical and fairy tale elements of the film are about as uninteresting as the main focus of the movie, the villain.<br/><br/>This movie spends so much time trying to shove the idea down my throat that the general in this movie is a maniac that it looses a little more every time this horribly over-acted character was on screen.<br/><br/>The characters, the sets, everything until the final credits was an exercise in mediocrity and boredom.<br/><br/>The sole interesting thing in this movie were the creature effects showcased in the movie, as with Hellboy, they are done masterfully.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, also like Hellboy, this film contains many amazing looking things and very little substance and very little reason to care about anything you see on screen."

","This is no doubt the worst movie by Del Toro so far, no matter what other people have said. The plot is simply ridiculously unbelievable, especially if you know a thing or two about recent Spanish history and are not caught in ideological mousetraps. The plot is similar to Del Toro's ""El Espinazo del Diablo"" (2001), but unfortunately it is much weaker. In fact, the viewer will not understand the plot at all unless he or she is mired in a certain ideology which Del Toro apparently shares with his leading actors. The absurdities and historical inaccuracies (especially those concerning Captain Vidal) are too gross and too abundant to list here, and the result is one of the most biased movies I have ever seen."

They look good but are not as visually stunning nor as strangely disturbing as you may have been led to believe. They owe more to standard fairy tales written by adults than they do the wild imaginings of children.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the reality sections are the more like a child's view of the civil war in Spain, where the communists are lovable heroes and the fascists impossibly evil.

While stopping for a break on their initial journey, the youngster fits the missing piece of a statue into its proper place; this unleashes a magical winged creature who leads the girl to the pale faun, a gargoyle-like guru who helps Ofelia understand she possesses the spirit of the Princess Moanna and will live eternal...that is, until she completes three heady tasks before the next full moon! Spanish-language fantasy begins well, combining elements of Grimm and 'Alice in Wonderland' with the modern, grotesque look of a Björk music video, but the elements of the story are hazy rather than coherent (if Ofelia hadn't put back the missing piece, would she still have Moanna's spirit?). Baquero is sublime as the child, but every segue from her to the evil captain halts the movie's momentum, and the incidentals (the captain's party, Ofelia ruining her new dress, the assistant sneaking medicine) aren't compelling. A film which bides its time between an incredible fantasy world and the harsh realities of the day is ultimately going to come up short (we can't wait for the preliminaries to be over with so that the real story can progress); despite a smoothly efficient direction and an able cast, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" simply feels too slight, too undemanding to garner status as a fantasy-classic. ** from ****"
"thebrowncoats-1","5","10","21","10 February 2007"," Disappointing
","I honestly do not understand why this film is receiving rave reviews everywhere. The story is simplistic. The only ambiguity is whether or not the girl is actually seeing fantastical creatures or is simply escaping the harsh realities of fascist Italy via her imagination. The acting is wooden; the characters, largely stereotypes. It is also a brutal film that is far too gory for children. So who is the intended audience? As for the special effects, they were imaginative but relatively infrequent. This was a movie that had lots of potential to which it simply did not live up. Apparently having subtitles and a different ""feel"" from the typical Hollywood film is enough to get rave reviews these days. Very disappointing."

There are 2 or 3 scenes with the fantasy value, and even then they're ridiculous and have no connection to a war film. The 'amazing fantasy creatures' are:<br/><br/>1) That annoying faun. 2) Those small fairy insects in a box. 3) A giant toad (I know, real imaginative!) 4) That small screeching thing that lives in milk... 5) Something with eyes in its hands that walks in the most ridiculous manner possible. That's it.<br/><br/>And other than these cheap excuses for fantasy what is there? Oh yeah, there's a Spanish person who mindlessly kills all the other characters in the movie.

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Despite going more commercial with the Hellboy films, Spanish special effects wunderkind Gullirmo Del Toro has probably made more of a name for himself with this cult, subversive independent film set against the backdrop of Franco's Spain. Shot in his native homeland, with no doubt a fraction of the budget, he's still managed to produce some incredible special effects that are truly a wonder to the eye and mind. And his tale of a young girl caught between the conflict of a band of freedom fighters and the fascist dictatorship her father is part of who escapes into a wonderful fantasy land to escape the harsh reality of her existence has promise and a pleasant charm all of it's own. Sadly, I could not get involved in the plot at all and it simply failed to engage me through-out. Still, it's made an impression on many others and is likely to remain a cult classic for some time to come. **"
"Flagrant-Baronessa","10","8","16","9 February 2007"," Reality vs. Illusion
","Now listen, I don't usually shower films with perfect tens, let alone those that are yet to stand the test of time, but I have to be honest here: I can't find anything tangibly wrong with Guillermo del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth"". Set against the backdrop of Franco's fascist repression in 1944, a young girl descends into fabled fantasy to escape the harsh reality of her step-father reign. This beautiful set-up is sheer darkly goosebumps-inducing magic, and the bitter everyday drama is almost as bitingly compelling.<br/><br/>""Pan's Labyrinth"" is in this way neatly-composed of two parallel stories operating seamlessly in the same film, interweaving bucketloads of suspense in every single shot. On the realistic, reality-based end of the spectrum, we have Sergi López as the repressive big-shot Capitán Vidal, Ofelia's step-father. Although the latter brings wonderful wide-eyed intensity to her leading role, it is truly López who projects the most charisma in his performance, creating not a caricature of a villain, but a fully-fledged powerhouse of a tyrant.<br/><br/>Ofelia is not as well-acted as she is well-written, it needs to be said. Yet this is understandable, for Del Toro gives us a no-holds-barred likable heroine who displays some of the most fearless antics you will see in films this year. She crawls through muddy hellholes with bugs on her legs. She visits demons. When she sees the iconic fearsome faun again, she runs up and hugs him. When her mother asks her to tell her unborn child a soothing bed-time story, Ofelia tells him dark nightmares, because they're stories to her.<br/><br/>As for cinematography and the likes, the more CGI there is in a film, the more heart it needs to project. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" passes this criteria with flying colours because although the heaviest weapon in Guillermo Del Toro's directorial arsenal is undeniably his dark visuals, the wrapping story is so tear-jerkingly compelling that CGI typically takes a backseat to the drama in the film. The score, lullabies and all, is unspeakably disturbing  which tells me it is scored perfectly to a fantasy epic like this.<br/><br/>Yes, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a foreign film, foreign not only in its speaking language, but in its visual linguistics and imagination. The whole world created on the colour-awash screen is alien to most people, and atmospheric originality goes a long way. In the end, the film is a self-spun cocoon of childhood magic laced with dark notions, something like a NC-17 version of Alice in Wonderland  something absolutely extraordinary.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"

There are always some excitements and joys awaiting us.<br/><br/>I watched this movie last night, and I can't help to share my enjoyment with others. Life is complicated and mysterious. While most of us lead a desperate mundane life, it is still so.Like Whistler is reputedly the first painter to touch the nocturnal scenery, Del Toro explores the heart of the dark.Truman Capote's novels are classified into two categories: day settings and nocturnal settings.In the latter, it is the world of mysteries, it is the world of human hearts. and in this movie Del Toro entwines the two into a piece. hail to genius!"

This movie renewed my interest in movies, and I look forward to going back and watch del Toro's other films. I would recommend it to anyone."
"Alleyman13","10","8","16","15 December 2006"," An excellently executed film.
","There is not one thing that I didn't like about this movie. The mixture of the fairy tale theme and the Spanish Civil War work amazingly well together. As I sat in the dark watching it, Del Toro's magnificent cinematography sucked me in and never let go. At no point during the film was I lulled to sleep. So many of the films nowadays, in my point of view, let you know that they are films. Pan's labyrinth, with the fantastic creatures and the twists actually made me believe that I was actually part of the story. The various match cuts also put me into the fairy tale realm. This film however is not the type of film that children should attend, but is incredible nonetheless."
"davidwestwell","10","8","16","10 December 2006"," A Must See Film
","This film deserves the Oscar for best film never mind best foreign film. The acting by all participants is an example to all aspiring actors. I went in to see this film with some trepidation but was amazed by the sheer simplicity of the story and the characterisations that carried the story throughout the film. The director has managed to incorporate both fantasy and reality in such away as to entice the audience to believe in his story. One word of question is that I think Spanish film makers are now attempting to rewrite Spanish history via films portraying the civil war, in such a way that the Republican army should have won this war and the Facists should never have come to power in the first place."
"AndrewPhillips","10","8","16","10 December 2006"," Amazing
","What a truly remarkable film, there are so many things about it that are good that this could turn into a list but I will resist.<br/><br/>Visually this film has everything you could wish for, with fantasy scenes that are masterfully created, from the journey through the tree and the giant toad, to the fawn and the very sinister and quite frightening, what shall I call it, child eater with eyes in its hands thing. The use of light or lack of it sometimes invokes emotions throughout, I was also taken with the scenes in the rain, not only visually but the sound, it felt oppressive, a great link to what was being felt by the rebels.<br/><br/>Who would not resort to a fantasy world when faced with a sadistic and down right evil step father like the captain. I flinched when he continually stabbed the bottle into the farmers son's face. When that poor stuttering lad was being tortured and after, did you see what had happened to his hand ooh. But sowing your own mouth up, I was watching through my hands. This part was played amazingly well by Sergi Lopez a brilliant actor, we believed in him and welcomed his death at the end.<br/><br/>Having seen only one other del Torro film the devils backbone, also very good, I am amazed at his ability to get such good performances from children. Just remarkable here, Ivana Bagelro should have awards heaped upon her. So moving, at the end when she is dieing, even through we know it is just her fantasy, she believes it and somehow that makes us grateful in her last moments.<br/><br/>The supporting cast were outstanding, especially Maribel Verdu who played Mercedes, she brought to the role real passion, brilliant.<br/><br/>You don't have to know anything about the war to appreciate the film or story. It will go down as one of the best films of all time, an experience that you will be hard pushed to forget."
"mikethebutcher","10","8","16","28 November 2006"," Amazing
","This film is outstanding. I went to see it last night after hearing a few very positive reviews and I was not disappointed. I am not a film buff and am not familiar with Guillermo del Toro's non-Hollywood films so didn't really know what to expect, but the director's imagination impressed me greatly.<br/><br/>This is both one of the most beautiful and the most gruesome/chilling films I have ever seen. The contrast between this, and between Franco's Spain and the Labyrinth are breathtaking. Franco's Spain in itself is a great backdrop to the film as it doesn't tend to get much exposure to non-Spanish audiences. The labyrinth is a superb piece of fantasy, with amazingly creepy characters like the Faun and the creature with no eyes.<br/><br/>The characters are all well-developed and excellent. The acting is also perfect, as is the music. I was deeply moved by this film and would recommend it to anyone, except children who will have nightmares for years. Do not be put off by the subtitles, as they are barely noticeable. I find it hard to believe how anyone on IMDb could give this film a score below 7/8, it is fantastic."
"tokago","10","8","16","27 November 2006"," A masterpiece in every aspect
","Up to this film, there was quite good enough evidence about the talent of Guillermo Del Toro as a director. I'm pretty sure that he will keep on providing good work. But however, after seeing this movie, there's one new thing else that i'm sure of... He will never be able to create such a beautiful movie again. This is surely a masterpiece; and this is his masterpiece that will ruin the rest of his life with a huge cast of shadow. Just like the Brazil did and actually -still doing- on Gilliam.<br/><br/>El Laberinto del Fauno is a very brutal and violent fairy tale that is carefully and masterfully scripted and directed, both by Del Toro. It can easily be compared to last year's Chronicles of Narnia, but unlike Narnia, this movie is very clear and consistent on its subject material. While Narnia departs from its initial offer, moving towards an exaggerated symbolism, therefore towards a childish fairy tale since the symbolism was far out of range to be meaningful, El Laberinto Del Fauno never looses its ties with reality. What this movie offers is a very hard to find combination of reality and disillusion, an impossible to find mixture of violence/brutality and humanism, and a one in a million possibility of innocence and guiltiness together, all eating from same can. These kind of combinations or pairs can only exist in one place: in a singular brain. And just like that, the movie chooses a perfect atmosphere for delivering the story: Civil War. A civil war (in this movie: Spanish civil war in fact) is like a self-arguing brain. The harshness of reality and the dosage of brutality is horribly high, so that we can easily and -willingly cross over to disillusion with Ophelia. So; This Labyrinth, may be a very valuable opening to your-our forgotten childhood.<br/><br/>This is a perfect movie, the perfect fiction movie (that i haven't seen for years) and obviously the best 2006 movie. Everyone should see this fairy tale, but not the children, because of the brutality fact. There will be sure enough time for it."

"teh_mode","9","8","16","25 November 2006"," dark, twisted, sublime, wondrous and excellently made. This is a triumph of modern cinema.
","All your emotions will be thoroughly tested in Guillermo Del Toro's grim fairy tale. A masterful fable that alternates between uber-gritty realism and dark, twisted fantasy with such a sublime slickness, it is near startling. A young woman by the name of Ofelia has just moved to rural Spain, with her sick, pregnant mother where her new husband, the slimy fascist Captain Vidal is currently holding his troops. Constantly under fire from partisan soldiers in the wooden hills, Vidal must attend to his wife whilst fighting for Franco's regime. Ofelia, meanwhile, is caught in a struggle to escape the grim realities of war-torn Spain. She is in love with stories, notably her fairy tales. One night, she is visited by a fairy, which brings her to the ""labyrinth"". A secret maze, run by a tall, tree-like faun. He calls her ""your highness"" and a princess, and gives her tasks to complete for him, each one adding a new page to her empty fairytale book.<br/><br/>Whilst from a distance Pan's Labyrinth may seem like a children's grim fairytale, it is anything but for children. The majority of the movie is far more concerned with Captain Vidal and his horrendous callousness to both his wife, his people and to the Spanish resistance. In a film that features a skinless monster with eyes in his hands, slowly creeping towards Ofelia as she avoids becoming the rancidly gravel-voiced demon's next dinner meal, Vidal is by far the most putrid thing on screen. A man who fears dreamers and thinkers, one of who just happens to be the innocent Ofelia. Her mother doesn't understand, nor does the Captain. It seems the only people she can turn to are the shrewd resistance-sympathising maid Mercedes (Maribel Verdu, of Y Tu Mama Tambien fame) and the faun himself.<br/><br/>Do not be fooled. This is a movie about children, but not for children. There are at least two torture sequences, which despite being purely simplistic are every bit as masochistic as Saw or Casino Royale. The themes dealt with in Pan's Labyrinth are simple, yet adult ones, managing to mesh the contrast between fantasy and reality to startling effect. Every bit as wonderful and awe-inspiring as it is grim and melancholic  you will be hard-pressed to find a better film this year."

","Another one of those anointed films that people have to make junk up about to rationalize their obsession. Bottom line is: lots of people these days love to watch films that are about little more than CRUELTY ... slasher films, supposed psychological thrillers, and others. At the end of the day, they're just an excuse to sell tickets via showing cruelty. So, this film takes that path but adds a fairly good story and some good acting and some a strange interaction between a 20th century civil war and fairy tale darkness. Contrary to the opinions of some here, no those two worlds did not blend well. That is one of the fundamental problems with the film. We can spend hours finding ways the two worlds may intersect, ways the two themes speak to universal truths, but, hey, why don't you just go back to flippin burgers. In this film, they clash, not blend. Discord, not harmony.<br/><br/>At least, unlike others who were disappointed, I didn't have ""unsurmountable expectations"". Even so, I was disappointed. I agree that it feels half-baked and the fantasy world goes completely unrealized and remains paper thin throughout. Contrary to the opinions of some here, the pale creature is not ""devastatingly creepy"". He is interesting. He is well done. He is in the film for about 2 minutes. In those 2 minutes, he does nothing really creepy.<br/><br/>Another fundamental problem is that, other than the girl, nobody is really likable. You know, it would have helped if we could have liked the mother, at least. Or, if Mercedes wasn't so stupid that she didn't kill the Captain. Really. Who with half a brain says, ""You won't be the first pig I've gutted!"" to someone lying helpless on the floor, and then turns around and runs away ... with little hope of escaping and no real idea that running away sooner really makes escape more likely. Just dumb writing. I won't bother with other holes."

","In 1944, in the post-Civil War in Spain, rebels still fight in the mountains against the fascist troops. The young and imaginative Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) travels with her pregnant and sick mother Carmen Vidal (Ariadna Gil) to the country to meet and live with her stepfather, the sadistic and cruel Captain Vidal (Sergi López), in an old mill. During the night, Ofelia meets a fairy and together they go to a pit in the center of a maze where they meet a faun that tells that she is a princess from a kingdom in the underground. He also tells that her father is waiting for her, but she needs to accomplish three gruesome, tough and dangerous assignments first. Meanwhile, she becomes friend of the servant Mercedes (Maribel Verdú), who is the sister of one of the rebels and actually is giving support to the group. In a dark, harsh and violent world, Ofelia lives her magical world trying to survive her tasks and sees her father and king again.<br/><br/>""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is among the best movies I have ever seen, with a fantastic, but very sad, pessimist and violent story, supported by magnificent and powerful characters, wonderful art work, cinematography, soundtrack and make-up. The story takes place in a very difficult period of the Spanish history, the post-Civil War with the victory of Franco. Ofelia, an intelligent girl that loves fairy tales and misses her father, creates an imaginary world to survive to the difficulties of the real world, living the fantasy as escapism. It is interesting to see that even her fantasy is creepy and dark. Her mother Carmen, played by the stunning Ariadna Gil, is a very weak and submissive widow, without expressing her opinion, who probably has suffered many difficulties to raise her daughter without a husband in such difficult times. On the opposite side, the wonderful Maribel Verdú plays Mercedes, a woman full of power and idealism, capable to humiliate herself to achieve her objectives. The outstanding Sergi López (the unforgettable Harry) plays one of the most despicable villains I have ever seen, a cruel, arrogant and evil man that shows no respect for anybody. There is a violent scene that is a rip-off of ""Irréversible"", when Captain Vidal hits the hunter in his nose with a bottle. This masterpiece is certainly the best work of the director Guillermo del Toro, from the excellent ""El Espinazo del Diablo"".

","Okay, I can grok a brilliant film; desperately intelligent, heartbreakingly reaching, meaningfully justified by its own (sudden, like a flash, i.e. brilliant) unique sense of self. I mean, I went back and saw 'being John Malcovich' 4 times in the theater before they stopped showing it! (the only other film I've ever become so immediately obsessed by was 'much ado about nothing'; is there a connection?) I just love any movie that obviously questions itself to the point of letting art happen. This can almost always make for a 'good' film. This film was good, but it was wrong, very wrong, and therefore, 'bad'. Okay, it was horrible. For real want of better means here I will attempt to explore, crippled by the in-articulate (my own) the why I am believing this. <br/><br/>Simply, the very heart or value of a fairy tale has always (secretly, or, 'that something which should not be mentioned but is universally known'...) been its dependence on the mystery of a moral reality. <br/><br/>By the word 'reality', it is presumed, without self conscious realization, to mean or be inexorably linked with the meaning behind the word 'morality'. That is, that that which happens in some circumstance, no matter how hopeless seeming, is somehow also revealing a deeper hope that would allow such a hopeless thing to seemingly be. This allowance is only for the sake of being ultimately, utterly beneficial for the developing identity of the observer or source perceiver. Or in other words, from the 'victims' point of view towards realising a self creating, divine 'forgiveness; or, from their eternal point of view, gratefulness realised. That is, this magic that makes morality the foundation of all and any true story also a fairy tale from the point of view of one who is lost amidst their own forever mysterious and developing story. <br/><br/>Fairy tales are built off of this world as a word, or an other-worldly unconditional point of view called love. <br/><br/>This film perverts this great tradition of human kind by attempting to presumptively build a fairy tale off of a fairy tale, rather than from (a faith in) reality first; and this to the ends of subverting the original magic of a true, faery story. <br/><br/>This is deeply shameful. I can't seem to grasp quite how bad this film really is, much less articulate it; but because I somehow just know how bad this film is I am inclined and motivated to try, and here it was.<br/><br/>I will this say to summarize.

So you think ""wow, I've got to see that."" Yes, there are weird creatures in this movie, but their screen time is brief. The film is largely a standard wartime drama, and the brutality of the Franco regime is shown repeatedly just in case you don't get it the first dozen times. Ever see a man beaten to death with a liquor bottle? It's just one of the three hundred scenes calculated to foment your anger at fascism and the concomitant loss of individual freedom.<br/><br/>There are some startling images in this movie, among them a gigantic frog and a man mending a slice in his face, but you'll spend most of your time wondering what atrocity el capitan will commit next. The suspense is there, certainly, but all the while you'll be wondering: where are the strange creatures I was promised, and how do they fit into the plot? The answer is, they don't.<br/><br/>Yes, this is one of those duality films where all the cool stuff that is going on exists only in the head of the main character Ofelia, in other words, that most boring of themes: individualistic escapism. The film seems to be saying that during times of oppression, it's okay to seek solace in fantasy. In the meantime, a very real rebellion is occurring in the mountains of Spain. This is why the film doesn't work: everything going on inside Ofelia's head has nothing whatsoever to do with the Franco resistance. Del Toro makes sure that the audience has no clue that this duality exists until the very end, where it is shown that Ofelia can see the faun and el capitan cannot.<br/><br/>There's nothing original to be seen here. Even some of the special effects are Harry Potteresque, such as the mandrake and the book with invisible ink.<br/><br/>What is the point to all this?

Unlike many movies that attempt to combine scattered fantasy elements into otherwise naturalistic environments, it never felt like I was being ripped away from the fantasy every time they focused on reality. What was going on in both worlds was compelling.<br/><br/>Pan is portrayed very faithfully as a god of the earth and somewhat of a trickster. When I first saw the trailer and saw how demon-like they made Pan's appearance, I was concerned that the creators had Christianized the story and turned Pan into Satan. I was relieved to discover they stayed faithful to the Pan of Pagan mythology, so no Pagans watching it should fear defamation and no mythologists or historians should fear being totally annoyed.<br/><br/>The horrors of war are brutally honest and graphic, which is exactly how war should be betrayed. So many movies romanticize it or make patriotic statements, when really war is an unspeakably terrible thing, especially when people have to live under a fascist regime, like the characters in this movie.<br/><br/>Loved it, absolutely loved it. Would've given it an 11 if I could."

","I have seen all bad movies lately, even two yesterday and today and this was the third. Possibly it was the worst of the three of them. It's a weird film about a little kid who finds a secret world in Spain or Mexico and her mother's sick. Her father is a bad soldier who kills people in a war that is happening in the real world, although not in the secret world she finds.<br/><br/>I thought it was rubbish. It made me uncomfortable, like peanut butter slapped on my head or eating too much spicy lamb. The so-called special effects were not-so-special and didn't look realistic.

","""You're getting older, and you'll see that life isn't like your fairy tales. The world is a cruel place. And you'll learn that, even if it hurts.""<br/><br/>The lines above, encapsulate not only the essence of Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth, but also the essence of life. It is a brutal portrayal of the world we are now used to and the decadence of morality which is within us. It is about escape. An escape into wonderland. To leave behind the truth which is cold, harsh and abject. To live out a fantasy which offers warmth, affection and hope.<br/><br/>The movie uses Fascist Spain of 1944 as the backdrop.Carmen,a woman widowed by the war, marries Captain Vidal, a savage Fascist Officer, responsible for clearing the surrounding region of rebel activists. She hopes that it will bring stability to her, and more importantly to her daughter,Ofelia.Carmen is pregnant with a second child, which is the sole reason Captain Vidal shelters her as he hopes to have her son. From here, the viewer is alternatively thrown into Ofelia's fairytale world and the war-torn real world; a metaphorical journey into the depths of a child's subconscious and how it twists her sense of reality, leaving you with a melancholic gratification and a stark realization of how tragic the loss of innocence can be.<br/><br/>Words cannot fully describe Ofelia's story, who's real world is so full of grief that her only solace is the world of her dreams. Tormented by her reality she runs to her fantasy which so consumes her that she puts everything at stake in return for the promised utopia. Her story is an allusion to how our aspirations shape us and push us to tread the most treacherous of paths. It tells us that in the darkest of times, it is not around us but within us that we will find the last ray of hope.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is a true classic as it fulfills every requirement of being one, and more. It is not the plot, but the execution which sets it apart. There is a certain simplicity in the tone of storytelling almost as if it were your bedtime story being read out to you by your mother. It follows parallel narratives and yet never loses touch with its heart. The performances are brilliant all around, but special praise must go out to Sergi López , who effortlessly displays the most sadistic and brutal qualities of man, in his portrayal of Vidal. Maribel Verdú who plays the housekeeper at Vidal's home, secretly supporting and aiding the guerrillas hiding in the forest, delivers a strong performance which is backed by some great dialogues. Equally fabulous is Doug Jones who plays the ""Faun"" and ""The Pale Man"" with great aplomb. But the trump card among the cast is young Ivana Baquero, who plays Ofelia, and delivers a heart-wrenching act. Her performance, endearing and charismatic, is the fabric which holds the emotional core of the film together.<br/><br/>The technical crew behind this movie has excelled to a superlative degree.A special mention for the art direction, set design, costumes and make-up as they beautifully reconstruct an enchanting world of fairies and fauns, rabbit-holes and mazes and help in dishing out dark and chilling visuals. The cinematography is obviously exquisite as it conveys a dark, brooding undertone throughout. The musical score and screenplay combine wonderfully well as the rhythms slowly build their way into our memories with the help of the magic that unfolds on screen.<br/><br/>Ultimately it is the sheer genius of the director which makes this simple story a unique work of cinema. He focuses on a theme, which, with all its complexities at the outset, simplifies to something very basic.Choice.He conveys that it is our choices that determine not only our fate, but also the fate of the ones we love. And that sacrifice is the purest form of love. To choose sacrifice is to choose love. And that to choose love, ahead of everything, in the face of every adversity, is the most important choice of them all.<br/><br/>Hats Off!"
"Spaceygirl","10","7","14","7 January 2008"," Horrifying and sublime
","""Pan's Labyrinth"" is at turns horrifying and sublime. A dark fantasy tale set at the tail-end of the Spanish Civil war, it involves a young girl Ofelia being drawn into a fantastical world while starkly devastating realities unfold around her. Yes, it IS in Spanish and yes, there ARE subtitles, but don't let that detract you from experiencing what is probably one of the best films of the decade. The effects are sometimes bizarre and it is absolutely not suitable for the kiddies, but anyone with a love for film will appreciate the beauty and intelligence behind Guillermo Del Toro's best to date. An absolute masterpiece!"
"Lunar-Raven","10","7","14","3 September 2007"," Pan's Labyrinth - A Magical Masterpiece.
","Set in the 1944 fascist era of Spain, Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth is a wonderful but chaotic fairytale that teeters between nightmare, enchantment, and reality. While the story holds a some-what simple, straight forward plot, it is entwined with spectacular imagery, intelligent writing, and some of the most captivating moments that have ever hit the big screen. While this film by definition is considered a fantasy piece, it has a bit of something for everyone; making it an enjoyable film for all walks of life. Through-out this movie, Del Toro manages to weave a bit of history, politics, and fantasy, all together creating an original, unique, and compelling film.<br/><br/>This film quickly begins as a unique story of a young girl named Ofelia unfolds. Ofelia, (played by Ivana Baquero), appears to be an average kid who loves to read and tell fairy tales. Her life drastically changes as she is sent along with her pregnant mother (played by Ariadna Gil) to live with her new stepfather, Capitán Vidal. Capitán Vidal (played by Sergi López), is a ruthless and unforgiving captain of the Spanish army who wants his soon-to-be-born son to grow up with him; hoping that he can help carry out his name. Although Ofelia's ""real life"" situation turns sour as she must deal with her sick mother, as well as the violence that plagues the outdoors between the rebels and fascist troops -- all of these things quickly become less significant as she gets sucked into her own creative world; a world of mystery, enchanting fairies, faun's and giant frogs.<br/><br/>Overall, I felt that this movie was extremely well done. From the amazing cast to the superb imagery, everything in this film was spot-on and created with a great deal of care. Although some of the previews may have been deceiving -- I will say that this movie is not a child's film. While there are some truly beautiful scenes that everyone could appreciate and love, there is also a great deal of realistic violence, death, corruption, and torture. In fact, over ¾'s of the movie is spent focusing on the ""real"" world within this base, which definitely isn't a pretty sight. I can however, say with certainty that Pan's Labyrinth is a brilliantly directed masterpiece, with some of the most visually jaw dropping scene's I've ever seen. This is easily the best fantasy film of 2006. If you like fantasy, I suggest you check this out; however, do be aware that there is quite a bit of violence in this film."
"asturnut","5","7","14","30 May 2007"," Gruesome
","I watch a lot of foreign language films generally enjoy them quite a bit. However, I had reservations about seeing this film because of the violence in it. However, I heard an interesting interview with the director on NPR and he offered some insight into his making of the film so I went ahead and rented it. I regret the decision to watch the movie. Although the movie gave me some perspective on the brutality of the Spanish Civil War (I used to live in Spain), the actual graphic violence in the movie was completely unnecessary. It was downright vile. Del Torro takes the visual representation of violence right down to cheap hack'em up-slash'em up levels. Disgusting. Furthermore, the incongruous interweaving of stories is unsuccessful in my opinion. The ending is as disturbing and unsatisfying as the rest of the movie. Del Torro tries to wrap the movie up and put a little bow on it at the end, but it just doesn't work.<br/><br/>My only positive comment is that the sets and costumes were well done and I encourage others to see foreign movies. If you like disturbing and dark movies, you will probably enjoy this. But I thought the whole movie just didn't click or justify the violence. The movie made me feel icky. Yuck."
"Angeneer","10","7","14","27 February 2007"," Yes classic movies can be made in 2006
","Absolutely magical in every sense. Cliché expressions like words don't do justice fit perfectly to this film. Del Toro gives us the perfect marriage of real and surreal, complimented by amazing visual effects and makeup, breathtaking music, seamless flow of the storyline and of course the brilliant performances of all leads, but especially Ivana Baquero as Ofelia and Sergi Lopez as Capitan Vidal.<br/><br/>It doesn't really matter that this masterpiece, Best Picture of 2006 by far didn't get even Best Foreign Movie from the Academy, because awards are not what matters. What matters is the millions of enchanted cinema goers who will always have this piece of gold in their top ten lists."
"Barky44","8","7","14","28 January 2007"," 24 Hours Later ... Still Not Sure What to Make of It
","It's been over 24 hours since I saw Pan's Labyrinth at the local Googleplex. I'm still not sure if I liked it or not. I'm giving it a good grade (8 out of 10) because it is wonderfully shot, and has great art direction, cinematography, and set design. It's also very well acted and directed, and it's not pretentious or overbearing or simplistic or goofy.<br/><br/>I guess it just didn't connect with me, like it's apparently connected with thousands and thousands of true fans. I'll try to describe the reasons why in a couple of paragraphs, but I doubt they'll be able to capture my antipathy properly.<br/><br/>First, this isn't really an ""adult fantasy film"" as some have ascribed. It really is about kids, namely a girl who's stuck in a horrible position (forced to live with the cruel captain who married her mother). The film shows how kids in terrible situations can often mentally retreat into various fantasies, in this case a realm of fauns and fairies. So why did they give it an ""R"" rating and market it to adults? They should have cut down the violence a bit (it's not gratuitous, the extra notch of ""R"" rated violence doesn't markedly propel the plot) and gone for a PG-13 rating. This way, it would have been actually directed at kids (albeit older ones).<br/><br/>As a reference point, consider what Stephen Spielberg did with his classic ""Empire of the Sun."" That, too, is a story about a kid caught in terrible circumstances (namely imprisonment in Japanese-held China during WWII). That was a PG-13 film, and shot through the eyes of the child, instead of through the eyes of the adults around the child. Something about ""Pan's Labyrinth"" doesn't ring true because of this. We're seeing a young girl's fantasies, but we are constantly torn back to an adult viewpoint. As a result, we never see this young girl grow and understand (and the evolution of a character is a prime force in cinema). If the director had kept us looking through her eyes, our sympathy for the character would be larger.<br/><br/>I think that last paragraph was quite convoluted, so I'll try to re-phrase the main problem of this film. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" does not maintain the cohesive point of view throughout the film. Is this film about a bad world shown through the eyes of a child, or is it a film about the fantasies of a child shown through the lens of the real world? It's this lack of viewpoint cohesion that leaves me cold.<br/><br/>8 out of 10."
"mystflexagon","10","7","14","25 January 2007"," I've seen thousands of films and this is clearly the greatest of all time
","Citizen Kane can go to heck. It's time for the cinephiles of the world to join me -- eternally lost in Del Toro's wonderful Laberinto (as they say in Spain).<br/><br/>Where to even begin? This film is deep. You will see it in the theatre and the film will not leave your mind for many weeks. I have never before seen such amazing character depth. Seriously, I cried at least three times over the course of this film. And I know I wasn't alone -- because my mom was right next to me crying too.<br/><br/>The dual nature of the fantasy world and the harsh realities of World War II intermingle in a way that is most delectable to the nocturnal spectator. The little girl will capture your heart in a big emotional glass jar and when she dies at the end, your heart will die too. The best part of the film is the adorable fawn creature. As soon as I get kids (and believe me I'm trying) I'm going to take them to this magical world as soon as they're old enough to read subtitles. It's important that they learn the lessons of the film, that good will always prevail over evil -- it's just that sometimes almost everyone you know and you yourself have to die too.<br/><br/>The General is unpredictable monster. I never knew whether he was going to shoot someone or just kill them. Every person he met! My grandmother (also present at the screening) remarked that he was quite like a fascist Elvis -- shooting the television instead of changing the channel. Although I guess instead of TVs this guy is shooting people.<br/><br/>The special effects are so real that you won't even wonder how they are done. You will simply believe that they are real. The fawn is hilarious. Was he supposed to be Pan? I don't know -- there are many mysteries to be unlocked and I hope to tackle them all when I see it again for the 7th time tomorrow.<br/><br/>Go now! This is seriously the greatest film of all time. Take it from me Dan ""The Movie Man"" Wolfson."
"thaPredator","10","7","14","22 January 2007"," A Beautiful Film that must be seen!
","I am not going to write a lengthy review. Needless to say I agree with 90% of the positive reviews I have read on this site. This is a fantastic film, a pure vision of del Toro's passion for the story. Del Toro again makes a film intended solely for us, the viewers, to enjoy and admire. If more directors shared this same philosophy, there would not be nearly as many cookie cutter and plain awful movies churned out for the Hollywood bean counters year after year.<br/><br/>I mainly am writing this review in response to the negative reviews on this site I purposely read. I found that in all the negative reviews, there was one common factor, all the people who hated the movie were people who had no idea what they were going to see. it's time to educate everyone:<br/><br/>1. This movie is not a kids movie. Do not bring them. Leave them home with a babysitter. <br/><br/>2. This movie is not all a fairy tale. It is set in fascist Spain after the Spanish Civil War, not completely in a magical world of make believe. <br/><br/>3. This movie is violent. If you are offended by blood and realistic, non cartoony violence, stay home with the kids and babysitter. <br/><br/>4. Don't go see this movie just because you are trying to keep up with the Joneses. Watch the full trailer, visit the website, read this review and others. EDUCATE yourself before blindly going into this or any other movie then leaving upset because it was not what you thought it was.<br/><br/>The bottom line is, this is a beautiful film that you must see if you enjoy seeing directors put all their passion into a film. If you are tired of typical, tired, paint by numbers Hollywood films(I'm looking at you Shymalan, Soderbergh) then run out and see this movie!"
"adrian-stokes-1","10","7","14","6 December 2006"," A masterpiece..
","This film will go down as being one of my all time favourites. Guillermo del Toro has done a fantastic job of bringing together war and the innocence of a young girls mind.<br/><br/>There are very few movies where I can say that I think every actor (including the extras!) were brilliant but this is it. A shining star amongst them all must be Ivana Baquero. She takes on the hardest role of them all as she has to portray a young girl trying to cope with her own demons alongside trying to cope with living with a step father and in the middle of a battle field. Sergi López as the captain is another classic character, a lovable rogue you can respect as well as loathe.<br/><br/>All in all this film has something for everybody. The subtitles (IMHO) don't take anything away from this film as the camera work appears to take into account the reader wont be able to keep up if its bouncing all over the place. 10/10 for me, cinematic brilliance!"

","Fiendishly dark, menacingly brutal, and wonderfully elaborate. This film never really lets you relax; instead it grips you firmly, yet unsettlingly, on the edge of your seat and compels you to watch. Through the eyes of war and the eyes of a child this masterpiece weaves its lingering spell of legend, creatures and magic. Superbly acted the story quickly draws you in; from the beautiful fantasy and richness of the underworld to the graphic nightmare and gritty reality of war, every frame is utterly captivating. A haunting soundtrack, which includes the eerie lullaby from Mercedes, complements the mood and atmosphere of the film wonderfully. A true work of genius and simply the best film I have seen all year."

","If anyone approaches this movie expecting a Fantasy film, they will be disappointed. Much like anyone approaching ""The Devil's Backbone"" expecting a ghost story ""ala"" ""Sixth Sense"". Although the Fantasy is not as scarce as some may lead you to believe (the film contains over 300 beautiful cgi shots) the fantasy elements are not always overwhelming but present throughout- may be a book, a mandrake root (beauty) or a sentient insect, etc, the elements pepper the tale. Calling it a fantasy film in the time of Potter and ""Lord of The Rings"" is setting any audience member for a disappointment. To call it beautiful, cruel and poetic is to preface it, I think, more accurately. It moved me deeply."
"annoman","10","7","14","22 October 2006"," Upon seeing a motion-picture such as this, viewers can hardly help but to surrender under the overwhelming weight of elation that results from its liberating creativity.
","Bravo Guillermo! From the brilliantly perturbed visionary who shared his eerily morose tale of abhorrent warfare and infringed adolescent innocence in 'The Devil's Backbone,' comes the gorgeously sadistic fantasy, 'Pan's Labyrinth.' As quality fantasies seem to do, Del Toro's elegantly haunting 'Labyrinth' infiltrates the mind by way of its intrigue's fantastic visions; in this case, he does so with an alarming tale of Spanish tyranny, disquieting violence and superfluous gore. Not since the likes of Argento's 'Deep Red' and 'Suspiria' has carnage been so immeasurably beautiful. This poignant saga shadows the dreamy adventures of Ofelia, an imaginative young girl who creates the fanciful world of 'Pan's Labyrinth,' in which remarkable creatures of various sorts dwell. As the repressed nation of Spain witnesses its peak in post-war violence, Ofelia's adoptive father is given the responsibility of eradicating any rebellious alliances from the vicinity. While he and his wife struggle with the troublesome happenings outside their home, Ofelia escapes to her favorite place; one rich with wondrous landscapes and unknown fortune. 'Pan's Labyrinth' is a film of exceptionally rare caliber. Upon seeing a motion-picture such as this, viewers can hardly help but to surrender under the overwhelming weight of elation that results from its liberating creativity. Del Toro's 'Pan's' could very well be this year's 'Fellowship of the Ring,' snagging Oscar nods in the departments of makeup, costume design, set decoration, sound, editing, and art direction; heck, maybe it'll even win a few."
"DoctorMuffins","4","11","25","12 June 2007"," Fascism bad! No, the movie is.
","EXTREME SPOILERS: Pan's Labyrinth in a nutshell: a little girl dies because fascists are bad. Her stepfather does every evil thing imaginable; torture, misogyny, and intense shaving constitute his daily routine. Short of eating babies (that's reserved for floppy-skinned monsters that put their own eyes on plates), there's nothing he won't do to ensure that the noble revolutionaries hiding in the woods die without any dignity or unswollen eyes. He's portrayed with zero subtlety or sympathy; he can't even die when stabbed in the heart, he's so evil.<br/><br/>I kept wondering, why is this man portrayed the same way as a Disney villain? The answer: Guillermo del Toro set out, with this movie, to warn the world's masses that anyone who is anti-Communist is exactly like this man.<br/><br/>Why am I giving so much attention to the historical fiction facet of the film rather than the fantasy elements? Because the movie gives just as much time to them, maybe twenty percent of the entire 112-minute running time. The few scenes in the fairy-tale subplot are visually imaginative but irrelevant to the larger point of the movie: fascism is bad.<br/><br/>At the end of the film, the audience is led to believe that this girl's imagination has provided some sort of redemption from her brutal surroundings.<br/><br/>Wow. The profundity is overwhelming. People imagine that they end up as royalty and not middle-class corpses? I'd have never thought of that without you, Guillermo! Pan's Labyrinth is just another cog in the wheel of the artsy crowd's anti-right wing obsession. Like an exterminator wielding a 300-pound sledgehammer to smash a long-dead housefly, wannabe avant-garde directors keep using big-budget films to preach to the world that, yes indeed, fascism during World War II was bad. I, personally, would love to see a new generation of filmmakers with the cojones to speak out against the fascists of the world today, including the Communists of Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea, et al. However, if del Toro would face up to the fact that more than one side of the political spectrum rules oppressively, then he would drown in his tears realizing how pointless and obsolete Pan's Labyrinth is."

The fantasy serves both for it's ""otherworld"" aspect and the illuminating personal strength and sacrifice. The special effects are beautiful with fantastic characters rendered as believable. Certainly not a movie for children. I was blown away."

I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Arriving at the cinema, the cashier told me this movie is subtitled because in Spanish, and asked me if I was put off. I answered that I was expecting it, and this was very important to my eyes. Indeed, Guillermo del Toro did amazingly well to resist any pressure or any temptation to shoot the movie in English, but I really think there was not even a doubt as to what language to use. This adds to the magic and the beauty of the movie.<br/><br/>I am running out of superlatives to describe the movie, and my advice would be to go and see it for yourselves. It's a compelling tale of sadness, hope, innocence, passion, love, hate, power and drama. We are torn between two worlds: on one side the magical world of Ofelia, with its fairies, and on the other the cruel reality that is war. Both are extremely well mixed together and we are continuously drawn from one to the other with virtuoso handling from del Toro.<br/><br/>The actors were all superb. Having seen Sergi Lopez from its french movies I was really blown away by the performance he gives as the Captain. Ivana Baquero is just perfect as Ofelia, and Maribel Verdu gives also a great performance. The supporting roles (particularly the doctor) are also very strong.<br/><br/>I really hope Guillermo del Toro gets the recognition he greatly deserves, and wish this movie to stay on as one of the best of its kind for many decades to come.

The story in the movie was really bad, the actual cast was poor, and the one thing that makes the movie in my eyes worthy of 1/10 instead of a 0/10 was the graphics. I believe that the only good thing in this movie was the creation of Faun, even though we don't see much of him. We only know where he is from, but we don't know who he is. And who exactly is this Pan?<br/><br/>I have found some of the actors good, but even if 1 or 2 are good, they cannot save the entire movie if the rest of the cast is poor. For example we see nothing of the so called rebels, just some people walking around, no story, no lines (except one) and no fealings! In we were soldiers we don't see much of the Vietkongs but when we do we she their feelings all over their faces and a 10 second scene looks like a 20 minutes scene worth of watching every second."

It is a very entertaining film, and the cinematography is beautiful, but the story is completely lacking. The war scenes are very brutal and gory, and the fantasy scenes aren't for kids, but overall all I can say is the ONLY thing I can figure out in this movie, is that the young girl didn't want to face the harsh reality's of war, and created this Fantasy world to stick her feet into throughout the film.. I don't see any ""hidden-meanings"" within this film at all. The girl is just a kid, and kids go off in fantasy worlds when they don't want to deal with harsh realities... nothing more to it than that.<br/><br/>The ending was pretty sad, but I was really really disappointed in the very end when she's at her ""kingdom"" - I mean, come on, hasn't this been done before???

"XFLRWF","9","8","17","3 January 2007"," Guillermo's Fairy Tale
","Jaw-dropping effects and masterful storytelling barely scratch the surface to describe Guillermo Del Toro's latest masterpiece, ""Pan's Labyrinth."" With his unique and creative eye, the director's passion in this fairy tale story comes through on the screen and right into the audience's minds. These attributes are accompanied by the fantastic performances of the cast that include Ivana Baquero, Sergi Lopez, and Doug Jones to name a few. While fairy tales are traditionally meant for young children, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" unleashes the imaginations of adult audiences and if only for a brief moment, lets them believe in the fantasy.<br/><br/>During the Spanish Civil War, young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her pregnant mother (Ariadna Gil) move into a military base with her army captain step-father (Sergi Lopez). As the war progresses, Ofelia encounters fairies who lead her to the faun Pan (Doug Jones). Pan believes Ofelia to be the soul carrier of a fairy princess who had died long ago. But in order to prove herself, she must complete three challenges. Before the next full moon, Ofelia must complete the challenges or her destiny is to stay in the earthly realm.<br/><br/>Presenting the two different worlds of the fantasy and the reality is a task that writer and director Del Toro accomplishes perfectly. He not only shows the harsh and brutal effect that war can have on people but he equally parallels it with Ofelia's trials. Whatever situation Ofelia and her family endure, she faces a similar issue in her task. Del Toro's decision to have the film in Spanish and subtitled also adds to the authenticity of the era. Del Toro's use of darker backgrounds compliments mood of the film. This is not a happy time for Spain nor Ofelia as each is going through huge changes. Del Toro uses these dark settings to show the unhappiness and fear both are enduring. The darkness also adds to the mysterious nature of the fantasy realm. <br/><br/>Del Toro's script shows he is as great a writer as he is a director is come up with such a fantastic story. Creating the film's story counterparts is not an easy task as Del Toro shows his research to the time period to coincide with his own ideas and legend. His personal Grimm Fairy Tale has characters that are very well developed and intriguing. His version of Pan is a great resemblance to the mythological character and the monsters Ofelia encounters show the ever-working imagination of the director. <br/><br/>As Ofelia, Ivana Baquero does a terrific job of bringing the character to life. We feel her pain and uncertainty of having to move to a strange new place and the excitement that she may be able to change it. Baquero's best performance comes from when she tries to comfort her mother. The innocence she brings into Ofelia and the love she has for those she cares for will touch the hearts of the audience. Rivaling Baquero's innocence is the cruel and brutal performance of Sergi Lopez as her step-father Captain Vidal. Lopez doesn't make the character merciless without cause. Instead, he delves into the prideful nature of the soldier. He is malicious because he feels he has an obligation to his country and to his family's honor to hold down his territory. One of Lopez's best characteristics in playing the Captain is his eyes. With a simple movement, audiences can actually see the wheels turning in his head as he plans the next move. Doug Jones' Pan is one of the more diverse characters. Throughout the film, one can not really be certain what his intentions are for Ofelia. The ambiguity is one of Jones' best traits. One minute he would be telling Ofelia her destiny, the next he would chastise her to forget the whole quest. Jones also realizes to play Pan more aged. He is not the happily, skipping through the forest Pan but rather a more learned faun with centuries of knowledge. <br/><br/>As the saying goes, ""this is not your mother's fairy tale."" Del Toro has tailored this tale for adult audiences and to let their imaginations run with it. His double storytelling ability and creative characters make this a thoughtful and thoroughly enjoyable film. The talented cast breathes life into Del Toro's characters and will make them iconic for years to come. Again, these talents just scratch the surface of the brilliance of the film. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" will leave audiences in awe and wonder and may just reignite the child essence in others."

","Don't get muddled up. This is not a movie in which a cute American girl dances with she-man David Bowie and makes pals with huge cuddly toys. No, this is one of those eviler fairy tales with baby-eating monsters and bloody carnage. The kind of stuff that Hellboy director Guillermo Del Toro is best at.<br/><br/>Ofelia and her mother move from the city to a large mansion in a rural area of 1944 Spain. Mother has remarried, since the death of her dad, to the cruel and wicked Captain Vidal. A man who only wants her for her womb and unborn child, with no interest in Ofelia at all. Vidal and his men use the mansion as a base to fight against the Republican rebels.<br/><br/>Not the best of environments for an 11-year-old to be in, Ofelia stumbles upon the Labyrinth of Fauno (Pan, the Goat God, has nothing to do with this film, so I don't understand the English title) in the expansive mansion garden. Deep inside she finds Fauno, a sort of...well he's a mix of a lot of things. Imagine Darkness from Legend crossed with Mr. Tumnus, The Predator and Davy Jones. Fauno tells her that she is really the Princess of some Magical Kingdom. Her father, the King has been searching for her and has opened many portals to Earth. Fauno believes she is the one and tests her by ordering the completion of 3 bizarre tasks.<br/><br/>The real world around Ofelia crumbles as Captain Vidal goes psycho, brutally murdering and torturing almost anyone he can. The rebels close in and her mother becomes very sick. Preferring Fauno's ghoulish tasks to witness murder on a daily basis, Ofelia becomes increasingly involved in her enigmatic Labyrinth world.<br/><br/>In this respect it is very much like Catherine Storr's novel Marianne Dreams (and then the movie Paperhouse by Bernard Rose). Even Javier Navarrete's wonderful score sometimes reminded me of Hans Zimmer's score for Paperhouse. Definitely a CD I will have to get when it comes out! Despite the adult rating I would still take kids to see this. And by that I mean intelligent kids who are not addicted to Playstation and who don't mind subtitles. With so many crappy kids movies featuring talking animals a horror/drama shot from the point of view of an 11-year-old girl may just be the perfect cure."
"the_english_mafia","10","8","17","25 November 2006"," Powerful, emotional, terrifying. Brilliant.
","To start with, can I just say quite simply: this is the best film I have ever seen. Ever. I had read many great reviews (including one from Mark Kermode who said it was the best film of the year) and so my expectations of it were through the roof. I imagined it could only disappoint. Pan's Labirynth is so extraordinary, I can barley begin to describe it in any way that would do it justice.<br/><br/>Set in civil war Spain, Ofelia (brilliantly played by Ivana Baquero) meets a Faun who promises to take her to a mystical land, where she can live immortally, if she can complete three tasks. The fantastical aspects of the film are interwoven with the real world, where the brutal captain Vidal, recently married to Ofelia's mother, takes the fight to left-wing rebels.<br/><br/>Pan's Labirynth is brutal and realistic and certainly one of the most violent films I've seen in a while, and I found my self looking away numerous times despite the many horror movies I've seen in the before. The violence is all in context and never feels exploitative or out of place. The film has an emotional power which I have never seen so well achieved in any film before, to such an extent I found myself in tears, several times. There are scarier elements to, such as 'the Pale Man' which is uncannily terrifying. Equally in the real word Sergi Lopez is a terrifying presence, particularly in the scenes of torture which he executes.<br/><br/>I never thought a film would displace Apocalypse Now as my number one, but this has spectacularly. Honestly, if you only see one film this year, see this. It is truly life-changing."

There are the strong female leads, the oppressive and purely evil military figures, the amazing fantasy world. This film is Spirited Away gone to hell and came back passing through Neil Gaiman's Sandman.<br/><br/>It is a joy to watch, it makes you yearn for the fantasy moments to escape the brutality of the ""reality"".

","The trailer sells it as some kind of fantasy adventure... well it's not. 80-90% of the movie deals with the civil war in Spain in the 40's. So it completely misled me. Given that, I was willing to give it a chance, but really I just wanted to scream ""GET TO THE POINT!!"" in the middle of the show.<br/><br/>Of the fantasy scenes that were in it, there was some cool stuff, but there could have so much more. It ended up just being boring. The intro seemed forced or contrived. The directing was pretty good. The anti-hero was so cruel he didn't seem real at all. The costumes were the best part. The conclusion made me go ""Is that it? That was the most obvious ending... that couldn't be the real ending."" <br/><br/>On the positive side, I liked the fact that, as she was being guided, you didn't know whether to believe her guide or not. As an innocent observer you were conflicted with the main character's choices, as she was. It made it climactic, in a sense, when you found out what was the truth."
"nickmon73","2","11","26","3 June 2007"," This film is making a political point
","Pans Labrynth is nicely filmed and imaginative and was definitely one of the most original films of the year. However, the film is not without serious faults, which in my opinion is it's very obvious pro-leftist take on the Spanish civil war. Instead of being objective on matters political, the film sets out to portray the leftists and communists as romantic freedom fighters, and the other side (supporters of Franco, the Catholic Church, the military) as companions in evil. As anyone who knows about the history of Spain will till you, things were far less clear cut than that and atrocities were carried out on both sides. It is my view that a nice fairy tail is spoiled by left wing point scoring, which should be taken with a large dose of salt."
"Lauren_Simpson","4","11","26","6 November 2006"," Del Toro Loses Focus
","Guillermo Del Toro's latest foray into the grim and fantastic underworld of the human imagination is probably best described as the mutant cousin to 2001's Gothic hit ""The Devil's Backbone."" The latter was a beautiful, chilling thriller, pitting a child against the horrors of wartime in Spain. The former, ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" continues in the same vein, but Del Toro seems to have lost his focus. The result is a topsy-turvy morass of a film that becomes increasingly ridiculous and offensive as the run-time unfurls.<br/><br/>The central character, Ofelia, played by Spanish newcomer Ivana Banquero, is a child isolated by the harshness of conflict during the Spanish Civil War. Her imagination runs wild, but her Gothic fictionsobvious defense-mechanisms against realitybecome corporeal with the help of a mystical fawn, Pan, who resides in a hidden forest labyrinth. While Ofelia embarks on a secret mission, people around her drop like flies due to the sadistic practices of Captain Vidal, her malicious step-father. Vidal, a highly ranked officer in the Francisco Franco regime, will do anything to protect his legacy and his autocratic way of life. Del Toro uses him to underscore the idea that the greatest villains exist not just in dreams but also in waking life.<br/><br/>Banquero, the lone child in the cast, who was 11 when ""Pan's Labyrinth"" was shot, is very convincing as Ofelia and deftly handles a challenging role. Sergi López (""Dirty Pretty Things"") and Maribel Verdú (""Y tu Mamá También""), playing Captain Vidal and servant Mercedes, respectively, turn out visceral performances. But a flawed plot overshadows these strengths.<br/><br/>The juxtaposition of light, saccharine moments with repulsive, horrific scenes makes the dark, dramatic ""Labyrinth"" almost comical. Elements of the film that Del Toro intends to be poignant come off as flimsy and manipulative. Also, the trials Ofelia must undergo in the fantasy world are far from challenging. In fact, we are given little incentive to believe in the necessity for their completion. The prize is said to be eternal life in the dream world. Nevertheless, despite the grim landscape of war-torn Spain, Ofelia seems loathe to separate from her mother and the only life she's ever knownand why shouldn't she when her dreamscapes are at times nightmarish and intensely claustrophobic?<br/><br/>While ""Pan's Labyrinth"" can be applauded for its richly textured imagery, it falls short of reaching the narrative heights of other recent Del Toro films. Not even the input of Alfonso Cuarón, who produced the film, seems to have helped. In fact, one might question whether ""Labyrinth"" was a failed attempt at mating horror with ""Harry Potter."" Such an experiment requires a fine alchemist to get the balance right. In this case, the alchemist mixed ingredients to suit two audiences that have radically different tastes. What we're left with is a witch's brew. A fairytale ending doesn't always offer redemption.<br/><br/>Copyright (c) 2006 by Lauren Simpson"

This movie is so well done that the story would be believable although it is a science fiction/fantasy genre. I have watched it three times back to back, I am surprised this movie took only three awards. The story is written with such an intelligence and it was matched with perfect music, make-up, decor, acting, directing, producing, perfect in everything indeed. The translation, I mean the English subtitles are wrong of course as they always are with any and every movie that is subtitled in English no matter what the source language is, but that has nothing to do with the movie makers of course (you would think there are no good translators on earth or no translators at all).

","Listen, just because it's foreign doesn't make it good. There were good things about this movie however. The idea of a dark fairytale isn't unique, but it was nice to see somebody other than Tim Burton trying their hand at the genre. (Is it really a genre?(and I have nothing against Tim Burton, but I can only watch so many monochrome movies shot in Technicolor.)) Beautiful CG and and affects. Pan himself reminded me of something out of Celtic mythology, covered in roots and pagan symbols. The child-eating monster is one of the few movie creatures to actually scare me in a long time. The direction was also top notch. But directing can only go so far when the script is awful, the story is trite and the acting wooden. The bad guy was just a puppet. By the end of the movie he was almost like a character out of a bad comic book. The only thing missing was he never kicked a puppy. (Not that I would condone such a thing.)Throw in some Spanish rebels to make it ""historical"", a happy ending that will put your pancreas into shock and you're left with a movie that was mediocre at best."

Those realities include neglect, they include injustice, and of course, they include violence. The viewer has to see that, and they must feel it too.

(The LA Times reviewer who claims that the violence gives us something to fear is completely off the mark. This isn't violence cleverly used to instill fear, it's just pushing buttons. Apparently Del Toro thinks that to create a real sense of fear you crush somebody's face with a beer bottle...a scene btw that is in the first 10 minutes of the movie, and fully rendered on camera...). To add insult to injury, the story is simplistic, unsophisticated, uninteresting, and ultimately boring. Sadly, if you've seen the trailer you've pretty much seen all the images worth seeing.

"Theo Robertson","8","4","7","22 April 2014"," Never Escapes From The Fact It's Two Entirely Separate Stories
","PAN'S LABYRINTH was just about the most critically acclaimed release of 2006 . While it was better than most of the films nominated for the Best Picture Oscar - can anyone remember THE QUEEN or BABEL ? - it suffered badly from the hype and acclaim that surrounded it . Watching it not long after its release I did get a feeling of slight disappointment of "" Is that it ? "" . Sometimes it's best to let the passage of time elapse before you give your honest opinion on a movie Eight years after its release now seems like a long enough time to see if it's as good as it was made out <br/><br/>There's no doubt PL is a strangely beautiful and haunting film . There is a major problem and that is that it never really escapes from the feel that it's two separate stories connected in a rather tenuous way . Ofelia lives in Franco's falangist , fascist Spain of 1944 and is made to live with her stepfather , the brutal sadistic Captain Vidal who holds the surrounding area in an iron fist . Ofelia , a child about to enter adolescence soon stumbles upon a strange underground kingdom populated by faries and demons and soon finds this magical kingdom can be every bit as cruel and oppressive as the war ridden and chaotic world of 1944 <br/><br/>Time to be a little bit controversial and state despite the idiosyncratic visual magic that Del Toro brings to his films by the far the best aspect is the real life horrors inflicted upon the human population of a fascist country and the fantasy elements seem to be included as a sort of gimmick , almost as if Del Toro thought a period drama would have no market outside of Spain . Every time the action cut to the underground fantasy a voice inside my head - no doubt the director - kept saying "" Please give me an Oscar for costume design , make up and visual effects por favor "" . When you've got an evil piece of work like Captain Vidal murdering people who needs made up monsters ? <br/><br/>If we're talking about Oscar nominations let's talk about Sergi Lopez as Vidal , or rather let's talk about one of the biggest Oscar snubs in history that's up there with Bruno Ganz in DER UNTERGANG . Seems if someone plays a murderous right winger this seems to alienate the award voters almost as if they're seen condoning mass murder . I'm of the view that a film is only as good as its villain and they don't much better than Vidal , a man who is more than happy to return to the family table after executing a couple of suspected rebels as if nothing out of the ordinary has happened . This reflects the Latin attitude of fascism . South American countries were notorious for this in the 1970s and 80s but even as recently as the 1970s Spain had a rather poor human rights record under Franco . Indeed I once worked with a Spanish waitress called Maria who told me her grandparents were murdered by Franco's regime . I never found out if it was because they were leftists or because they were descended from people who killed Jesus but it was a very poignant reminder that fascism in Europe didn't end with the defeats of Germany and Italy in 1945 <br/><br/>As it stands PAN'S LABYRINTH is a strange but captivating movie . It's not quite a fairy tale and it's not quite a historical drama . It's contains wonderful performances and yet it's probably not the masterwork some people claim it to be . It never manages to overcome the inherent problem of being two stories trying and failing to gel together which means it's a good film but not a brilliant one"

The story is set in WWII where devastation is all around and the child, her mother and many others have tragic endings. This film is on my top 5 of hated films of all time.

","Yeah, this one's OK I suppose. Very imaginative I have to say.<br/><br/>But I think that, apart from the girl's fantasies, the storyline is a bit weak and not really believable. Set just after the Spanish civil war, it's too stereotypical. The mother of a young girl is struggling very hard with the pregnancy of a second child. But her husband, who she's gone to stay with, the captain of his army is evil and doesn't care about her, only about his baby ""boy"" he is convinced to be having. The scene where they're all gathered around a table having dinner is what caps it off for me. He just insults her to everyone and wouldn't even let her hold his hand. The acting here is poor and too over-the-top. The evil baddie status of the husband is one we've seen far too often in film and is just too extreme here.<br/><br/>There's also too many ""Ooh I din't see THAT one coming"" moments. Like the bit where the captain conveniently finds a small amount of antibiotics in the woods. He has a really kind doctor, antibiotics are found amongst where his enemies, the good guys, have just been. Mutiny? Never!<br/><br/>That said, the young girl's fantasies are moving and artistic.<br/><br/>But I think this film has had so much praise based solely on the fact that it's in a foreign language and seen by many an English speaking audience. In that way, the film's different... but does that mean it's good?<br/><br/>I think it's over-rated."

The amount of violence shown is not particularly great but what is shown is brutal. For the majority, it is the sense that the villains are capable of such hateful and inhumane acts that you fear what they will do next.

The story about the Spanish authorities tracking down guerrilla rebels is fine, although the brutal act of the Captain in charge are almost too much to be believed (his comeuppance at the hands of his maid is still a high point). The supernatural elements add nothing to this story. Ofelia's journey to regain her underworld throne has nothing to do with the activities of the Franco government, or her mother's marriage to the Captain. The ending makes both of these points more than clear.<br/><br/>Del Toro would have served his audience better to have made two separate films from the elements he created, giving himself a chance to refine the characters and situations in each story.

And fabulous write ups and sparkling recommendations from friends, too.<br/><br/>All I got was a fairy tale. With your actual fairies in it. Maybe my expectations were raised unduly by the translation - this guy isn't Pan, he's a faun. The fantasy factor here isn't dark, weird or terrifying - it's childish, like another Harry Potter. The history doesn't fascinate me. The violence doesn't give me a chilling sense of the horror of the regime - it's just horrible. The question of whether I'm dreaming - frankly I thought A Nightmare On Elm Street did it better (seriously - and I cringed less at the bloodthirsty bits in that one).<br/><br/>Now I fully expect the fantasy fans to go bonkers for this, it has marvellous animation in it, and a plot formula that seems to match other films fantasy fans love (generally I don't like them, either, sorry).

","'Pan's Labyrinth' - Easily one the most overrated movies of all time. I think people are over-analyzing this one. The story is actually so thin, that there's almost no story at all. And it didn't help that the main character was poorly acted. Hat's off for Sergi López for giving me something positive to take away from this experience. Although I must admit that it's a visually stunning movie."
"Otterman_MK2","10","5","10","10 August 2012"," Beautiful masterpiece that restores my faith in film
","Guillermo del Toro has created a masterpiece that has not only re-energised my love for film, but made me realise that films are, first and foremost, the telling of a story.<br/><br/>Despite its story of a girl discovering a secret world, Pan's Labyrinth is an adult movie, and this fact should not be taken lightly. Whilst there are fantastical elements, the film is set during the Spanish Civil War, and contains some shockingly dark scenes that genuinely frightened and unnerved me for some time, fully unveiling humanity at its darkest. This is not a film to be seen by children, so take the 15 rating seriously.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth tells two story's parallel to each other. One tells the story of the young protagonist, Ofelia, living with her violent and authoritative step-father alongside her pregnant mother, the other about Ofelia accepting a number of tasks given by a fawn to prove she is the re-born princess of a hidden fantastical world. Neither world feels more realistic than the other, the scenes set in the 'real' world focusing on the theme of human nature at its darkest, the fantastical world presenting terrifying creatures through incredibly realistic means, the film presenting some of the best makeup and special effects I have ever seen. The costumes and makeup used for the creatures, particularly the chilling 'Pale Child- Eating Man', are truly award-worthy masterpieces of art, combined with Doug Jones' beautifully physical performances as the Faun and The Pale Man.<br/><br/>When discussing the film with others, some actually criticised its simplistic story, finding it 'lacking in drive' and, in one case, 'boring'. These are very naive criticisms of the films, both being entirely ignorant of the films deliberately mythical-styled story, the film being a fable as opposed to a story. Once this is accepted, you will experience a beautifully written, perfectly presented, artistically driven masterpiece. What really is astounding is just how flawless the film is. I cannot recall ever watching a film that has caused every emotion in my body to rise, let alone present itself as a work of art.<br/><br/>There is not a bad word I can say about this film and it's undoubtedly the best movie I have ever seen and one of my personal all-time favourites. If you personally did not enjoy the film, that is fine, but there is nothing here to criticise. The film is genuinely entirely wonderful, remaining a master of artistic direction and emotional qualities. I can now say my love for film has been re-energised, and I will gladly sit through the increasingly high levels of rubbish Hollywood has resorted to, knowing that films like this are possible."

","I was excited to see this movie. I was expecting a high octane fantasy film with a lot of fairy-tale-ish stories, but it was a bit more focused on reality than the labyrinth. It was more centered on the war and it distracted from the Labyrinth's story. However I still loved it. The acting was amazing by the whole cast, and the make-up and effects were amazing. I loved the Pale Man the most. He was so freaky, That is the only horror character that I believe would scare me. However he could not best me in battle.<br/><br/>The characters were great, but the story seemed bland. They jumped around too much for my taste. Overall, I do enjoy this movie, and it is worth the money to buy, because it is fun to watch multiple times, as long as it can hit home for you."
"filmbuff20","9","5","10","24 December 2007"," Visually and intellectually stimulating.
","Guillermo Del Toro's previous work was always a cut above and incredibly distinctive, so much that he could potentially become an adjective, although Tim Burtonesque is slightly easier to say than Guillermo Del Toroesque. From Cronos to The Devils Backbone to Blade 2 and more recently Hellboy, Del Toro has invited the viewer into his world of machinery and monsters. No more so than Pan's Labyrinth (more literally The Labyrinth of the Faun) in which he creates some of the most tantalisingly sumptuous images he's put to celluloid so far. In post Civil War Spain, 1944, Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her mother Carmen go to live with her sadistic stepfather Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez). While there she meets The Faun (Doug Jones) who tells her that she may be a lost Princess and she must complete several tasks in order to prove her identity. She agrees readily partly out of childish curiosity and partly to escape the horrors of her real world life.<br/><br/>From the very first frame, this film grabs you. It's absorbing to the point of being glued to the screen despite several moments which may make you want to look away. The Pale man is one of the creepiest creature inventions of recent years and Del Toro's other monsters are so fully realised and imaginative that it's hard not to be awed. In a film like Blade 2, these creations are cool. In Pan's Labyrinth, they are strangely beautiful and arresting. The acting is superb all around, Sergi Lopez more evil and twisted than anything in Ofelia's world, bearing many similarities to Ralph Feinnes' Amon Goeth and Maribel Verdu, here playing a very different role to Luisa in Y tu mamá también is wonderfully understated until her final breaking point. Newcomer Ivana Baquero acts all the recent child actors off the screen in her quietly confident performance, slowly coming of age before our eyes. The greatest thing about the fantasy of this film is that nothing is explained, just as a fairy tale would be. The habit of needing to explain everything in Hollywood films kills the wonder of the fantasy and here, Del Toro simply presents everything as 'that's the way it is.' Why do I need to go and feed these stones to a toad in a tree? That's the way it is. In the same way, some of the extreme violence in the film is presented in a brutal, shocking way to convey more or less the same message. That's the way it is.<br/><br/>There are parallels made between the real world and the fantasy world that are constantly revealing themselves throughout the film and almost act like easter eggs on subsequent viewings. This film was well thought through and carefully constructed and it shows through with all the details from the set designs, to the colour schemes to Guillermo Navarro's beautiful cinematography. The icing on the cake is the haunting score by Javier Navarette, guaranteed to have you humming it well after the credits roll. As far as the ending, Del Toro explains it as he sees it in interviews, but the great thing about a fairy tale is that it's whatever you want it to be and that's a rich film experience. Pan's Labyrinth is a dazzling, mesmerising piece of work that will become something of a classic in the future."
"cpppfeffer-1","Null","5","10","4 December 2007"," no fantasy movie at all - and a meager plot as well
","I can;t believe this movie received that ratings it did. This movie has nothing to do with a fantasy story but all with a horrific and rather shallow story reminiscent of a horror movie. Besides the shock ""value"" there is absolutely no need to be that graphic in order to get the story across - in fact, less would have been a lot more! But maybe here lies the genius of the movie maker - to shock the dull and pampered audience out of their seats - minds - so that their attention is caught and they kind of feel alive.<br/><br/>But in all this grossness - there could have been true art - but I am afraid - no. It is flat and at best the some of the acting deserves mentioning. In my book this movie is a flop!"
"swaindominic","6","5","10","21 March 2007"," Visually superb but otherwise lacking.
","I was completely convinced that I was going to enjoy this film. I should, of course, only judge films by seeing them myself but I had read so many reviews (by reviewers who I normally agree with) that I felt this would be a real gem.<br/><br/>Sadly I just didn't enjoy large sections of the film at all. I had expected a thought-provoking fantasy film which was beautifully crafted and thoroughly insightful (such comments have been flooding out of the many positive reviews I have seen). However on careful reflection I must say I didn't find much of the film to be insightful, and for some parts it bordered on emotionless.<br/><br/>I will highlight a few of the main problems, the first being the lack of cohesion between the two story lines. At least two thirds of the film focuses on a Fascist captain exacting merciless pain on those who oppose him (or in some cases innocent bystanders) - meanwhile Ofelia delves in and out of a fantasy world to undertake three tasks. For me the fantasy world elements do not seem to fit in to this brutal war film.<br/><br/>This brings me on to another grievance which is the lack of depth in the world in which Ofelia is transported to (or imagines?). I am still unclear as to how it existed, in what way it intermingled with the real world and what its function was. Some may say this is as it was intended to encourage the viewer to question the deeper meaning and explore the possibilities. In my case I was not left pondering the finer details, rather I was baffled and frustrated by the mere tip of the iceberg we were introduced to. I was not left wondering whether it was all her imagination as she sought to escape the brutality of the real world - simply I was left wondering why?, what was the point of it all? In particular I would point to the scene with the frog, this seemed like a superficial exuberance which an over imaginative teenager penned in minutes - it felt like it didn't belong to any film let alone this one.<br/><br/>I also felt totally disconnected from every character. The captain is portrayed like a cartoonish super villain and we are left with no clear indication of his motivation. Each character seemed distant somehow, with the exception perhaps of Mercedes. For the most part I didn't become involved with their plight, I felt somehow as a dispassionate onlooker (which is unlike me when watching films of such despair).<br/><br/>Finally I would comment on the use of violence. When I feel it is necessary then I always happily accept violence depicted on screen, even if it is very graphic. However I feel most of the violence shown in this film is there to shock and produce a strong response from the viewer - not to benefit the depth of storyline. For the most part each violent scene seemed meaningless and unnecessary. I would agree that it's important to know quite how brutal the regime was, however I don't know if that was the writer's motivation when he wrote these scenes.<br/><br/>So, I have gone to town here in criticising this film and it may seem that I hated it. I certainly didn't hate it - I just didn't get much from it. There are plus points with an honourable mention for the powerful visual impact of the film. The cinematography is superb and the worlds (real and fantasy) are excellently brought to life, in a hauntingly disturbing way. Technically the filmmakers have excelled and I would also agree with other reviewers that the acting is solid and can't be faulted.<br/><br/>In summary I believe that this will be a wonderful experience for many viewers but I am not one of those who fully enjoyed it. For me it lacks depth, it is devoid of any clear message, it is baffling and often brutal without justification. It seemed like an ineffective Spanish civil war film coupled with an incomplete fantasy story. Yet, I will watch it again and reflect on it."
"abigailbfay","9","5","10","2 March 2007"," A marvelous, disturbing fairytale
","Pan's Labyrinth is a very impressive film, both artistically and historically. It is fascinating to see how the worlds of fantasy and reality collide, and with what unforeseen consequences. Ofelia is an endearing character, very innocent and yet wise. She is perceptive; though she lives half the time in a world of fairies and fauns, she notices the destruction of the world around her. Though her story is compelling, and her imagination darkly fascinating, Ofelia alone did not make this movie great. Instead, what shocked and impressed me the most was the uninhibited way in which it portrayed Franco's Spain. This film is not shy when it comes to violence. If you are in the least bit squeamish when it comes to blood, this would not be a good choice! I found the violence overpowering at times, though it was not gratuitous. On the contrary, having it so present in the film forces the viewer to put themselves truly in the time period, and makes them consider the situation more in depth. It was not a happy time for Spain; death and killing were simply everywhere. The character of the sadistic Captain takes this to extremes, but it comes from all sides, and we can see the pervasive effects of this violence in young Ofelia's thoughts. The film also forced me to assess my personal character. Whenever a film is so deeply real, as this one is, that it brings the viewer into the world in which it is set, it makes me wonder: what side would I be on? In that same situation, what would I do? Am I brave enough to do what we know is right? Difficult questions to answer. For me, Pan's Labyrinth inspired such self reflection. It will blow you away, sicken you, inspire you, and leave you haunted. In all, an excellent dark fairytale that deserved every Academy Award it won."
"mgcman-1","9","5","10","6 February 2007"," A Goyaesque vision of Spain
","At the end of the 18th century, Spanish artist Goya produced an artistic masterpiece ""el sueño de la razon produce monstrous - the dream of reason creates monsters"". Del Toros' recent film is a modern version of the same theme. As in Goya's time when Spain was rocked by the Napoleonic invasion, the setting of Pan's Labyrinth during the time of Spain's civil war serves to remind the viewer that society is very fragile and subject to radical change through brute force. In the new Spain, where might makes right, innocence is lost, and people's lives are sacrificed in order to make way for a painful vision of Spain's fascist future, a girl creates an alternative fantasy world in order to cope with the trauma that is her life. Nevertheless the monsters of her dreams provide little escape from the brutes that she must deal with every day. Trust, power, loyalty, secrets, all are vividly represented by the actors in this, one of the best films of 2006."
"ravenus","9","5","10","4 February 2007"," A superb mature fantasy tale!
","If there's anything about Pan's Labyrinth that disappoints me, it is only that when the DVD comes out it'll be advertised as being made by the same guy who made Blade II and Hellboy, two examples of half-cooked SFX wankery coated with comic-book fanboy drool. Pan's Labyrinth is everything those films aren't: It has a story that actually interests, it has visual FX that are built entirely to tell its wondrous tale and don't look like generic ""sci-fi meets kung-fu"" tech demos and it's not afraid to make you feel depressed about cruel things that happen to characters you grow to like.<br/><br/>Set in WW2 era Spain where the Fascist military is doing its best to suppress the rebellion, the film centers around Ofelia (a bravura performance by Ivana Baquero), an imaginative child who with her re-married and pregnant mother comes to stay with her step-father, the iron-handed Captain Vidal. Shying from the general air of militarism and brutality around her, Ofelia slips into a fantasy plane where she meets a faun who tells her that she must complete 3 tasks for her to reclaim her legacy as the princess of a magical realm. The plot travels between the real and fantasy worlds of Ofelia, and scenes of civic unrest and fascist oppression alternate with magical quests that involve giant frogs and creatures with (removable) eyes on their palms. Even the climax has 2 parts, one in the real world and one in the magic world.<br/><br/>Under Del Toro's guidance the story moves seamlessly between the 2 worlds and he does not discount the existence of either of them. Some may pick nits about the somewhat one-sided characterization of the military as dedicated sadists but the thing to remember is that this is a film told essentially from a child's POV and reflects the simplicity of that perspective. Of course it is not to be taken as a film for children, because it does not flinch from graphic violence when needed and even the ending has a moving tragic air to it.<br/><br/>In the end, this is a modern day classic that needs to be seen and savored by teenage/adult audiences that look for something beyond merchandise-oriented studio crap. And move over Tim Burton, there's a new prince to claim the mature fairy tale fantasy crown that you've been wearing so far. His name is Guillermo Del Toro and from the looks of it, he has kicked your ass by a long mile."
"JiaQiLi","8","5","10","2 January 2007"," Innocence: Weapon Against Sadistic Violence
","Many films portray characters' fight against war and violence. Characters use different ways to stand up against the terror and hopelessness that violence brings. For example, Guido battles the Nazi terror with his humour in ""Life is Beautiful."" Wladyslaw Szpilman fights the same regime with his determination to survive in ""The Pianist."" In ""El Laberinto del Fauno,"" Ofelia's weapon is innocence. She is so determined not to shed innocent blood for her own gain. She maintains her purity when she is put to the final test late in the film.<br/><br/>The film is appropriately dark and violent (hence not for everyone). It depicts the violence, cruelty, and hopelessness of the human world. The underworld is always dark but it is where Ofelia finds her true identity and personality. Her journey, however, is not smooth. If Ofelia passes all three tasks without obstacle, this film becomes mundane. Her failure in the second task highlight that our lives are prone to temptation and doubts. Steps of faith are not always easy to take.<br/><br/>Del Toro's ability to closely and smoothly weave the fantasy and reality world impress me. We tend to think that the two worlds are far apart and drastically different. ""El Laberinto del Fauno"", however, depicts violence both in the human and fantasy realms. In the human world, Captain Vidal and his Fascist troops try to weed out the rebels. In the fantasy world, monsters like toads and ogres wreak havoc to trees and children.<br/><br/>Ofelia maintains her integrity and innocence till the end. However, I wonder what source of hope can other people find. Ofelia has a predestined identity that other people do not. Pedro, Mercedes, and others must find ways to secure peace and hope. Unfortunately, Del Toro does not discuss how their conquests unfold. Ofelia's journey is so private and unique that others cannot share. Such is the reason for the 8/10.<br/><br/>The score draws me in. It gives me a sense of mystery that I am ready to journey with Ofelia, looking for the peace and hope that we long for. I listen to the entire soundtrack in the official site and it is amazing."

","I saw this movie Thursday night at Midnight at the AFI filmfest in LA. It was packed. I went in with no preconceptions as I had never heard of it before and my husband bought the tickets because he had heard about it. I loved this movie. It had magic, violence, history, gore, family issues, war, and loyalty. It helped that the Spanish speakers spoke clearly and slowly so if I missed a caption I could still figure out what was going on. (My Spanish is pretty simple). The imagery and imagination of the fairy world were Oscar worthy. The fairies and faun were great special effects/costumes and the violent captain was very believable and scary as an out of control military man in a nasty civil war. The insurgents and local people are all believable and real and the magical world, with its beauty and dangers just draws the viewer in."

In a nutshell this is a ""traditional"" fairy tale weaved into a hard-hitting military / family drama. The mixture is highly unusual and unlikely but it works. Boy, does it work.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly basic, even predictable, but don't allow that to put you off. This simplicity works perfectly in such a complex blend of reality and fantasy. Visually the film is stunning - a rare treat for the eyes which left me gob smacked. The Faun is quite an amazing creation, the scenery throughout is lush and detailed, the effects are compelling from the creature effects to the injuries which are portrayed.

","Spain, 1944. It is the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War. In the Pyrenees, an arrogant Nationalist officer (Capt. Vidal, a frightening Sergi Lòpez), who has established his headquarters in a remote hamlet in the forest, is ruthlessly tracking down the last remnants of the Republican forces, who are hiding in the mountains. His pregnant wife and her daughter from her previous marriage arrive at the hamlet to live with him but are kept there in near-seclusion by the insensitive officer. The girl, Ofelia, escapes the cruelty of the Civil War and of her dour stepfather through an imaginary world filled with fairies. The entrance to her fantastical world is a stone labyrinth guarded by an ambiguous faun pretending to be her servant /hence the title of the film/. Throughout the film, Capt. Vidal reveals his penchant for criminal behaviour whilst we are left wondering whether Ofelia's fantastical world is imaginary or real. El Laberinto del Fauno's major success lies in intertwining the harsh, unglamorous reality of the Spanish Civil War with Ofelia's fantasies, even more so than in Peter Jackson's Heavenly Creatures. For me, this is really El Laberinto del Fauno's major breakthrough. Where, for instance, the Harry Potter or the Narnia stories could be set in any time, any location, El Laberinto del Fauno is inextricably linked with the terror wrought by Franco's fascist regime. Also, Ofelia's fate is much more traumatic than Harry Potter's or than Tolkien's Hobbits' because the most horrid monster of the film, in the end, is not the faun or the Pale Man, but Capt. Vidal. And, alas, it has been proved many times in history that the vilest monsters have always been human beings. Highly recommended (but not for children!)."

Del Toro knows perfectly how to transport the people to his own personal world, only existing inside his ""insanily brilliant"" mind.<br/><br/>Using a historical reference as a point of start (somehting he did in Devil's backbone) he builds a story of fantasy that happens in/outside of the girl's head.<br/><br/>Having Sergi Lopez as a kind of Kroenen (from Hellboy of course) armed with a bloody gun and his bad mood, perfect as a franquist lieutenant who enjoys killing reds. The little girl makes a great performance far away from what we saw on Narnia (which has a lot of opposite things respect to this nightmarish movie), and the creature design is award worthy.<br/><br/>The story is perfect. You cant add something else, or take something else, is a perfect story for a great movie. The rhythm is kinda slow with some scenes, but without them, we wouldn't have such memorable images. To resume, if you take Hellboy, The Devil's backbone and Silent Hill, you will get this movie. But much much better."
"Ryan-474","3","11","28","18 January 2007"," Not thrilled...
","OK, let me start by saying there were a few things about the movie that I did like. I thought that some of the visual effects were very nicely done. The character of Pan was very well designed. The creature with eyes in its hands was adequately creepy. The frog was an interesting concept.<br/><br/>Here is what I really couldn't stand about the movie... Please be warned this does contain spoilers!!!! If you have not seen it and you don't want the movie ruined for you, stop reading now.<br/><br/>First of all the preview of the movie makes it look phenomenal! That is what drew me in to see the movie in the first place. Then the first killing with the man getting his face bashed in repeatedly with the butt of the gun. Yeah... that was stupid. I realize that they were trying to point out the cruelty of war, but that was just pointless. The trailer leads you to believe that that is the Spanish reply to Narnia... then you get the first make-shift horror gore. I understand that the movie was R rated for a reason.. but when you make a movie that is projected as being an adult science fiction, the gore just ruined it. If I wanted to see that I would have gone to see whatever slasher film is currently being released.<br/><br/>My other big problem is that the title really has very little to do with the movie. The word Labyrinth in its simplest form is a maze. I realize that they are trying to say that the tasks that Ofelia was sent on are complex series things that she must do, and that is where they are referencing the idea of a ""Labyrinth"". But that is not the direction that we are lead to believe the movie will be going in. When I saw the first preview of the movie I was under the impression that Ofelia was going to enter an actual labyrinth. The previews lead you to believe this by showing you things that are not the outside world. They should have shown more of Ofelia in the real world.<br/><br/>Ending spoiler beyond this point! Ofelia is crazy... yes she is out of her skull insane, hallucinating right until the very end. There is nothing to show that she truly enters this new world... they show her dead body at the end. So with her last ounce of life she hallucinates that she is still living in this new glorious world.<br/><br/>As someone that has a passion for movies, this one was bitter end. Usually I can find something of worth within most of the films that I see, even if I don't think it was incredible. With this one, I saw it once, and I will most likely not watch it again. It really wasn't all that good... and I hate saying that because I do like most of Guillermo del Toro's movies."

","I was really looking forward to this movie but was really let down by it instead. I truly cannot fathom the critical masturbation that seems to be going on surrounding this ""masterpiece"". If this is a masterpiece then the bar for high quality works of art in film has been reduced to a new low. The film is not bad, had I seen it out of context I would have thought it a watchable distraction with some slow uninteresting parts but pretty good effects. Instead I'm told this is a masterful, beautiful work of genius. It is not. It is far from it. The tone is far from magical for the fantasy pieces, and far from intriguing, dramatic or real for the civil war sequences.<br/><br/>The tone is dour overall. The child actress Ivana Baquero does a great job in scenes dealing with sadness or cruelty. But as for a range of emotions she doesn't seem to go much further than this. I don't think I can remember Ofelia laughing at any stage, or being truly angry, or truly enchanted by these fascinating creatures appearing before her. ""I saw a fairy"" she says to her Mother  ""Did you? Well you sure don't look like you did"" should have been the response. For that matter I don't think I can remember her convey much emotions apart from her the overall subdued morbidity. Perhaps Del Toro intended this but I doubt it and it tends to create very simplistic characters. The Father Vidal is a predictable card board cut out bad guy. Has this very obvious fact floated over the critics heads? The camera is pedestrian and unremarkable, and the production design could/should have been much better. I found the music was not evocative and certainly not enchanting or magical. <br/><br/>**MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD STOP NOW** Things got even more diluted and un-focused toward the end, the Faun returns because the script merely requires him to and he decides to give Ofelia another chance. And killing the kid felt very forced and manipulative. I tend to feel if this hadn't happened and the ""real"" war scenes had been removed praise for the film would have been considerably reduced. These are the scenes designed to induce a feeling of bold greatness in the audience but I found them to be cheap tricks in a slightly above average film. ""The Devils Backbone"" remains Del Toros best film. Campared to that Pan is poor indeed."
"AlsExGal","9","6","13","27 November 2009"," Truly the best film of 2006
","Pan's Labyrinth is a film about the role choice and blind obedience has in shaping the destinies of the individual as well as society. The film consists of two tales that are skillfully interwoven with the same twelve year old girl, Ofelia, at the center of each. One is a tale of life and rebellion in 1944 Spain under the Franco regime, the other tale involves a magical world in which the faun, Pan, oversees three tests that will allow Ofelia to claim her rightful place as princess in that magical world. At the beginning of the film both tales have little in common with one another other than the girl being at the center of each. However, as the film progresses, the magical world crosses over more and more into the real world. For example, the key, the dagger, and the monsters encountered in the magical world have definite analogs in the earthly realm.<br/><br/>There is much that is left open for interpretation in this film. For example, until the end you are not sure if Pan is even telling the girl the truth. Is he actually leading her to a higher destiny, or does he just need someone to perform the three tasks in order to get something for himself? Why does Pan get younger and younger as the film progresses? Since Ofelia has a love of magical stories and nobody else actually sees any of the magical occurrences, are they real or just ways for the girl to escape her increasingly sad situation and environment? Most of the characters in the ""real world"" part of the film, however, are completely unambiguous. Ofelia's stepfather, Captain Vidal, is the most shining example. From the beginning he plays a man devoted to detail, to the extinction of the rebels, and to his own legacy. He seems to have no human feelings and is as made of stone as the labyrinth that inhabits his property. This is made clear early in the film by a violent scene in which two villagers that claim to be hunting rabbits are killed by Vidal as suspected rebels. When he later finds a rabbit in the mens' belongings that seems to confirm their story, his only reaction is that of irritation at his men for not more thoroughly searching the villagers before bothering him with the matter.<br/><br/>If you enjoy tales of magic and fantasy in which everything is not sewed up into a tidy happy ending, and you appreciate how the visual aspect of film can contribute to the mood of various scenes, I strongly advise you check this movie out."

But alas, one of the best visionary talents in the business ventures into a world that is entirely of his own creation and for once, he gets it right.<br/><br/>del Toro made his mark on audiences in 1993 with the acclaimed vampire flick ""Cronos,"" a film I'll admit I have not seen but have heard much about, including the praise for the uniquely original vision of the director and its eight wins at the Ariel Awards in Mexico. He made his American feature-film debut with the horror film ""Mimic"" (1997), and then returned to Mexico with ""The Devil's Backbone"" (2001), which I have also not seen. del Toro has won over legions of comic book fans for his work on the aforementioned ""Blade II"" (2002), an adaptation of the Marvel Comics character and ""Hellboy"" (2004), which is an adaptation of the Dark Horse comic created by artist Mike Mignola. Now we're at ""Pan's Labyrinth.""<br/><br/>A film with roots in well-known fairy tales such as ""Alice in Wonderland,"" ""Through the Looking Glass,"" ""The Chronicles of Narnia,"" Roman mythology but sources chiefly from del Toro's own twisted imagination, the Spanish-language ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is set in post-Civil War Spain in 1944 during World War II. The chaotic Civil War and WWII are only a backdrop for the meat of the story, which centers around 11-year old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), who is driven with her widowed, very-pregnant mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to the Spanish countryside where her husband, Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), and his men have been ordered to eliminate the remaining pockets of the Republican Resistance.<br/><br/>One night while sleeping, Ofelia meets a strange insect-like creature (which looks like a combination of a walking stick and praying mantis) that later morphs into a kind of fairy. It later introduces her to Pan (Doug Jones, an American talent in two roles under incredible amounts of makeup), who gives her three tasks to complete to ensure that her ""essence remains intact."" What this means, is that Pan recognizes Ofelia to be a long-lost princess, and these three tasks are a means for her to re-enter the kingdom where her father, the king, awaits.<br/><br/>But these little tasks of Pan grow to be increasingly dangerous, as Ofelia is also hounded by the realities of her surroundings, including her ailing mother, the Resistance in the woods, and the sadistic Vidal's increasingly brutal methods of dealing with the Resistance. The only other person in her real world who really cares for her is Vidal's faithful servant Mercedes (Maribel Verdu).<br/><br/>""Pan's Labyrinth,"" despite the fact it's a fairy tale, is certainly not a picture for children. Heed the ""R"" rating, parents, because you'll be shocked by some of what you see here. Its graphic violence (the most gruesome of which seems to be kept off-screen, for the most part) and disturbing fantasy imagery is what you have to beware of. Beyond that, this is one of the most starkly original fantasy pieces in a long time.<br/><br/>When looking at a picture like this, especially a foreign-language picture, you'll have to cast aside any hesitant thoughts you may have, such as refusing to read subtitles. Really, I watch martial arts movies and Anime' and occasionally I have to deal with reading subtitles; it's not a big deal. It just ensures that you have to pay more attention to what's going on. With that said, I feel that the fact ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a Spanish-language feature only adds to its alien appeal, to remind us that we're watching something that is far removed from our reality. That's another plus on the part of del Toro.<br/><br/>The actors are well-chosen (del Toro himself apparently hand-picked many of his principals). The bravest is the 12-year-old Ivana Baquero as young Ofelia. Bookish and seemingly unable (or unwilling) to grasp the harsh realities of the world around her, her escape into the world of Pan's Labyrinth seems almost expected of her by the more thoughtful members of the audience, given her circumstances. The aesthetic appeal of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is what has surely gotten this film most of its greatest accolades around the world. From del Toro's own unlimited imagination, a whole new world springs to life almost effortlessly. His camera catches this fantasy universe perfectly, and his story is simply fantastic and otherworldly. As an aspiring author myself, this is what drew me in the most. Like Lewis Carroll or C.S. Lewis and their respective fantasy visions, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is all the more likely to join them as cherished classics.<br/><br/>""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a dark, uniquely original experience from a great director, Guillermo del Toro. He is truly one of the most original talents working in the film industry today. I can only hope he keeps it up.<br/><br/>10/10"
"HarshCritic69","10","6","13","19 January 2007"," A child's troubled fantasy in a harsh world.
","Pan's Labyrinth is a masterpiece. It paints a dark and disturbing picture about the horrors of war and how an innocent, imaginative child copes with her gruesome reality.<br/><br/>CAVEAT: THIS ""FANTASY"" MAY NOT BE WHAT YOU EXPECT!<br/><br/>Note to those who are expecting a romantic escapist fantasy flick - this is a VERY DARK and disturbing movie, not for the light hearted and impressionable. Definitely NOT for children. Definitely NOT a ""date"" movie, unless afterwords you plan to spend a detox session at home sipping warm milk, watching Teletubbies. And I thought that ""Se7en"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" were romantic comedies. Some scenes will make even the most hardened of the audience members cringe. Be warned.<br/><br/>Is it a Fantasy, as advertised? It certainly has faeries, fauns and other creatures that would legitimize this description. However, these are no elves of Tolkien's Middle Earth nor are they centaurs of Narnia. These guys are straight out of paintings by Hieronymus Bosch's ""Hell"" or Goya's ""Saturn, devouring his children"". Are they real? Or are they the product of little girl's fantasy whose imagination has been twisted by indiscriminate brutality of the Spanish Civil war? You be the judge.<br/><br/>While this was not exactly what I expected to see going into the movie theater, I was totally blown away: the acting, visual effects, scenery, music, camera work - all were absolutely wonderful. Pan's labyrinth is a cinematic masterpiece. Just know what you are getting into and if you are up to it, watch it!.. and then take a cold shower."
"Quinoa1984","10","6","13","5 January 2007"," One of the best fairy tales for adults I've ever seen
","Guillermo Del-Toro goes into full bloom with a real feat of cinematic strength with Pan's Labyrinth, the kind of film that builds more and more with momentum until one's left in a total engrossment in the storytelling and the fates of the characters (mainly the little girl of the story, Ivana Baquero's Ofelia). Del-Toro knows that since his movie is mainly more for adults than the kids (I wouldn't not recommend it to kids, but the younger ones would definitely get freaked out by the more gruesomely violent moments), it should really be provocative by way of showing how a child has no other choice but to go into the realm of one's fantasies. But on further introspection about the movie, what makes it even more fascinating is how, in a strange way, it's not escapism in the sense that the girl retreats to the dreamworld. If anything the dreamworld retreats to her, or rather each side of fantasy and reality have an equal pertinence here, unlike another film from this past year, the (underlooked) Terry Gilliam film Tideland, where a little girl also had to escape under no other recourse to which it transformed her own world-view to a great degree. Pan's Labyrinth blends together a unique form of magical realism that grows more potent and aborbing on a repeat viewing, and it's actually stronger by showing how the fantastical can be contrasted with what's really terrifying and cruel in the world.<br/><br/>In this case it comes in the form of fascism and a kind of rule-by-law/fear, and in the form of the little girl's step-father, Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez, formerly of With a Friend Like Harry). His is one of the great antagonist performances I've seen in recent memory, though mostly because of Del-Toro making him such a force of domination and cruelty on anyone who doesn't fit into his obedience and world-view. He and his troops are facing off against the rebels in the area circa 1940s Franco-run Spain, and has no tolerance for anyone in his midst who won't go under his form of justice (there's an immediate form of repulsion by what he does, graphically, to father and son peasants who only were in the woods after rabbits). The stakes become raised, however, when his troops capture one of the rebels alive, and after torture, there's recognition among some of the caretakers in his home, like the good doctor- who is there really to take care of the Captain's very pregnant wife and mother of Ofelia- and the head maid of the household (the great Maribel Verdu as Mercedes), and suddenly Ofelia finds herself pit against this man that she could never stand to begin with, but now sees as a true threat to what she has to accomplish.<br/><br/>And what she has to accomplish is the more fantastical portion of the picture, a very strange but completely illuminating set of scenes where we find that Ofelia really has the spirit of an underworld princess in her, and a faun (er, 'Pan'), gets her to complete tasks in order to set the spirit free. But in the face of the Captain, and her own mother's weakened spirit (which leads to a very sad state of affairs), it becomes the greatest struggle of Ofelia's life, and all in the midst of a political conflict settled in this environment with guns and overwrought bloodshed that she couldn't even begin to understand. Hence, the escapism. But part of the greatness in Pan's Labyrinth- aside from the tremendous technical accomplishments on all fronts (cinematography, production and creature design, special/visual effects, the attention to detail with both the historical and more fairy-tale aspects)- is that we really care about Ofelia's struggle, as she's really in a dire situation when she has to snap back from her time with the insects/fairies and meetings with the faun. Through the bleakness that surrounds her, one can see how the fantasy is not just a sweet desire, but a necessity in youth- however one might want it as an adult as well.<br/><br/>Filled with heart and ideas, a climax that really becomes moving and captivating without becoming too sentimental, and with some individual scenes that rank with the best in the decade (Lopez's scene where he stitches back his own face- and then takes a drink of alcohol- is priceless, ditto for when Ofelia has to get the dagger from the banquet hall), this is a real marvel of ""magical realism"", as it's been dubbed, and is surely Del-Toro's triumph so far as a filmmaker (and, like Gilliam, visionary to boot)."

","I for one didn't think it was that great. I was expecting fantasy, not people killing each other.<br/><br/>If you think you are going to see a dark faerie tale, you're not. You're going to see a person's face get beat to a pulp in graphic detail, a severe wound sewing operation in graphic detail, bullet shots to the face in graphic detail - and a lot of people getting shot at point blank range. Of course, all this violence is proported to have some sort of meaning, as in, ""see how cruel people are too each other"". But to me, the movie came across as, ""see how much we think you want to watch people being cruel too each other and then we'll come up with a nice theme about how people are so cruel so that you can feel good about our movie's sadism."" Apart from that, I can't say that is was a bad movie, just not something that I care to see. Actually, I went in thinking this was the director of Y Tu Mama & Prisoner of A., but when I found out Guillermo is really the directory of Devil's Backbone and Hellboy, I went, oh yeah - THOSE movies that didn't do anything for me."
"monk_e_fish","10","6","13","14 December 2006"," Lose yourself in the labyrinth
","Having admirably juggled Hollywood and Spanish language pictures in the past, Guillermo Del Toro returns with a film that is both incredibly imaginative and unreal yet deeply moving on a most human level. It is to Del Toro's great credit that both the film's two worlds are not only convincing in their own right but are seamlessly and intelligently blended together, a cleverly edited and very stylish early sequence has Ofelia trying to calm her kicking unborn brother with a story as the camera pans down to show the baby's foetus and then across to the beautiful flower in a field of thorns from Ofelia's story and then follows the insect-like fairy back into the room with Ofelia and her mother. The special effects and editing here are superb and this mixing of reality and story gains the appearance of happening in a single tracking shot. As would be expected from the director of Hellboy, the art direction and design in the fantasy scenes is amazing. The finest such sequence comes courtesy of the Pale Man, a figure who has dominated all the pre-publicity for the film and yet, sat totally still at a table with a great feast and his eyeballs on a plate beside him, he cuts a brilliantly disturbing and strange figure the like of which we have never seen; and that is before he gets up, inserts the eyeballs into the palm of his hands and staggers after the terrified Ofelia. The faun, meanwhile, is no friendly, bumbling Mr. Tumnus, but an imposing, sinister figure who we are never entirely sure is worthy of our trust. He is also a creature that appears truly to be a part of nature, seeming to emerge from the rocks of his labyrinth when he first appears, when he describes himself as the mountains and the earth and the woods, he really looks like it. The majority of the film, however, occurs not in the fantasy world of the labyrinth but the very real world of the house of Captain Vidal. Played with great skill by Sergi Lopez, the captain is a terrific and yet very real kind of evil, a man who wants everything to be perfectly ordered and is pained by the notion of anything not being just as he desires it. Even his brutal torture method must follow a set pattern and script each time. Vidal's love of rigorous routine is further displayed in the classic Del Toro motif of clockwork as the captain is seen constantly winding his watch, a reminder also that he lives perpetually in the shadow of his father, a military hero whose watch stopped at the exact time of his death, a symbol to show his son how a great man dies. This, of course, raises another significant point about Vidal. He is, essentially, a small man, a man who is dedicated to following orders (the wrongness of blindly following orders is a further anti-Fascist theme of the film, contrasting the doctor's remarks on Vidal's never questioning attitude to Ofelia's reactions to the faun wanting her to do whatever he says). In the small world of the film he may seem like the great evil but he is just a small part of a rotting society. As the hiding rebels say, they may get rid of Vidal but Franco can always send another in his place. The real world of Pan's Labyrinth is a dark one, not just in the grim, gruesome violence dealt out by Captain Vidal but in the sense of being trapped here and, as voiced by Ofelia's mother, the feeling that this difficulty is the way that the world is. There is little wonder, therefore, that Ofelia retreats into the fantasy world offered by the faun. Del Toro leaves his audience in doubt as to whether this world is real or a product of Ofelia's troubled imagination, giving suggestions either way in the course of the film. With her stack of story books and the way she instantly perceives the strange insect creature as a fairy, Del Toro certainly gives his heroine an imagination he can relate to. While the usage of another book, blank until she fills it with her touch, as Ofelia's link her fantasy world tasks suggests the director's love of the power of stories. Real or otherwise, Ofelia sees her tasks as an escape from the imposing world of Vidal's house. She feels isolated, alone and misunderstood with her mother ill and in bed, her new stepfather unconcerned and no other children, so she jumps at the chance to prove herself to the faun. When he leaves after her failure to follow the rules she is broken and when he gives her one last chance it gives her new life. Del Toro's real strength in this film is not the visual creativity he normally brings as a director but the human emotional impact that he creates here as a writer. Ofelia, in a brilliant, charming and winning performance from young Ivana Baquero, is a heroine who really engages the audience's sympathies. Creative, resourceful and brave, she is a likable character whose feelings of being lost and alone among this dark, grown up world anybody who has been a child can relate to in some way. The fact that Baquero's performance shows her as obviously scared and yet managing to conquer her fears and go forward to complete her tasks, especially evident in the toad scene, makes Ofelia believable and yet heroic and Pan's Labyrinth more than just a dark fairy tale for adults. It is a powerful emotional piece and the final scenes will bring a tear to your eye. A film that deserves to be seen by everyone not just the small audiences that normally frequent subtitled pictures, Pan's Labyrinth is not just Del Toro's finest film but the finest film by any director this year."

","After having seen this last night, I must say I'm still surprised and astonished (in a good sense) about this movie. I truly like it.<br/><br/>My expectations of this movie, before seeing it, was actually that I was going to see a fantasy/fairy tale movie, but found that only to be partly true, with the main plot actually being depiction of a very small fictional (i assume its fictional, but actually don't know) fraction of the war in Spain in 1944.<br/><br/>The way he (Del Toro) blends the fairy tale plot with the historical drama plot is magnificent, and they supplement each other so well.<br/><br/>After seeing this movie, I sit back with a feeling, that Del Toro wanted the two (maybe three) plot lines to be seen in different perspectives. The historical drama plot in an adults way, hence the sometimes very brutal visualization of the plot. The fairy tale plot in a child's way, hence the simplicity of the ""tasks"" our child is put through. I liked that.<br/><br/>It all sounds so blue, but all I can say is that it's been a while, since I've seen a movie, that both touches me and amazes me. <br/><br/>Thumbs up."

"bopsichord","10","7","16","30 October 2006"," Disturbing yet beautiful, a true fairytale for adults.
","It is a tribute to Del Toro that after all my anticipation, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" didn't disappoint. Let's just stand back and look at his filmography for a moment:<br/><br/>Laberinto del Fauno, El (2006)<br/><br/>... aka Pan's Labyrinth (USA)<br/><br/>Hellboy (2004)<br/><br/>Blade II (2002)<br/><br/>Espinazo del diablo, El (2001)<br/><br/>... aka The Devil's Backbone (Europe: English title) (USA)<br/><br/>Mimic (1997) <br/><br/>Cronos (1993) <br/><br/>What jumps out for me is that it is his Spanish language films that consistently approach greatness. ""Mimic"", ""Blade 2"" and even the darling of many, ""Hellboy"", are poor at worst, mediocre at best. But look at ""Cronos"", ""The Devil's Backbone"" and now ""Pan's Labyrinth"". Each one is a politically aware, magical foray into strange and tortured worlds. I still marvel that it has taken a Mexican to create two of the most authentic explorations of the Spanish Civil War. Ken Loach's ""Land and Freedom"" was powerful, but more of an exploration of the failure of European Socialism than of the Spanish experience. ""The Devil's Backbone"" in contrast used fantasy to probe at the heart of the Spanish nightmare. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" continues this experiment and in the process becomes a portrait and indeed a celebration of the Spanish nation and its culture. Brutal and lyrical by turns, it uses its ""fairytale for adults"" label like a razor, exposing the real price of Spanish Fascism.<br/><br/>At the heart of this movie we have a battle for Spain's future played against the backdrop of a rich and honorable past, one that is being sacrificed blindly. Of course, the innocents, as represented by Ofelia, are the chief victims of this madness. Motifs common to most of Del Toro's work appear again here; grotesque creatures, strange insects, violent men, put-upon orphans and an ever present Underworld of which we are largely ignorant. However, these elements are integral to the story and one comes away feeling that this is what Del Toro has been working towards all these years.<br/><br/>A criticism that might be leveled at the film might be the black and white nature of the opponents, the Fascists being irredeemably evil while the rebels are honorable and good. However, it is a fairytale for adults after all and the allegory is rich enough to sustain this polarisation. Ofelia herself offers a complexity of character that is refreshing. Another charge one might level is the extremity of some of the violence and gore. To that I might point out that fairy tales have never been lacking in violence; I think it is in the Grimm Brothers' ""The Juniper-tree"" that a stepmother dismembers her son, cooks him up and serves him to be eaten by his father. Pleasant stories, fairy tales.<br/><br/>Beautiful and disturbing, this is so far removed from Del Toro's Hollywood work as to beg the question why he works in America at all, though of course one can do nothing without money and he himself has professed to adopting the ""one for them, one for me"" rule. Thank God there is no way on earth the US could produce a remake of this.<br/><br/>""Pan's Labyrinth"" stands alongside ""Spirit of the Beehive"" (another Spanish Civil War fairytale), ""Germany Year Zero"" and indeed Del Toro's own ""The Devil's Backbone"" as a superlative childhood vision of a world gone bad. Compare the success of this movie with the similar, but less impressive, ""Tideland"", and you will see that Del Toro is a true master of the macabre and a vocal poet of the childhood world."

"samuelgustavof","10","3","5","17 November 2019"," Fantasy to make sense of reality
","In my first impression the child (Ofelia) creates this imaginary world in her mind in order to try and have a role to play in restoring the order of things (i've seen an interview where Guillermo Del toro said that the decisions the girl makes in the fantasy realm have a decisive impact in the real world). Pan, as he him self points out, is the mountain, the forest and the earth such as greek mithology depicks 'Pan' to be, he represents nature in it's essence, that wich the girl see is corrupted by war and wants desperately to fix. So Pan asign tasks for her, as if nature it's self puts in Ofelia's hands the ability to save it. That goes to show how a child process the things they can't understand in a beautiful, hopefull and most of all fantastic way."

But both story lines are kinda destroyed by the flat and uninteresting characters. My last point is that I didn't get the point or the message of the movie. It isn't a movie without any depth, but as the movie ends, there is no feeling of an appeal, the story is just... over.<br/><br/>Quite nice to look at, good acting and a decent soundtrack, but also filled with boring and flat characters and an interesting story idea, but it had no special appeal and just continues without increasing."

Fantastic and magical ideas and scenes appeared from time to time, but incredibly illogical plot turns have broken each scene experience. Overall plot looks crafted and quite unnatural. I found several scenes displaying extraordinary violence unneeded and over-the-top, they made the movie look more like a trash one.

"abeburnett","10","3","5","28 January 2007"," A film for anyone who hasn't slaughtered the child within
","Tremendously, poignantly sad, Pan's Labyrinth is a masterpiece of cinema.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is equivalent to our daily experience--in which we wake up every morning bathed in the reality that life is not all perfect, fluffy Disney movies. In fact, life often seems unbalanced in favor of the pain and anguish department. Moments of joy, happiness, love, security, satisfaction--every experience of positive emotion--are fleeting, more mirage than solid reality.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth speaks to the child wearing an adults shell. It speaks to our sense of horror at the world and life we're surrounded with. Agreeably, few of us endure the horrors, pain, fear, and despair of Ofelia's life, but by painting Ofelia's demons and nightmares as vividly as she experienced them, our daily struggles are immortalized, honored. We, vicariously through Ofelia, feel that perhaps there's a reason we endure the turmoil of life. Perhaps we too are princes and princesses, destined for greater things. Pan's Labyrinth is a movie for thinking people; a movie for those who feel like there must be more; a movie for anyone who's ever struggled onward, day to day, winning small battles but feeling they're loosing the larger war.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is not for the faint of heart, nor for those who've slaughtered the child within on the alter of harsh reality.

"gapple-3","2","11","29","1 February 2007"," Violent and horrible
","Have we become so inured to violence that film reviewers don't even bother to mention it any more? I found this film almost unwatchable in its graphic violence. The characters seemed to me to be just overdrawn stereotypes and the situations - such as the childbirth scene and its outcome - obvious and clichéd. The Captain was an appalling sadist without a redeeming feature; the housemaid was sweet and saintly. When it was over my companion turned to me and said: 'Well what was that all about?' 'A fairy tale for adults' is hardly an adequate answer. What was the point of the fantasy sequences? I could understand if they were the child's way of escaping the horrible reality around her; but the fantasies were equally frightening. What was the filmmaker trying say ? Why did he set it in the aftermath of the Spanish civil war - was it supposed to be some sort of allegory for Iraq? I was totally baffled, as well as being sickened by the violence. I detect a trend of thought among critics and the Academy that anything made by a Spanish or Mexican director must be great. That may be the case with Almodovar, but then he's a genius."
"Justin1983","3","9","23","17 December 2007"," Garbage
","While every person I know who has seen the movie professed their deep and passionate love for the film, apprehension did come over me as I gazed at the DVD cover and saw, ""From the director of BLADE II and HELLBOY"" in text placed right above the title. My apprehension was not misplaced, I was bored to tears and became increasingly restless as the movie plodded on. Surely, my time could have been invested more fruitfully elsewhere. Pan's Labyrinth was a waste of my time, and in my opinion a poorly made movie.<br/><br/>It really is odd that Pan's Labyrinth was advertised as a fairy tale (or even as a ""fairy tale for adults""). Instead, it is a movie with a girl who is obsessed with fairy tales, but not a ""fairy tale"". Part of the criteria for fairy tales is that they happen outside of time (""once upon a time""), not actual historical times. As well as that they operate outside of a 100% concrete location (they instead happen in non-existent lands where fantastic things can take place). Pan's Labyrinth happens in 1944 and in Spain. Trust me, it is in no way a fairy tale, look up the definition of fairy tale and you'll see that Pan's Labyrinth has nothing do with them whatsoever.<br/><br/>The directing in Pan's Labyrinth leaves something to be desired, while it is not atrocious, Guillermo Del Toro comes off as lazy, semi-incompetent, and complacent. The 180-degree rule is broken about a handful of times over the course of Pan's Labyrinth seemingly out of laziness. While the rule can be broken by directors, such as it was done by Stanley Kubrick, to purposely disorient the viewerdisorientation, that is never the intent of Pan's Labyrinth (which makes every attempt to effortlessly fuse fantasy and reality together, or so Guillermo Del Toro claimed). Instead when the rule is broken in Pan's Labyrinth, one can only assume it is a mistake made by Guillermo Del Toro. Guillermo Del Toro is unable to breathe life into the characters that populate Pan's Labyrinth; instead though his complacent directing, all of the characters are two-dimensional, unrelatable, and fail to inspire any concern from the viewer.<br/><br/>The editing is annoying in Pan's Labyrinth (at first, only subtly, but as the film progresses, the repeated annoyances become antagonizing). The film is peppered liberally with unnecessary and misplaced dissolves that disrupt the flow of the editing, working against the movie (whenever a dolly-shot is used in Pan's Labyrinth-you can bet that there will be an unnecessary dissolve somewhere in the length of the dolly-shot... uh, why?). Match cuts made within Pan's Labyrinth feel gimmicky and self-satisfied. One of the best examples is during a montage that repeatedly cuts back between Ofelia lost inside her fantasies and her step-father leading a brigade of horsed soldiers as they ascend a forested hill, match cuts are made as the trunks of trees envelop the frame and become walls that surround Ofelia, and as the camera continues to pan right, the match cut is made again and again (beating the viewer over the head).<br/><br/>The script is dull for the film and the characters within it as well. But not only are the characters in Pan's Labyrinth flat, dull, and unlikable-the protagonist's intelligence is irksomely inconsistent. Ofelia constantly demonstrates her lack of intelligence (or possession of even an inkling of common sense) over the course of the film, yet conveniently is able to figure out that the character of Mercedes is working with the Spanish resistance (also, Ofelia's sudden knowledge of the existence of resistance fighters in the woods that she only recently arrived in is left unexplained... Seriously, the girl is as dumb as a rock, how did she figure those two things out?).<br/><br/>***START OF POSSIBLE SPOILER*** <br/><br/>Something that comes to mind when recollecting on the poor script, is the lack of any motivation for Ofelia eating the forbidden grapes of the Pale Man (instead, she gulps down two grapes knowing full well the warnings of death made by the Faun). Previously in the movie, Ofelia was sent to bed without dinner, but that was several nights previous in the course of the time line within the movie. If only the events were arranged to happen in the same night, Ofelia's greedy impulsiveness would actually make sense-instead of being motivationally random and merely convenient for there to be a brief scene of tension with the Pale Man chasing Ofelia.<br/><br/>***END OF POSSIBLE SPOILER***<br/><br/>Bottom line: Pan's Labyrinth sucks. If you thought it was a good movie, you desperately need to watch some films of higher quality."

","This is pure sadism and exploitation disguised cynically as a fairy tale about a child. There is nothing wondrous, childish, or innocent about this film. It is a dark, gloomy orgy of sadistic scenes, that are being sold to us as just another fairy tale. You see, the filmmakers behind this horrid piece of cinema think we are stupid enough not to see the film for what it really is. Thus, there are pixies and fauns, and things you normally see in a fairy tale, but behind it all, there is only torture. Yes, pure torture. The girl is being tormented, the people around her are tormented, nasty people do nasty things. But what is the moral of the story? That when a girl escapes into a fantasy world in order to escape the torture in the real world, she is tortured just as much. Now, who wouldn't want to watch that? I really feel sorry for all those who took perverse pleasure in watching this. It is an assault on the audience. And the fact it is so manipulative and dishonest about what it really is, only makes it even worse."
"hustler58","1","14","41","11 October 2007"," One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Not even close to what I expected.
","Be forewarned: This movie is nothing like what you'll see in the trailers. The trailers lie to build up an awful movie. Truly a caveat emptor.<br/><br/>Dark, boring and distasteful. Foreign language spoken. A movie that has to be read. If the trailers had shown more of the main footage and not so much of the fantasy stuff, I definitely would have passed on this. But, the trailers made it look intriguing - didn't say anything about foreign language spoken or subtitles. If I could give this movie a zero rating I would. Don't let the high ratings fool you.<br/><br/>Thankfully, I bought this as a Previously Viewed DVD (and I still can't believe I paid money for this). If the store won't take it back as an exchange, I will give it to my public library. On second thought, if I can't exchange it, I will destroy this copy because I wouldn't want to inflict this on another human being. (Update: the store took it back.)<br/><br/>Most of the characters left me feeling nothing for any of them. Except, I hated the Captain. Perhaps he was the best actor in the whole movie because he made me hate his character. This is not a way I want to leave a movie. Only feeling hate for the villain.<br/><br/>There are many movies that will make me laugh and/or cry. I fell asleep during this one. When I woke up, I finished reading the rest of the movie, hoping for something good to come out of the experience. Nothing ever did.<br/><br/>Even the U.S. title is misleading. How do you get ""Pan's Labrynth"" from ""El Laberinto del fauno."" It should have been called ""The Labrynth Of The Faun."" ""Pan's Labrynth"" of course brings Peter Pan to mind. This was obviously a deliberate attempt to co-opt the famous Peter Pan name to give the movie some semblance of credibility.<br/><br/>Okay, I forgot that Pan/Faun was a mythological creature and thereby showed my ignorance in that area. However, the purpose of making a movie is to sell it and make money. When the name was translated, it should have been literal instead of interpreted. That would have removed any possible confusion that the interpreted title generates. Or perhaps that was the point all along - to generate confusion, to trick more people into watching this awful creation.<br/><br/>One thing I did learn is I to check IMDb's reviews from now on before I watch a questionable movie like this. And pay as close attention to the bad reviews as the good. As many people already know, you can't trust titles or trailers.<br/><br/>If I save even one person from the torture of having to read such an awful movie, writing this review was worth every minute of it."

","Every so often I have that uncomfortable, squirmy feeling I'm sure all moviegoers do, when you're sitting in the theatre watching a movie that critics and audiences alike have hailed as a masterpiece, and you're not enjoying it all. That was me during ""Pan's Labyrinth."" My only reaction after coming out of this grueling, depressing Christ fable was: ""Did I see the same movie everyone else did?"" <br/><br/>Critics are likely responding to director Guillermo del Toro's fierce originality of vision, and indeed that is this film's most impressive asset. But the originality is wasted on a lame story capped by a lamer message, that essentially goes something like this: Don't worry if the life you're currently living brings you nothing but pain and misery -- all of that pain and misery will make you eligible for eternal happiness in Heaven. If you get cozy fuzzy feelings from canned religious homilies like this, then please, go watch this film and enjoy. But for one who doesn't believe in Heaven, and who would rather see films that offer practical messages of hope and salvation for our current troubled world, I felt gypped that in the end this movie had nothing better than that to say.<br/><br/>I don't need movies to tell me that the world can be a cruel and uncaring place to live. And a movie certainly need not go back to 1944 Spain to offer up examples of that cruelty. But if it's going to address a problem, it should at least be part of the solution, and give me something I can use. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is bold in suggesting that a child's fantasy world may be no match for the harsh realities in which she is living -- in an industry that exists to sell us fantasy through which we can escape the real world, del Toro takes quite a gamble to give us this product that tells us just the opposite. But all of that boldness does nothing more than lead one to a Sunday school lesson that may just be the biggest fantasy of them all.<br/><br/>There's very little fantasy in this film, actually, much less than the trailers would have you believe. A majority of the film is devoted to the sadistic actions of a military captain serving Franco's regime, and we get to see him smash a peasant's face with a wine bottle until it caves in, shoot numerous people in the head and other parts of the body, torture one man with all manner of carpenter's tools. At one point, we get to see him stitch up a knife slice in his face in graphic close up detail. Those of us with less of a lust for blood may wonder if the more graphic scenes are truly necessary. Defenders of them will say yes, and that the horrors of this film's reality must be made clear if the juxtaposition of the main character's retreats into fantasy are to be effective. But I say that there is a difference between using violence graphically and using it effectively, and that the most graphic moments in this film do nothing but cheapen the overall effect.<br/><br/>And by the way, what is it with religious people and movies? Why does every religiously-themed film that anyone wants to see have to be dripping in sadism? What exactly do they teach you in those churches anyway? <br/><br/>This is a really grim film folks, completely lacking in any kind of wit. Guillermo del Toro obviously has imagination to spare, but it's not the kind of imagination I want to be spending any more time with any time soon.<br/><br/>Grade: C"

It is a bewitching tale that will keep you enthralled throughout.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is not a fantasy adventure filled with bright colours and cute and cuddly mythical creatures (it is more Jim Henson than Disney). The world of Pan's Labyrinth is dark and cruel, and at times the violence is relentless and startling. Despite this, it is a film filled with beauty, the kind of beauty that can only be seen in Gothic art or on a stormy winter's night.<br/><br/>Whether you believe that Ofelia has created a world from her imagination or whether the visions she experiences are reality, you will be fascinated by her world and all that she encounters."

The fantastic combination of all the colours and surrealistic paintings have mixed up at once in my mind. It is not a surprise that this amazing work won an Oscar for Cinematography. Guillermo Navarro and Del Torro had a beautiful dream coming true. The story is transferred on the screen incredibly, the creatures appearing in the vault are just like real(the faun, fairies, the terrifying eye-in-palm creature). I am not up to fantasy pictures, but this one moved my mind right from the start.<br/><br/>The main idea for me is: <br/><br/>What YOU believe, no one else does, because the OTHERS do not believe in a thing. Not to believe in anything is the cause of all the chaos and unrest in the world. Believing is something that makes our life a whole, whether it is true or not, whether we believe in something usual or even in a better world. Everything in the world is magic as long as we DO BELIEVE it is."

","El Laberinto del Fauno (The Labyrinth of the Faun) or Pan's Laybrinth as it's also known as is a great movie, it's a wonderful work of art created by Guillermo del Toro who also directed great films like Mimic, Blade II, Hellboy. The fantasy parts are amazing, the way the fantasy world and real world elements contrast makes this film unique. We see a nice, imaginative fable like world then we see a dark, violent real world. The way they contrast is pulled off impressively, Doug Jones who played Abe in Hellboy gets in creature make up again this time playing the Faun and the Pale Man. El Laberinto del Fauno, Pan's Labyrinth is also unique because it's an adult fantasy film, it's got violence, swearing and gore. I think that's what makes it so appealing because it's something different.<br/><br/>El Laberinto del Fauno, Pan's Labyrinth is a masterpiece by Guillermo del Toro that should be seen.

","Simply put: Pan's Labyrinth is one of the most beautiful, best written, best directed, and best acted films of all time. The screenplay drips with symbolism in this critique on fascism and unquestioned authority. Though I went into the film expecting fantasy, I came out more satisfied than I could have ever imagined when I first walked in the theater.<br/><br/>From the first scene to the ending credits, this movie brings you right in to the countryside of Franco's Spain and it never lets you go. Ofelia's acting is superb, along with the supporting cast. Also, the final scene is one of the most beautiful and touching scenes that I have ever witnessed. If you are not stirred emotionally, in some way, by the final scene, you should just stop going to movies, because nothing is going to be able to move you.<br/><br/>A most well deserved 10/10.

"Schopenhauer101","7","4","8","3 July 2007"," Very beautiful but the violence didn't help the movie in any way.
","This movie was an interesting experience. The camera-work is gorgeous, the effects very nice, good acting too. I mean it. But the movie has some REALLY serious flaws too, no question about it. A movie about fantasy in a way misses its point when it makes you think of computer animations and latex puppets. The story has to be grounded in primarily in the viewers *emotions* not in the senses that reaches ear and eye. In the first Star Wars movies the effects was great at the time but it was the saga, the tale that made one keep thinking about it for weeks after leaving the cinema. That wont happen with this film even if it is quite good. Visuals cant alone create that, and it shouldn't, a audience that confuse surface with deep, lay ground to an empty shallow and scary cultural scenario.<br/><br/>Also and more importantly...the intensity of the depicted violence can never replace the overall intensity of the movie experience. I think everybody somewhere know that that is a very very cheap trick. Still the monkey in man begin to clap hands when seeing the violence in sin city or 300, just for the sake of violence. The problem with the visual torture in this movie was that it felt so unnecessary. Sometimes violence can improve a movie, like in Shindlers list, (but if that movie had been a gore-movie like ""Passion of the Christ"", it would have teased our disgust more than our hearts. The jackass guys can disgust us, but they cant touch our deeper feelings because that takes intelligence and very hard artistic work.) Maybe the whole point with the gore in this film was to make people like me complain about it. Of course it will work, the day it wont, the world will be even worse than now. I know people that has been tortured in war, and don't find the idea of people watch the fiction of that as nice entertainment while eating popcorn very inspiring, or even as a good cultural sign. It should be easy to make the tale more adult without just adding violence, i mean, why not more complexity or depth instead? The movie was a good one anyway, but it could have been a true masterpiece if it had touched us even deeper with its storyline. See it yourself and get your own opinion.<br/><br/>I rate it 6.5 of 10."

Her father has died before the movie begins and she is forced to move with her pregnant mother to a battlefront to live with her stepfather, a Captain who is desperately trying to live up to his father's military prowess and stem off the attack of Spanish rebels.<br/><br/>Del Toro takes some poetic license with his portrayal of the faun, who is more tree than goat, but the portrayal is nothing short of perfect. Though, not as prevalent in the film as in other fantasy films, the creatures are some of the most memorable in the genre.<br/><br/>The creature encountered during the second task is particularly creepy, as he awakes to pursue Ofelia in search of a living meal.<br/><br/>The conclusion of this film is satisfying, if vague, and is one I would see again and again; of course it will be one that the kids will need to be put to bed before watching."

It is raw and original. I didn't find Pan's Labyrinth to be overly violent. I found it real, but I guess if you have a weak stomach, maybe you should skip this one.

"cultfilmfan","8","4","8","10 February 2007"," Pan's Labyrinth
","Pan's Labyrinth is a Mexican film in Spanish with English subtitles. The film is set in the 1940's in Spain and is about a young girl named Ofelia who comes with her mother to live with her evil stepfather who is an army general during the end of World War 2. To escape the sadness and evil around her, Ofelia discovers a labyrinth in the back of the house and meets a creature who resembles a faun who tells her that she is a princess and must complete several tasks to come back to her kingdom. Ofelia does these tasks and is taken away into strange new worlds and are introduced to several unique creatures. In the real world Ofelia's mother is pregnant and with her evil and overbearing stepfather things are getting a lot worse and seeing as the film is set in the mid 40's during a fascist Spain there is a lot of violence and evil going on around her and sometimes in order to escape that Ofelia will have to go back inside the imaginary world to complete her tasks in order to be somewhere safer even though danger lurks in the fantasy worlds as well. Winner of over 22 awards so far, Pan's Labyrinth has good direction, a good script, good performances by the entire cast, good original music, good cinematography, good film editing, good production design and good makeup. Before I state what I liked about the film I would like to get the fact that although this is a fantasy film and looks like it would be great for children that it is probably not suitable for them receiving an R rating in the states for graphic violence and language, so parents please be advised. Getting that out of the way I must say that I really enjoyed this film. When Ofelia is in the fantasy worlds they are full of beauty and are gorgeous looking and at the same time they are often wonderfully grotesque and weird, so the look and effects of this film are fantastic. The imagination behind writer/director Guillermo del Toro is amazing and he has created a wonderful blend of fantasy and real life horror that balances out well and plays perfectly. When in the real world everything is dark, dreary and depressing looking, but while in the fantasy land everything is usually bright and more cheerful. This film plays out like a perfect fairy tale with dark elements, a hero, a villain and lots of weird stuff in between to keep us amazed and to capture our interest. The film is very dark, but anyone who has read fairy tales will be able to tell you that most of them are and it suit's the film and it's style very well. This is a gorgeous looking, creative, interesting and very well done film that is one of the best films of the year and I'm glad there is finally a fantasy film out there for adults to enjoy. I really enjoy fantasy films, but the majority of the recent stuff out there like Lord Of The Rings or Harry Potter isn't really my style, so I'm happy to say that this film certainly filled the bill and I was very impressed by the end of it. For those who are into fantasy and don't mind that the film is dark then you are in for a great story and a wonderful world of surprise that the filmmaker captures for you. I hope this film continues to do well and I hope the fact that it is subtitled does not hold people back from seeing it because it really is an amazing film and meant to be seen."

","If there's anything to complain about, it might be that the art direction is a little too dark, although this movie IS about the trials of a princess of the underworld. Otherwise, I can't help thinking that the little girl in ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and the ubiquitous Dakota Fanning must both want to hide under a rock after watching Ivana Baquero as Ofelia. Between her and Sergi Lopez as the Capitan, this movie is a sheer performance delight.<br/><br/>It's almost incomprehensible how much more than that the director managed to effortlessly pack into two hours. We learn all we need to know about Fascism and the Spanish Civil War with such story telling power that it's a little disconcerting. Add fully developed themes about the rigors of child birth and the demands of motherhood, how true nobility is related to moral and physical courage, and infuse it all with a wonderful sense of justice and you've got an unforgettable film of monumental beauty.<br/><br/>I don't doubt some people will be put off by this film's moral sensibilities, but I also don't doubt there's no group more in need of this film than those people. And I sincerely hope teenagers get to see it. It might have the most impact on them. I don't agree at all with those who think it's too graphic in places.<br/><br/>Bravo Guillermo del Toro!

","7-7.5 out of 10<br/><br/>I'll begin with the films most appealing portions, namely that it was beautifully shot, a technical master piece, casting was very strong and I thought the violence was well placed, although it could've been more sever. However the plot was a tremendous let down as I failed to find much meaning in it, after the film I was able to rationalize a few themes in the movie, yet they didn't seem to fit the actual film as well as they did the plot. The themes I felt that fit the plot were a critique of martyrdom, a fatal sense of self-created existence, and an analysis of trust. First the most prominent theme, at least in my eyes, that being the critique on martyrdom; I almost thought that theme was well portrayed as we find our heroine dying to save her little brother, and only being to accept this due to an imagined world. Thus illustrating that the only situation in which martyrdom is not only acceptable but even reasonable is when one has created one's self an imaginary world into which to retreat. <br/><br/>Next we examine another aspect of her world, not so much it's qualities as a safe haven, but rather the dangers the world brings to reality. Ofelia's world often lets her escape the brutality of her world, yet it does nothing short of sabotaging her attempts to live, putting her at odds with both her mother and captain Vidal, first incurring her mother's disappointment at having not only been late but also having ruined her beautiful new dress, and later drawing the captain's wrath at having stolen his son. This world puts her life in danger numerous times and could be expanded to be understood as an attack on self delusion, furthermore this film shows how crippling self delusion can be to those around one as we see Mercedes completely destroyed over Ofelia's self inflicted death. <br/><br/>Finally the commentary on trust, here two Ofelia's death is the ultimate statement and we see her mistrust of an imaginary being resulting in her unfortunate demise which seems to be directly attached with the idea that trust of beings that seem more qualified can often be faulty lest those being prove themselves trust worthy. <br/><br/>Now I won't deny that the main villain, captain Vidal, is a total bamf, and he is a great villain however this creates a false image of the Franco regime as he is the clear bad guy and the rebels are clearly good, when in reality both sides were terrible. Franco's regime was a repulsive time in history, yet Franco was able to miraculously keep Spain out of WWII a truly overwhelming accomplishment, and his adversaries were equally as radical but to the other extreme, these communists were of the same brand that Orwell fought and that took control of Russia, a set of tyrannical beasts who valued no life and based their actions only the false notion that men were equal. Now the idea of equality is nice for kids but falls terribly short of reality, but that is for another argument, in Spain the reds were terribly authoritarian and were as, if not more, sadistic than Franco's fascists. In summary, gorgeous film that was very well shot and produced, yet the theme lacked any exceptional characteristics, i.e. cool to own but not really worth rating exceptionally highly."
"bingham_bryant","8","4","8","1 February 2007"," A stunning reminder of the harshness of childhood...
","There is no one more creative than a child in the dark. As children, almost all of us were overcome by the most macabre leaps of the imagination once our parents had left us alone in our beds, vulnerable and scared. Suddenly every sound was a death threat, every shifting beam from the street transformed into the glare of a burglar's flashlight. Logic was swiftly made malleable; the most bizarre events could be thrown together by youthful paranoia to explain the circumstances by which a mummy could be lurking in the closet, a decaying skeleton under the bed. It was all terrifying, and for a child whose mind was still unadulterated by reason, it was all very real. Guillermo del Toro's new film ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is one of the best movies to come along in a while for many reasons, but it is most unique in the way it has perfectly captured the terrors of childhood, both real and imaginary. ""Pan"", like del Toro's previous gem ""The Devil's Backbone"", takes place against the backdrop of 1930's Spain during the country's civil war between Fascists and Soviets that had torn it apart, The main storyline revolves around Ofelia, played by a luminescent Ivana Baquero, a young girl who has retreated into novels and fairy tales to escape the harsh realities of her life. Her mother, a widow, is heavily pregnant with the child of Capitán Vidal, the deliciously malignant Sergi López, a fascist officer stationed at a dilapidated mill deep in the Soviet occupied Spanish forests. At Vidal's insistence Ofelia and her mother move there, a difficult journey and a heavy blow to the health of the weakened pregnant woman. Ofelia soon finds that she is anything but alone at the mill. Woken in the night by a noisy but amiable praying mantis, she follows the bug to a nearby labyrinth. At the maze's center she meets a faun, who soon sets her off on a series of tasks in order to escape the nightmares of her life. The quest she begins soon after is populated by creatures so freakish, so bizarre and yet simultaneously so familiar that only the mind of a child could have created them. The faun is a duplicitous, creaking old goat whose every movement is echoed by the sound of a branch breaking in the dark or the creak of a door in the night. A monstrous toad living in the bottom of an old oak encapsulates everything that is so paradoxically intriguing and repulsive about amphibians to little boys. The Pale Man, a cannibalistic monstrosity of skin and sinew, is lifted straight from Goya's painting of Saturn devouring his children, another work of art created in a mind tortured by the cruelty of the Spanish Civil War. Del Toro's monsters embody everything that is terrifying to children, brought to life so well that they are almost intolerable even in maturity. This is not a film for the squeamish, filled as it is with images of both horrific fantasy and blood which is all too real. Most of this blood is spilt by Capitán Vidal, whose tyranny is the focus of the film's other plot line. His dogged pursuit of the Communist forces is hampered by a rebellious but motherly housekeeper, played in a remarkable transformation by Maribel Verdú, the sexy older woman from ""Y tu mamá también"". Grimly set on the eradication and cleansing of Spain, his character gives the film important historical context, foreshadowing the beginning of Europe's own waking nightmare. Del Toro is thankfully not blunt enough to make the two plot lines parallel, instead allowing the audience to draw connections without hitting them over the head with them. About to lose her mother in childbirth, surrounded by death and the burgeoning forces of fascism, Ofelia's innocence brings into stark relief the fallen world of adults which lies around her. Del Toro has created a film which rings true because of the purity of it's' core, just a sad little girl whose dreams are being corrupted by the cruelty of her world. To bring the brutality of that world to us del Toro has resurrected our childhood nightmares, and they are more harrowing than we can ever remember."
"stevejamesma","1","4","8","25 January 2007"," Far too dark and the story doesn't hold together
","First this movie was incredibly dark, violent and unpleasant. Furthermore, the story line didn't hold together enough. There were a number of parts in which the main characters did not act in ways that were consistent with the types of characters they were supposed to be. It really made for a unpleasant, unenjoyable experience. SPOILER WARNING: Even the small bit of redemption and hope in the end is dampened by the terrible sorrow that Mercedes feels. How depressing.<br/><br/>*SPOLIER WARNING* Further, the scene where Ophelia ate the grapes was completely unrealistic -- her character was far too strong a character to violate the ""rules"" in that way -- and her explanation afterward... ""I didn't think two little grapes would matter"" was pathetic story telling. If they made it so she was under some sort of trance, it would have been held together much better. Instead, the script was fundamentally flawed.<br/><br/>*SPOILER WARNING* And finally, why didn't Mercedes kill the captain when she had the chance? The visual effects of the captain's severed face was quite well done, but there is no reason that Mercedes would have left him alive except so the movie makers could film a ""dramatic ending"" in which the captain comes back and tries to kill Ophelia. They could have had the captain fight back an escape from Mercedes' knife point but instead, she just gives him a stern warning and then runs off. How pathetic! <br/><br/>The movie had some interesting visuals and effects but was more disturbing than it needed to be and the story was simply not up to par. I was extremely disappointed."
"howard.schumann","8","4","8","21 January 2007"," A personal film about memory
","Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth has been called a fairy tale, but it is one without the color, warmth, or wonder we normally associate with films of this type. Rather, it owes more to the Latin genre of magic realism, as it reflects the grim fantasies of a young child caught in the middle of a brutal conflict and her desperate longing for a world without pain. Set in Spain after Franco had emerged victorious in the Spanish Civil War, Nationalist troops and die hard resistance fighters continue the struggle in the Spanish countryside. As the film opens, Carmen (Ariadna Gil) and her daughter Ofelia, brilliantly performed by Ivana Baquero, are traveling to join Carmen's new husband, Falangist Captain Vidal (Sergei Lopez) in his military headquarters.<br/><br/>Ofelia, a bright, imaginative girl of ten, carries with her books of fairy tales. Her father, a tailor, died a few years ago in the war, and her mother is pregnant with the baby the Captain believes will be his son. When they stop to rest, the little girl meets a buzzing dragonfly and believes it to be a fairy welcoming her to a magic realm. In a voice-over, we hear the story of an underground country where ""there are no lies and no pain"", a metaphor perhaps for the thousands of Franco resisters who were forced to go underground. In this country, a young princess named Moanna is mourned after she leaves the realm to explore life on Earth and is blinded by the sun and dies. Her father, the King of the Underworld, however, has never given up hope that the princess will one day return in another incarnation.<br/><br/>When Ofelia reaches the mill which has been converted into a military headquarters, she discovers an ancient stone labyrinth near her new home and meets seven-foot tall Pan, a half-man half-goat ""faun"", (Doug Jones) who tells her that she is the princess who everyone in his kingdom has longed for. To return to her true home and be reunited with her father, however, she must complete three arduous tasks, revealed to her by touching the blank pages of large notebook. These include encountering a huge toad in the roots of an old fig tree and retrieving a key from his stomach, and searching for a dagger in a room guarded by another gruesome creature, the Pale Man, whose eyeballs are in the palm of his hands. The room is filled with delectable treats but Ofelia is sworn not to eat them.<br/><br/>The film shifts seamlessly between fantasy sequences and the armed conflict. Vidal is depicted as a soldier who takes pleasure in killing. In one scene, he sadistically beats a peasant to death with a bottle, suspecting him of being a rebel. His cruelty is not limited to rebels, however. When Carmen becomes sick during her difficult pregnancy, the girl hears her stepfather tell the doctor that if it comes to a choice between saving the mother or saving the baby, he wants him to save the baby. Amidst all the darkness, Ofelia develops a warm relationship with the housekeeper, Mercedes (Maribel Verdu), whom she later discovers sneaks out at night to bring messages, food, and medical supplies to the rebels. The Captain is merciless when he discovers Mercedes' ""treason"" as well as that of Dr. Ferreiro (Alex Angulo) who refuses to obey Vidal's orders.<br/><br/>As the world around her grows darker and her mother becomes sicker, Ofelia further retreats into her dream world. Soon she must make the most difficult choice any person can be asked to make. Pan's Labyrinth is a strong and heartfelt film but it is a mostly gloomy affair and I yearned for some light and warmth to pervade the darkness, but the film does not go there except for a few brief moments. Del Toro's work, however, is not about metaphysics or spirituality. It is a personal film about memory and, as both Ofelia and Vidal remember their fathers, del Toro wants the world to remember the sadistic nature of the Franco regime, the courage of those who stood up to its brutality, and the innocence his country lost forever."
"IRateFilms","10","4","8","15 January 2007"," Pan's Labyrinth Review
","Pan's Labyrinth is a fairy tale story for adults that centers on a young girls escape from reality, that reality being fascism in civil war-torn Spain circa 1944. Guillermo Del Toro's newest picture brings us adults back to the place fantasies like The Never Ending Story did when we were children. The sheer darkness and violence of the fantasy segments perfectly complement the blood and torture portrayed during the war scenes. Ofelia, not being able to grasp what is going on around her, escapes into a world of faun's and fairies which at times are scarier than the real villain of the film, Captain Vidal played with by venerated Spanish actor Sergi Lopez. The real praise, when it comes to performance, must be handed to Maribel Verdu who's fear and inspiration for freedom are truly envisioned through her eyes. Del Toro does use many transitions in the film that lend to a one-shot impression, by using trees and walls to cut from one angle to another, something Hitchcock used to make Rope look like one unbroken shot. These transitions lend greatly to the stories two parallel universes, making them equally real to me as the two came closer and closer to intersecting. Ofelia's world of imagination is filled with over-sized frogs, bugs and various creatures made from the earth, that crawl in and out of the film seamlessly, complementing the editing.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth, written and directed by Del Toro, is a very personal film, and helps cement Del Toro as one of the better filmmakers within the science-fiction fantasy genre. Like the title suggests, Pan's Labyrinth creates a very intricate, elaborate maze, using its two stories to switch paths as you get lost within Del Toro's alluringly perceptive direction. Del Toro's use of CGI is very minimal, but mixed with the make-up effects conjures a very memorable, time-standing world of fantasy. This is, without a doubt one of the most beautiful films of the year, and along with its aesthetic sensibility, Pan's Labyrinth has painted a perfect anti-fascist story."
"imdb-10420","8","4","8","12 December 2006"," Confrontingly fantastic
","I'm not quite sure what to make of this.<br/><br/>Is it a happy ending, or a sad ending? Is one more real than the other, and if we accept that it is simply because it seems obvious, is it necessarily more important than the other? In a sense, it's the happy ending that Ofelia strives for that brings about the unhappy version of events, and in the end the two coincide.<br/><br/>I guess I'm still somewhat confused and trying to make sense of the senseless, and in some ways maybe that just means that I got the whole point of the movie. It's politically charged yet poetic, senselessly violent as it is fantastic and as inspiring at is depressing.<br/><br/>I'd expect that many people would walk out of a cinema with similarly mixed feelings - I didn't know whether to smile or to cry. Much of the audience I sat with dealt with some of the more gruesome moments with a form of collective comic relief - where humour inappropriately surfaces to confront harsh realities that we prefer to deny: ""they're not really going to make us watch that, are they?""; followed by, ""can i look now? is it over yet?"".<br/><br/>This is definitely not for children, although I doubt it would exceed an M (15+) rating in this country. Only things like sex and drugs seem to qualify for that. If the language and violence were toned down then you might be able to pretend that there were something in it for both adults and children, but that's clearly not the intention here and I think best avoided.<br/><br/>Instead, the fantasy world of Ofelia becomes almost as relevant, almost as real as the world of the adult characters, and it's the parallel course of the two and their eventual interjoining that leads to the inevitable conclusion of this story.<br/><br/>So I guess I could sit here and think about this in terms of a portrayal of the evils of fascism - in context. I could think about this in terms of an artwork - a traditionally surreal and complex way of telling a story that's set in a particular place in history. But I think I'll choose to look at this as a way of experiencing a story from two different points of view: the harsh actuality of the adult world with all its nasty and cruel realities (just as Ofelia's mother points out to her), contrasted with the coping mechanisms and ""innocence"" - verging on denial - of Ofelia's own journey through the events that take place...<br/><br/>Having said that, it's hard to give one more weight than the other. Who's really in denial? So I leave the theatre not quite knowing what to think, how to feel or what to do next.<br/><br/>Cool.<br/><br/>P.S. There are plenty of bombs and action scenes for the rest of you."
"greene-1","7","4","8","9 December 2006"," Moving and powerful
","del Toro interweaves the mundane and the magical in this account of a girl whose mother has married and been impregnated by a Fascist army captain during the Spanish civil war. The Captain has decided that the progeny will be a son, and that the son should be with the father. Therefore the heavily pregnant mother, with the daughter in tow, is carted into an army camp in the middle of the countryside deep within guerrilla territory. This gives the backdrop to the film, not only in terms of locale, but also the character played by Sergi López, whose portrayal of a cold blooded man with an appetite for gratuitous brutality is positively chilling.<br/><br/>In this situation, the girl, Ofelia, becomes drawn into a parallel world, totally alien to the various domestic and military issues which envelop the camp, but which nevertheless has an impact on those close to her. As events spiral seemingly out of control in both arenas, Ofelia is faced with intractable choices in which principles in one world or the other will be compromised.<br/><br/>While the inventiveness and poetry of the mystical aspect positively transports the viewer into a magical dimension, it has to be said that the 'normal' aspect is as harsh as can be and provides an uncomfortable juxtaposition, a bit like offsetting the Chronicles of Narnia against Apocalypse Now.<br/><br/>At its core this film is about sacrifice. It's about just how much people will endure, what they will go through, what dangers they will face, in whatever world, to stand by their principles and those they love."

","I seen this movie not having seen any of Del Toro's movies before and I have to say that from the outset I am now a huge Del Toro fan. This movie wonderfully blends real life issues of Fascist Spain to a world of wonder were Ofelia finds yourself torn between the two. Not to spoil the story too much but it tells the story of this little girl who moves out to an army compound in the country side of Spain with her mother. They are joining the mother's new husband, a cruel and ruthless Spanish captain. At the back of the compound Ofelia finds a Labyrinth and a Faun named Pan He sets her 3 tasks to complete. Every time we meet Pan he seems to get more beautiful and you often sense there's more to what he is telling Ofelia. The visual effects are amazing along with real strong performances from all. The fact that it was in Spanish as well really made the movie seem all the more genuine. This one should be mentioned if not nominated for an Oscar as everyone should know that a movie like this exists outside the world of Hollywood, a must see for everyone!!"
"Im_your_Papi","10","4","8","26 October 2006"," Best Del Toro film to date
","As of last night this movie more than surprised me, not only in content, but acting. The primary actors were just too good to be true. One of Del Toro's earlier projects was El Espinazo del Diablo 'The Devil's Backbone' and I though of it as too good. Del Toro's imagination is macabre to the extreme, but not evil macabre like George Romero. The most sadistic character so far is Sergi Lopez portrayal of Captain Vidal, set in 1944 in which Franco's soldiers were fighting to finally push back any rebels against Franco's evil regime Vidal was one of the most sadistic bastards on screen, ihated him so much for being cruel, twisted and perverse. Other portrayals was a young lady Ivana Baquero, the movie primarily revolves around her and her imagination of fairies and fauns and nasty creatures. Her portrayal of Ofelia was second to none for an actress under 17 and amongst some of the best acting. I will not say the movie was gory, but there are scenes of torture, sick and twisted visual effects, violence involving minors, apathy in the part of Vidal for his wife, and pure casualties of war of both guilty and innocent parties whether directly involved with the revolution or just innocent bystanders. The Faun let's say, will give you a mixed feeling and reaction to his true intents. But the best part of the movies involves a self sacrifice, that will give me a rating of this movie a ""10""."
"frankjohnstone-1","10","4","8","10 September 2006"," A History of Magic
","A quick comment: I just saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival and it was absolutely brilliant. My only problem was that I didn't understand Spanish, so I constantly had to take my eyes off the beautiful images to look at the annoying subtitles. I think that what made this movie truly incredible was the combination of utterly fantastic fantasy and stunningly brutal realism. Some of the scenes with Captain Vidal were very reminiscent of Cronenberg's work in ""A History of Violence"". There's no fantasy movie I can think of that's exactly like the elements you see in this one, but in those parts of the movie it was almost like ""Labyrinth"" taking a few steps toward ""The Cell"" and stopping before it crossed the threshold. I know how stupid it is to compare something this original to anything else, but I think it's a useful frame of reference. If you do go see it, prepare for magic, prepare for violence and prepare to be stunned. Del Toro does it again!"

","Yes, spoilers. But I usually write reviews in the assumption that any readers I get may have seen the movie already.<br/><br/>So I'll start with the very first thing I didn't like - The ending. This whole movie, I was believing the ""fantasy"" portion was ""real"" in this movie's particular reality. I thought the girl was in sufficient danger with the child-eating demon. I even thought the Faun was more sinister than he let on. And I would have been fine with any ""sad"" ending. What I did not like is the movie treating me like a moron. At the very end, the girl's death puts her in her Princess-like station with a father and a mother who looks amazingly like her previously dead real-life mother.<br/><br/>As in: It's basically her ""Heaven"".<br/><br/>As an atheist, I'm not prudish. I don't get angry when people say ""God Bless You"" when I sneeze, and sometimes I even visit my friend's church to socialize. But somehow this movie succeeded in offending me. It tricked me. It all turned out to be the imaginings of a girl.<br/><br/>Or was it?<br/><br/>How did she get the chalk? How did she escape a locked door? How did the ""Mandrake root"" actually seem to work, and it's effects immediately diminished as it was burned? Was all of it real, or imagination?<br/><br/>I don't mind multiple interpretations to things but It would have been nice to be directed to one or the other.<br/><br/>...But I digress.<br/><br/>I read a lot of the reviews under ""Hated"" (as I often do, because I already know what I liked in a film so I don't need to read a dozen reviews of ""this was amazing""), and I don't believe the movie was completely awful.<br/><br/>The acting was fine, especially that of the Captain. They did a good job making you hate him, but his acting was superb. His facial emotions, his movements were all fluid and believable for a man with that personality. He stole every scene he was in, and despite his cruel bludgeoning at the beginning, I couldn't wait to see him in the next scene.<br/><br/>Everyone else was mediocre, which was fine in this semi-realistic portrayal of War-life. I liked the girl, but the split War-Drama/Fantasy was jarring, but I ran with it.<br/><br/>And one final, minor complaint; Wasn't this advertised as a children's fantasy? Goodness me, I can't imagine what people thought after seeing it in a theater."

","""El laberinto del Fauno"" is a poem. Delightful and frightening. The whispering woods, home to what will be an awful scenario of war, almost speak. They blow magically and enigmatically. The camera plays all the time, presenting the story in a smooth way, artistic and contemplative. The toying around with the focus makes the impression of a vivid experience, like we are really present in the story.<br/><br/>The script is delicious; mixing two stories in one. The story of a war liberated in times of the decade on 1940, with the fascist army of Franco liberating a war against the rebels in the mountains. The other story centers on Ofelia, a girl whose mother engages with a cold-blooded, soul-less Captain Vidal that with the facility that he polishes clean his boots, fits his impeccable uniform and shaves with unsullied effort he can kill a man with no second thoughts, or torture a youngster with the same feeling. Sergi Lopez confers the character an incredible interpretation, with freezing looks and inhumane gestures.<br/><br/>Ivana Baquero as young Ofelia does a flawless performance. The cast is superb, imposing realism over melodramatic attempts. Guillermo del Toro does a poetry work, something off the books of Hollywood with a fresh, innovative story.<br/><br/>The greatest aspect of this film goes to the visuals. A stunning make-up that brings to life mythological creatures and a faultless art direction that with a small naive appearance imposes the world a breathtaking look. The contrast with the war freed upon the mountains makes this aspect a lot better. The managing to keep both of this worlds apart but innocently inter-related makes the experience breathtaking.<br/><br/>This movie is a beautiful poem, written and directed in a mature and royal way. It may have a brutal imagine catalog but it's worth all the way. Keep it in Spanish to admire the softness of the language.<br/><br/>Please watch this film, it's fierce good."

","I cried in this film. I wasn't sure if I was crying because of the cinematic experience, because of the climactic conclusion, because of how I connected with the fantastical world... but when the lights came up, I didn't want anyone looking at me. I just wanted to vanish, not be left in a house full of people. It's rare that a film captures me so deeply, that I'm able to actively watch it without a live critique going on in my head. This is a sample of film-making at it's finest. Using the language of cinema to say something more about a time and a place. Putting his best metaphors forward, the filmmaker harnesses the reason why imagination exists, and juxtaposes it brilliantly with a brutal war. I was astounded by this film. I expected more of the Labyrinth, and less of the war; but that's just a preconception based on advertising. Despite the lack of David Bowie, this film was the best I've seen all year."

","From the oppening, to the end, I found this movie to be engrossing. The cinematography for one was incredible, all from the lighting choices, the edditng and the way they cut from one scene to the next showed a lot of creativity and was done in such a way as I have not seen in anything close to the likes of in a film recently. <br/><br/>If you are looking for just a pretty picture, of a story which is easy to understand, then this may not be the best choice for you to go and see. However, if you are looking to see and discover a whole new world (and when I state this I am not just talking about the magical world and it's elements in the film, I am also talking about the period in the Spanish civil war in which this film takes place), then this will be a film you will probably enjoy and which you'll probably buy a DVD of, that you will have around for the next 15 years. <br/><br/>It's not a history piece, it's not about history and facts, nor is it a war movie, or even a children's' movie for that matter. It is a story about people. It is a story about people in difficult circumstances, going through hard times...never the less, the film goes on to prove that we are all here for a reason, and ultimately, out of our own choice. <br/><br/>The film is also fantasy, though I wouldn't actually think of it as that. Because for one, it focuses more on the story and what is actually going on rather then the fact that magical things are happening. Which I actually kind of enjoyed. Sometimes I see a film that's fantasy (which I love fantasy), but really they took no time to develop the plot or characters.<br/><br/>It wasn't what I would call genius in every sense of the word (like Lord of the Rings). But it didn't breach it's limits of what it could do, and it certainly brought to the screen enough captivating story, and skill to keep an audience interested. But this movie, it has a life of it's own! And I think it has personality more then all of the other fantasies or movies starring children made in recent years (not to mention some wonderful acting!). And I do believe it deserved and got the 20 minute standing ovation it did from the crowd at the Cannes film festival!"

","Dreams are the place where we can all escape from the evils of the world. <br/><br/>This movie speaks from the heart. A beautiful fairy tale embedded in a moving story about a family struggling to survive in a world on the brink of chaos. The movie is based on the simple concept of the power of life and the power to take it. It has been a long time since I've seen such beauty and evil in the same film. It is a great throwback to the original intentions of the first Star Wars trilogy where good and evil were mutually exclusive with no shades of gray. The characters are multi-dimensional, well crafted, unpredictable, and draw you into the movie. <br/><br/>I loved the bad guy! I haven't seen such a truly dark character in a very long time. He's cold, evil, and remorseless, and I found it hard to see any redeeming qualities about him. He is the true definition of a Heart of Darkness, consumed by hate and greed. Our heroine is the perfect counterpoint: frail, innocent, loving, and selfless.<br/><br/>The historical part of the movie may throw some people off, but I suggest you sink yourself into it to figure out just why a fantasy aspect was such a brilliant idea. This is not your Neverending Story or broomstick movie. It is much more stripped down but magically crafted so that the fantasies seem almost plausible and the lines are blurred between the real and the dream. <br/><br/>I loved this movie! It was a true epic tale."
"ereg24","10","5","11","17 February 2007"," Such Brilliance
","Let me start by saying that this is not fantasy in the sense of Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, but something much deeper.<br/><br/>The story takes place in late World War II Nationalist Spain. A little girl is pulled from her comfort zone and placed into the hills of northern Spain. In this new place, she is now under the cruel control of her (for lack of a better word) evil stepfather.<br/><br/>Quickly she finds a Faun at the center of an old labyrinth in the countryside who sends her on a quest for immortality, as she performs three task. The less you know about the film going in, the better.<br/><br/>It really helps this movie to understand the political climate of Spain at this time. Nationalist Spain had just undergone a Republican Spain, and had formulated a fascist government.<br/><br/>Likewise you must understand that the main character is a young girl, and throughout the film she does things that young children do. Many viewers have complained about some of the protagonist actions, but that comes from a misunderstanding of the nature of children.<br/><br/>While some people have been turned off by its use of subtitles, I humbly refute by arguing that the Spanish language lends such poetry to the dialog, that the movie would have been butchered in English.<br/><br/>Along with the flow of dialog, you find that the score for the movie adds such a mood to the film that at some moments you can merely watch the actions taking place and listen to know what's going on.<br/><br/>One final note is that this movie's use of literary devices (such a rarity in modern film). You have subtle foreshadowing to subtle, yet crucial plot points, and blatant foreshadowing to the shallower plot points. You have symbolism (to say what symbolizes what would ruin far to much) themes, motifs, allusions and some of the best characterization I've seen in years.<br/><br/>Do NOT under any circumstance dismiss this movie as a childish fantasy and keep expecting David Bowie to pop out. This is a mature fairy tail that demands a mature interpretation from its viewers; It is flawless in every effort it makes. This is a truly unique experience that is not to be missed, and again the less you know going into it, the better"

","For anyone who has ever read TRUE fairy tales knows they are NOT very pleasant. This movie was just incredible. It is in Spanish but don't let that keep you from seeing this film. The Mythology in it is very realistic and fascinating. First the little girls is brought to a new home. She discovers a fairy there which leads her to a Labyrinth. Inside the Labyrinth she meets a Faun (Pan) who tells her that she is a princess and must complete 3 tasks to return to her underground palace. But there is something unsettling about the faun. Meanwhile her pregnant mother is very ill, and her stepfather is an evil war captain. The brilliant part about this movie is that there are two plots. The one plot is the fantasy one of the girl's imagination and the magical underworld and another ""Real World"" Plot is about an ongoing War. The reason that was brilliant was that even though there was much importance to what the girl is doing in the fantasy land the ""Real World"" still revolves all the sameA MUST SEE!!"
"couching_tiger_eatin_popcorn","6","5","11","1 February 2007"," Beautiful, without much substance. Too much graphic violence. Mediocre acting.
","True, it's an interesting concept in theory--creating a child's point of view of brutality by creating a film about a child retreating to her imagination during wartime.<br/><br/>But the film's message and its characters, the two things that really matter to me in a serious film like this, are so banal that I cannot find myself liking this movie.<br/><br/>This film's message is that abuse of power is wrong and that war is bad. It is just so black-and-white, without much thinking involved...it's like saying ""stealing is bad"". It's so obvious, and the film is so serious about the message...very single-dimensional, and to be honest, rather off-putting for me.<br/><br/>Characters were pretty cartoonish as well, with no complexity, no depth. Again, not interesting. It could be due to the movie being shot from a child's point of view--but I don't think lack of more complex characters enhanced the film. <br/><br/>As for its concept of contrast between the dark, gritty reality with the child's imagination...it had potential to be interesting. I didn't like how they carried it out, however--the film makers decided to create the contrast using graphic violence, which is rather off-putting and pointless, rather than sad or heartbreaking. Yes, I do admit that it takes a lot to make the adult movie audience these days be shocked by violence. But by creating better characters, I think it's still possible to make a greater emotional impact without using the overtly graphic violence shown here. By the way, the violence is such that a man passed out in my local theater during a scene in this film, and had to be carried out in an ambulance. I'm not kidding.<br/><br/>There are definitely good elements in this film, such as good direction. Undoubtedly the show's center piece, there is a fantastic scene with a flesh eating monster that is taught, wondrous, eerie and beautiful.<br/><br/>The look of the movie feel similar to the Lemony Snicket movie--only difference is that this film used darker tones in set design. Personally, I would rate this movie at the same level artistically and conceptually as Lemony Snicket, although I think Pan's Labyrinth is meant to be more than that. I do have to give it lots of credit for their awesome visuals, as its budget of $18M (vs. $140M for Lemony Snicket) is pretty incredible. But in the end, it's good set production that deserves acclaim, not the overall artistry of the film.<br/><br/>The ending felt forced...did not connect with me, personally. I walked out feeling that overall, I did not gain much from the film. My distaste for the violence and the lack of character depth really put me off, which erased any positives. I could see how people would walk away with positive review of this film, but it's definitely over-hyped."
"uber_panda","10","5","11","1 February 2007"," Beautiful, visually stunning, and perfectly bittersweet
","First, off before I tell you how much I've enjoyed this film, let me just state how much I hate people who bash this film because it's in subtitles. If you don't want to read the subtitles then learn the language! <br/><br/>Back to the film...it was a magnificent feast for the eyes and ears. Everything about it was perfect, the score, the cinematography, the visuals, and the acting was all very well done. Most incredibly was the acting of young Ivana Baquero, when she told her little brother that she would make him a prince, I was near tears (Dakota Fanning is terrible compared to Ivana). And of course how can I forget about Sergi López's performance as the tyrannical Captain Vidal? The thing I found most intriguing and indeed the most terrifying about his character is that how is so prim, proper, and polite about everything, he almost seems human. <br/><br/>The only weak part that I found in this film was the fantasy elements (or lack thereof), all the elements can be seen in the two minute thirty second trailer. It's not a lot, but still a wonderful film.<br/><br/>Although, for some who have heard that the film is gruesome, it is. But so are fairy tales. I mean, read the original tales by the Brothers Grimm and Anderson, look back on what happens, grandmothers eaten by wolves! Witches eating children! And you know what happened to ""Jiminey Cricket"" in Carlo Collodi's Pinnochio? Killed by Pinnochio himself in the beginning! Mix that with Spanish Civil War and thats a lot of blood. And for the people who disliked that aspect of the film, let me tell you this. That's life. Life's gruesome, it's ugly, things don't go the way you want them, people die, tears are shed, but it's also this beautiful, amazing thing and I think Guillermo del Toro has captured those things in this film. There are just so many layers to this film, the only way to view them is to watch this wonderful film over and over."
"NED-10","10","5","11","29 January 2007"," A captivating allegory about war and redemption
","Pan's Labyrinth is a captivating, violent, and at times disturbing fairly tale. The film, written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, is an allegory about the Spanish Civil War that is framed as a child's odessy that takes place in northern Spain during the 1940s where the Spanish army was attempting to root-out the last of the ""guerrilla"" resistance fighters in the years after the official end of the war in 1939. In fact the term ""guerrillas"", which is Spanish for ""little wars"", was coined here. Each character in the film is a metaphor for some aspect of Spain during this period. The story itself is a calling for the people of Spain to face their past so that they can move forward with hope.<br/><br/>Enter Ophelia, a bright, inquisitive child who's mother is married to a Captain in the Spanish Army. Ophelia, I think, represents the soul, conscience, etc. of the people of modern day Spain. The Captain, who represents Franco's Fascist government and military, has brought Ophelia and her mother (who represents the old, pre-Franco Spain) to a garrison in northern Spain, where the Captain's troops are attempting to root out the last of the resistance fighters - and killing many innocent people in the process.<br/><br/>The Mother is pregnant with a child, the son of The Captain. The Child seems to represent the new, post-Franco Spain. The child is Ophelia's half-brother because her father, a tailor, has died. Her father seems to represent the old Monarchy (e.g. a king) who stitched together modern Spain from a collection of provinces over the last millennium.<br/><br/>Ophelia is an avid reader of fairy tales and while at the garrison becomes unwittingly entwined in a fairy tale of her own. She meets a faun who identifies her as a future princess and sends her on several quests, which she needs to complete in order to claim her reward. The quests, it would appear, represent a task to the people of Spain today to face this aspect of their past (the Civil War) and come to grips with it, and only by doing this can they move forward.<br/><br/>In the first quest, for example, she is sent to the roots of a giant fig tree where an evil toad lurks. The presence of the toad is killing the tree and keeping it from flourishing. The toad is representative of this dark secret that lies at the underbelly of Spain itself (the fig tree) and is keeping Spain from truly flourishing. Rooting out this toad is the ""key"" to Spain's future.<br/><br/>Without elaborating too much on the rest of the movie, suffice to say that the Captain, is blindly driven see his new son born no matter what the cost or how much bloodshed. He is thwarted by the guerrilla resistance, who is embodied by an determined and fearless housemaid and nanny. A doctor, representing the hard-working, innocent bystanders in the war gets caught up in the middle of the struggle.<br/><br/>We get a clue to the end of the picture at the beginning of the film. However, that does not entirely soften the impact. Most people do not learn much about this bit of history, so many people will not quite understand why the film is as dark as it is. As violent as it is, it pales by comparison to the real atrocities which occurred. I definitely recommend the film, but with a caution. It's a very involving film but also very difficult to watch at times.<br/><br/>The film is visually amazing and well acted, tightly written and tightly edited. Ivana Baquero's portrayal of young Ophelia was marvelous.<br/><br/>In closing, I would like to thank my high school Spanish teacher, Mr. Gaone, who's passion for Spanish history (along with some clues in the pre-press for the movie) enabled me to understand this film."
"irinagoldst","10","5","11","22 January 2007"," Excellent movie
","It's more than a fairytale, or, maybe, the European way of making fairy tales. It's a fantasy story for grown-ups and a drama for children. You might find it scary here and there, but it sticks to reality at the same time. 1944's Spain was not the best place to live happily or to raise your children. However, despite the fights, Ofelia found a way to survive through fantasy. Or maybe fantasy rescued her from a cruel destiny, and could have saved her mother as well if only she would have kept a bit of her child's innocence. The movie proves that Europeans can make their own fantasy movies and that happy ends do not make necessarily a good movie. The end is up to us, or to the child in us - because in real life it is unbearable to accept such death of a innocent and yet brave ""princess""."
"lucasaq-1","10","5","11","21 January 2007"," A true meshing of fantasy and reality.
","""Beautiful and exhilarating, A fairy tale for grown-ups"" so Ebert heaps praise on this visual wonder. Many others praise this film with similar phrase, but I will settle to call this one of the greatest blends of fantasy with realism. Keep the kids at home. This film may have a child at the lead, but it hardly for the eyes of the children.<br/><br/>Guillermo Del Toro has crafted a film that is at times disturbing and others magical, but throughout the setting is never really lost. We are constantly in shadows. The moon is often the source of light and the being that surround us are strangely human. The setting is postwar Spain and the woodlands where a war still wages between gorilla troops and the army lead by a strict captain. Into this world of deception, brutality, and regimen living comes the free spirited Ofelia, and her mother, Carmen who is pregnant. As the story unfolds Del Toro quickly whisks Ofelia into a world of fantasy, but never fully relieves the tension and brutality of the real world. This world is a horrible and made so by the devilish Captain Vidal. There may be a connection between him and the hideously looking faun, but I had to give that idea up. The film isn't what it often seems and the fairy tales not as innocent as the ones normally brought to mind in children's books. This is an adult fairytale, but it still has a heart.<br/><br/>Ofelia is charmingly and disarmingly played by Ivana Baquero. She has the look of an Alice in Wonderland, but with far more at stake than being lost. She plays the full range of emotion expected of any actress and carries it off the innocence of the child to carry the majority of the film. For the rest of the film there is Sergi Lopez and his evil Captain Vidal. While his character isn't given much characterization, it is sufficient to get across the weight of his character who can speak for himself without an introduction. He doesn't like complications and has the sword to put to rest any problems. He is menacing in every scene even until the end. But he is matched in the real world by his own housekeeper Mercedes who is played brilliantly by Maribel Verdu. She may not look it or even at times act it, but she is made of solid stuff. She acts as Ofelia's protector in the real world a role which her mother cannot fully keep as she is pregnant and disabled for the majority of the film.<br/><br/>While the characters and actors root the film in reality the art direction makes for an incredibly foreign feel at times, but the place is never in question as the characters resemble many dangerous and beautiful things of which we are familiar. Still the costumes especially the fauns are amazing. Doug Jones voices the faun and I suspect acts the faun.<br/><br/>The film is true meshing of fantasy and reality. Guillermo Del Toro doesn't relent in story or vision and made the most visual stunning film this year. I loved the story, the look, the sound, and even the feel of this film. In short this film captured my heart and stands as one of the best of this and any year."

","Pan's Labyrinth by Guillermo Del Toro is the film we fantasy and horror fans have been salivating for. What an imaginative spectacle Del Toro has created here, a pure delight on every conceivable spectrum. A young girl, Ophelia, is sent to a mountain army station with her pregnant mother, in order for her sibling to born in the presence of the her stepfather, the Captain. The environment is hostile, but the sides are drawn clear early on in the film, and an even side story between guerrillas and their opposition give the film a realism that juxtaposes with the movie's terrific fairy tale premise. Shortly there after, Ophelia discovers a fairy and is soon led to a labyrinth on the army stations outskirts. Her arrival in the maze is something of prophecy, and once she delves deeper in, the best part of the movie begins. Great visuals and equal acting highlight the film from start to fin. And though a couple parts seem to be rushed for the sake of time, Del Toro directs effortlessly, mixing realism with fiction sublimely. A perfect score as well as a captivating story hold this film high above all others this year. 9.5 outta 10"

","**contains spoilers** Have you ever had a miserably bad experience at a restaurant that you previously had thought would be stellar because of all the good reviews? This movie is that restaurant. It's all hype but the king has no clothes, though few would admit it. What it really is is a badly done horror movie hiding behind the facade of a fantasy wrapped in a war movie. What better ploy to show gobs of blood and gore? This movie is a blood fest and the only love the director shows for any of his characters, is the loving embrace by the camera every time blood is in the scene. Someone is stitching his own mouth: Close-up please! Someone is being beaten about the head: Close-up please! Someone is being tortured: Close-up please! Someone needs an amputation: Close-up please! It was so ridiculous that I almost expected to see ""Blood"" make an appearance in the screen credits. You know you're watching a bad movie when every single major character takes actions that are completely out of character and it doesn't take long to figure out that the reason for such is that you are being rather obviously manipulated because the director has another blood fest to embrace in the next scene. Incidents don't occur to advance the plot, they occur to advance the gore. In one scene the rebels actually start a campfire in midday in clear view of the enemy base camp. At first you think that no rebel army could be so stupid and that it is probably a trap. Well, think again. There is no trap; they actually did start a fire in the middle of the day for no other apparent reason other than, one presumes, to warm their lunch! The rebel army is composed of morons who leave astonishingly stupid clues behind so that key benefactors can later be implicated and/or murdered (in gory close-up, of course). The rebels have a spy at the enemy base camp but do you think the spy would take the opportunity to poison the enemy leader? No, of course not. Instead, the spy uses her plumb position to act as postal carrier! When she actually does have a prime opportunity to kill the enemy leader, she instead squanders it by simply cutting his mouth open. (How else could you have the self-stitching close-ups later on?) She then leaves and walks right past the very people who apprehended her in the first place. Did she honestly think she wouldn't get caught walking in plain view of them? The stupidity of the characters in this movie is mind boggling. This isn't Hitchcockian suspense, it's more like B movie schlock fest alerts; every time someone does something stupid, you know blood will follow. The stupidity isn't what you would expect from characters in a real first rate movie. However, the stupidity is exactly what you would expect in a movie like Freddie vs. Jason or some such teen slasher movie. And that's really all that this is; it's a slasher masquerading as a fantasy wrapped in a war movie. After all, you have to at least pretend to have some semblance of a plot. When someone finally does decide to poison the enemy leader, he occasionally stumbles but otherwise, the lethal dose has little impact; exactly what one would expect from the hard-to-kill ""Jason"" type character typical of most slasher movies. But what I found most offensive of all was the death scene where the little girl is by herself with the spy a few steps away, not even comforting/hugging her but instead humming a wordless ""lullaby"" that sounds more like a depressing and wordless funeral dirge. Aberrant and abhorrent."

From the production-design to the costumes, make-up and effects, it was an absolute marvel to sit through. And the cinematography tops it all of with giving it an interesting mix of both dark-blue and orange colors, passing off the comforting and disturbing tone of the world.<br/><br/>The score by Javier Navarrete is this fantastic magical summary of how powerful music can be for a motion-picture and how much it adds to it. I can definitely call it one of the greatest ones out there.<br/><br/>The directing by del Toro couldn't be any better, as he captures the best shots and scenes that the movie has to offer, making it even better with his compelling script. The characters are all believable and very important, making us care for most of them and makes us invested in this strange universe where they are set in.<br/><br/>With all of these elements mixed together, you get an instant classic, that will be remained as one of the most inspiring and heart-stabbing fantasy films/experiences that you will ever see, included with one of the most tragic, saddest and unforgettable endings that you will ever witness, which never gets old or worse and one of the reasons why it's one of my favorite films of all time.<br/><br/>I'm giving 'Pan's Labyrinth' a 10/10"

Until it changes back to the real world where she has been shot and killed.

"MoraRose519","10","2","3","15 May 2019"," Magical Masterpiece
","A film so amazingly put together, combining fantasy and real world. Even though this movie is a low budget film, you would never be able to tell. With amazing character development, costuming, makeup, and CGI work Guillermo del Toro has created a masterpiece.
Through the eyes of a young girl, we see many tragedies and experience the innocents of youth: everything holds magic. Through the Captain we experience anger and no remorse. Through Carmen we experience obedience. With all the different characters we experience many layers of characteristics we see throughout our lives."

","Entertaining and has lots of visual pop, but didn't quite live up to everything I had heard about it (this was my first time watching it, and I had always been interested). It's kind of a strange intersection, with the fairytale elements put alongside brutal violence and torture, but I think that was part of the point, the innocence lost in war and for Spain under the Franco regime. In the blend of fantasy and reality, I thought the fantasy elements worked better, and I wish there had been more of them. I loved the dreamy feeling of the child from the 'other world' and my favorite part was the Pale Man; the visuals are fantastic in that scene and I loved the Goya reference. The other half of the movie with the resistance fighters is decent, but not as strong as it could have been. It needed more nuance; the captain is cartoonishly evil and the plot is suspect at key points (e.g. a moment when it defies logic for someone not to kill him). I think the weak link here is unfortunately in the writing, as the story and characters are pretty simple."

"teodorodontosaurus","10","2","3","25 April 2018"," Is life (not) a fairy tale?
","Probably the darkest fairy tale ever; it's an antithesis between a fantasy world and the harsh and unmerciful reality. The atrocities during the Francoist Spain are dominating the real world. The fantasy world is also dark and full of foes.
Before the movie ends, an immediate question comes in the viewer's mind: Is it really a fantasy world or just a child's imagination?
Sergi López's performence is top notch; cold, extremely cruel and brutal, unsympathetic, disgusting, sadistic and almost lacking emotions; yeah, my favorite character in the movie is evil!
Ivana Baquero must be mentioned too; a pretty good performance for her age.
Beware, this is not a typical fairy tale!"

"baekms","10","2","3","4 February 2018"," A captive and beautiful movie
","When I first saw this movie, I had this rare feeling like entering another world with my whole body and mind from beginning till the end. It was written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, produced and distributed internationally by Esperanto Filmoj and Warner Bros.
The story takes place in Spain in the summer of 1944, five years after the Spanish Civil War, during the early Francoist period. 
Pan's Labyrinth takes place in Spain in 1944s, during a time of Spanish civil war. A ruthless Captain has set up camp in a distant forest, and requests that his pregnant step-wife and her fantasy-obsessed daughter, Ofelia join him there. <br/><br/>Del Toro stated that he considers the story to be a parable, influenced by fairy tales, and that it addresses and continues themes related to his earlier film The Devil's Backbone (2001) to which Pan's Labyrinth is a spiritual successor, according to del Toro in his director's DVD commentary. 
The original Spanish title refers to the fauns of Roman mythology, while the English title refers specifically to the faun-like Greek deity Pan. 
The film won numerous international awards.
There are some visually brutal scenes in it, so attention. 
The acting is amazing, especially the young Ivana Baquero, playing Ofelia. 
The animation is phenomenal, but not nearly as breathtaking as the costumes or scenery. The labyrinth itself just sucks all the breath out of you when you see it at night for the first time. Pay attention to the great ""pale man"": a most terrifying creature in the movie.
To me it's a jewel in the movie world: a sad description of the Franco period, mixed with a great fantasy: cruel, sad but wonderful."

","Pan's Labyrinth is a truly gripping film. It shows the difference in class between the peasant resistance and the fascist military. It's a great blend of action and drama whilst managing to stay interesting to the audience. It combines history, fantasy, politics and a story into 2 hours of enthralling film. The setting is magical and transports you into a world of mystical delight.<br/><br/>The costume and make up team really out do themselves, making the mythical creature of a Faun look real. It's not CGI or some animations; they took the time and effort to make a Greek god, only seen in paintings into a real life being. <br/><br/>The Performance by Ivana Baquero is brilliant, especially as she was only 11 or 12 at the time. She has to act with CGI; she has to act scared, sad, happy, relieved and surprised. With such little experience puts on an incredible show. Also, the performance of Sergi Lopez is amazing. From the first time we meet him to the last he keeps his character, a character which is always by the book, cold hearted and emotionless, even towards a child. <br/><br/>Before watching the film I expected a corny story with poor performance by the lead child actor. But I couldn't have been more wrong. Even though it's sounds all cheesy story, it's actually quite dark, brutal and thrilling. There's unexpected violence completely out of nowhere that surprises the audience and gives a true insight into what the character are like early on. <br/><br/>Overall, Pan's Labyrinth is a must see block buster. Please do not discriminate it as it's foreign with subtitles, after a few minutes your used to it and hooked on its riveting tale."
"Drewgarden","6","2","3","17 May 2017"," Brilliant idea, painful delivery system
","I was touched by this movie when I first saw it in 2008. In many ways I was younger back then. I thought to myself tonight - ""I'm up for some fantasia fun with the Faun and Ofelia et al"". What I got instead was a rather landlocked affair, and the fairy tale I wanted just wasn't there in enough strength.<br/><br/>The fairy tale concept in this movie is truly inspired, the girl feeling displaced in a troubled world and poor personal circumstances, stands to become a princess, if she can just pass the tests. The historical backdrop and the art house feel are perfect for this and the fairy tale is very compelling, it really manages to pack the required dark severity. The scene in the pale mans cavern with the banquet is truly masterful. Points also must be given for the ending, it did manage to make me feel at least some of what it promised I could. Thanks gang!<br/><br/>But from there on it fails...<br/><br/>Usually with these kinds of stories, the dangers are overcome by the heroine's exhibiting moral qualities that are the real message of the movie. In Pans Labyrinth, the real message of the movie is instead a gruelling lecture about fascism thrust upon us in the real world, quite apart from Ofelia's quest (are we wrong to question Del Toro's casting the communists as sainted warriors?). Just about all of the characters apart from those involved in the fairy tale are pretty loathsome, say nothing of ""the Captain"" who is one of the most unbelievable villains you will ever see. He really is boring, and he's in it all the way. It's not an exaggeration to say that the movie is about this sad irredeemable bastard. Even our heroine has no effect on him, in every scene Del Toro is saying ""don't you hate him? hate him now! he's a baddie!'<br/><br/>Baquero, the Faun and the fairy tale save this movie from being a disaster. My only criticism of Baquero's role is that (I read this as a rumor, and it seems to fit) the role seemed to be suited for a younger girl, I sensed the script wasn't quite complex enough for her age. She would have landed the material had she been given it, she played her part very well. I absolutely love the way she is visibly tempted by the feast and waives the fairies off in the underground cavern to make her fated mistake.<br/><br/>So over all, it was in Del Toro's grasp to make a truly great dark fairy tale, with an ending so good you are transported to another world, but I can't really say that's what this is. After his moment of genius, he can't stay on the path, and the result is a bit hard to take. He was like Ofelia in the cavern of the pale man - eats his own forbidden fruit for no reason (or for whatever reason), and we're all forced to wince it out. <br/><br/>I give this 7 because the fairy tale really is quite intriguing, the rest was painful and predictable."
"djd-56903","8","2","3","12 May 2017"," Amazing
","Del Toro always proves himself! When comes to the effects, it is almost scary real, the creatures he comes up with are flawless. If you watch this movie prepare to have you breath taken away, and your heart pumping. The tension gets to levels where you almost can't take it anymore. I would buy this movie the moment I get a chance. If you don't understand Spanish,you will need to turn on the subtitles, so you will read a little bit more."
"chassaroo","10","2","3","2 February 2017"," Ofelia will always be my hero
","Pan's Labyrinth (2006)<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is a movie about a young Spanish girl, Ofelia, who is moving with her mother, Carmen, to her new step-fathers house. Her step- father, Vidal, just happens to be a captain who is determined to hunt down and rid the world of the rest of the anti-Franco rebels. Upon arriving, Ofelia discovers the labyrinth and has no idea just what she's truly in for. Before getting to explore too far, Mercedes (Vidal's cook/assistant), interrupts her and takes her back to the house. Later, once everyone is in bed and asleep, a fairy visits Ofelia to take her back to the labyrinth where she meets a mysterious faun, who technically doesn't have a name, who claims she is a princess of the Underworld and tells her in order for her to escape the harsh real world, she must complete three tasks to ensure her essence is still in-tact and that she hasn't turned mortal. <br/><br/>Ofelia just wants to escape the real world and live happily with her mother where they don't have to worry about anyone but they are stuck living with the Captain who only cares about having a son prodigy. Ofelia believes that she could give them a better life by completing the tasks provided by the faun until things turn bad. Once Carmen becomes sick, Ofelia doesn't complete the task so the faun pays her a visit who seems extremely upset that she failed. After the faun gives her another chance, she encounters the Pale Man, who is no one to be messed with.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie you notice the theme being good vs. evil. Dark vs. light. <br/><br/>The editing of this film is immaculate. Throughout the scenes, you can notice the theme even when nothing is being said and nothing is happening. At one point, Ofelia is getting ready to get a bath and she is sitting on the side of the tub reading the book that the faun gave her; the light is bright and round, it's soft colors and smooth. When it comes to Vidal, suddenly things become sharper and duller. The editing also continues with the mood of the scene. In the end, when Vidal's empire is falling to pieces and Ofelia is trying to escape with the baby, it's dark and gloomy. The details in the movie draw you in and attach you to the characters so you feel as if you're a part of it and you become emotionally attached. So when the Captain in chasing after Ofelia, you begin to panic. You know something bad is going to happen since everywhere you look it's dark and the music is suspenseful. You heart beats faster and faster as Vidal catches up to Ofelia and his new son in her arms. At that moment, Ofelia has a choice to either give her baby brother over to the faun to open the portal for her to the underworld or the give him to Vidal but instead she sacrifices herself. The Captain takes the baby and shoots Ofelia in the stomach and then tries to run away. In the midst of his getaway, he is stopped by Mercedes and her brother, who is an anti-Franco rebel, and his army. Vidal accepted defeat when he handed over the baby to Mercedes but even in the end he tried to convince Mercedes to tell his son how he died and Mercedes interrupts him to tell him that he will never even know his father's name before her brother Pedro shot him in the cheek. Mercedes runs to Ofelia's motionless body and even in this dark and heartbreaking moment, you notice Ofelia give a slight smile and then it shows her with her real father, King of the Underworld, and her mother in their kingdom. The faun appears and explains that it was all just a test and she made the right choice by not giving up her brother. <br/><br/>Vidal was the evil in this movie. From the horror scenes of him smashing in an innocent man's face with a bottle and killing his father to torturing an anti-Franco rebel for multiple days. Ofelia was the good. She tried to keep her mother alive with a mandrake root from the faun that Vidal ended up destroying. Ofelia knew about Mercedes lies but kept them a secret because she knew Mercedes would be killed if the Captain found out. <br/><br/>Most people cannot enjoy this movie due to its violence, brutality, and lack of a happy ending but it is because of those reasons that I love this movie. Pan's Labyrinth is not just another cliché fairy tale. It is unique and has a strong story with an emotional pull. The mix of reality and magical world is amazing. I have seen this movie what feels like a million times and it will never get old."
"tankace","10","2","3","2 November 2016"," Gillermo del Toro maybe best product as yet!
","Now to be perfectly honest with you ,dear reader, I am a HUGE fan of del Toro films, with the Hellboy movies been among my favorites superhero and fantasy movies and Pacific Rim the best flick about giant robots since Iron Giant, so yes I genuinely believe he is a great director, writer and producer. And as far as I see it his best work as yet this one Pan's Labyrinth one of the most beautiful, atmospheric and captivating film I have ever seen in my life.<br/><br/>The story takes place in Spain after the Civil War of 1936 to 1939 and follows the young bookish girl Ofelia ,who goes with her pregnant mother to a military camp under to control of her step-father, the general and commander of that place and one of the most cruel, arrogant and sadistic villain in movie history, who could give Ramsay Bolton a run for his money. During her stay at each opportunity she has, escapes in to a fantasy world that is just around her corner and confronts creatures that are both amazing to look at and totally terrifying. The movie also gives time to the rebel group that is hunted down by the Franco forces and their tries to survive and beat back the fascist in the camp.<br/><br/>The contrast between the fantasy world that we among side Ofelia explore and the real one is close to perfect for we see both similarities and differences. To elaborate on that this contrast makes it impossible to see these two worlds separated for when you look closely you find out that in their structures and designs have some parallels that are too go to spoil you have to see them yourself.<br/><br/>Another great thing about the flick is that the story feels like a fairy tail, but isn't like those we all know like Snow White and the seven dwarfs, Sleeping Beauty , the Little Mermaid and so on. For del Toro turn the model of the classic fairy tails complete on its head and gives you a story which feels both realistic in plot, out of this world when it comes to the fantasy elements, which looks as they were the child for a beautiful dream with a horrifying nightmare and you want to look over and stare at it at the same time.<br/><br/>As for the acting, is perfect with Ivana Baquero that plays Ofelia been so good that for a while I forgot that she was acting, Doug Jones as the titled Pan as is usual for him been in to the character( literally) and the rest of the cast having their time to shine.<br/><br/>For anyone who likes creature feature, fantasy, the fairy tails with a twist or in general good movies is a must watch, like now. And to close with a warning, it is not a film for children, not at all ,it is for a more mature audience ,so if you want to watch it with your kid, young nephew or niece ,do it as your own digression."

","I have always loved this movie. I was a young girl when I first watched it and I fell in love with the fairy tale aspect and as I have gotten older I have fallen in love with the effects and conflict of it. The story line is interesting and keeps you guessing to see if the girl is in fact the princess. This story of love really feels authentic and wonderful, mostly because it is a story about love of family. You can honestly appreciate the way the story is framed in warn torn Spain and how that creates a different level of drama and sometimes confusion. It is an interesting blend of fantasy, war, and horror. I have seen this movie probably 30 times and it never fails to make me cry at the end from sadness and joy."
"Zvargo","9","2","3","1 May 2016"," The Darkest Fairy Tale
","(SPOILERS) Pan's Labyrinth blew me away. Set during a Spanish Civil War, the setting often alternated between the horrors of reality and the fanciful wonderland that the young girl Ofelia, played by Ivana Baquero found herself in. After an encounter with a bipedal talking Faun played by Doug Jones who tells her she must complete 3 tasks before the next full moon in order to escape the mortal land and live with her father and mother who are royalty of the underworld. Each of these three tasks require Ofelia to venture away from her pregnant and sickly mother, played by Ariadna Gil and brutal step-father played by Sergi López to complete these tasks she receives from a magic book that the faun had given her.<br/><br/>This movie was beautiful. Beautiful in the darkest of ways that I think I have seen put to film. A housemaid named Mercedes who essentially takes Ofelia under her wing has a lullaby that she hums to Ofelia at one point of the film. It is so simple and beautiful but very important to the film as you can hear it and its influence throughout the score of the film. The color pallet of the film is incredibly dark yet beautiful. The reality of the civil war ravaged area of Spain is constantly overcast and dark or rainy and each of the fantastical elements of the film are presented in the same type of light except I noticed that with each task Ofelia had to complete the composition of the shots became darker and darker as her situations became more and more dire. This darkness continues until the incredibly bright, bittersweet climax of the film. Innocence of person seems to be the central theme of this movie. Ofelia is thrust into a world she wanted nothing to do with. Her mother becomes pregnant and moves to the compound where the Captain Vidal and the men he commands over reside. He is a terrible, brutal man. Vidal is perhaps one of the most brutal and frightening antagonists I have ever seen in a film. He treats Ofelia and her mother like objects while only caring about his son (the baby that the mother Carmen is pregnant with). He takes no prisoners except to torture and maim them before killing them when he receives what he wants. Ofelia stands to be the central figure of innocence throughout a war where both sides are killing each other or backstabbing each other. Ofelia's innocence is brought to light in many instances throughout the film until the climax when the Faun requires the blood of an Innocent to open a portal back to Ofelia's true royal family. <br/><br/>This movie was very different than your standard ""Innocence triumphs"" type film. No one is sacred or untouchable in this movie and it shows throughout. While a movie such as E.T. has a bitter sweet ending and the innocent child risks his life to save another certainly could be paid tribute here in Pan's Labyrinth, I feel it is taken to an extreme showing the horrors of experiencing a war as a child from the frontlines. Motifs in which Ofelia's innocence are tested throughout the film. There are moments when her character traits put those around her in danger because she didn't consider her acts to be ""That bad"" and in the ultimate test of innocence she sacrificed herself for her brother ultimately earning her way from her mortal body to reclaim her spot as princess in the underworld with her mother and father. This film truly shows a strong innocent character in Ofelia. She was brave until the end and while the film seemed to leave the ending up to the viewer I like to believe that it was truly a bittersweet ending when the credits rolled. A dark and twisted fairy tale, Pan's Labyrinth was great and highly recommended."

Every shot seemed to be tight, focused, and captured the mood the scene is creating. Obviously the visuals is what makes this movie so amazing and it deserves that merit. the use of makeup and real set pieces rather than the CGI saturated world we live in now is why I will always love this movie.

","To be honest, the first time I listened to the name of this movie, i never imagined anything like this, because i used have the bad habit to judge before to see. Anyway it seems to me now that i'm a fanatic of these kind of movies, that the context of a real world can make us more and more imaginative, beyond the things we believe and thought. For me this is a weird but beautiful example of the power of imagination that the director Del Toro can give us. I didn't remember what exactly did I do when movie finished, i just smiled, watched the credits scrolling, heard the beautiful music and then i put the movie on its box. Nothing else. Something happened. I can't describe that effect that Pan's Labyrinth gave me to me, but it was beautiful. Cry or smile, or cry while smiling. Only a genius could make that piece of cinematographic art. I liked for many reasons. One of them, it's spoken in Spanish, the atmosphere of tension that comes together when the war combined with a strong Spanish accent gives emotion to the movie. And then, the tranquility. All the actors getting deep into his character. A combined rhythm that shows different contexts of two different worlds. Doesn't matter what you believe, it's your choice. I recommend this movie for those who want to see something weird, but something that can prove itself the worth of a young soul. There's a prequel, which is based in the same context. (The devil's backbone). The idea of have a child on the main character for me is such as see the innocent life turned into something that they wouldn't be able to do. <br/><br/>That's why i loved it."

It's dark and horrifying appealing to an older audience yet shows the hardships of that time. <br/><br/>The actors are all stable in their roles and Doug Jones as the El Fauno is stunning. The costumes are something else that entice me, especially El Fauno who looks as though he is part of the Earth from which he probably came. There are roughly 2 plot lines running in parallel; the military-resistance story and the princess fantasy story. Both move back and forth as needed. Each storyline connects smoothly and is easy for the audience to follow."
"ramesestsarina2","9","2","3","3 July 2014"," Beautiful masterpiece
","This film is truly brilliant. I could spend this entire review gushing about how wonderful I think it is, but will try to be more precise. <br/><br/>The plot is beautifully constructed, juxtaposing seamlessly between a reality without hope and the fantasy that offers a light at the end of the tunnel. The acting was superb throughout – the young Ivana Baquero shows remarkable skill in bringing the character of Ofelia to life, and we really can believe and enter into her distress and fear. The haunting music was a perfect backdrop to the action, enhancing the despair of the situation. The effects are excellent and believable.<br/><br/>Whether or not the audience is supposed to believe that Ofelia is imagining things or whether it is really happening, seems to me to be ultimately irrelevant. What the audience is looking at is the idea of hope rising out of despair, in the person of a little girl who believes in magic. The effect she has on the adults around her, whether it be contempt from the Captain, or the love she inspires in Mercedes, is the most poignant and beautiful part of this story. <br/><br/>This is a great movie.

Anyway the result of friends Alfonso Cuaron and Guilhermo del Toro seems to work well and I personally think that they should work again in the Future. That scene where the girl steels the fruit from that weird Monster with eyes on his Hands was a weird scene.

","I am a huge fantasy aficionado. Films like Blancanieves, LOTR series and Miyazaki's works are my personal favorites. I knew that Del Toro was a fine film-maker when it came to telling a dark fantasy story. So, when the credits started rolling, i knew that i had seen one of the best films of all time. The real beauty lies in the fact that Del Toro manages to blend Spanish civil war and a beautifully lavish fantasy world together. The film is brutal yet magical. This is a fairy-tale for grown ups where Ofelia's child-like imagination runs free yet the world created by her is full of horror. As far as acting goes it is Sergi López's fantastic portrayal of Vidal that caught my eye. His performance is chilling enough to make you hate the captain. Ivana Baquero portrays Ofelia with a nuance which is beyond her years. And lastly it is Guillermo Navarro's masterful cinematography that breathes life in every scene. A true masterpiece which is sure to remain a high benchmark for fantasy films in years to come."

","The way Del Toro balances this story between the cruel reality of the Spanish civil war and the wonder of this realm he's created is perfect. This is one of the purest fantasy movies I've seen, and it's beautiful throughout, even in scenes without Ofelia and her imagination present. Behind the gloom is a strong family tale; Ofelia's love for her mother, the struggles Mercedes goes through with her brother, and Captain Vidal's strained history with his father. This instills heart to what could easily be nothing more than a florid piece, regarded purely for it's dress-up (which is incredible). <br/><br/>The performances were also great. Ivana Bacquero and Maribel Verdu were standouts, but it's Sergi Lopez's embodiment of evil as Captain Vidal that leaves the biggest impression. As far as movie villains go, he'd have to be up there with the best. Credit is due also to Doug Jones, the man who is usually behind the amazing costumes in GDT films. His movements as The Faun and The Pale Man ranged from powerful and intimidating to absolutely terrifying. Extra credit too for learning Spanish.<br/><br/>This film is a remarkable achievement, not just for Spanish cinema but cinema as a whole. It should be remembered as one of the most riveting pieces of dark fantasy. Guillermo Del Toro is a genius and master of this genre, and the people behind the scenes who work with costumes, set designs, FX etc. are incredible.<br/><br/>A movie I would recommend that's similar in terms of dream-like fantasy and a completely visceral feel is a 2006 film called The Fall. I wouldn't rate it as highly as Pan's Labyrinth but it's definitely a good film in it's own right, and worth checking out.<br/><br/>Sweet, thanks for reading yo!"

","I thought this was one of the best sub-titled movies I have ever watched. I forgot I was even reading the words after five minutes. I would usually not watch a movie this type, that I couldn't understand and so must read sub titles, (it can distract me from the movie) but this movie kept my interest enough to not notice, it's a very interesting movie. <br/><br/>The story really grabbed my imagination, I loved the characters and thought they were really well done. When I saw the preview to this, that is what caught my attention the most, now seeing the movie it did not disappoint. <br/><br/>The story was very heart felt, and the Labyrinth and characters made a hard impression on my feelings toward this story. The movie ended on a great note, and didn't leave me feeling like something was missing.<br/><br/>I would watch this movie again, I think it's worth it."
"joerowling","10","2","3","28 April 2013"," if you don't do subtitles don't watch this movie
","This movie is one of the greatest ever made. The visual effects are some of the most engaging and impressive that I have seen and I have seen a lot of movies. It is not so much impressive in the way that CG is in Avatar but it is on it's own level. You just have to see it to understand. The story is very heavy and powerful. Some scenes were so shocking and powerful that I was actually shaking. There are horror movies that deal with strange and unlikely things like zombies, and don't get me wrong I love a good zombie or vampire movie. However, a film like this one that deals with war in a very smart and real way has a much bigger impact when something really bad happens than a movie that is clearly make believe. This movie deals with make believe and the surreal in a way that few other movies have been able to pull off well. What Dreams Come attempted this and did not quite hit the mark, this movie does a much better job of contrasting and blending what is real and what is imagination. Brilliant, brilliant movie. If you have a problem with subtitles do not waste your time, you will be disappointed and want to give the movie an unfair low rating which is an ignorant English speaking person thing to do. If you can deal with subtitles, watch this movie."
"ChristianUnchained","9","2","3","23 April 2013"," An incredible exploration of the imagination of Del Toro
","Unique, very well crafted adult fairy tale. The fantasy component, while not getting much screen time, is effective at conveying an interesting twist in the genre. It's an incredible fusion, and features some awesome character designs. Performances across the board are effective and at times powerful. The original score is also moving, fitting the action perfectly. <br/><br/>Granted, Pan's Labyrinth is fairly bizarre but is more than approachable. It is a spellbinding tale of love, sacrifice, and courage that is incredibly memorable. If only we got a further glimpse deeper into the mind of Del Toro, this movie would be perfect. If you are looking for something unique and a little different, look no further than this classic."

","Pan's labyrinth is a truly wonderful experience and right from the start the viewer is treated to some beautiful visuals. But this film is a lot more than just being pretty to look at and beyond the excellent visuals, the viewer is treated to a captivating story.<br/><br/>The main star of the film is Ofelia (played by Ivana Baquero) and considering she was only 12 years old when the film was made I thought her acting was really good - arguably the only acting that was as good as/better than Baquero's was Sergi Lopez whose performance as the evil captain Vidal (Ofelia's step-dad) was also excellent. We also have Mercedes (played by Maribel Verdu) Carmen (Ofelia's mum - played by Ariadna Gil) and the doctor (played by Alex Angulo) in supporting roles.<br/><br/>Another of the film's strengths is the pacing - although the film is nearly 2 hours long, you won't even notice the time passing - the film's main plot covers Ofelia and her fairytale world within the Labyrinth and we also have a sub plot involving Captain Vidal and his war against 'The Guerillas'.<br/><br/>Pan's labyrinth is beautiful to look at, has a wonderful story, is well acted with a strong script. I would strongly recommend checking it out"

","The thing got like a 96% positive rating on rotten tomatoes/meta-critic. Can't imagine what all the critics were inhaling in the theaters . Do we really live in era of such diminished expectations? <br/><br/>The production values are beyond reproach, but it's a major disappointment - the plot was tiresome, the characters one dimensional clichés, violence gratuitous and the Christ allegory ending embarrassing. As a fair-tale, the magic realism elements were contrived and shallow. As an exploration of Spain's civil war during fascism it's laughably bogus. <br/><br/>Also Mr. Director, if your inept main character shows less sense about her than my 2 year old niece, it's hard to take your film seriously .<br/><br/>Worst 'foreign film' I've seen in a while."

"spicysovereignty","8","1","1","25 May 2019"," Obedience, Fairy Tales, and Trauma
","If nothing else, Pan's Labyrinth is bold. Bold in its choice to subvert the fairy tale, bold to use its impressive but unconventional effects, and bold in its commitment to always keeping you on your toes.<br/><br/>But this boldness is not without substance. This is a sad story - there can be no doubt about that. But why? In the end, I think, it comes down to its theme of obedience. Throughout the film, obedience (or the lack thereof) is explored: from Ofelia's constant disobedience to her mother and the faun to the guerillas in the forest continuing to resist, despite their loss in the civil war. We root for these people, and admire their resistance. But always it is punished. This is what makes the film so heartbreaking. Even when victory comes, there is always a bittersweet tinge. There is no better example of this than in the final scene. Ofelia disobeys the captain by not allowing him to take her brother, and is shot for it. Yet, even in death, she resists, believing wholeheartedly that she has done her duty and will live with her mother and father as a princess forever.<br/><br/>This brings me to a final point - my interpretation. I believe that the entire magical world was a coping mechanism for Ofelia's miserable situation. This is shown during Ofelia's last encounter with the faun when the film cuts to the captain's perspective, and he sees nothing as well as with the film's emphasis on the bottle of red fluid that explains why Ofelia's mother recovered - not because of the mandrake root. This interpretation may be ridiculous or widely known. I haven't researched it. This is simply mine.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time."
"ayakasaito","10","1","1","6 May 2019"," Beautifully directed movie
","Guillermo del Toro has recreated a historical time period with a fantastic story. The movie begins with the humming of a gloomy tune, which helps to set the mood and scene for the rest of the film. After this but still towards the beginning, the orchestra allowed for the magical atmosphere when Ofelia is introduced to certain mystical elements, such as the fairy disguised as a stick bug. The music in the remainder of the film was, for the most part, dark and dramatic. Using this type of music created suspense and made the creatures even more frightening. It also builds up and matches the twisted character of Captain Vidal, who is responsible for many horrific actions. Finally, the lullaby from the film shared a familiar tone and melody to those that are often hummed by grandmothers and mothers to their children.
The camera movements primarily function as a guide for the audience's attention. It leads them to become aware of certain elements that could have gone unnoticed otherwise. The way that the camera zooms in to objects helps viewer's notice minor details that later become significant to the plot of the story. It also contributes to the dramatic mood of certain scenes, such as when the stick bug flies into view from the statue's mouth. The camera movements aligned the viewer's perspective with that of the character, such as when Ofelia looks at the eye from the statue.
The costume and make-up of the film help illustrate the setting for the time period. It also distinguishes the various roles of characters, such as Vidal, the fascist captain and antagonist. His routine of shining his boots and regularly shaving his face shows his obsessive and controlling nature. Vidal and his men wear clean, blue-grey uniforms, which reinforce the coldness and social superiority of those characters. Ofelia's clothing primarily consists of greenish hues, which give the impression that she is down-to-earth, and modest styles that are appropriate for her age. The green also appears to embrace her in the same way she surrounds herself with nature.
The creatures have distinct characteristics. For example, the Pale Man is very tall and has sagging skin, with eyes on its hands. This horrific image is appropriate for the mood of the movie. The faun, on the other hand, is a round character who has the ability to display gentleness and wrath. His physical form is very texturized and contains elements of ""the mountain, the forest, and the earth,"" making him appear more ancient or wise. The costumes and makeup have significant impacts on the presentation of each scene."

","4 February 2007. In the classic foreign tinge of dark, more sinister fantasy, Pan consumes the audience with darker themes of death. The spacing between fantasy and reality is rather fascinating, though the ultimate issue of reality while blurred somewhat, isn't deliberately pronounced enough to create a true resonance of doubt and wonder. There is one pinnacle scene that appears more manipulative without explanation during the banquet scene. Both overly simple and complex, the special effects are good, the set design engulfing. Unlike Chronicles of Naria (2005), Harry Potter, Jumanji (1995), Lord of the Rings, The Neverending Story, Spirited Away (2002), Time Bandits (1981), Pan has a more wrenching fantastical atmosphere that almost tears the genre apart.

It is an effective blend of fantasy and reality, but there is a problem.

A lot of foreign language movies in America are completely overlooked because of the other movies that are being advertised, but Pan's Labyrinth doesn't do that. It stays in your mind forever.

"Gabe37","10","1","1","29 January 2018"," One of the best movies for ages to come...
","This is the first time I write a review for a movie, and it happens to be for my favorite ever. I remember watching it back in 2007, and I was mesmerized by the cinematography, the performances, the direction and the music that makes you travel with your mind. But the most fascinating thing was the way the real world and the fantasy world are connected. Guillermo Del Toro proved to be a master at this. It's a war movie, a fantasy movie, a drama movie, a horror movie and it excels at all these parts.
As far as the performances are concerned, Ivana baquero really delivers (despite her young age) and Sergi Lopez truly becomes one of the most convincing and hateful bad characters in the history of cinema. The rest of the supporting cast is remarkable too.
No matter how great I think this movie is, I would not recommend it to everyone. I work in a DVD Club and I have noticed that not all people can appreciate it. It is certainly not because of the spanish language, but the fact that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a perfect representative of -what I call- thinking cinema. It is a movie that will make you think of it for days after you have watched it. It includes so many symbolisms and life lessons... But for those who like this kind of movies, I would say ""Watch it now!"".
Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Del Toro because he gave us a movie to remember for years... A movie which combines the misery, the hope and the dreams that make us feel alive."

The use of Spanish throughout the film makes the historical context of the film a strong presence and a constant reminder to the audience that the film was placed during the Spanish Civil war - constantly reminding them of the horror in the real world.

The use of low shots also helps intensify the horror and threat of certain characters, this can mainly been seen through the use of Pale Man's character.

Del Toro does an amazing justice to incorporating the real and the fantasy throughout the film. The abuse that Ofelia receives not only from her step-farther Captain Vidal, but also the threat of the Pale Man helps create sympathy and empathy from the audience. However the presentation of characters such as Ofelia and Maribel Verdu portrays how females can be strong and domineering - especially during a time such as the Spanish Civil war. In conclusion this piece of cinematography is beautifully accomplished. Achieving empathy, attention and suspension that is sought by the audience. The film itself gives a accurate representation into the hardship that is faced during the war and how fantasy and make believe can create the most magical adventure in such a dark era.

","Guillermo del Toro's 'Pan's Labyrinth' (originally released circa2006): a multi-Dimensional horror/fantasy plus historically-relevant morality-play reflecting an original work of genuine artistry and boundless imagination!  Presenting a one-of-a-kind cinematic combination & inspired merging of multiple genres that works perfectly as part atmospheric escapist entertainment (delving into the horror-Fantasy realm) but also incredibly containing and effectively communicating a deep empathy = leaving the viewer profoundly 'moved' by film's end.... by dramatic-revelations and sacrifices that seem to carry genuinely spiritual 'weight'  <br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro's fantastically-effective admixture is quite astounding: being part Gothic-horror, part historical-drama, part political-thriller surprisingly also imbued with a significant dose of Latin/Spanish 'Magical-Realism' within the fantasy-World created as both sanctuary/refuge & eventual pathway to navigating the darkened, unsympathetic, hostile 'real-world' confronting young protagonist 'Ofelia' forced to make fateful choices at the tail-end of brutal Spanish Civil-War.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is ambitious for its historical scope, philosophical point-of-view, and utterly-fantastic visualizations highlighting the elusive search for compassion and location of faint-traces of genuine 'humanity' (even if only existing primarily in the realm of human-imagination) when confronted by a World of unrelenting violence, cruelty and unabashed Evil, in this case the Spanish Civil War that extracted a heavy, unsympathetic toll on the innocent civilian population of Spain also serving as an ominous precursor to the boundless cruelty + unremitting-horrors of WWII and even the Holocaust itself – although Pan's Labyrinth specifically takes place during 1944 after the civil war had already been lost by the Loyalists, and General Francisco Franco's fascist-forces were consolidating power (and brutally dealing with the last remnants of resistance) <br/><br/>This subject matter could have been a real 'downer' but Guillermo del Toro's masterful film-making and insanely-imaginative visual-arts-wizardry leaves the viewer spellbound as if transported to a darker version 'Oz/Wonderland' filled with magical creatures that appear to alternate between friend and foe = constantly testing the protagonist Ofelia's own deep moral code/core (i.e. forcing her to make fateful choices about life & death, for herself and others that she cares about). <br/><br/>I think it takes multiple-viewings to extract/ unearth the layers and depth of 'meaning' and also for the viewer to 'reconcile' the literal barrage of images & characterizations that are a combination of bizarrely-horrifying, otherworldly-mystifying, emotionally heart-wrenching (and in the final analysis perhaps even spiritually uplifting to a degree) – I don't think there is any other film quite like it, not to be missed (or ever forgotten!)"
"bluecottonbluejay","10","1","1","29 November 2017"," Haunting and magical
","This is my favorite film of Guillermo Del Toro's. It captures a little seen era of history and injects it with (pardon the cliché) magical realism and a sense of wonder. All of the performances are great and the ambiance of this film instantly sets you ill at ease. It's like a twisted fairy tale and I hesitate to say too much more about it."
"elicopperman","9","1","1","24 November 2017"," The Most Disturbing Fairy Tale I've Ever Seen
","This is the first film I've seen from dark fantasy film director Guillermo del Toro, and I don't think I've seen a movie that changed my perception of fantasy films as much as this. I am not kidding when I say that this movie is disturbing beyond reason, as it centers around a girl named Ofelia who moves in with her stepfather, the tyrannical Captain Vidal, while also living in her own imagination. Once she's at the residence of her stepfather, Ofelia discovers a mysterious labyrinth and meets a fan who sets her on a path to save herself as well as her severely ill mother. As time goes on though, there is a blur in the lines between fantasy and reality, and Ofelia soon encounters a horrific battle between Good and Evil.<br/><br/>Right off the bat, the world building of the fantasy elements this film offers is incredible. The film has a very gritty and dark setting in the real world given the civil war happening, and as such the world Ofelia imagines is so grim yet imaginative that you wanna see more of it. The creatures in design are beyond words, whether it be the creature Pan (performed extraordinarily well by Doug Jones), to the fairies, to even a Pale Man, and considering that the film mixes animatronics and CGI along with makeup and costumes really brings the effects to new heights. It's no wonder the film won the Oscar for Best Makeup and Best Production Design, because this is like no other world I've ever seen in a fantasy film.<br/><br/>As for the content, I did think that the arch of Captain Vidal got in the way of Ofelia's story a lot, and because of this it almost feels like two different movies are contrasting each other. However, it all fits with the dark world that Ofelia would go into, and since it's hard for her to witness such heinous acts in the real world, her imagination seems to take note and it creates a beautiful Gothic nightmare within itself. I could never stop rooting for Ofelia to just get away from such a horrid man or even life, and even though the trials she gets into in her own world are fake, the film succeeds in creating suspense between her relation with her mother and stepfather and what she can do to save herself.<br/><br/>To quote film critic Jim Emerson, Pan's Labyrinth is ""a fairy tale of such potency and awesome beauty that it reconnects the adult imagination to the primal thrill and horror of the stories that held us spellbound as children"" As fantasy oriented as they are, fairy tales have never shied away from letting out their inner horrors, and those horrors have shaped kids into adults for the better. Pan's Labyrinth brings fantasy into such a grim underworld for a little girl's imagination that it fits beautifully with the contrast of reality and fantasy that can bring adults into this spellbinding fable. If you watch this film, you may never look at fantasy the same way again, but it will bring you back to a time when you cherished imaginary worlds as much as the next child."

"classicsoncall","8","1","1","3 November 2017"," ""This is your last chance"".
","One will be struck with the way director Guillermo del Toro blends fantasy with the backdrop of a war drama. The principal character, the young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), manages to interact in both worlds, and each of them are of dark and Gothic design. Considering it's subject matter, one might initially think this would be a good movie for kids to see but there's really too much gruesome violence and mutilation that takes place to make it wholesome for youngsters. The fantasy elements may conjure up images from other films like ""Alice in Wonderland"" or ""The Wizard of Oz"", but again, those pictures were generally a lot more colorful and optimistic in tone. The one thing that disappointed me with the character of Ofelia was when she ate the grapes in the lair of The Pale Man. I really wanted her to display more self control as the heroine of the tale. Unusual too is the idea that the heroine, so called, would actually die at the end of the story, at least in the real world realm. There was some consolation in the fact that she rejoined her father in the spirit world, but the first impression adds to my caution about the film's impact on a young audience."
"lewiscannon-52799","7","1","1","31 October 2017"," Great film
","Considering pans labyrinth isn't usually the type of film that I would watch (in regards to the genre and language) I really enjoyed the film. Not only is the film built upon a solid plot and story line, surrounding the height of the Spanish civil war; it dabbles with the idea of fantasy and escapism from the real world. This escapism aspect is played out through the mind-set and narrative of a young girl called Ofelia. Many props and editing techniques are used within the film to further propel us into the idea of a fantasy world and allow us to delve even deeper into her Arcadian mind-set. I personally really like the side by side contrast of a happier/ more uplifting toned plot in conjunction with the much more serious and depressing story of the civil war. Not only does the film explore historical context and escapism, but more serious themes like abuse, sexism, war and even more jarring themes such as torture, both physical and psychological/ mental. As someone who generally appreciates the physical aspects that go into the making and cinematography of a film, I was thoroughly impressed with the special effects makeup within the movie, as well as how continuously used it was throughout. Two of the main characters were fully created using special effects makeup (these being the pale man and the fawn) this further added to the fantasy genre of the film and made it that much more enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>However, as much as I did enjoy the film, certain aspects of it did become rather repetitive and almost predictable, for example, as soon as the film started, it was clear to me that the mother was going to die at some point; this level of predictability could be a good or a bad thing, as well as just be down to a person's individual perceptive abilities when viewing films, however, this did stick out like a sore thumb to me. Certain parts of the movie were also quite slow and seemed to drag on for a while, not any major parts come to mind although certain shots and edits/cuts between shots could have been more finely tuned in my opinion, making certain scenes even more impactful or dramatic. Overall, Pans labyrinth was an enjoyable film to watch, the pros definitely outweigh the cons and in my opinion, is a ""breath of fresh air"" in comparison to some other fantasy films."
"phoebeknight-36061","8","1","1","27 October 2017"," A very good film.
","The films darker topics (such as political violence, sadism and horror to some extent) were well balanced with fairy tale aspects, which gave it a more digestible and understandable way of exploring such heavy political topics. The cinematography, performances, makeup and visual effects were all so brilliant and helped ground the film as well as linking the fantasy to the harsh and brutal reality. The story itself was well written and very enticing as it did well to bring together both a very dark story with a very fantastical one, without it feeling too odd or one or the other feeling too out of place adjacent to one ever so different. Overall it was an extremely good film and definitely worth watching."

","There are few fantasy films that are able to so convincingly build such an awe-inspiring, enrapturing world in the span of one movie; Pan's Labyrinth is one of those films. <br/><br/>Almost to the point of perfection, Del Toro is able to masterfully craft a combination of fantasy, horror, war, and mystic elements together. I don't think I've really ever seen another movie I could compare this one to. It has such an odd, off-pace feel to it that even now I'm having trouble describing it. More fantasy movies should aspire to be in the realm of Pan's Labyrinth.<br/><br/>What does the ending of this movie tell us? Is it a religious allegory? Is this all about war and being a martyr? Or is it just telling us the story of a girl whose imagination allowed her to escape her brutal surroundings for a while? However you interpret it, I hope you enjoy the experience as much as I did."
"katy_fenner","9","1","1","17 October 2017"," Simple review on the film
","Pans Labyrinth hooked me in, and created an enigma that had me captured from the very start. The overall mood of the film is extremely dark, ghostly and eerie, and the lighting often changes to represent the different themes of the film; escapism, reality and fantasy are shown in green, blue and red/gold lights. The micro elements are very detailed, for example in the first scene, the graphic editing of Ofelia's eye into the parallel universe was very effective as it represented the other world through her perspective, along with the narrators voice. Furthermore, the mise-en-scene used through the constant use of books portrayed Ofelia's interest in fairy tails and fantasy, which she uses as an escape from the real world, and also the horrific things that happen around her. I thought that the special effects were astounding, from the faun, to the toad, to the pale man; all the creatures/monsters shocked me as they were so realistic. The film was visually remarkable! Additionally, the performance from Ivana Baquero was exceptional, especially considering she was so young at the time of the film. The camera shots were very significant throughout the film, as there are extreme close ups of Vidal's watch which symbolises how important time is in the film. Also the distant shot of the pale man is very similar to when Vidal is at the dinner table, this portrays Ofelia's mental reconstruction of Vidal as Ofelia sees him as pure evil. Overall, I loved the film and thoroughly enjoyed the juxtaposition between the 'two worlds' and also the theme of good vs evil."
"kartiknnagar","8","1","1","14 October 2017"," Emotionally powerful and melancholic adult fairytale
","This film has a bit of everything : fantastical creatures, horror and tension, historical slice- of-life (dealing with the aftermath of the Spanish Civil war in 1944), a fairy-tale like story competing for screen time with a grim military attack against rebellious guerillas, loathsome and sadistic characters, but also cute and inherently good characters, warm and fuzzy sequences full of love and emotion, but also extremely brutal and disturbing violence. But most importantly, this film has a lot of heart, and by the end you will feel intimately connected with its principal characters, and it will make you cry with its stirring and somewhat ambiguous climax. <br/><br/>This has been called an adult fairytale and there is a lot of ambiguity as to whether the magical and fantastical sequences are real or the imaginations of a scared and lonely child. There are clues towards both these possibilities, but I personally believe that thematically, it makes more sense that the fantasy sequences are just created by the mind of our child protagonist to cope with all the strangeness and brutality around her, and the ending really hits you even more powerfully with this assumption, as we grasp the true purpose of these imaginings and see how it helps her to achieve peace and happiness in a really grim situation."

","I remember my interest in seeing this when it first came out in 2006, so I went to the big screen and saw it there and remember being blown away about how amazing this movie was. I was a bit skeptical paying for a movie that wasn't in English, and having to spend the entire time reading to understand what was happening, and while it does take away from the experience somewhat, the movie is so compelling and gripping that it does little to distract you from the incredible experience. Something triggered in my brain 11 years later that made me want to see this movie again, and I just finished watching it and now that I'm older, found that I appreciated the movie even more this time around. The mixture of fantasy, magic, war, innocence, hatred, love, and the underlying good vs. evil story really are well balanced in this film. I'd have rated it a 10, other than what I mentioned earlier about having to read the subtitles which does slightly detract from the enjoyment. I read in the trivia notes that the writer/director declined a budget of 2x to make the movie in English, so I commend him for making such an amazing film and staying true to his desire to keep it original. A great movie that if you've not seen, you are missing out."
"Screen_Blitz","9","1","1","7 September 2017"," Guillermo Del Toro crafts an exuberant, yet nightmarish fantasy world, blending high-classed visuals with and storytelling with sobering history on the European front
","Picture an adult version of 'Alice in Wonderland', add graphic violence and momentous themes to the mix, and you got yourself an accurate picture of Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth (or El Laberinto del Fauno in Spanish). This film takes a high-classed fantasy genre and spins into a dark, twisted universe where fairy tales clash with the grim history of the European front during World War II. The results that transpire is an Alice in Wonderland-like adventure that strikes at the heart not with whimsical excitement or charm, but with its wicked twists and turns that captures the innocence of childhood diminished under the unforgiving history that defined our world today. Do not let the visuals fool you, this is by no means a kid-friendly adventure. It is very dark, very violent, and proceeds a sense of dread from beginning to end; and Del Toro has almost no doses of levity to offer in the bargain. On the upside, the scarcity of child-friendly themes is what makes this high-classed fantasy tale so unique. The film is set in 1944 during the Spanish Civil War when Spain was being overrun by fascism. Following the death of her father who was killed in the war, 11-year old Ofelia (played by Ivana Baquero), a fairy tale obsessed youngster, moves with her mother (played by Ariadna Gil), who is growing ill from her pregnancy, to the country side of Spain to escape the chaos. There, she meets her new stepfather Captain Vidal (played by Sergi Lopez), a fascist army officer with a sadistic edge, and Vidal's housekeeper Mercedes (played by Meribel Verdu) who she grows a close bond with. On night, Ofelia is awoken by a fairy who leads her to a mysterious labyrinth where she meets a giant faun (voiced by Doug Jones). Upon meeting, she learns she is the princess of a magical kingdom, but must prove her loyalty by completing three unpleasant tasks before the full moon rises. As the war atrocities rage on and the lines between reality and fantasy begin to dissolve, Ofelia is pitted in a ruthless battle that threatens to tear both her and her family apart. <br/><br/>Guillermo Del Toro wields a masterful hand at pulling us into his world where dreams turn to nightmares and fantasy morphs into horrifying reality. Rich in electrifying storytelling and powerful in balancing his signature visual methodology with hard-hitting substance, the film takes you on a ride that is vastly unpredictable with plenty of scares and thrills to fill the mix. The story operates on the base of the Spanish Civil War in which the action, beautifully shot by Del Toro, is intertwined back and forth with the lead character Ofelia's interaction with the fantasy world and the effects it leads on both her and her ailing mother. As Captain Vidal's tyranny ravages their home land, a gruesome battle between good and evil rages on to the point where all bets are off and the fate of each character could be the worst imaginable scenario. And the beauty of Del Toro's storytelling is that he never lets any moment go to waste nor does he make the critical mistake of allowing his nightmarish visuals tower over his narrative, especially when offering a solid history lesson on the atrocities of war in the European front. The fairies and the monsters, all of which are done by CGI, are astounding, yet scary to look at. We are talking about pale-skinned monster with no eyes on his side, but on the palm of his hands. The performances by Ivana Baquero and Meribel Verdu are amazing, but perhaps not enough to match up with Sergi Lopez's grim performance as Captain Vidal, the ruthless Hitler-like army officer who splatters the screen with his blood-stained demeanor. Each time he is on screen, the sense of discomfort fills the air. <br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is an exuberantly crafted fantasy tale, constructed by the hands of Guillermo Del Toro who offers a near-flawless blend of twisted visual methodology and sobering history of the war in Spain. It is a high-classed fantasy that places a landmark on its genre in more ways than one. It is a definite must-see, but only for mature audiences. If you are a parent and make the ill-advised decision of letting your children sit through this, well, do not be surprised if you find them sneaking in bed with you in the middle of the night."

","In this beautiful film directed by the talented Guillermo Del Toro, he brings imagination and fantasy to life. The film that surrounds the adventures of a young girl named Ofelia, are intertwined with the wrath of her new step father Captain Vidal. His strategical military view is abrasive and firm. Ofelia is tasked by a faun to carry our several types of errands so that she can be with her family from the underworld. Meanwhile Captain Vidal is killing everyone from the doctor to the rabbit hunters. He even killed the rabbit hunters with a beer bottle. That is actually pretty impressive. Vidal's views are Type A personality style. He is stern with his soldiers and has a form of Hitler mentality. The ideology of this film is basically from Captain Vidal wanting a better Spain. And he will stop at nothing to achieve his goal. This film is an intense film for anyone to watch. From Vidal killing everyone in his way to his cheek being slashed open. This is a film definitely not for children, but for adults to escape in their inner Ofelia to an adventure far away."

The film is set in 1943 Spain, after the rise of fascism.

So, when it came to our local theater, I watched it twice—consecutively—and I think it was well worth the time to pay for it once and see it twice. It is nominated for Best Foreign Language Film (from Mexico) although it was filmed in Spain, about Spain, with an all-Spanish cast (with the brilliant exceptions of Mexican director and screenwriter, del Toro and American actor Doug Jones who plays both Pan (the fawn) and the pale man.<br/><br/>The movie tells a grim and magical story of a young girl, Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), who is forced to move to rural Spain in 1944 after the Spanish Civil War in which her father had been killed while fighting against Franco. As the movie begins, Ofelia and her pregnant mother are traveling to a rural outpost to join her mother's second husband, Capitán Vidal (Sergi López). Vidal is one of Franco's officers who is posted at the outpost to command and control the heavy resistance still being waged by anti-Franco forces. <br/><br/>Ofelia's mother is having a troubled pregnancy and is forced to spend most of her time in bed. Ofelia has no children her age to play with but is cared for by Vidal's housekeeper, Mercedes (Maribel Verdú). Most importantly, Ophelia is emerged in her books of magical fairy tales: her real surroundings are so brutal that her imagination easily takes her to living in her fairy tale world. <br/><br/>The movie takes us back and forth between the real world around Ophelia and the imaginary one that she had created. Both can be dark and treacherous. However, the only one that she has any control over is her imaginary one. So, she is devoted to the missions in that world.<br/><br/>Ophelia 'enters' the imaginary world through a maze-like labyrinth (suggested by the ruins of an old mill on the outpost). But once she enters, she can easily get lost without guidance and instructions. Her guide is a giant fawn, Pan (Doug Jones), who instructs her how to open doors, find creatures, and confront them. Pan also instructs her what tasks to carry out as well as what dangers to be aware of in her endeavors. <br/><br/>Ophelia is given three critical tasks to be carried out by a certain time and according to Pan's rules. Breaking the rules could lead to catastrophe, but she must make her own choices too. To help her carry out her quests, she is given small dragonfly-like fairies to guide her. The fairies are not only her friends but they help point out possible problems with their gestures and reactions.<br/><br/>Interspersed with these quests, we see Ophelia's life in the real world. Her stepfather is brutal and sadistic. Before questioning someone, he often gives a prelude in which he brandishes his instruments of torture. However, just as Ophelia is given choices in her imaginary world, so too are the adults in the real world. They can fight, resist, give in, or not respond to threats and pay the consequences. <br/><br/>This movie is well-conceived and presented. Also, the artwork and special effects are remarkable. However, it really isn't fit for children in spite of its fairy tale themes. Ophelia's imaginary world is no more scary or dark than what we might see in a good Harry Potter movie—a hug toad throwing up a ball of mucus to find a sticky hidden key, etc. However, the adult world is TOO real and violent for innocent children and some adults. Still, both real and the imaginary worlds must exist together to make the movie effective: the movie is conceived as an interplay between the two worlds, so you can't have one without the other. What we are left with is a good movie with audience limitations. It's a dilemma, but there you have it..."

"Leofwine_draca","7","1","1","6 October 2016"," A good film, although the fantasy elements jarred
","Guillermo del Toro's fantastic horror-cum-thriller is a film with an unwieldy subject matter. It strives to blend a period thriller involving the battle between Fascists and guerrillas with a Alice in Wonderland-type storyline involving a young girl becoming embroiled in a quest in a magical world. I didn't really care for the inclusion of the latter genre in this film; the fantastic elements felt half-written and clichéd, too obviously modelled on previous Hollywood fare and lacking in depth or interest; ironically, considering del Toro's independent background, these are the elements that feel too much like blockbuster fare; a triumph of special effects over substance.<br/><br/>The bits I'm talking about include the insect at the beginning, the fairies and Pan himself, whose camp mannerisms and riddle-strewn monologues were a little too much for me to bear. Thankfully, one of the film's fantastic moments makes up for these other weak bits: it's the centre-piece involving the utterly horrific Pale Monster, a monster with eyes in his hands. Hands down this is one of the scariest moments of cinema I've seen in my life and I loved every second of it; it's a shame del Toro couldn't reach this height with the rest of the magical stuff in the film.<br/><br/>The thriller plot is far more engaging, a familiar story of an evil man and the people in his household who obey him and secretly work against him with the rebels in the nearby woods. The baddie is played by Sergi Lopez, who steals every moment with a nuanced, understated performance that puts him up there in the ranks of top film villains. Lopez plays a man prone to violence and torture, and there are quite a few grisly scenes to be endured that will be no surprise to anyone who's seen the likes of BLADE II. The other cast members are also good; mainly the actors are unknown outside of Spain, and this works in the film's favour. The only exception is Doug Jones, playing Pan and the Pale Man; at this rate he's shaping up to be the new Lon Chaney.<br/><br/>Technically, del Toro puts as much work in here as in his other films; there's no faulting the effects, the cinematography or the music. It's all very effective as is the script and the atmosphere. I just wish some of the fantasy bits could have been handled better; I prefer to think that they take place only in the young heroine's mind, thus keeping the film a work of realism. It's much darker and more unsettling when viewed in this light."

","Pan's Labyrinth is a beautiful film both dark and heavy in art, yet very real and far from being horror. It's essentially about a young girl who stumbles onto a fantasy world hidden in plain sight. She learns to see and interpret the signs and rules, all while living under the roof of an evil army officer. It deals with war, but on a small scale in an isolated environment, creating a perfect world where reality and fantasy blend together to the point that one loses track and lets themselves believe in the magic. The rural and dangerous setting also creates a sense of imprisonment, leaving the characters with an internal struggle about whether to flee or face their fears. One of Del Toro's best works, Pan's Labyrinth is masterfully executed with superb acting and phenomenal character design and will be remembered for a very long time.

I am not a critic or a movie expert, but there is something about this movie which captures you and then you feel part of the whole setting. As it progresses you feel with the characters, all disappointments, hopes, happiness, you end up owning every emotion until the end when the movie leaves your heart shaking. I am not sure why, but this movie has influenced me strongly so much so that I am not sure if my words are going to do any justice to this. <br/><br/>10/10 Must watch!!"
"RubenTarantino","9","1","1","20 June 2016"," THE adult fairy tale.
","El laberinto del fauno (2006)<br/><br/>This film, directed by Guillermo del Toro based on his own original screenplay is set in mid-twentieth-century Spain, which was under the rule of Francisco Franco and his dictatorship. Stared by Ivana Baquero in the lead role of Ofelia, it tells us her story; a girl that loves fairy tales and lives absentminded in her own fictional world, while her mother faces the cruel reality of being subjugated to her husband, a Captain in Franco's sadistic army. Ofelia is met with some whimsical yet arduous challenges. Meanwhile horror keeps spreading in the side story between her mom and her uncle, a renegade soldier who created a rebel faction in furtherance of planning an uprising against the regime.<br/><br/>The cast, just like in every other critically acclaimed film, seems to be full of faultless picks for each position, even though it's mainly Spanish. Parts like captain Vidal, portrayed by Serji Lopez, offer stunning performances that leave us wondering how these actors are not a-list celebrities. It blends a variety of different film genres into a beautiful cinematic cocktail. Fantasy and drama with a little bit of historical nuances on the side. It's a fairy-tale for adults. Fanciful but nevertheless gory, as could and should be expected by a proper del Toro fan. Do not watch if you are prone to vomiting as there are some harsh scenes in this flick, but do watch if you like adrenaline, since the film uses childhood innocence for face value but maintains an underlying tone of suspense that is guaranteed to put you regularly on the edge of your seat. Costume designers and editors must not be forgotten considering they merged real props with special effects in such a balanced way one could start questioning whether or not some mystic beings are in fact only a product of medieval folklore. As the plot thickens we start seeing how things aren't as simple as they once seemed and the world Ofelia lives in starts to feel real to us viewers. Or maybe we just start using our minds as a defence mechanism against the chaos and sorrow of the ""real"" world we are presented with, so dispiriting it makes us want to escape it. The film revolves around this idea of what's real or fake without ever being conclusive. So it's up to you to decide what to believe in. I consider this to be a film like no other in the sense that it unpretentiously delivers a dichotomy of strong feelings and seemingly incompatible genres all mashed up into 180 minutes of jaw - dropping cinematography. So, for me, whether you are a film buff or a just casual viewer, this is indisputably a must watch."

","Pan's Labyrinth is a movie that's been high on my watch list for quite a while. What I had heard of it really sparked my interest. So finally sitting down to watch it, I was taken aback. The film gradually descends into a dark, dark place. And the movie hits you and it hits you hard and never lets you get up again. And I god damn love it.<br/><br/>After the initial introduction, we're very well aware of the world we're entering. It's a country tortured by civil war. So straight up, you're in a dark place. And as the film progresses, it only gets worse. The darkness of the mythical side is truly scary and with this combination of real and mythical fear, this dark undertone never leaves me and I was always on edge.<br/><br/>The acting was superb even from young Ofelia. The cinematography was great and all the characters work very well together to form a cohesive story. The special effects were eerily beautiful.<br/><br/>Overall, a beautifully dark film that I thoroughly enjoyed."

","I went to see this film after noticing the high rating it has been given on IMDb and after reading a few reviews. I was sorely disappointed. The reviews (ones on this site) led me to believe that it would be brilliant. I think i must have watched the wrong film because I found nothing of the sort. It was boring and had no plot. Also, they had tried to paste together two completely different types of film with sleep-inducing consequences. The film contains a small amount of violence which, given its graphical nature, I would rather have done without. How this film managed not to get an 18 classification based on that I don't know. I kept wondering if the film was leading somewhere but it never did. It yields a couple of small parts that are quite good (thats why I gave it a 2) but a minute or two later we get back to boredom. The only reason I wrote this review is that I find it unfathomable how it averaged an 8.3 rating. Stay home because there's nothing good about this film. Even the usher was keeling over."

","Despite the seeming innocence of this work, it is really a thinly veiled propaganda piece against Christian and traditional values.<br/><br/>It portrays Spanish Nationalists as evil and brutish thugs; those who have actually studied the history of the Spanish Civil War know that is the opposite of what really happened. <br/><br/>Those pitted against the Nationalists were Marxists of every stripe who openly burned and bombed Churches and raped and murdered nuns. A simple cursory examination of period photography will show the atrocious war crimes committed by the Marxist ""republicans""; all under the false guise of ""freedom"". <br/><br/>This film includes graphic violence that will give youth, not just children, nightmares.<br/><br/>In short, while many may ""nay-say"" my open and honest review of this deceitful work, the fact of the matter remains it is a piece of propaganda that really just needs to be recycled and forgotten."
"ilikeimdb","3","9","25","18 January 2007"," Overrated and I'll Explain Why
","I can understand why so many critics have been swept away by this contrasting tale of a brutal regime and the lovely but parallel dangerous fantasy world imagined by our young girl heroine. It's a ""pretty"" film balancing the real world against a not overly-CGIed imaginary one. But here's the crux of the problem: What is the point of this film? What deeper and interesting issues can the audience explore through the vision of the director and his story? My response: None. A simple tale and a simple vision of escaping from a desperate reality. We have the extreme visually graphic brutality of the general against many softer feminine elements (and virtuous feminine strength shown over and over again). So, good versus evil? A young girl's fantasy dashed? The ""clever"" blurring of her fantasy vs. reality? Nice touches that don't amount to anything deeper or more meaningful.<br/><br/>On another note, I found the brutal elements too disgusting to watch and again wondered what was the point? A vicious villain's villain, yes. Geez, I never would have imagined that a man could be so cruel for no apparent reason than the absolute drive to conquer and dominate. That was some learning experience."
"freemantle_uk","10","6","15","6 June 2009"," Beatuful Fantasy Film
","Pan's Labyrinth, since as one of the best films in 2006 by critics and cinema fans alike and they do have a point. A film made with love and imagination. Easily the best film I seen by the top Mexican director Guillermo del Toro.<br/><br/>Set in 1944 during the Franco Regime of Spain, 10-year-old Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her heavily pregnant mother Camern (Ariadna Gil) move to Spanish countryside. Camern's new husband, Captain Vidal (Sergi López i Ayats) who was leading a campaign as a guerrilla force. He wanted his wife there for the birth of his child, despite fact she was ill during the pregnancy. Ofelia is a lonely child, she dislikes the Captain who wants her to call him father and only cares abouts his seed. He is also a brutal commander against the guerrillas, who was very willing to use torture and stave them out. She ends up befriending a servant, Mercedes (Maribel Verdú), who happens to be a guerrilla spy. Ofelia was a girl who liked to read fairy tales and believed in them. She reads on where the Princess of the Underworlds goes to the Real World, but ends up loosing her memory and dies. The King however believed that his daughter's spirit was still alive and would return to him. One night Ofelia goes to an old labyrinth need the house and discovers a Faun (Doug Jones). He believes Ofelia was Princess Moanna and tell her that the King was waiting for her. He sets Ofelia to complete 3 tasks that needed to be done for the next full moon. On this quest she encounters strange creatures, magical tools and dangers and has a book that can predict her future.<br/><br/>This is a film of wonderful designs of creatures and sets. It has a great mix of realistic settings and ideas like the guerrilla warfare to the magical world Ofelia has to embark appond. There is a great mix of make-up, CGI and puppets. Del Toro is a man with a wonderful imagination.<br/><br/>The story and characters are strong and compelling. You care about what happens and has a mix of child-like wonder to the harsh realist of the real world. There are homages to other wonderful films and books like The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, the Wizard of Oz, Spirited Away and Alice in Wonderland, as well as fairy tales. There are even some direct homages, such as Ofelina's dress. There are numerous sub-plots which end up interlinking with the story and all easy enough to follow.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is also dark, violence and pretty scary, it is not a film for young children. Because of the engaging character of Ofelina you end up fearing for her. Also the Pale Man is a really horrible looking creature and if you have a phobia of eyes like me, then it's unpleasant.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent, especially by the young actress Ivana Baquero who should have a great career ahead of her. Del Toro is a wonderful at casting.<br/><br/>If you can not tell, Del Toro's direction was magnificent. He hands the story so well, mixing all it elements with skill. This is type of film he needs to do more of.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is a wonderful dark fairy tale for the modern age."
"dead47548","4","6","15","8 January 2008"," Massively overrated.
","While the idea of contrasting a dark fairy tale with a dark political story of rebellion is quite ingenious, the film ends up being extremely empty and drags far too often. As strong as the performances are the lack of any kind of depth in the mother character results in a lack of sympathy for Ofelia because we never really understand what she's doing all of this for, though I did get teary at the end. The fact that Captain Vidal has absolutely no positive qualities is utterly ridiculous since no one is that sadistic and terrible (even Anton Chigurh showed signs of sympathy) and made the more realistic parts of the story seem that much more unbelievable. The strength of the performances and the jaw-dropping technical aspects can't entirely save a film when it feels so hollow. The ending did manage to bring quite a smile to my face, though."
"explodingcat","3","5","12","16 February 2007"," Nice moments but essentially rubbish
","The movie's fantasy scenes are great, and the best bit of the movie. But the rest of it was very much story by numbers. In fact it was melodramatic pap that wrote itself. The good guys were oh so good, the bad guy oh so bad, the characters clichéd as far as they could be, it was in the end kind of silly, which for a subject as bold as a civil war, is not good. The main girl also had more than a touch of Anne Frank about her visually speaking, which may have been just me, but again added to the trite feeling of the overall movie<br/><br/>But the fantasy scenes were really good, and if the movie focused more on these, rather than the rudimentary main storyline, it would have been better."
"zerogirl42","10","5","12","8 January 2007"," I Have No Stomach for Gore and I LOVED Pan's Labyrinth
","Let me stress, this is not a film for children. It's more in the old-fashioned story-telling vain with true villains, tests of courage, and lot's of harsh lessons. It's like the version of Cinderella where her step-sister cuts off her toe to fit into the glass slipper (and you actually see the toe being removed).<br/><br/>I wanted to address the gore in the film. Yes, the violence is harsh, but it's only on the screen for about 5 minutes out of the entire film. You can also tell when it's going to happen. The scene will build up to it. The visuals won't just cut to something gory then explain it later (like The Ring, which I had to walk out of because it was too graphic and scary). I had plenty of time to cover my eyes.<br/><br/>From the other reviews I've read, I thought I was going to be bombarded by gore and violence, but this was not the case. The story starts at a mellow pace with pleasant imagery. It really captures the wonder and innocence of a child being introduced to a cruel and strange world (both real and fantasy). There is a definite Alice and Wonderland feel to the film, but it quickly spirals to something much darker than the Disney version. <br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is two stories in one. There's the harsh reality of war versus a fantastical world based on myth and fairy tales. This film is what other films have been so desperately trying to be, but otherwise failing (The Brother's Grimm comes to mind).<br/><br/>I love mythical, parable-type films and Pan's Labyrinth does a great job with wonderful story-telling, excellent acting, great character development, fine editing...the list goes on and on. Also, the CG is understated and beautiful."
"thinbeach","3","4","9","25 October 2018"," Pan's Sadism
","Pan's Labyrinth is both too childish for adults and too adult for children. A young girl approached by fairies in the woods to complete some gruesome tasks so that she might become princess in an underground kingdom, juxtaposed with guerilla warfare, torture, and maternal death. Does one really wish to see a girl reading magic books, followed immediately by repeated face stabbings? It is the most repulsive fairy tale you could imagine.<br/><br/>Much of the cinematography is stunning, but whoever offered the filmmakers a discount on the crane has done us all a great disservice, as the cameraman is unable to keep his hands still, and as if the ugly subject matter wasn't for the stomach enough, we spend the entire film in aimless motion, getting sea sick on dry land. Worse is the script and its numerous logical flaws, which see characters doing many unbelievable things a vast majority of the time. I guess if they cared as much about the script as the camera moves, this never would have made it to screen."

I understand the concept that children live in their own world and their fantasies go hand in hand with their surroundings. I understand that fawn in this film is not Pan BUT for goodness sake please tell me what is this film about? <br/><br/>It reminded me of Full Metal Jacket. Its like watching two films. Of course there is a big difference in FMJ as both films are related but in this case there is just no connection. Its like watching 'Saving Private Ryan' and 'Lords of the Rings' simultaneously. Of course both not as good as these two great flicks. Very overrated flick. the only reason you wanna watch this film is for the Phalanges movement. Its a spoiler. A balloon which inflates and burst without a sound."
"michael_the_nermal","4","4","9","27 February 2008"," Utterly Depressing. Not Enough Fantasy Sequences
","Warning! Many Spoilers Ahead!<br/><br/>This has to be one of the most depressing movie's I've seen in a long time. The acting was decent, but the story (the one in the real world, not the fantasy world) was just too disheartening to watch, even for those who are slightly braver than simply being faint of heart. One who are expecting an engaging invitation to a creative fantasy realm will be sorely disappointed, as most of the screen time (well over half, I would wager) is spent with the army officer who is the protagonist's stepfather. We see scene after scene of his cold, heartless brutality, both towards his wife and stepdaughter, as well as to anti-Franco revolutionaries (just to split hairs for a moment: this movie takes place a few years after the Spanish Civil War had ended and Franco had taken power. I say this just in case anyone thought this a movie about the Spanish Civil War). There are a couple of scenes of grotesque violence, one of which is a disturbingly realistic lip-cutting scene. We see the officer's wound before he sows it up: his mouth looks like that of a gory H.R. Pufnstuf. After his wound has been sown shut, we still see him reel in agony as he bleeds from it. This is simply one reason parents should be wary if they think about taking kids to see this. The officer will give them nightmares for a long time.<br/><br/>The fantasy realm into which the girl escapes is, from what I could deduce, a metaphor for overcoming the madness of the Franco regime, and fascist dictatorships in general. Those wanting to indulge in a fantasy movie like ""The Chronicles of Narnia"", ""The Lord of the Rings"", or even ""The Neverending Story"" will be very disappointed, as the fantasy is not given the screen time one would have hoped, nor is the fantasy world richly developed. The faun's magic realm is supposed to be the girl's way of coping with the brutality of her stepfather, but we see only a few glimpses of it, and it is not juxtaposed well with the scenes of the revolutionaries or the sadistic stepfather. In short, the audience is left craving more of the girl's magic world. Many of the ""real world"" scenes do not blend in well as a dichotomy with the girl's imaginary world, and the film suffers for it.<br/><br/>In short, the grim storyline and constantly depressing scenes, without so much as a simple moment of comic relief or humor to break the tension, makes this a rather difficult movie to watch. It is simply a dark art house movie thinly masquerading as a fantasy film (at least in promotional art). I do not recommend this for families who want to bring along the kids or fans of fantasy and science fiction. Those adults with a more intellectual bent or those who take pleasure in watching art-house movies may enjoy ""Pan's Labyrinth."" In all, the audience for this film seems rather limited."
"mikael-pedersen","10","4","9","12 February 2008"," Absolutely beautiful
","Superior performance and an absolutely beautiful though sad storyline.<br/><br/>I was touched and moved by Ofelias escape from reality, into her fairytale world of wonders. <br/><br/>The three leading characters, Ivana Baquero as Ofelia, Sergi López as Vidal and Maribel Verdú as Mercedes carried us through a couple of hours of pure magic. <br/><br/>I was especially impressed by the performance of young Ivana Baquero. She was absolutely outstanding. <br/><br/>Sergi López gave access to a the dark soul of a self-centered, sadistic and emotionless soldier. His only concern was to bring glory to his name, and pass it on to his baby boy. <br/><br/>Del Toro has written himself into the movie history. <br/><br/>A must see!"
"didi.chow","4","4","9","10 July 2007"," I didn't get it
","I like fantasy movies, I like historic pieces. This movie has both of these categories combined in one, but this fact didn't help me understand it. Maybe there isn't a lot to understand, as the movie tells the story of a captain chasing Guerilla fighters in Franco's Spain (historic part), while his little step-daughter, when alone, lives in a fairy world trying to complete tasks set-up by a faun (fantasy part). If this in fact it, in my opinion, this movie is pretty much pointless. While photographed beautifully, the graphic display of violence is inappropriate. Another thing, I don't get, is how highly this movie is rated. Lately, it seems, that you can't get a high rating, if your movie isn't dark, gritty and depressing. The ratings are misleading, they certainly misled me to watching it. If you're looking for something, that will make you sad and depressed and maybe even a little disgusted by the over-usage of violence, go see this movie, otherwise, stay clear."
"jvincent1","6","4","9","23 June 2007"," Am I Missing Something Here?
","Given the present sorry state of American cinema, I was somewhat cynical of a film as heralded as this one. After all, what had Guillermo del Toro done to enhance his reputation as a filmmaker other than Blade II, and Hellboy? I've seen better resumes from young directors. So, what do we get from him in Pan's Labrynth? A magical war movie set during the revolt against Spain's Generalisimo Franco. Guys, I'm still waiting for the day when CGI becomes so good that it can replace the need for a good story. That del Toro is a product of the CGI-dominated school of film-making is very evident here, as the truly wondrous special effects taking place below the earth seemingly have little to do with the world above. There, the evil Captain brutalizes, tortures and kills peasants by the dozens, and we get to watch every excruciating minute of it. I even wanted to cheer when he finally ""got"" his in the end; one shot to the head. And, how does the magical world below help bring about the demise of the captain? Oh, it doesn't. This fantastic world of visual horrors but mostly delights, is strictly for the benefit of poor little Ofelia (and, surprise, surprise, there's her mother, another victim of the captain). The inhabitants of this netherworld enable us to appreciate the value of old time effects such as make-up, but it's still effects, effects, effects. Except for topside, where its murder, torture, more murder (we even get to see the captain perform a little stitch job on the side of his mouth). The more I write, the worse this movie gets, so I'll end it here by saying if you want to see a filmmaker combine plot with imaginative special effects feast your eyes on a Terry Gilliam film, particularly his Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas. If only he could reign it in just a little."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","9","4","9","10 June 2007"," Ying and Yang
","After the overwhelming nominations at the Oscars that Pans Laberyth got, I have to say that I was definitely fascinated with this film and wanted to see what it was about. When it went to rental, I couldn't help but notice the R-Rating, which seemed a little odd. But I now know why, this was definitely one of the darkest fantasy films I have ever seen. That's why I said Ying and Yang, it seemed like it had a very dark side, but also a slightly brighter one where this girl travels into her own fantasy world where she is a princess. This film had fascinating characters, a very interesting story, and was beautifully shot, so I can see where it stands on the top 250 and got the Oscar nods it got.<br/><br/>Ofelia, a little girl, is going with her pregnant mother to a city in Spain, where there is a huge war going on. They are traveling to see the very sadistic and cruel captain of the army, the mother has married him and he is now Ofelia's new father. But Ofelia comes into a world of her own when a fairy brings her to a Labyerth in the garden where she meets a faun and he tells her that he is her servant, and he can help her bring back her thrown to the kingdom by doing a few simple tasks, well, not that simple. But it makes it all the more difficult with the world outside, where her father is murdering others and doesn't care about her mother, only the son she carries inside her.<br/><br/>This was truly an interesting film, in some ways it was a breath of fresh air due to the fact that we don't really have any films like this any more. The cast, the set, the story, the language was so beautiful, I was very impressed. I would recommend this film, not so much to just anyone, it takes a certain type of person I think to fully understand what this film and story is, not judging, just saying I can already name a few people I know who wouldn't enjoy this movie because they wouldn't understand it. But if you are a fan of film, the art of it, I think you'll enjoy this masterpiece.<br/><br/>9/10"
"Coventry","8","4","9","6 April 2007"," One of a Kind Fantasy film. Definitely Del Toro's greatest film!
","Even though I'm one of the absolute few horror freaks out there who thinks the films of Guillermo Del Toro are vastly overrated (or at least over-hyped), deep down I was somewhat confident that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" would rapidly become his ultimate masterwork. All of his previous genre efforts contain ingenious fantasy elements and genuinely macabre undertones (especially ""Cronos"" and ""The Devil's Backbone"") but the screenplays always were unexciting - on the verge of dull, even - and eventually only depended on Del Toro's directorial style & craftsmanship. The aforementioned titles, and to a certain degree ""Blade II"" and ""Mimic"" as well, are enchanting to look at but the stories ultimately failed to impress me. A simple glimpse at the poster art and synopsis of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" already indicated it would be a world of difference! It seems as if Del Toro single-handedly revives the formula of legitimate fairy-tales and passionately reverts to all its old-fashioned and uncanny characteristics, like ominous & grotesque landscapes, youthful heroines, monsters and fairies, violence and very disturbing scenery. Tim Burton is another very gifted filmmaker in the field of adult fairy-tales, but even his films eventually tend to get sentimental and overly joyful, whereas ""Pan's Labyrinth"" admirably sustains a dark and harrowing atmosphere throughout. And it becomes even more praiseworthy, because Del Toro also managed to successfully blend the fantasy-atmosphere with actual black pages in our history books; more particularly the fascist political situation in Spain near the end of WWII. The film opens with an introduction of a young princess who lost her immortality because she got curious and left her father's magical kingdom in order to explore the rest of the world. Her spirit still floats around though, eagerly looking out to get into the body of a young girl who's courageous and strong enough to fulfill three ordeals that'll bring her back to her father. The fantastic dreamy tone of the intro brutally gets interrupted with images of a young girl and her pregnant mother traveling to the domain of her stepfather, who's an incredibly relentless, sadistic and power-mad army captain under the reign of Franco. Whilst Ofelia enters the garden's labyrinth, where Pan the guardian informs here about her birthright, rebels and insiders fruitlessly attempt to bring down the Captain's dictatorship. Even though ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a constantly eventful motion picture, it has to be said the opening 45 minutes (after the intro) are rather dull and disappointing. Ofelia's initial meetings with Pan as well as her first task to accomplish aren't convincing and lack the dark atmosphere the brief fairy-tale introduction promised us. Only after Ofelia's second ordeal  a brief but wondrous confrontation with a malevolent creature with eyes in the palms of his hands  and a baffling depiction of the Captain's evil persona (that man is totally emotion- and heartless!), the film becomes indescribably compelling and hauntingly unsettling. And particularly the climax, which features some unexpected and rarely-seen-before twists, is a powerful demonstration of versatile cinema. The cinematography, set pieces and wholesome of effects all look stunningly breathtaking and nobody can every claim the Oscars ""Pan's Labyrinth"" won in these categories are undeserved. It's a magnificent film to look at AND listen to as well, as the music (courtesy of Javier Navarette) is extremely enchanting. Watch it when you have the opportunity!"
"tghoneyc","10","4","9","30 January 2007"," Absolutely the Best Movie of 2006
","Mexican director Guillermo Del Toro revisits the world he explored first in the awesome ""The Devil's Backbone,"" that of the Spanish Civil War. Only this time it's 1944 and the war has just ended. Only a few rebel groups are left to be defeated by Franco's army. The story here is set at one of the rural outposts where militia forces occupy the forest near an old mill.<br/><br/>Ivana Baquero is Ofelia, a ten-year-old girl who travels with her pregnant mother to meet her stepfather, the sadistic Captain Vidal, who cares only about two things: that his son be born at the mill, and that he fulfill his duty and put down the uprising.<br/><br/>Ofelia's only friend is Mercedes (""Y tu mama tambien""'s Maribel Verdu), a serving girl who is feeding information to the rebels. After figuring out who she is, Ofelia agrees to keep her secret because she likes Mercedes, and fears Captain Vidal.<br/><br/>To escape the violence, Ofelia loses herself among fairies and a faun who resides in an ancient labyrinth behind the mill. The faun (played by Doug Jones of Del Toro's ""Hellboy"") explains to Ofelia that she is a princess who must complete three tasks in order to prove that she isn't mortal, and can be admitted back to her kingdom.<br/><br/>The first of her missions is to destroy an obese frog who has burrowed inside a giant fig tree and is killing it. The scene is pretty funny, but every time she goes on one of these missions she gets berated by her mother, who seems to be even more afraid of Vidal than anyone else.<br/><br/>Del Toro masterfully interweaves the real and surreal elements of the story, balancing them perfectly to create a flawless mix of real tension and magic. She must contend with her mother's worsening condition in pregnancy, and Vidal's growing impatience with her presence at the mill. The rebels know the terrain, but Vidal's men are better equipped, and more fierce. The violence in the movie is quite graphic and heart-wrenching.<br/><br/>Sergi Lopez, as Captain Vidal, should take up residence as one of the great villains of cinema. Lopez imbues in Vidal the kind of humanity that seemed absent in Eduardo Noriega's Jacinto from ""Backbone"". As such he is a much scarier person. Vidal is the son of a military man who died in the line of duty. His only wish is to follow in his father's footsteps. But first, he must have a son to follow in his. And for this he has no room to care much for Ofelia, or her ailing mother, so long as his son is delivered.<br/><br/>As the other great villain of the movie, Del Toro gives us the Pale Man, a murderous white creature (also Doug Jones) with eyes in his hands and long sharp claws. In his banquet hall there are paintings of him with piles of dead children mounted around him. Truly a menacing figure. His memory is not easy to shake.<br/><br/>This often-shocking film is certainly not for small fry--it would surely give them nightmares--but it is an odyssey that must be seen to be believed. Drawing from a number of fairy tales, Del Toro has created an original work that goes far to become in my opinion the best movie I have seen this year, and certainly Del Toro's masterwork."

The story follows a young Spanish girl in 1944 Fascist Spain, in the country with her pregnant mother and fascist step-father. She finds an ancient labyrinth in the forest near some backwoods town in the Spanish mountains (I think near the France-Spain border, but I could be wrong). Inside the labyrinth she meets a faun (the Pale Man/Pan) and sets out on a series of quests to regain her 'honor' as a princess in the underworld realm.<br/><br/>The FX: Now, I thought that all the shots with the Pale Man were CGI, but it turns out they were not. The faeries are CG, and done very well. The makeup is utterly amazing.<br/><br/>The Music: One word: haunting. The score brings the mood of film to life.<br/><br/>The Acting: I am completely unfamiliar with all the actors except Doug Jones (even though he's just a guy in a suit, really). Jones' mannerisms as the Pale Man were fantastic. Ivana Baquero was absolutely phenomenal as Ofelia. Her portrayal of a scared girl wrapped in a fantasy world was the best performance of the entire film. The only actor/actress I found not to be very convincing was Maribel Verdu, who played Mercedes. The first scenes with her were not very good, but her subplot as being an undercover agent for the resistance was very well done.<br/><br/>Overall: One of the best movies I have ever seen. As I stated before, I've never been so moved by a film. Magic exists. Beauty exists even in the ugliest of places. If you don't leave this film with some understanding of this, then you weren't paying close enough attention.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."

","Yes, ""simply crap"", and I'm not afraid to say it, in spite of the ""critics"" who made this movie jump in the IMDb Top 250. Does this movie tell a story as beautiful as Forrest Gump? Ask yourself that question frankly. Yet Forrest Gump is lower in the top than this stretch of blood, violence, and unrelated intermeshed dark fantasy and brutal war themes.<br/><br/>As to the reason why so many people voted this movie so high, I can only speculate: the nowadays public thirst for the violent, the fantastic and the unconventional (i.e. foreign films), in a desire to escape the everyday routine. After Hollywood producing some platitudes, or perhaps after the public getting bored with movies that simply entertain you, anything that's foreign is automatically looked up to. Same thing with the lame attempt at porn, the string of cuss words which is Y Tu Mama Tambien.<br/><br/>If any of these movies were American, only the closet sadists would sit through more than 15 minutes of them."
"Rooster9","10","4","9","26 January 2007"," A Simply Amazing Movie
","The best way to appreciate ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is to compare it to Terry Gilliam's ""Tideland."" Not only were both released in 2006 and sport surprisingly similar poster art, but both are fantasy-reality stories about little girls disappearing into a world of imagination in order to deal with the terrible realities of life. The difference, however, is that ""Tideland"" treats its characters as mere vehicles for unbridled fantasy and, in fact, sacrifices them mercilessly to some disturbing ideas and images, while ""Pan's Labyrinth"" does not. It loves its characters and weaves an amazingly emotional story that does not horrify and fantasize simply for the sake of shock and awe.<br/><br/>""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a cross-genre movie that gets it all right. It's a war movie. It's a fantasy. It's a character-driven drama. And, in an unconventional way, it's horror.<br/><br/>Del Torro calls it a film about obedience. Certainly it's a film about fascism and revolution. But it's also about a girl learning when to break the chains of blind obedience and plant the seeds of independent thought. Abused by a hostile step-father (a fascist army captain) and neglected by a pregnant mother (whom the father keeps constantly drugged), little Ofelia is confronted with horrors she cannot possibly understand. So she translates them into a fantasy world which teaches her lessons no one else seems able to. And the lessons are harsh.<br/><br/>But the way Del Torro brings all of these elements together is nothing short of brilliant. This could have easily been as awkward as the pseudo-fantastical ""Neverwas,"" as precious as the sometimes-sappy ""Finding Neverland"" or even as reckless as the disturbing ""Tideland."" But in this movie, fantasy and reality melt into one another. And the result is engrossing, emotional and inspiring!"

","El Laberinto del Fauno is a true tale of fantasy and imagery. It mixes the fantasy world of a small girl and the cruelty of the war in a very subtle manner. This film captures all the magical elements in a fairy tale and it is presented in an exquisite and elegant manner by Guillermo del Toro, which I might add is the greatest Mexican filmmaker today.<br/><br/>I do not recall any other Mexican films that deal with the fantasy/horror genre like this one does. As a matter of fact, most Mexican films are always trying to be controversial by using sexual scenes and bad language and also by showing us the corruption, politics and poverty of Mexico.<br/><br/>El Laberinto del Fauno does none of the above. This film is just pure pleasure to the eyesight and the rest of the senses. It is a magical tale for adults and it is a delight to see the imagination and originality of the best Mexican filmmaker."

","This film hits the very fine line on what a fantasy film should be. And although its more 60:40 war drama ( which is brilliantly executed ).

Mainly for the terrifying ""pale man"" sequence that frightened me (and I'm 13) and the realistic war violence that looks almost documentary style. But anyway Some incredible performances the cast. Sergi López plays Carmen Vidal a powerful captain given the task of riding the hills of the Spanish republicans, an unforgettable performance by Ivana Baquero as Ofelia, a young girl trapped in a world of torture and war. She uses a story of a princess in a fairytale to escape it. Best film of 2006, it very well could be! Why is this film so unique? well watch it and you will see for yourself..."
"dglink","10","4","9","24 January 2007"," Fairy Stories are not Always for Children
","The Spanish-language film, ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" has perhaps the most misleading trailer in recent memory. Scenes of a young girl, a faun, and tiny fairies suggest a film that might be appropriate for children. Wrong. This often-brutal tale that takes place in Spain during World War II contains graphic violence and enough horrors to induce nightmares in the young or even in adults sensitive to suggested torture. However, when taken as an adult fairy tale with political overtones, the film rates among the best of the past year.<br/><br/>Like other films about children who try to escape from an unpleasant reality into a fantasy world, writer-director Guillermo del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth"" immerses a young girl in the loveless household of her mother's second husband, a cruel captain in Generalissimo Franco's army. While her mother fades away as a difficult pregnancy saps her strength and a cold marriage destroys her will, the young girl is convinced by a faun that she is a princess of the underworld and need only complete three tasks to return and reclaim her rightful role.<br/><br/>The cast is superb. Young Ivana Baquero plays Ofelia, the dethroned princess, with skill beyond her years, and Maribel Verdu is excellent as Mercedes, a compassionate servant with a secret. However, the standout is Sergi Lopez, who imbues the monstrous Captain Vidal with a cold cruelty that is evident from his first scene when he meets Ofelia. The politics of the filmmakers are unmistakably anti-fascist, and Lopez portrays Vidal with relish as an amoral, emotionless monster, who will stop at nothing in his battle against those who oppose Franco. Add first-rate production values, a delicate score by Javier Navarrete, and a captivating script and this Spanish-Mexican co-production emerges as a vastly entertaining gem for adults."

","Accompanied by her pregnant mother (Ariadna Gil), Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) moves from a Spanish city to the countryside to live with her new stepfather, Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez). During the night Ofelia meets a fairy and together they go to a pit in the centre of a nearby maze where they meet a faun (Doug Jones) that tells her she is a princess from another world. He explains to her that she needs to complete three gruesome, tough and dangerous assignments to be reunited with her father again. Meanwhile, she befriends a servant, Mercedes (Maribel Verdu), one of her only friends in the real world. This mixture of war, Gothic fantasy and drama happens to be a beautiful, moving and stunning film and the best to come around in some time (and deservedly received a 22 minute applause at the Cannes Film Festival).<br/><br/>I personally could not wait to see this, as I love dark horror/fantasies. My expectations were high going into this, but when I walked out of the theatre I was one happy person, this movie fulfilled all my expectations and then some. Honestly, what I say cannot do this movie justice, it was an incredible experience now one of my favourite films. It is a brutally violent, moving, magical and at times lovely movie. Guillermo del Toro (who made the Spanish horror ""The Devil's Backbone"" and Hollywood blockbusters ""Blade II"" and ""Hellboy"") wrote and directed Pan's Labyrinth with an evident passion. The story flows beautifully, with no flaws and a smooth pace. Accompanied by del Toro's almost unmatched skill as a modern director, Pan's Labyrinth succeeds on all fronts. Javier Navarrete's incredible score is both touching and soothing and adds a huge emotional impact throughout the whole movie. The action sequences are shot stylishly and are incredibly bloody. Del Toro does not shy away from bloodshed in the real world and the magical world. Moreover, the fantasy elements are incredibly dark and adult and are not your typical Disney creatures which spontaneously burst into song. The creatures that Ofelia encounters are dark and scary looking things. The Faun, although a kind and gentle creature looks and sounds quite menacing and The Pale Man is easily the creepiest creation I have seen in a fantasy movie and although he has a short amount of screen time it's definitely an unforgettable thing.<br/><br/>The acting is absolutely wonderful, especially from Baquero, who gives a powerful performance as young Ofelia. I can see her going far with the amount of talent she has. Lopez is very menacing and sadistic as the Captain, whenever he is on screen his presence immediately fills it. Kudos must go to Jones, who plays not only The Faun but also The Pale Man, he gives life to two polar creatures and as a result, breathes more life into an already perfect film. Also, the cinematography is gorgeous, Guillermo Navarro captures the gorgeous Spanish countryside, a war-torn city and Ofelia's fantasy world with striking beauty and grimness. If there is ever a list of must-see movies, this will surely be present. I urge anyone who has not seen this to see it without delay. Honestly, this movie is flawless in my books. Everything from the acting, the direction, the score and the cinematography, del Toro has created a cinematic treasure that any cinema geek should see now! 5/5"
"jzappa","7","4","9","21 January 2007"," Some People Can't Escape Their Fate
","I haven't liked a single Guillermo Del Toro film that I've seen. I didn't like Mimic, Blade II, or Hellboy. That's not all he's made, but that's three strikes. I felt like that would be the last of the Guillermo Del Toro films that I'd see, until Pan's Labyrinth comes along and gets tremendous praise. I thought, well it actually looks good, and I'm sure every director, even the lesser ones, has his day, and so I decided to see it. I saw it, and I was disappointed.<br/><br/>The movie has atmosphere, which I always like. I like how the film never leaves the Spanish cabin and the woods that surround it. And I also enjoyed the magical creatures, the good ones and the bad ones, when they were actually shown. The problem with the movie is that it's so uneven that you come in not really fully knowing what to expect and then somehow leave with the feeling that you haven't gotten what you expected.<br/><br/>The film takes place during the Spanish Revolution, and attempts to center around one little girl's adventure into a world of fairies, gods, and heavenly creatures, the Revolution being the antagonist that may keep her from reaching the etherial life as the princess of this world. This is hardly effective because the movie is 80% Revolution and 20% fantasy. The audience is subjected to waiting through scenes, even violent and action-packed ones, instead of enjoying them. This is not because these scenes are badly done or boring, but because we didn't come to see a movie about the Spanish Revolution and the evil of the little girl's warlord father. We came to see a fantasy. The scenes of fantasy are very enjoyable, but in all, they probably add up to about a half hour. The remaining hour and a half is lost focus.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is uneven in many other ways, too. For instance, it's a fantasy about a little girl, but it's rated R. The film is advertised like any other fantasy film, much less a fantasy film about a little girl, and there's nothing R-rated about it. So when we see that R rating, what are we to expect? Right up until the second I sat down in the theater, I had no idea what I was seeing. All I knew was that it was called Pan's Labyrinth. And it's because the movie doesn't know what it is, what it's about, or who it's about. Is it a fantasy about a little girl, or is it a drama, or is it both, or is it one overlapping another? Is it about a fantasy world, or is it about the Spanish Revolution, or is it one overlapping another? Is it about the little girl or is it about her father?<br/><br/>Maribel Verdu's performance is terrific, as is that of Sergi Lopez, Ivana Boquero, and Ariadna Gil, and the cinematography is beautiful, capturing the atmosphere I speak of, but they hardly effect one who is watching a completely unfocused story. I think that's the end of the line for Guillermo Del Toro in my book. I gave him one more big chance after three strikes, and he still couldn't quite cut it. Benicio Del Toro is a fine actor, but his brother should maybe work for a publishing company or something."

","This movie was by-far the most extraordinary movie I've seen to date. Although very graphic, its special effects and character flare were beyond reproach. This is a must-see movie; however, even though it's a fairy tale, it's not one I would recommend for children. This is, though, definitely one to see in the theater.<br/><br/>Without spoiling the film, I will say that it was filmed only in Spanish and contains subtitles, which only detract from the film in-that you must read when you know the scenes are phenomenally achieved. The fact that this film is set in near-post-WWII adds to the drama involved in the intertwined fairy tale. <br/><br/>Enjoy the film and take back a bit of fantasy as you leave the auditorium. ;-)"

","Because everyone else had waxed so euphoric over this film, I went with high expectations. However, though I enjoyed it, I did not find it to be as extraordinary as I was led to expect. For one thing, the Faun is an awkward and crude creation, with a mad hint of Muppet about him; perhaps my vision has been spoiled by the proliferation of special effects in recent decades. For another, the movie was so dark and claustrophobic (both in the fantasy scenes and in the ""real-life"" scenes) that it was almost a caricature. The young lead actress was excellent, as were all the actors. However, the story line with its noble Nationalists, sadistic captain, innocent child, and bed-ridden mother-to-be struck me as hackneyed. Perhaps I am betraying my age, and all this seems new to everyone else who sees it.<br/><br/>However, the acting is compelling and the savagery of the twisted Captain's acts (and the retribution exacted on him by the terrified, brave Mercedes) will stay with me for a long time."

Filmmaker Guillermo Del Toro's masterpiece fantasy cum political allegory is set against the WWII backdrop of Franco-era Spain, with a young girl (newcomer Baquero in a fantastic performance), who travels with her pregnant widowed mother (Gil) to be with her mother's new husband, a fascist Army captain (Lopez, a vile, evil second cousin to Ralph Fiennes in ""Schindler's List""), who only wants his new baby while ruling with an iron fist. The girl meanwhile discovers an enchanting yet forebodingly dark underworld of woodland creatures and fairies that beckon her as their long-lost princess to lead them into a new future together. Told with imagination beyond capabilities of lesser hands, Del Toro's unwavering originality is on par with his mentor David Cronenberg in his morality plays mixed with macabre and sprinkled with liberal gory violence."

Another innovative resources is the way that the camera travels to make transition, it's a fresh storytelling. The make up it's great, because it is not a beautiful character and you think that maybe he is evil, but you discover that the Captain is the real monster.

Sometimes the violence is overwhelming, but it should be, it's there to get it's point across, the make bad things seem very real in a fantasy world.

","Guillermo Del Toro's eighth feature length film and fifth in his native Spanish 'Laberinto del Fauno' (Pan's Labyrinth) is a highly entertaining visual masterpiece that should not be missed.<br/><br/>Set in 1944 during the Spanish Civil War, young and curious Ofelia (Baquero) moves with pregnant mother (Gil) to live with her wicked fascist stepfather Captain Vidal played excellently by Sergi Lopez. Here, Ofelia befriends 'Pan', a faun like creature claiming to be the gatekeeper of a magical land he believes Ofelia is the long lost princess of. To reclaim her throne, Ofelia must pass a series of challenges set by Pan to prove she is the princess. These challenges set against the backdrop of Vidals vicious regime, create a wonderfully contrasting world in which fantasy is far more comforting and inviting than the brutal reality experienced at the time.<br/><br/>Visually stunning and unapologetically gritty, Pans Labyrinth is an explosive combination of hard-hitting human violence and whimsical fantasy."

It is a film of many layers, for adults (only, not a children's film) it matches the hard reality of a very sad time, playing on your adult cynicism and understanding yet pairing it with a wish to believe, an allowance to be taken with the fantasy; you too want to escape Ofelia's and Spain's nightmare.<br/><br/>Yes it is violent, it's affectingly so because it's the violence of humanity and not fantasy. Some people will be disappointed and wish for some Eregon rubbish. The acting is second to none and I suppose my last comment is that it was SO refreshing to see a film with no CGI, that relied on true acting skills to pull it off. For me it did."

","I think that i've never seen a so beautiful movie throughout my life and admit that the last 15 minutes are all the most moving of the entire movie isn't an absurdity. It's such a mix of 2 tales, 2 movies in a one. The first, the main one that tells about a magical and fabulous world (in which only few people - mainly the children - are able to watch and watch further...)within nature, humans and strange creatures cohabit together in a thrilling and unexpected process to the final. Instead, the ""other movie"" tells about historical acts throughout the dark presence of the dictator Franco in the post civil war in Spain. The character of Ophelia and the Pan are simply wonderful. The child who plays Ophelia (I don't remember the name) is such dipped in the character and for many spectators she appears as an angel, a true princess due to rivers of tears. Some scenes are for me just legendary. First of all the one of the monster without face and with the eyeballs in his hands. The rest of the scene comprises also a full banquet of substantial fruits. The entire sequence lets me to remember a painting of Pieter Von Claesz, a great dutch master. But in adds i can mention the last sequence which that there is the little Ophelia in the kingdom of her father and of the celestial spheres. She looks herself as she is dressed and when she noticed to get red shoes at the feet a light begin to shine in her innocent eyes. Everything is filled up of joy, light and lyrical final claps.

","When going to see Pan's Labyrinth, I had already been told by critics it was the best film of the year, yet by the look of the plot, I found it hard to believe them. But from the beginning of the film, it is easy to see why it is regarded so highly. The true brilliance of the film is the emotions portrayed by the main characters, especially the young Ivana Baquero as the lead of Ofelia, that creates empathy and caring for the characters and the story, as well as Sergi Lopez as the ruthless Captain Vidal, who plays one of the most convincing, terrifying and most realistic villains I've ever seen in a film. The story is in itself a magnificent labyrinth, going places a Hollywood movie wouldn't dare. The film is beautiful in every way, from the cinematography and impressive visual effects that could rival big Hollywood studios, to the symbolism in the parallels of the fantasy and reality, to the raw yet subtle emotions portrayed. Pan's Labyrinth has its unique elements because it is the only film that has ever been able to mix a serious drama with fantasy successfully. It has a big enough budget with great production values to impress, but it has the sheer originality of an independent film reeking of genius. This is a true masterpiece that can easily withstand time, as it contains everything a masterpiece needs, and should be seen by all."
"rogerdarlington","Null","4","9","16 December 2006"," Fantastic fantasy
","This Spanish-language film is an utterly brilliant interweaving of two different tales from two totally different genres: one a story of the last stages of the Spanish Civil War in 1944 involving much violence and cruelty and the other a Gothic children's fantasy with various fantastical characters. What links the two narratives is the central personage of a young and brave girl called Ofelia (12 year old Ivana Baquero), the step-daughter of the brutal Spanish army captain (Sergi López) in the first story and the reincarnation of a lost underworld princess in the second.<br/><br/>This could so easily have been a ridiculous failure, but its stunning success is thanks to Mexican writer and director Guillermo del Toro who manages to make both tales both compelling and connected and, in the process, offers us some shocking characters - both human and fantasy - and many thought-provoking incidents and situations. He imbues the whole thing with washed-out colours and wonderful visual imagery. Del Toro has described the labyrinth as ""a metaphor for Spain in extreme right and left transition to where it is now"". This is most definitely not a film for children, but any adult who values innovative cinema will find this a rare treat."

"gsygsy","7","4","9","9 December 2006"," ambitious
","This is an ambitious movie. It yokes together two completely contrasting methods of story-telling, two totally different atmospheres. One is a very violent portrayal of a local battle between the two sides of the Spanish Civil War; the other is the imaginative response of a young girl to those same horrors, as she seeks not only refuge but also some kind of explanation in fantastic tales, in which she is cast in the principal role.<br/><br/>The trouble is that the political/historical story is also, of course, a fiction, no matter how typical or based on real events it may or may not be. In its own way it is as much a tale as the dazzling fantasy that the director puts before us. Nevertheless we are invited to look upon the historical plot somewhat differently - not least because ""real""characters often remind the young girl that she spends far too much time in the realm of childish stories, and that she should grow up and see the world as it is. <br/><br/>The means by which this real Spain is conveyed to the audience is by a violence so spectacularly nasty that, hardened movie goer though I am, I could barely look at some of it. And yet in at least one of the fantasy sequences there is a grizzly horror that is also hard to look at. So there is a blurring, either deliberate or accidental - perhaps the fantasy world can be seen as the projection of the violence the young girl senses at first but then is increasingly part of. There is certainly a blurring of distinctions between the two worlds.<br/><br/>This blurring is emphasised by two decisions. One is the portrayal of the principal male character, the fascist captain, as a vicious sadist, as immoral a villain as the giants or wolves of traditional fairy-tales,The other decision is the portrayal of his main antagonist, a brave freedom fighter, as his moral polar opposite, and who triumphs by means of a deus ex machina that seems quite as bizarre as Glinda the Good Witch turning up. And yet this world is supposed to be a real? Maybe the writer/director is making a point about what civil war is like. Maybe it's based on a real event that actually occurred: well, real events don't necessarily make good, believable fiction. Whatever the motivation for it, in the final analysis this blurring between the two stories weakens the story of the partisans. It makes them not quite believable, and therefore, for me, robs the daring end of the film of some power.<br/><br/>All that said, the movie is amazing to look at, is very well acted, and, providing you've got the stomach for the more vicious stuff, worth seeing. It's definitely worth supporting a film like this that aims high, even if it doesn't quite get there."
"The_Triad","6","4","9","28 November 2006"," Nice, but not great.
","Pan's Labyrinth was an interesting, beautiful film to look at (most of the time) but from a simple entertainment standpoint it was just a bit on the dull side. The film is set in Spain, against the backdrop of the Spanish civil war. A young girl goes to stay with her mother and her new stepfather, a one-dimensional fascist general.<br/><br/>The film succeeds on many levels, mainly from cinematography and effects standpoints. But fails (for me at least) to gain much interest into the characters involved. If the film had got me to care about the characters a bit more, it would have been a great movie, but as it stood, it just lacked that depth of character that it needed to push it into the next level, leaving me not to care too much about the fate of the characters, no matter how beautiful, or ugly their world became and the script, (or at least the English translation) was average at best. (take the first interrogation scene with the stuttering man for example.)<br/><br/>For anyone who has seen a Hayao Miyazaki movie, the notion of a young girl retreating into fantasy to escape her troubles is nothing new. And although Pan's Labyrinth might be a masterpiece in terms of cinematography and effects, it really should've tried more to investigate the characters rather than having a simple ""innocent young girl"" vs. ""murdering fascist general"" which was just a bit too simple."

","The high marks this movie has earned are well deserved on the technical side, but the real point of the whole thing seems to be yet another strong dose of ""eeeeevil fascists are ugly nasty beasts and yay for the poor, noble communists fighting to survive their reign of terror"" in our faces. Everything outside the labyrinth element of the movie is designed to convey that message, and that's the majority of the screen time.<br/><br/>This eye-rollingly one-sided presentation is the only way such topics are ever treated in the movies we see since WW2. It seems that the hot war ended but the propaganda war never did. Reality was rather different, so I have to dock the movie several points for that dishonesty."
"begob","5","3","6","31 August 2014"," Disappointing
","I think this is two fairy tales - one tells the story of the heroine's three tasks in Pan's labyrinth, and the other the fight between good communists and bad fascists. In the end the final task corresponds with the defeat of the fascists.<br/><br/>The production and acting are very good, the fantasy scenes are imaginative, and overall it's good to watch. The only violence I had problems with was the amputation scene - had to turn away. I had a problem with a couple of plot points- the heroine breaks the rules, which seems out of character for her + as a consequence Pan says the game's up, but then returns to give her another chance. The second bit does get resolved, but it bugged me.<br/><br/>The story's not really satisfying because it's a total fairy tale - no true insight for the audience. Plus it seems to me the heroine's completion of her fantasy tasks produces the kind of hierarchical system that the goodies have been fighting against in the other fairy tale. So that makes it politically naive.<br/><br/>I hadn't watched this before because it's subtitled + had a reputation for being weird. I wish it had been genuinely weird."
"Red-Barracuda","9","3","6","12 October 2012"," The definitive adult fairy tale
","Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth is set in the immediate aftermath of the Spanish Civil War. And it's no ordinary film. It's a highly original combination of war drama with pure phantasmagorical fantasy. Its central character is a young girl called Ofelia, quite brilliantly played by Ivana Baquero in one of the all-time great child performances. Ofelia follows her mother to a remote outpost where she joins her new husband, a sadistic army captain. Ofelia is a shy bookish girl who loves fairy stories. Almost immediately she discovers a parallel reality, an underground labyrinth presided over by a huge faun. This strange world is contrasted with her grim reality, a joyless world full of violence and hopelessness. Both realities merge for Ofelia and the fantasy world provides answers for her to take back to her real life.<br/><br/>This is perhaps the most definitive example of a fairy tale for adults. It's a story that combines great beauty with harsh ugliness. Its strong stuff that doesn't play things easy. It's emotionally pretty intense and will move most people who watch it more than most movies. The exceptionally talented cast of actors help cement the dramatic intensity. While, it benefits from the hand of a master visual storyteller like del Toro. Very few directors would have thought it obvious to tell this story in this way. But it's precisely this idea that elevates Pan's Labyrinth to such a high level. The serious drama benefits from the bizarre contrast provided by the fantasy and vice versa. They both bring out interesting aspects of each other and they both ultimately combine to devastating emotional effect by the end."

","The first time I watched this movie I was 11 years old. I came out of the movie theater terrified, yet amazed at the brilliance and beauty of the film. Since that day it has become one of my favorite movies of all time.<br/><br/>Everything in this movie is carefully thought out and crafted. The cinematography is not only gorgeous, but it also sets the mood for the movie perfectly and reinforces its main themes. The performance given by Ivana Baquero as Ofelia is heart braking and should have earned an Academy Award nomination. The way Guillermo del Toro directed this young actress was perfect. Sergi Lopes as Vidal gave one of the most chilling and terrifying performances to date. The character's cruelty and lack of empathy are very well portrayed by this Spanish actor.<br/><br/>Doug Jones as the faun gives an outstanding physical performance. Although another actor voices the faun, Doug Jones nails the physicality of the actor and creates the illusion that he is in fact speaking. Doug Jones's best performance in this film is as the Pale Man. Even with all the make up on, Doug grounds the character and makes him both terrifying and believable. The way it moves and walks is menacing and frightening. All the other members of the cast also have amazing performances that contribute to the brilliance of the film.<br/><br/>Along with Guillermo Navarro, the cinematographer, Guillermo del Toro portrays a brutal and cold vision of the world and the fascist era in Spain. They show the brutality of the war and set the mood with the beautiful blue colors in the night scenes. This film is one of the most beautifully shot films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a beautiful film that portrays the world in a cold and brutal way, but never without losing hope. It is Guillermo del Toro's best film to date and I would recommend it. I give it a 10/10 because of its beautiful cinematography, excellent story, amazing performances and of course the near perfect directing by Guillermo del Toro."

","""I wish that I made this film.""....my first thought after about 10 minutes of dead silence that followed last notes of end credits of Del Torro's masterpiece ""El Labirintho del Fauno"". I had been left speechless and in superpositive shock after watching this amazing piece of art. It's a waste of time saying that this is a visually perfect blend of Bunjuel style shots and Goya's black paintings, Gothic fairytale storytelling and revolutionary partizan movies, love and death, real and surreal....it's all been said already. Its pointless and of no matter at all for this film! The fact is that this is a uniform energy flow, piece of art that surpasses all separate arts that it's made of. It's an open road to the core of viewer's soul. In one word, truly a masterpiece! I just can't get one thing...?! How can this be made by a director that made films like Hellboy or Blade 2?!? What happened to him? The same question could be pointed to brothers Wachowski that made Matrix 2 and 3 after original Matrix. If Del Torro had that artistic potential, how come that he didn't use it before in his films? I guess an artist need luck and all stars to get together to create a masterpiece."
"BigBirdtheBum","10","3","6","27 February 2008"," Absolutely magnificent. My favourite film ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","Pan's Labyrinth This film in my opinion is the greatest film ever created. From a critical perspective this film is almost absolutely flawless. In ever aspect the film successfully gives the audience everything it could possible deem necessary. And may I add it was robbed of an Oscar!!!!! I could watch this beautiful artwork to the end of time and I would never ever become bored of it.<br/><br/>Every single thing I could possible list which makes a perfect film, is present in this masterpiece. The plot is excellent and original, and focuses on a young girl's quest to reveal her true identity in the midst of the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War. The plot is as I said just before original and is well written and paced and gets to the point in each scene. All the scenes in the film serve a purpose and not one of them is used as a filler to rack up a few extra minutes, which is a rarity in almost all films. Aside from having a flawless plot the characters in the film are well developed and distinguished from one another. Each character is rather unique and contributes a substantial amount to the story. The performances were excellent, despite the fact that these actors were relatively unknown outside Spain I felt happy in seeing them give wonderful and at times inspiring performances. Aside from acting the evil characters (Vidal and his officers) are accurately and successfully portrayed so that they portray the dark of the world where as other characters such as Mercedes and Ofelia provides the light of world. This essentially gives the film the perfect contrast that separates evil and good. It is such as shame that the film was criticized by many people on the basis that no character had a shade of grey. These people are completely ignorant as this was the entire purpose of the film- to show that there can be good in evil.<br/><br/>It is not only the characters that portray this contrast the plot does as well. The plot blends a violent reality with a beautiful and perfect fantasy world that the main character: Ofelia longs to be a part of. This type of filming will be very unique and intriguing to a large amount of audiences. The plot manages very well in keeping audiences engaged until the bitter end, which I must say is the most powerful and beautiful thing I have ever scene displayed on the big screen.<br/><br/>Another positive aspect of this film is the setting. And I must say the sets and cinematography are absolutely outstanding, some of the best I have ever scene. For example the scene early on in the film in which Ofelia confronts a faun (not a baby deer, the fantasy creature) the camera-work in it was absolutely outstanding. If I were to see such fantastic sets in real life I would say they were real. This outstanding cinematography is accompanied by outstanding makeup and magnificent visuals.<br/><br/>As with the sets, the fantasy creatures looked extremely realistic. One character the pale man, had astonishing make up that he looked like something out of a nightmare. The monster essentially looks like a man, but has pale white skin, very thin legs and eyes in his palms!!! This character was designed and executed with an excellent amount of care and skill.<br/><br/>The only thing I can possibly think of that is negative is the length. At around two hours I felt the film was a little too short. Although I am sure others can find criticism I simply cannot provide any other fault this masterpiece.<br/><br/>Summing up I would recommend this film for anyone. Whether they love or hate fantasy. However this film does contain some graphic violence, torture and emotion intensity that may disturb some viewers. I personally would not show this to a child below 13 years of age. Summing up this beautiful film receives a 9.8/10 for me. The highest rating I have every given a film. And one of the 6 films I have every given a 10, the others being; ""The Godfather Part 1"", ""The Godfather Part 2"" and finally the Lord of the Rings Trilogy."
"sharp-alissa","10","3","6","25 February 2008"," Wonderful movie...
","This movie is one of the best movies made. Even though it's completely in Spanish, it touches your heart as you cheer for Princess Moana as she makes her journey back to her homeland. It also keeps you guessing and if the Faun is good or bad. The director did an amazing job with all of the details, including lighting and angles of the camera. He also did a great job with including the continual inclusion of the number three. Three fairies, three keyholes, three chairs in the underworld (with the king, queen and Moana's chair).<br/><br/>I also must say that the creatures used were incredible. I'm quite partial to the creepy guy that Ophelia finds during her second task, the one that puts his eyes into his hands. I love him, the way he was designed was so cool. Not to mention the Faun...he was awesome, and his monologue about his name is one of my favorite monolouges ever. Not to mention the way that the fairies were desgined, that they were really bugs and could transform into the human/fairy shape. That was ingenious! The music to this movie was mindblowing, I love the lullaby that they play. And the script, flowed perfectly and you really got involved in these character's lives, could feel their emotions as if you were standing there in the middle of the action.<br/><br/>The ending was brilliant, especially because they showed you that she died in the beginning. And even though your happy for her, you cannot stop yourself from crying, because Mercedes doesn't know that she went on to become her old self once again.<br/><br/>All in all, I believe that every person should see this movie once they're old enough to understand it. It's powerful and touching and it'll leave you talking about it for years to come."

","Very disappointing. I went into this movie prepared to see a fantasy, not a violent war movie. Someone told me that it would rip my heart out in a good way. There was no heart ripping. Basically zero emotions were provoked. I have no clue why so many people love this movie so much and were effected by it to the degree that they described. The fairytale aspects of this movie were old, recycled ideas that I've heard so many times that it even came across as trite to me. The movie wasn't gripping in any way besides the fact that I kept waiting for that famed ""heart rip"" that would happen that never delivered. Another thing that I didn't like was the portrayal of Pan. I thought for the amount of money that went into imagery, they could have done a better job with that character.<br/><br/>6/10 for music, imagery,and the child actress, who was a remarkable actress and I'm looking forward to seeing her play in more roles, if that's where life takes her."

","A good surprise! When I decided to watch this film I didn't know very well what to expect, since I had heard it was about the fantasy world created by a little girl; I generally don't appreciate and don't use to watch ""enchanting stories"", but as this one won so many awards it called my attention, and I decided to give it a chance. I didn't regret! It's not really an ""enchanting story"", but one related to the cruel world where we live! That's what I found more deep and interesting in this film: its message! We can live in a world full of war, hate, violence, that there's always a place to fantasy and innocence! The character OFELIA is the proof of that! She lives in a place full of death, violence and stupidity but she can create her own personal world of fantasy, where she truly belongs <br/><br/>I really did appreciate the plot of this movie, more than its special effects; while at the beginning I would bet it would be the opposite! <br/><br/>The plot is very well constructed and clearly separates this cruel world where OFELIA lives and the world created in her own mind. I guess there are no cross points between them, what makes this story real and more interesting in my point of view. The background scenario to the plot  the communist resistance after the Spanish civil war  is also very well created. <br/><br/>The production and the special effects are great as expected, and the acting is very good too, especially by the main characters. CAPITAN VIDAL (played by Sergio Lopez) included! He's the typical cruel and inflexible fascist, but the actor did a nice job. <br/><br/>I liked it more than I was expecting!"
"abrighterview","10","3","6","2 January 2008"," Very Special (MINOR SPOILERS - no plot details but themes discussed)
","Rarely do I write reviews on IMDb but as the end credits music plays in the background I feel compelled to write one on this film.<br/><br/>Without any restraint I can say that this is one of the best films I have seen, I am very tempted to say the best. I'm struggling to bring my thoughts together at the moment, the last two hours have seemed to be much longer and I feel emotionally exhausted. The only word I can use at this moment is beautiful. This film shows artistic film making at its best and does so in a way that makes it very engaging and easy to follow, unlike other similarly philosophical and artistic films.<br/><br/>The film is essentially an extremely powerful representation of the Spanish Civil War - my knowledge on this subject is very limited, in fact all I know of the brutality of the war is from Hemmingway's 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' and I do believe that had I not read this novel I would have appreciated this film (slightly) less. The central theme appears to be the unnecessary blood-shed and slaughter of innocence/innocents in many different senses.<br/><br/>This is a two hour emotional roller-coaster with excellent character development and milestones in the plot that arise and stop you as though you've walked into a wall - all of this leads to a devastatingly effective and provocative climax.<br/><br/>I'd love to write a more comprehensive and definitive review on this but frankly it would have to be a lengthy essay. All I can say is if you haven't watched it and you want to see what could and should be remembered as one of the greatest films of our time, maybe of all time, watch this. If you want to watch a captivating and not-too-taxing film, watch this. If you want to be moved and provoked, watch this."

","This interweaves a dark children's fairytale with an simple adult war story and the effect does leave you wondering why bother merging them? The cynical answer is that neither story is good enough or substantial enough to stand on it's own!<br/><br/>The stories are both quite simple with very little dialogue. <br/><br/>The fairytale is a very old-fashioned story of a lost fairy princess trying to regain her throne and is done well although I had heard before watching it that it was visually stunning and was a little disappointed that it isn't, it is visually interesting but certainly not stunning.<br/><br/>The war story is also nothing new, a vicious soldier trying to hunt down the rebels while there are spies in his camp.<br/><br/>The only original thing in the film is the mixing of the two stories and this is done very well with dark scenes in reality being played on top of dark fantasy scenes and the mounting desperation of Ofelia to escape her life.<br/><br/>The acting is good with Baquero causing none of the annoyances that often occur when children star in adult films, the rest of the cast deliver good performances keeping you interested and giving some depth to the war story.<br/><br/>The ending is surprising and consistent although with a little compromise to the dark theme of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The problem is that the film is insubstantial, neither story line is memorable on it's own and joining them doesn't do enough to raise the film above the level of a curiosity.

"darthheimdall","10","3","6","15 December 2007"," An innovative blend of fantasy and reality
","There is a rare class of movies that get better every time you watch them. Pan's Labryinth is one of those films. After viewing it the second time, I love it even more than when I first saw it in the theatre.<br/><br/>There are two plots that are woven together. The first is about Ofelia, a young girl who embarks on a quest to return to her kingdom in the underworld by a mysterious Faun. The second is about her nurse Mercedes, and her quest to dispose Ofelia's Fascist stepfather, Captain Vidal. Ivanna Baquero, in spite of her young age, can act circles around many of Hollywood's best in her role as Ofelia, coming across as a mature but still imaginative young girl who must deal with a cruel stepfather, a civil war, and a dying pregnant mother on top of a dangerous quest for immortality. Mercedes is excellent as she spends day after day serving her fascist master so that she can gather intelligence and supplies for her brother and his freedom fighters. Captain Vidal is a cool, sadistic villain, while still sympathetic in his concern for his unborn son. The doctor, while pessimistic about overthrowing the fascists, does the right thing in aiding Mercedes against them. Overall, this movie is a perfect blend of fantasy and reality, and would be enjoyable even to those who stopped believing in fairy tales when they were ten. As both plots combine into a tragic but optimistic story, so do the genres of war and fantasy combine in this film to create a dark but excellent movie."
"rmax304823","7","3","6","20 August 2007"," Dorothy on a Drastic Bummer.
","The film had enough hype behind it that I settled in to watch it. In the first ten minutes I was considering watching an Agatha Christie mystery instead. At the end of fifteen minutes it had me and I couldn't get away.<br/><br/>Ofelia, who should know better at fourteen, has childhood fantasies about fairies and fauns and monsters and magic cures. She lives in Spain in 1944. Her mother is having a troubled pregnancy and her stepfather is a sadistic murdering brute who represents General Franco. There a lot of special effects in the first ten minutes or so. A fairy visits her and beckons her into a labyrinth, at the bottom of which is a faun who gives her three scary tasks. She completes the first one okay -- feeding stones to a giant toad. She flunks the second, but, given a last chance, she succeeds at the third, which means giving her life for the life of her infant brother. She ascends into heaven and sitteth at the right hand of her long-gone real father, and the left hand of her newly deceased mother.<br/><br/>What turned me off were those special effects. First of all, the fairy that visits her in her bedroom, the first time, is not my idea of a fairy. The fairy starts of fluttering around the room and making an ominous crackling sound. The first time Ofelia sees it, it looks like a cross between a stick insect and a praying mantis. I don't know if the producers intended it that way but the thing made my skin crawl. Ditto for the ""faun."" This is the least pettable faun in your collective unconscious. A stone statue creaks into life and turns into this hideous, demonic creature with monster ram horns, a thoroughly screwed up face, long pointy fingernails, hooves and whatnot. It speaks in a slow raspy voice that sounds as if it's lying with every phoneme. If that's the best fantasy she can come up with, she needs to get into Deepak Chopra or something. Gave me the willies.<br/><br/>At that, it may be an improvement over the real world she lives in, a story that saves the film in my estimation. All these Spanish folks are just trying to get along, see, except for Franco's soldiers, of which Ofelia's stepfather is one. He has a nasty habit of going around shooting people, including, in the end, the young girl. He does it without passion, without remorse, even when the victims turn out to be innocent. Sometimes, I guess out of boredom, he allows a doomed prisoner to try brushing away the muzzle a few times before he finally pulls the trigger. On the other side are the communist peasants who live in the hills. They're the good guys and see to it that the stepfather pays for his sins.<br/><br/>The special effects were overdone. It's as if they'd been designed by somebody on shrooms. Many of the fantasy creatures are covered with the glutinous substance that sticks to everything, and the sound people have made it sound as if someone is stirring a pot of molasses with a wooden spoon. It would have been a better film if the effects had been turned down a little bit. They seem intended to dazzle rather than convince, but the only people who will be dazzled would be children who haven't played video games or watched crummy monster movies. The effects are even overdone during the real-life story, as when the stepfather sews up his own slashed cheek. He didn't need to do that. First, he could have called the company medic who would have done a better job. Second, we've already witnessed this scene when Arnold Schwarzenegger plucks out his own eyeball in ""The Terminator."" It's not shocking. It's self indulgent.<br/><br/>But, the CGI aside, it's an innovative movie. There have been other Spanish films about kids' fantasies (""The Spirit of the Hive"") but this one is livelier and truly gripping. A person who has just been shot isn't yanked backwards like a marionette, the cliché treatment. He may hardly notice it at first, pause to remove his glasses, before slumping. The director will sometimes cut while a foreground object, such as a tree trunk, interrupts the flow of the images. And more than once there are other people witnessing a scene but they are hidden from us until someone waves aside the obscuring object, which may be an open umbrella. The shocks are effective and more subtle than anything in the fantasies. The movie really does resemble ""The Wizard of Oz"" played as tragedy. We even get a pair of Ofelia's red shoes. The ending, of course, is a cop out unless you can believe, as some do, that fantasy life continues after we expire. And the good peasants didn't win, as they seem to in the movie. Instead, Franco lived on to a ripe old age and the baton was passed to his son. The film will break your heart, but it's a nice fantasy."

","PAN'S LABYRINTH is a mystery cloaked in the garb of a fairy tale for adults. It is an examination of the cruelty of the Civil War in Spain as Franco assumed prominence and the extent to which some people would resist or escape: one of those means of escape just happens to be fantasy. Writer/Director Guillermo del Toro proves his potential as one of the more important experimental filmmakers with this haunting, mesmerizing tale of a young girl's ability to cope with the world into which she is plunged.<br/><br/>Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is the eleven year old daughter of Carmen (Adriana Gil) whom we first meet as the mother and daughter move to the deserted mill to live with Carmen's sadistic and brutal new husband, Falangist Capitán Vidal (Sergi López). Carmen is pregnant with Vidal's child and upon her arrival she is ordered to bed attended by the housekeeper Mercedes (Maribel Verdú). Ofelia is frightened by Vidal and his cruel world and by the deteriorating condition of her very pregnant mother and follows a strange insect that leads her to a secret opening into a labyrinth. Her curiosity and desperation to find a better place leads to her discovery of an entirely different world beneath the ground, a world run by the Faun (Doug Jones) who gives Ofelia three tasks that will assist her in making her world above ground a better place. Ofelia must choose between the ever increasing terror surrounding her new home with Vidal and his heinous behavior and overcome the fear of the grotesque but fascinating world of Pan's Labyrinth: the story ends with the manner in which a child must face the realities of the failure of the adult world and find successful solutions - whether those solutions be reality or fantasy.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro has chosen a superb cast of actors, extraordinary visual effects technicians, cinematographer Guillermo Navarro and music composer Javier Navarrete to create this magical tale. The film becomes one of the finest examples of the use of fantasy in an historical setting. It is bound to become a classic. Grady Harp"
"reject5467","10","3","6","21 May 2007"," ""School Critique of Pan's Labyrinth""
","Pan's Labyrinth is an excellent view into the rarely seen ""R-rated"" fairy tale genre. Writer, Director, and Co-Producer, Guillermo Del Toro, delivers a picture in which those who view it must be smart enough to relate it to their own human nature. To be able to understand this film viewers need to draw from previous experience, and leave all previous ideas about the film behind.<br/><br/>Guillermo Del Toro was able to take his vision of Pan's Labyrinth as far as he wanted it to go because as writer and director, he didn't need to stay to someone else's vision he was able to change anything about any aspect of the film at any point.<br/><br/>The lighting used in Pan's Labyrinth separates the two worlds that Ofelia (main character) travels between. Her real world is filled with cold colors, blues, and greens. The harsh reality of the living with Vidal (her new stepfather, and the Captain of the military regiment) along with his troops make the viewer relate to Ofelia obvious depression while in it. The fantasy world is overflowing with crimsons, golds, browns, and yellows. Creating a ""womblike"" feel says Del Toro. An example of creative lighting is in the scene in which the rebels attack the mill held by the Spanish Military. During shooting Spain had a record dry spell so there was no fire allowed. They needed to create big explosion so they used ""dirt and cork and a festival of lights on dimmers"" says Guillermo Navarro, the Director of Photography. <br/><br/>Sounds used in Pan's Labyrinth were focused more on verbal appeal than musical. Being a Spanish film the language is gentle to the ear. Much of the music is played very low in the background to break the silence. But mainly the dialogue between the characters is good enough to keep the viewer interested without needing music to keep their focus.<br/><br/>The costume design in Pan's Labyrinth is accurate in displaying the time period in which the story takes place. In Ofelia's real world the costume design is mainly military garb and. The Spanish military wears their standard uniform. While the rebels wear their battle weary uniform, which have basically become rags after so much fighting. This displays the struggle that they are being forced to deal with. Ofelia and the other non-military characters wear traditional civilian clothing. During a dinner that Captain Vidal host many Aristocratic people come that seem to be wearing very elaborate and expensive clothing.<br/><br/>In Ofelia's fantasy world the costumes are very extravagant. The two most memorable costumes are the Faun and the Pale Man. Pan's (the Faun's) costume is very detailed. The first time the viewer sees Pan he could be mistaken for a tree because of some of the plants that seem to be growing on him. The actor in the suit had his legs edited out via green-screen to make it seem that Pan's knee bend in the opposite direction (backward). The Pale man's costume was very eerie. The concept is very strange for this costume. Having eyes in his hands creates a very menacing looking character. When a regular person puts their hands on their faces in that matter most viewers think of playing with children thus the fairy tale aspect is the story, but this character takes that idea and tosses it out of the window. The final costume designs of the fantasy world are when she finally meets her real father. They are stunning crimson and gold robes, that blend nicely with the golden background creating an expansive look to them. Ofelia's, costumes are mainly her real world clothing thus creating a contrast between her and her imaginary world.<br/><br/>There were not many special effects used in Pan's Labyrinth. The only stand out special effect was a giant frog in which Ofelia encounters under the big tree. This was one of the few parts of the movie that I didn't enjoy because the frog looked way to fake. It looked like it was just copied and pasted into the film, without any type of blend done to make it look more realistic.<br/><br/>I believe that Pan's Labyrinth is a very well made film. Almost every aspect of this film makes a competent viewer think and view it as apart of there own lives. I highly recommend this film for anyone who truly appreciates good film."

","I never really fell into the group of people hyped up for this film, I thought it looked good but too phony and fantasy like not too mention i thought it might turn out like Narnia.Pan's Labyrinth is however one of the best epic fantasy films ever made right up there with Lord Of The Rings, and King Kong in terms of cinematic perfection.The film is not a complete fantasy world like the previews portray it as it is only on consistent occasion that the main character Ophelia enters the world of the Labyrinth where most of the film takes place in the real world on a military base.The film has extremely surprising and violent content and is definitely not a fantasy film for children so for those thinking this will be anything close to Harry Potter, Narnia, or Eragon think again before taking your child to see this relentlessly gory yet artistically beautiful film.If any of you are gamers and have played Resident Evil 4 you'll know of the eerie creatures and hauntingly beautiful settings such as enormous corridors and eerie rooms and a certain scene in Pan's Labyrinth will definitely remind you of what made Resident Evil 4 such a great game to look at.Speaking of visual style the movie does one of the most fantastic jobs at creating a beautiful fantasy world without anything looking cheesy or fake.The CGI is masterful and is probably the best and most realistic use of CGI since King Kong while the props and costumes for the majority of the creates make them feel much more real.The movie does a good job of emotionally drawing you to certain characters and hating other characters so when certain things happen to them you are devastated or extremely happy so the movie does a perfect job in terms of character development and getting you into the film to root for who it wants you to root for.The gore and violence is realistic, stylized, and intense and the blood effects are absolutely amazing, they don't look the very least bit fake.The storyline moves along at a pretty good pace it gets slow very rarely as the action is spaced out well over the course of the movie.In one word i would describe Pan's Labyrinth as ""Epic"".Guillermo Del Toro i've always felt was overrated as i enjoyed Blade 2 and Hellboy but not to the point of thinking ""hey the new Del Toro films out it's gotta be good"" now i see the talent everybody is talking about.Very well done by the entire production it deserved the 3 Academy Awards it received and undeniably should have won the Academy Award for best score over An Inconveniant Truth.This movie is an epic masterpiece i now look forward to Del Toro's work."
"Thunderbuck","10","3","6","20 May 2007"," Brutal... magical... powerful
","When I went to rent this film the clerk was sure to advise me: ""You know this is Spanish with English subtitles, right?"" I told her I already knew that. ""Okay, just that I've had some people return it."" So there's my first piece of advice for watching this movie; yes, it's subtitled. You're going to have to actually read the dialogue.<br/><br/>Second piece of advice: don't equate ""fantasy"" with ""suitable for children"" and ignore this film's R rating. It earns that rating honestly with some VERY graphic violence.<br/><br/>Given those two caveats, PAN'S LABYRINTH is a spectacularly original, heartbreakingly beautiful movie. There's a temptation to veer into movie-geek talk about how it speaks ""to the human condition"" and how it ""demonstrates the triumph of imagination over pain"", but I'd rather comment on how it just makes a fantastic, entertaining story.<br/><br/>This movie is just as much thriller as it is fantasy as it is tear-jerker. The power of PAN'S LABYRINTH is that its characters are at once familiar and well-drawn.<br/><br/>The film occupies two worlds: a remote army encampment in Fascist 1944 Spain and the magical second-life of pre-teen Ofelia, the stepdaughter of the camp's captain. Neither of these worlds is presented with any compromise. The Captain (Sergi López) is clearly brutal and not-so-clearly insecure, constantly aware of the memory of his father, a General killed in battle.<br/><br/>Ofelia's (Ivana Baquero) escape from her hated stepfather is a world of faeries and fauns, rendered seamlessly. This is as beautiful an application of digital effects as I've seen in any film. The creatures are original--at times terrifying--and constantly amazing.<br/><br/>A word on the violence of this movie. It is absolutely necessary to the story, and the film's emotional power would have been diluted without it. I would not show this movie to my children, but as an adult I appreciate Del Toro's trust in his audience. PAN'S LABYRINTH is my new prime example of how graphic violence CAN serve a story.<br/><br/>Yes, PAN'S LABYRINTH is brutally violent, and, yes, it is subtitled. Given those conditions, I recommend it highly. If you watch only one ""foreign"" film in your life, make it this one."
"lee3993","10","3","6","20 May 2007"," Pan's Labyrinth : A-MAZE-ZING
","I finally saw ""Pan's Labyrinth"" for the first time recently on DVD. I was hesitant to see it at the movies because I knew I would have to read subtitles, which usually means I could miss some very important dialog if I didn't pay close attention. What was I waiting for!!! I must say that it is easily the best foreign language film I have ever seen. Reading subtitles has never been so much fun. Movies of this caliber usually come around once in a generation. And after ""Lord of the Rings"", I was sure that it would be 20 years before I would see another film as entertaining as this one. Although I am not a big fan of foreign language films, I was totally amazed at the magical storytelling and visual feasts displayed here. Although the film is rated R, it does not contain any drug content or sex scenes, even though the violence is quite graphic at times. I would recommend it for the whole family, but with parental guidance for the youngest minds. ""Pan's Labyrinth is one of the best movies ever made. Without a doubt, this film is an instant classic, on par with other classics of the genre like ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Lord of the Rings"", and ""Star Wars"". Don't miss it!!!"
"Penelope_Sparrow","10","3","6","20 May 2007"," A Magical Treasure
","As a lover of movies, particularly of the fantasy genre, Pan's Labyrinth sent me on a journey that I will not soon forget. Though people who are not familiar with the Spanish language may be turned off by the subtitles, you should not let that small fact ruin this experience for you. It does not take away from it one bit. In fact, it gives it a little something extra, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Not only are the special effects breath taking, but each actor delivers an amazing performance. Particularly that of Ivana Baquera, who has undoubtedly earned herself high status in Hollywood for her portrayal of the young Ofelia.<br/><br/>I cannot say too much more, for fear of spoiling a wonderful tale that all should experience for themselves, but I can say this: Watch Pan's Labyrinth. You will not regret it."
"BeLyt","10","3","6","18 May 2007"," Darkly Beautiful
","This movie doesn't try to dance around the despair and pain of war, yet it brings forward reasons to hope as well. The effects were exceptional, although gory at times and may not be appropriate for young children. Everyone appeared to be very well cast. I think watching this movie in Spanish with English subtitles added depth to the characters as well as gave the opportunity to not miss a word. A beautiful, dark, suspenseful film with touches of light and hope. The young woman who played Ofelia (appropriate name for a magical movie) was heart-breaking in her role. A movie to recommend for people interested in myths and faerie, as well as history."
"jaybob","10","3","6","16 May 2007"," one of the best
","Pan's Labrynth is without a doubt of one best films of 2006. It did receive 3 Oscars, It deserved more.<br/><br/>This is a harrowing, somber tale mixing both Science Fiction animation & real life drama.<br/><br/>The setting is a forest in Spain during World War 2. A troop of soldiers led by a very sadistic Captain (Serge Lopez is superb in this role.) His pregnant wife is about to deliver a child, where-in lies the rest of the story<br/><br/>Also he has a 11 year old step-daughter enchantingly portrayed by Ariadna Gil, who finds a magical land in the forest, She also finds a faun (enacted by Doug Jones--he also portrays another character later on in the film). I cannot divulge more about these scenes. Add to the mix a housekeeper played by Ivana Baquerro,who is in sympathy with both Carmen & with the rebels.<br/><br/>ALL 3 should have been nominated for Oscars.<br/><br/>The writer/director Guiillermo Del Toro was nominated.<br/><br/>It was a shame the Hollywood could not pick a NON_ENGLISH film as one of the top 5 of the year.<br/><br/>Very rarely has Hollywood done this. PAN'S LABRYNTH is way superior to the 2 past films nominated GRAND ILLUSION & Z.<br/><br/>I do not this there were any other non-English films nominated for outstanding film.Granted there is a separate award for these movies & are eligible for all other Oscars & have been nominated & won many times. BUT they do not get nominated or win the big one.<br/><br/>NOTE: This is a harrowing grim movie,It definitely is not for children under 13-14 years old. Besides being too mature there is little action or humour in this film.<br/><br/>It is rather for adults who enjoy superb drama mixed with some science -ficton.. These two elements blend perfectly.<br/><br/>The acting by all is superb, the production credits are excellent.<br/><br/>Ratings **** (out of 4) 99 points (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out if 10)"
"Bosco-HK","10","3","6","15 May 2007"," Very talented actors and actresses indeed
","This is an extremely enjoyable movie, I must put it out there! 'Who would believe a turning teenager who still reads fairy tales that says that there are such magical wonderful creatures like fairies and other creatures of the woods?' -ignore the grammar- Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) played an amazing role as the daughter of Carmen Vidal (Ariadna Gil), of course her Princess Moanna role, and the older sister of the newborn child. She was amazingly brave throughout every task, the crawling and meeting of the Toad, and of course the last scene is truly without words -Everytime I type the name Ofelia, I begin to get the reenactment of the last scene, it's pretty mind blowing-. She even played the real life role of a young teenager, 'always curious and never obeys', so she decides to check something out of the huge feast on the long table. When the little fairy friends told her not to do so, during that entire scene, I was like speaking out for the fairies: ""No, no, no... young lady, put that back down.."", ""No, you must not, remember the rules.."", ""Oh no, see what you've done!"" and so on... And Ofelia: ""Go away."", ""Shoo..."", ""Be gone."" ""I don't care.""... and so on..<br/><br/>And then I went ""Oh no, you're in deep trouble now..."" As for the commander, 'step'-father of Ofelia, Cpt. Vidal (Sergi López), he was extremely strict and cruel. I felt really bad when he reprimanded Ofelia in such ways several times, and not forgetting the last scene where he actually shoots a 'little girl' aka Ofelia -not to say that Ivana is little- but compared to whom he fought against, those were men opposing his ways, such as following order from the supreme.<br/><br/>All the other actors were good too, including the Doctor, Dr. Ferreiro(Álex Angulo), who stood in between helping both sides, and not forgetting Mercedes (Maribel Verdú) who I believe is a very caring and wonderful person. At the very end, she weeped painfully -like as if she was her real mother- for Ofelia, a girl unimaginably kindhearted and trustworthy who did not spill her identity, one who she couldn't save!<br/><br/>I recommend this movie for all who have read fairy tales and I believe you will be inspired to believe that there are those who believe that they exist -I'll say let Ofelia (Ivana) who played her so well, tell you about 'em-."
"ffac06","10","3","6","15 May 2007"," Best movie of the decade.
","This is the best movie I have seen in a long time. This movie teaches a lot about morals and motivation. All of the characters are superbly acted, with the captain being (IMO) the best. He is supposed to be a self-centered, cruel killer, and that is exactly how he shows up. The scene where he is at his highest, though it sounds horrible to say it, is the torture scene. You can see him making small talk about the tools, and he acts through during the whole scene. Also, at the end, when he hands the baby over to Mercedes, you can tell that Vidal is really getting into the speech. It left me wondering if he had perhaps been planning for this, and had the speech memorized. He also looked so shocked and disappointed when Mercedes said that the baby wouldn't even know who his father was.<br/><br/>The part that struck me the hardest, though, was Ofelia's ultimate sacrifice. She could have done so many things to get into the Underworld easily, like drawing her brother's blood herself, or simply letting the faun have him. Instead, she remained devoted to her brother, and got shot as a result. This is the biggest moral of the story, and is even the tag-line.<br/><br/>While some may say that this isn't a good movie for younger people, I disagree. This would be a great thing to show to teenagers, from fourteen up, about how the world isn't all fun and games. NOTE: If you are going to watch this, use the subtitles and leave the original Spanish on. It is worth reading."
"soniaandree","10","3","6","3 April 2007"," A child's fairytale.
","This movie, like all fairy tales, is actually dark and beautiful, mixing the real world with the imaginary one, the tale of a young girl looking to escape reality for another fantastic dimension. British viewers said the movie was gore, which it isn't, based on all the horror/thriller movies I may have seen since the 80s. In fact, the general public thought about this movie as a dark fantasy, a darker version of the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" perhaps, but they were wrong in that this movie wasn't made for British people who go to artsy international cinema, cocooned by the idea that ""art"" can be an excuse for all sorts. As a viewer, I would say that what was disturbing was that you can feel a certain unease in the main character's life experience, maybe because fairy tales do take chunks of real life and exaggerate them until you realise you can't stand it anymore. Consequently, the movie, far from being the usual dark fantasy anyone was expecting, turns out to be a real psychological eye-opener to the world of children and their monsters. Highly recommended viewing."

","Pan's Labyrinth tells the tale of young Ofelia, who is stepdaughter to a fascist Captain in 1944. When she strays off into the forest near her new-found home she discovers a dark, eerie, fantasy world.<br/><br/>Visually, this movie is stunning. I was surprised that a movie outside the U.S. could produce such an amazing use of special effects and cgi, easily comparable and more-often BETTER than ANYTHING the U.S. coughed up that year. This movie truly pulls you in to it's fantastic world and does not let you leave and it's plot is enchanting and captivating. But this is far, far away from some children's fantasy, the movie is 18's for a reason. It's violent and truly brutal at times, leading to some very squeamish moments. This combination of violence, dark themes and fantasy is rare in the mainstream cinema, making this film a breath of fresh air and quite unique.<br/><br/>The fact that it is in Spanish can't be taken as a negative element, I for one hardly noticed due to the fact that I was so enthralled in the movie itself and it really portrayed how ridiculous award ceremonies such as The Oscars are, that simply because of the language this (far superior) movie couldn't contend against movies like 'Little Miss Sunshine' for Best Film.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this, BELIEVE the critics view on this, it truly is an amazing movie and like all amazing movies, it is not simply about the story irt offers, but delves far more into underlying themes than a first watch might suggest.

"Donnellson","10","3","6","21 March 2007"," Few Movies Resonate
","This is a stroke of brilliance by Guillermo del Toro-- the brilliance comes into play with how he has intricately woven the Parallel Journeys of the unconscious and conscious mind.<br/><br/>It is a parable of moral choices versus blind obedience juxtaposed with the symbols of mythology and religion without getting lost in specific perceptions. The parable is told from the POV of fantasy being the reality. It is the test of what one believes even though it cannot be seena Rorschach Test.<br/><br/>The metaphor of War represents the inner conflict of those that do not hold true to their beliefs practice blind obedience and fear death  while living out their lives as if they're immortal and the monster of mortality called death is held at bay in their unhappy struggle.<br/><br/>Life is violent, cruel and full of tricksters that can change your world and unsettle your psyche in a moment. Few movies resonate to the extent that Pan does. Yes, it is the age old morality tale that evil will not go unpunished. But then you have missed the symbolism that unlocks the door to the pathwayparticularly the one that leads you to the Blue Rose."
"pepenet23","10","3","6","20 March 2007"," A story about Spain
","Some Mexicans, only some are as well versed in Spanish history as Americans are on British history; usually those of us whose grandparents were Spanish and lived that period of time in Spain. I don't know much about the director's relation to Spain, and he might even rebuttal my interpretation on his work. What I see in this fairy tale is the recent history of a country that went through a most traumatic period in time. The Spanish civil war lasted from 1936 to 1939 (a brutal prelude of what WWII was to be like). This came after of almost a century of continuous downfall from what was once the most powerful empire for almost 300 years. Napoleon's occupation of the peninsula, the loss of its colonies, the Spanish American war, were more calamities its pride could take. Through disappointment of its traditional institutions Monarchy, Church and Military- many hasten the country to radical swift changes towards the left. This caused the right to react with overwhelming violence. Franco's Nationalists after defeating the Republican side composed of democrats, socialists, communists, laics, etc.- wisely kept his distance to his old Axis friends during the World War but convinced allied victors he wound be a useful ally against the communist during the coming cold war, the nationalists survived as a regime until the death of the generalissimo in 1975. A process of democratization was begun under King Juan Carlos I. Back to our story the princess is attracted to a new light and world, like Spain is to the 20th century modern dogmas promises of a better society. But the brightness blinds her and she forgets who she really is. The war has blinded Spaniards and they've forgotten the fact they are brothers & sisters. The emotionless scenes where both sides make sure fallen enemies are truly dead by shooting them again and not taking prisoners, if only to torture them, states the sort of hatred the country has fallen into. It is wishful thinking that a rebel group would actually defeat a government force. One cannot see this as a reality fact but a metaphoric result of what will come eventually to Spain. Liberty and democracy will return, but it's not the freedom fighters who will do this, they were actually defeated or migrated elsewhere, but Captain Vidal surrendering his son to the freedom defenders hints us what truly comes to happened, it's the children of the phalanges who restore democracy in the end when Franco died. They brought back the wishes of their fathers' enemies, a fairer and more just society. The return of Ofelia (Spain) to her kingdom can only occur with her death first. Mercedes morning for Ofelia, indicates that a unbearably long while will pass by. All who fought would have died before the new blood can rebuild the realm. The young offspring must not know if their fathers where nationalist or republicans for the future to work for them. Middle East hatred has endured because Jews, Muslims and even Christians know very well who they are. Ofelia's refusal to sacrifice her brother is Spain's hope in the future even if that means it will have to endure uncertain fate and the cruelty of the fascists and even death. Death is pretty much present in this story because a fact is so many did die, to many, to a point where it's death that taught everyone a better way had to be found. A lesson many learned but many forgot. If ever the return of a King Arthur, a Flower of Scotland, a Quetzalcoatl happened to someone it turned true for Spain."

","What's a heartbreaking fairy tale! It's definitely one of the best films of 2006, I'm so pleased it won 3 Oscars a few weeks ago, and as I also love ""The Lives Of Others"", so I'm not so shocked by its winning best foreign film over ""Pan's Labyrith"", and as a matter of fact, that's the perfect result.<br/><br/>Since this film has been so popular these days, i will just skip the scenario and say something after watching it for 2 times, I hardly watch a film more than once in such a short interval while I have so many films to watch and too little time to finish this mission-impossible.<br/><br/>As the scenes are changing between the real cruel revolution war and imaginary fantasy world, that's to say, really a tough task for the photography, and this movie rocks because it's perfectly well done at this aspect. Also the amazing visual effects of the mythical parts, totally stunning! The portrait of characters is also worthing acclaim, especially for Sergi Lopez as the sinister Captain, Sergi shines in every scene he is in, his cocky arrogance and brutal deviltries are vivid enough to leave a deep impression in my heart. And I also find Maribel Verbu stands out as a strong, righteous undercover maid, she is aging so severely compared to in ""And Your Mother Too"", perhaps it's the makeup and the rugged clothes she wears. But a very powerful performance! Besides, the young new actress Ivana Baquero also gives a decent performance as the innocent girl.<br/><br/>And one annoying thing in the plot is that the little girl cannot resist the lure of delicious grapes even she is warned before, I know it's maybe hard to make it plausible, and it's just the need for the storyline, I think this is quite a big flaw there and really bothers me, if not for that, I will give it a 10/10 rating.<br/><br/>In my deep heart I am a pessimistic person and lack of confidence, I feel terribly sorry for the ending, not because I don't believe in fairy tales, but I cannot get rid of the shadows of death that occupies all over my mind. In a world like today, really hard for me to be cheered up, this film teach us some different way of regarding life and the world, see the bright side and meantime don't forget the dark one, this could the perfect dilemma for human beings to handle with and enjoy it. Live in pain but happily! Suddenly a strange signal came through my mind, I should watch ""Borat"" sometime! Omg, this has never occurred to me before!"

","It is very rare in this day and age to experience a film that stirs so many emotions in someone at the same time. Thank goodness we have Guillermo Del Toro to fulfill this task.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie only skims the surface of how fantastic it is. In truth, fantasy does not play as much of a part as the previews would let on-only about 20-30 minutes are devoted to the fantasy world of the Labyrinth. Still, it manages to be an icredible fantasy while at the same time being an absolutely amazing film at the same time.<br/><br/>The prevalent theme of the film is the effects of war, especially on a child who is surronded by it.<br/><br/>Every aspect of the film is beautiful-the cinematography, sets, and art design are all phenomenal. It sets a darker tone that brings all sorts of incredible emotions.<br/><br/>The score of the film is, in my opinion, one of the best in years and years.

","Wild, strange, brutal, beautiful and memorable. It is impossible to sum up the multi-faceted Pan's Labyrinth in a few sentences ... but I'll do my best.<br/><br/>Spain, 1944. The Civil War is over and Franco's army are occupied in hunting down and killing the rebels still in hiding in the countryside. Into this volatile situation come young Ofelia, and her frail, heavily-pregnant mother Carmen. Married to Captain Vidal of the Fascist Army, it is evident that Carmen hopes her marriage will provide security and stability for herself and her daughter. But Vidal is sadistic and unfeeling, concerned only about the son he is sure Carmen is carrying. Moreover, with the rebels getting ready to launch an attack on his outpost, Vidal is quickly losing whatever vestiges of humanity remain within him and is becoming more beast than man in his brutality, something Carmen refuses to see but which Ofelia is acutely aware of.<br/><br/>Cut off from the world, her only ally the housekeeper Mercedes (who is secretly passing information to the rebels) Ofelia gains a chance at escape when, in a ruined labyrinth behind her new abode, she encounters a Faun, who tells her she is a long-lost princess from an underground kingdom that knows neither sickness nor pain. To return to it, she must complete three seemingly simple tasks before the next full moon ... but as Mercedes tells her, she must be wary of the Faun and what he is asking her to do ...<br/><br/>None of this does justice to the sheer wonder of Del Toro's vision. It is often violent (shockingly so - a man is stabbed in the face with a bottle within the first half-hour, the results of one of Vidal's torture sessions are graphically displayed and Vidal himself suffers terrible injuries at the hands of Mercedes) dark, bloody, brutal and yet wildly imaginative. My absolute favourite moment is when Ofelia comes face to face with the Pale Man - a horrific being worthy of Goya and Bosch. Be warned, this inspires genuine fear! Nor does it sum up the many themes embodied within the work ... but suffice it to say, watch this, no matter how dark or scary. Your imagination will be the richer for it."

","Pans Labyrinth"", a remarkable film from the inconsistent director Guillermo Del Toro, is an intertwined tale of adulterated fantasy, a very accurate assessment on nefarious and fascist government, and most of all, a superlative accomplishment in the genre of fantasy. Del Toro has proved more than his hidden facade of indispensable magic; he has created a world to escape to. For the first, and maybe the only time this year, the viewer is in a world of cinema that is unpredictable from the start.<br/><br/>A towering work of narrative obscurity, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" portrays the life of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a genuine little girl who believes in magic. Her mother, Carmen, is pregnant, and they are on their way to the mothers' husbands' home in 1944. Her husband Captain Vidal) is a hardcore Franquista (Franco supporter, the dictator who ruled Spain from 1939 until 1975 when he died of natural causes) who is merciless at all costs.<br/><br/>But in the end, Del Toro does not distinguish a good from a bad ending, and quite frankly it hardly even matters. What the viewer perceives is more than just a remarkable story. It's an illustrious work of magic made for a must-viewing. And in the end, after Ofelia's last task is accomplished, and the masterful musical score lay in the background, one can't help but think: Could the film be meant for something else? Of course it is, for it is a clear and thought out political allegory. But even by viewing the film at diverse standpoints, in the end it really comes down to the real truth: the film is nothing short of a true and simple work of art."
"ameh1","Null","3","6","11 March 2007"," In a World Without Hope - Part 2
","Having already spoken my mind on the movie The Children of Men, I thought it would be appropriate to see the remaining two movies from this Mexican/Latin/Spanish Trilogy, Babel and Pan's Labyrinth. Having now seen these three movies, I am convinced that the gods of cinema have transferred the various skills of movie-making to invaders from outside its Cathedral, Hollywood, the New Spanish Armada if you must, forcing the powers that control the purse strings, to allow this sudden and dramatic burst of energy and creativity to infiltrate an establishment that has gotten lazy and too comfortable.<br/><br/>What is common in all three movies is that they are extremely strong when it comes to the basics. With scripts that are complete and cohesive, absorbing and extremely effective. All the techniques of the film-making process; from the cinematography, to sound, to the editing and acting; bring to life in a most wonderful way, the power and the drama that is inherent in the written words and sentences, in the tragic nature of the characters, their relationships and conflicts, and in the brutality and honesty with which the story unfolds out there on the silver screen, in front of our very eyes.<br/><br/>Having now gathered all the resources and the sophisticated technology, and assembled the talent, it will all be a waste if there is no direction, a unique perspective, a singular point of view. This is the responsibility of the director. They must use their skill and imagination, and the resources at their disposal to create the magic. All the three directors have succeeded beyond expectation, and have created masterful art works that have, to a certain extent shaken the established order of things. They have all shown commitment and dedication, and displayed a passion and desire to express themselves through their movies without any reservations or shyness, telling the story as it was created, with all its brutality and honesty, refusing to compromise. Sometimes, as one watches these movies it can get frightening, and in spite of your self you want to tell them to stop, that is enough. There were one or two instances in the movies Babel and Pans Labyrinth, towards the end, where I thought they had taken things to far.<br/><br/>Pans Labyrinth has a more classical style to it, with rich deep colors, a wonderful feel and texture, with an old fashioned sensibility, looking almost like a black and white movie. The characters are extremely well defined, naive and idealistic in their passions and beliefs. The camera movements are often slow and deliberate, sometimes opening up the scene to include all the details and emphasizing each and every feeling and emotion the creators want to convey to the audience.<br/><br/>It is set in the past, and has as its central theme, a conflict between two fundamental ideologies, two ""isms"". In many ways the movie is much like Children of Men, the difference being in style; one unfolds like a Greek Tragedy and the other has a nervous energy to it and is set in the future. In both movies, it is difficult to separate the good from the evil, as both groups of people, those that belong with the systems of power and authority and those that are fighting the totalitarian regime's, will use any means possible to achieve their eventual goals and in the end one begins to question what are the goals. Both movies emphasize the idea that when man looses hope and belief, he also looses those elements that separate us from the rest of the animals, a Conscience, Morality and Virtue, Justice and The Rule of Law. It is the young innocent mind of a child that suffers the most in a world with no hope.<br/><br/>When children grow up without hope or belief, they will seek anything or any form or entity that will provide them with a sense of belonging. It becomes natural and normal for them to do everything and anything to protect what they believe to be a safe haven, never questioning the motives of their superiors or the means used to protect the power, for them it is obvious and rational. Some will be persuaded to seek in another human or group of people a reason for their angst, and will use their skills and genius in finding the means, to seek what they believe to be a just cause, a final solution.<br/><br/>Captain Vidal is just such a character, the uniform and the trappings of office, give him a sense of importance and a meaning to life. It is interesting to note that just before watching this movie, I had a watched a documentary on PBS, about the last years of Auschwitz. It gives you an insight into the nature of Rudolf Hoess, the SS Kommandant of Auschwitz, and Adolph Eichmann, head of the SS in Hungary. Sergi Lopez as Capitan Vidal gives a brilliant performance and should have been honored for his work.<br/><br/>When Ofelia realizes that her mother has given up all hope of surviving alone, submitting herself to the devil's care, she seeks, in the world of her imagination, the truth, where the gods do actually exist and miracles do happen and where humans will be actually punished for seeking what does not belong to them. When fantasy meets reality, the end result is tragic and painful; at least it was for me, as I watched the story unfold. Do the gods of Ofelia's imagination or those from Ancient Mythology really exist, do we finally achieve immortality when we die and leave this cursed earth. Are we to be forever punished by the gods and denied an Earthly Paradise for being weak and mortal. Should a child not dream of a better world for herself and her family? Is their no hope then for the human race? Important questions these movies demand of the audience, to consider and debate."
"simonparker1990","10","3","6","11 March 2007"," Best Movie of 2006!
","Determined to see a proper Guillermo Del Toro movies I was quite excited when I heard about Pan' Labyrinth. A movie completely in Spanish, a movie full of intricate fantasy monsters while being set within the Spanish Civil War. It was a movie never designed for mass crowds to watch it, but rather for people to slowly discover it and admire it. So as I walked into the cinema late last Sunday I was really excited, mainly because I wanted to see whether it would live up to expectations, and whether I could see the beauty of the movie. Now two days after seeing it I have decided to write my review on it, you see it has taken me two days of thinking about it for me to truly appreciate just how amazing the movie is. Pan's Labyrinth goes way beyond being the movie of 2006 within the first hour, what was originally in my mind going to be a nice fantasy movie turned into an epic tale about family, friendship, bravery, inner-demons and the evil that people face. This is a movie that is the closest to perfection I have seen in a long, long time. Previous years have seen movies I perceived as great such as Shaun of the Dead, Pirates of the Caribbean, Finding Neverland, Sin City and others. Pan's Labyrinth manages to top all of them for sheer inventiveness, sheer creativity, sheer beauty and sheer amazingness. It is difficult to write a review on this movie as it really can be interpreted in so many ways, the story is a grown up fairy tale, trust me kids will go screaming out the cinema if they see this movie. Its a movie that deals more with the fascism occurring in the real world than with the horrific monsters in the fantasy world. Its a clever and inventive way to do a movie like this and ultimately the largest risk that Guillermo Del Toro has taken for this movie as well/ Thankfully it pays off perfectly as it gives enough character development for us to genuinely care for the characters and enough time with the fantasy creatures for us to appreciate the beauty of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie features a bizarre little plot and to be honest how it was actually laid out in the movie was nothing like I expected. For starters the actual fantasy sections of the movie barely take up a quarter of the film. In a two hour movie there's actually very little of the monsters and bizarre fantasy things going on. Instead the plot decides to remain rooted firmly in reality, we instead see the impact of Vidal's actions on other people. How Ofelia is terrified for her mothers life, how Mercedes despised feeding the man who is trying to kill her brother. The characters really do make the movie what it is and every single cast member plays their part to absolute perfection. The fantasy sections are of course the highlights in my eyes, the site of the Pale Man just sitting at the table is enough to send shivers down your spine. When he starts moving you'll be horrified! Ofelia is a superb character and we always follow her story with genuine sympathy for the character. Had her character have not been believable then this movie could quite easily have fell flat on its face, but even in the fantasy scenes she is pitch perfect. Her character showing a large array of emotions and not the simple gormless look that Daniel Radcliffe puts in every single Harry Potter movie! Yet despite all my praise for her, she is still not the stand out cast member. No in my eyes the biggest star in this movie is Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez). Lopez really makes a monster out a character that could have been extremely two dimensional. The villain is easily the best character in the movie, every single scene he steals. He only has to utter a few words to send a shiver down your spine. His standout scene is where he declares to a victim he is about to torture that he can go free if he counts to three. The trouble is the man stutters and if he stutters then the torture begins. Its one of the tensest moments of the year and Vidal really proves to be the most menacing villain for a long time in that scene. The other two cast members worthy of mentioning are the brilliant Maribel Verdu as Mercedes and the even better Doug Jones as both the Pale Man and Pan.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is one of the best movie in years, certainly the best movie of 2006, certainly better than half the Hollywood rubbish in ages. No faults to speak of whatsoever!"
"moviegeek310","10","3","6","9 March 2007"," An Instant Classic!
","Ever since I first heard about ""Pan's Labyrinth"" I thought it looked amazing. Then it ended up winning three Oscars; Best Achievement in Art Direction, Cinematography, and Make-up, and almost won Best Foreign Film. After that, I knew I had to see this film. I made the short trek to Flint to see it, and I am so glad I did. The movie is actually better than the reviewers or trailer ever made it out to be. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a haunting, beautiful, fairy-tale masterpiece that beats ""Children of Men"" as best film of last year. <br/><br/>The movie centers on a young girl named Ofelia in 1944 Spain. She and her pregnant mom are forced to live in a military hide-out with Ofelia's evil, dictator stepfather until her mother has her baby. A little ways away from the compound, Ofelia finds an ancient labyrinth. Upon entering she meets Pan, a faun who has been waiting for her for centuries. Ofelia discovers she is actually a princess, and uses this fantasy world to escape from her harsh, war-ravaged reality. <br/><br/>The plot sounds like a kid-type fairy tale, but it is not. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a dark, intense, and violent, with a Tim Burton type look to it. By all means though, older teens and adults will be enthralled by director Guillermo del Toro's film. The cinematography and costumes are brilliant, hence the Oscars. The originality of it all is great; we have never seen a film quite like this before. The music is haunting yet beautiful, and will stick with you long after the film ends. What I especially enjoyed was the contrast between the real world and Pan's world. It leaves you with the question of whether or not it is all in Ofelia's mind or if it is actually real. Ivana Baquero who plays Ofelia is absolutely amazing! Normally child actors don't do much for me, but Ivana blew me completely away, she draws you into the movie with her brilliant acting. Sergi López as Captain Vidal, Ofelia's stepfather, is extremely believable as the worse than bad, bad guy. By the end you will loathe Vidal with a passion. Just to give you a little heads up, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is in Spanish with English subtitles, which I love, but most people hate. And for those who thought the trailer looked scary, don't fret, there is only one scary sequence, but nonetheless, it is VERY scary. <br/><br/>So for those who are up to braving an artsy, subtitled, dark, graphic film, then you are in for a wild ride. Believe me when I say, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a masterpiece. <br/><br/>It is rated R for graphic violence, and some language."
"Monkeyman_Jon","10","3","6","7 March 2007"," The Welcome Nightmare
","Never, before I saw 'Pan's Labyrinth', have I walked out of a theater feeling quite this beaten up. Sure, 'Hostel' should be the exception, but that's another story and another genre.<br/><br/>I did, like I had been told, enter the cinema with both an open heart and an open mind, and that would appear to be the key to really - I will not say enjoy, 'cause this is not a very enjoyable movie, it's something else - get something (or everything) out of it. The story is quite simple, it's a fable, so of coarse, but yet so complex.<br/><br/>The poor book worm Ofelia finds herself, some time after the end of the Spanish civil war, in a remote mountain village with her mother and her new daddy: the cruel fascist Captain Vidal. There are still anti-Franco rebels hiding in the hills, and they are to be drawn out and terminated under Vidals command - and like any child of harsh times, Ofelia starts living inside her head.<br/><br/>Outside the house, there is a maze that's been standing for much longer than any of the village's houses. And it is there, that Ofelia finds her way into another world - a fairy-tale world, where she is the lost princess of a magical kingdom, bound to return to the underground to reign. But to get there she has to complete a number of tasks for the odd Faun that she meets in the maze.<br/><br/>Unlike many who has not seen 'Pan's Labyrinth' likes to think, the scariest parts of the movie are in fact not the ones that take place in the bizarre fable-world (we have all seen the pale man with eyes in his palms), but the ones that take place in the real world (but then again, what is really real in the eyes of a child?). It is those moments of pure terror, not much unlike movies such as 'Schindlers List' and 'The Pianist' that leaves you so empty, and full of questions, whilst the side-story of the underground kingdom leaves you warm and hopeful. It sounds so cheesy, I know, but it's true. The innocence of a child's mind, versus the true evil of the real world.<br/><br/>But ultimately, it really is not a happy story.<br/><br/>But I have to see it again. I don't care about the nightmares, I'll welcome them this time."

","I finally caught up with El Laberinto del Fauno at a Barcelona cinema last night. A very fine work, successfully blending fantasy with brutal reality. In a nearby coffee house afterwards, you could tell who had just seen the film - they were were all waving their hands around in 'Pale Man' mode.<br/><br/>I won't summarize the plot - plenty of others have done that - other than to say that some commentators are mistaken in thinking it was set in the Spanish Civil War.<br/><br/>By 1944, when the film was set, the civil war had been over for five years, Franco's right-wing forces having succeeded in overthrowing Spain's democratic government.<br/><br/>The film's background was the armed resistance that sprang up around the country as Franco's cruel regime cracked down with murderous savagery (well summed up in the film) on any form of dissent. Tens of thousands of Spaniards were tortured and murdered and the resistance continued until democracy was finally restored in late 1970s."
"ExpendableMan","9","3","6","6 March 2007"," The stuff of beautiful nightmares
","Having received a twenty minute standing ovation when it was shown at the Cannes Film Festival, Pan's Labyrinth was always going to be one of two things - a masterpiece, or a film that thinks it is a masterpiece and unsurprisingly, message boards up and down the net are already afire with discussions as to whether it deserves all the praise. Which camp you fall in to is all down to personal opinion of course, but nevertheless Guillermo Del Toro should be applauded for bringing an uncompromising personal vision into such a wide public sphere. Pan's Labyrinth you see, is not an easy film to watch. Describing it as a fairy tale may have convinced some people that it will be an adult spin on a children's medium, something the entire family can sit down and enjoy, but this couldn't be further from the truth.<br/><br/>Set in rural Spain in the aftermath of the civil war, it shows fascism at its most oppressive. The credits have barely finished rolling before a captured peasant is bludgeoned to near death with a glass bottle, his father screaming in anguish beside him and then both being remorselessly shot. Later, a torture victim is shown dripping in blood, covered in bruises and with his hand slashed right down the middle, begging a sympathetic doctor to kill him. Elsewhere, fascist police officers stroll through the corpses of gun battle victims placing a bullet in the head of each one to ensure that they are dead. And this is without even considering the nightmarish fantasy elements of the plot either. One thing Pan's Labyrinth most definitely isn't, is a children's movie. This is the stuff of adult nightmares.<br/><br/>However, there is a certain beauty about it. As the tag-line reads, ""innocence has a power evil cannot imagine"" and in-between all the civil strife, beatings and lip slashing wanders Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), the pre-pubescent step daughter of the tyrannical Captain Vidal. With her heavily pregnant mother sick and her step father dismissive of her, the girl finds herself alone in an unfamiliar place. Surrounded by darkness and fear, she stumbles wide eyed into a hidden world, where a faun (the make up clad Doug Jones) informs her she is in fact a princess and the time has to come to return to her true father's side...<br/><br/>The result, is a head on collision between Ofelia's childlike wonder and the stark reality of Franco-era Spain. It is never fully stated whether Pan's secret realm genuinely exists, or simply the creation of the girl's overactive imagination (she is obsessed with fairy tales after all), but the fantasy element lends a serene beauty to the proceedings, despite being as vicious in places as the countryside she longs to escape. The faun himself is equally friendly as he is haunting for instance, but this is nothing compared to the nightmarish Pale Man (Doug Jones again). In the creation of the child-eating albino monster whose eyes fit in the palm of his hands, Del Toro has more or less completely debunked the myth of the fantasy genre as harmless entertainment for the kids and fashioned a beast that will cause sleepless nights all round.<br/><br/>Regardless of this though, the critics of Pan's Labyrinth still have much to chew on. Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez) for instance is sometimes so evil that he gets dangerously close to being a jack booted parody and there is little of the fantasy here that isn't in debt to Grimm's Fairy Tales or Lewis Carroll, but to focus on these things would be to overlook just how perfectly executed the entire movie is. You may be horrified by the Labyrinth, but at the same time you won't be able to look away. True, it is slightly disappointing that the fantasy world does not take up as much of the running time as you might hope, but this is a minor complaint when the film is this impressive. It is both beautiful and dangerous, violent and tender, uplifting and sad and a highly accomplished project for a director who could easily have sat back and made millions with another Blade movie. Just be prepared to be sleeping with the lights on for a while."
"LinkinParkFan2812003","10","3","6","26 February 2007"," Pan has an excellent Labyrinth
","It's very very rare that a movie comes out of Mexico with such a bang like this one has. Del Toro has completely out done himself in this film. From the beautiful score to the fantastic acting this movie is excellent. It has won 3 Oscars and various other awards. If that's not enough to convince you to see this movie, well here's another reason. It's on over 130 critics lists across the country, including Roger Ebert. The story is about a girl who moves to the country side with her mother to go live with a captain, who her mother wants her to call dad. Once they get to the country side the girl starts having the adventure of her life. While the captain is at war with people who live in the forest. keep in mind this could also be considered as a war movie. this is about as much of the movie as I'm going to explain because if I had said anymore it would've ruined the movie for you.

"calmly_insane","10","3","6","25 February 2007"," Impossible to take at face value
","The excitement I had and still have for this film is not containable. I should start with the negatives first, but that's against the laws of nature, considering that this film has virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>There is gore, which some may find squeamish, but it is a necessary vehicle to convey the desperation of the times, which are set in the fascist regime of Spain and Italy. There is also plenty of tense moments that the director uses so well the audience is left holding hands in plenty of moments of fear and suspense, completely unknowing to the fate that will be bestowed upon the three central characters: Mercedes the Housekeeper, the evil Captain, and Ofelia the innocent protagonist.<br/><br/>The acting, set direction, make-up, music, directing and writing all combine to produce one of the top 10 films of the decade, if not of all time. The fast-paced story may seem slow at times, but that's only the fear digging its nails into your subconscious, the inner-child still wanting to believe in a fairytale ending. The finale, which I will not spoil, will be happy to some and possibly sad to others, but beware: do not take the movie at face-value. You will be sorrily mistaken."

"funkyfry","8","3","6","21 February 2007"," Extraordinary adult faerie tale
","This film is really excellent... perhaps not absolutely everything I hope for in a film, or in a fantasy/faerie film, it's totally unique and certainly never dull. Part of me thinks that the violence in the film was too excessive, though it was not exploitative because it ties into the general themes of the film. But that part of me thinks that a truly great faerie tale can be scary but should be something that children could have access to.<br/><br/>The performances are uniformly top notch. Ivana Baquero gives us one of the more emotionally real child performances we've seen in a long time, especially in the fantasy field. Sergi Lopez is strong as her fascist (and sadistic) step-father, Capitan Vidal. Maribel Verdu probably has the most to do in the film and she manages to do her acting in such a way that you can believe that she could possibly be overlooked initially, while what she shows you beneath the character's surface shows unsuspected strength. Doug Jones also puts in an impressive performance as Pan, conveying the menace and majesty of the faun.<br/><br/>A few words on the theme of the film -- I think in a lot of ways it is about obedience. It's more complex than what appears at first. The contrast is there certainly between the captain, who is totally obsessed with discipline and order, and the child Ofelia who is very free spirited. When the doctor walks away after killing the prisoner, the captain asks him why he did not obey his order. The doctor says that he can't simply obey for the sake of obeying -- ""only people like you can do that."" If you think about the 3 challenges that Ofelia has to pass, in the first one she obeys the instructions of the faun and despite all of the horror of her situation, she easily escapes. In the second trial she is unable to obey the rules, incurring Pan's wrath because she ate of the food and she did not escape through the door. But in the final trial she is presented with a situation where to obey the rules or to obey Pan would be wrong, and she makes her own decision in favor of sparing an innocent life even at great costs to her own. This can be seen as a metaphor or analogy to encourage people not to obey dictators when they issue immoral rules, much as her stepfather the Captain would do. Her ascendance to the magical realm can be seen as a hopeful metaphor for what the human race itself can aspire to, if we begin to value the lives of innocents more than any other prize.<br/><br/>I think the film doesn't really fail to do anything it attempts to do, but I wish that the film-makers had been able to fashion a convincing faerie tale like this in a way that would have, as I said above, been more accessible to younger viewers. For example I think Gilliam's ""Time Bandits"" or Burton's ""Big Fish"" presented some very adult ideas but did so in a way so that not only would the films themselves be suitable for somewhat younger audiences but those dark/adult themes would also be opened up for the young audience. Faerie tales can be used for many purposes, but rarely in the classic literature do we see them used simply for entertainment. Usually they are also cautionary tales with some symbolic resonance. Faerie tales were also a form of mythology, in the sense that they were used to explain the unexplainable. For example the English term ""stroke"" as in ""she suffered a stroke"" comes from the older term for ""faerie struck"" or struck down by fey influences beyond human understanding. What I think the film-makers in this case are doing, is presenting a kind of ""instructional"" faerie tale whose purpose is to ""explain"" the reasons for evil in this world, for the continued existence of fascism and the continued oppression of innocent people. I only wish that it could have been done in such a way that it would actually reach children and communicate these ideas to children because sadly by the time we reach adulthood it's already too late for many of us to escape the cycle of violence that the film presents."
"niall-linehan","10","3","6","14 February 2007"," A compelling and original fantasy tail for grown up children
","These days it's quite common that film makers attempt to use highly stylized visuals to make up for a lacking in substance in film. It's much rarer that we get to see a film that expertly marries stunning visuals with a deep and satisfying story. In Pan's Labyrinth director Guillermo del Toro has done just that. <br/><br/>Set in Spain at the end of the second world war, it tells the tail of the stepdaughter of a captain in Franco's army. Unhappy with her life, she escapes into fantastic imaginary world while brutal repression is inflicted by the fascists around her. As the story progresses, events in her Imaginary world mirror those in the increasingly violent real world and both worlds begin to intermingle. However Del Toro gives both stories enough space to grow individually. This allows for reflection on themes such power and love while simultaneously providing a compelling and absorbing adventure story.<br/><br/>Directing his own screenplay, del Toro has managed to get universally great performances from his excellent cast. Particularly of note is the captain himself, played with cruel arrogance by Sergi López. Another great performance comes from Maribel Verdú as his maid who is also working with the rebels. However it's the thirteen year old Ivana Baquero who is the star. Her turn as the young heroine Ofelia establishes her as a talent to watch. <br/><br/>Visually, in the fantasy segments of the film Del Toro has crafted an uniquely dark world. Scenes that would have Messrs Burton and Jackson week at the knees are brilliantly contrasted with the horror of war. <br/><br/>Yet the key to the success of this film is that Del Toro know's when to pull his punches. The audience is not bombarded with gratuitous CGI. The visual elements merely play their part, along with an original story, an excellent script, great performances and intelligent direction to make a Film that has all the makings of a modern classic. <br/><br/>A work of great originality, Pan's Labyrinth is a dark fairy tail that film lovers and grown up children will adore."

It was so beautiful and the actors are so good that you believe everything that is happening to them. I was sitting on the edge of my seat the entire time. After watching for a short while, you don't even realize you're reading subtitles. I will never understand how people can not know anything about a movie and be upset when it's not what they thought it was from looking at the poster! Yes, it's fantasy, but that does not mean the the trees are going to walk and talk or the world is going to be a happy place. I think people should go see this for what it truly is... brilliant, inspiring, beautiful, and a one of a kind adult fairy tale."

","I cannot recommend this movie to anyone who has lost his sensitivity.It is about a dream of a girl who tries,through her fairy tails,to explore another world.Her name is something we must carefully consider.Ofelia,which is a Greek word,means some kind of debt or obligation.That you have to do something for a purpose,even if you have to sacrifice an innocent life.On the real life Ofelia must take care of her mother and come to terms with her new father.Her father is captain Vidal,a fascist soldier who has only two aims in his life:to kill all the communists and to keep Ofelia's mother alive in order to born their baby.Try to find the symbolisms in this film ,which are many.Don't try to understand,where does the unrealistic part stop and reality starts.Let this movie speak in your child's heart."
"MrGKB","8","3","6","10 February 2007"," Compelling adult fairy tale...
","...left this viewer sitting in quiet wonder. Auteur Guillermo del Toro, previously responsible for the immensely entertaining ""Hellboy,"" and the at least visually remarkable ""Blade II,"" along with a better than expected ""Mimic"" and cult favorite ""Chronos,"" shows himself to be at the top of his form in this violently beautiful film. There's no question in my mind that I'll be looking forward to ""Hellboy II,"" as well as ""3993.""<br/><br/>Lensed with absolute mastery by Guillermo ""Jackie Brown"" Navarro, ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" (Pan's Labyrinth) is the story of a young Spanish girl on the cusp of adolescence, deeply immersed in the fantasy world of her own vivid imagination, who ventures into that fantasy world in reaction to the difficulties of life in war-torn fascist Spain in mid-1944. Whether that escape into magical realms is ""real"" or simply a product of her overwrought psyche dealing with the daily horrors of her situation is a question the audience must answer for itself; del Toro is careful not to make the decision himself, and the film is all the more powerful for it. The production design, art direction, costuming, make-up and sfx, the sound fx, the score; all are deliciously detailed and extravagantly perfect, even when they make the audience cringe with horror or repulsion. In truth, ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is as close to a fully realized modern Grimm's Fairy Tale as one could hope.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent all the way around. Relative newcomer Ivana Baquero is appealingly innocent and resourceful as Ofelia, a little girl caught up in the whirlwind of life's harsh realities. Seasoned veteran Maribel Verdú, an actress I am thrilled to have finally discovered, plays Ofelia's confidante with resolute grace and, as it turns out, revolutionary strength. I can only believe that she is well-respected in the Spanish-speaking acting community, and beloved by her audiences. Ariadna ""Belle Époque"" Gil is wan and sympathetic as Ofelia's doomed mother, and I trust is equally respected and loved.<br/><br/>Wonderful as the women are, special deference must be paid to the incredible performances of Sergi López as the villainous Capitán Vidal (a man so cold-hearted that he can stitch up his own filleted cheek with barely a peep of the pain he dispenses so readily to his enemies), and the inestimably talented Doug ""Hellboy"" Jones in the dual roles of Pan and the Pale Man (his vocal readings as Pan are outstanding, absolutely awesome once you realize he doesn't speak Spanish) (3/10 edit: I was sorry to discover that his voice was dubbed over by another actor, though that hardly lessens his physical performance) <br/><br/>""El Laberinto del Fauno"" is, quite simply, remarkable and deliriously effective, and firmly cements del Toro's growing reputation as a director to watch closely. Be warned: this is not a movie for children. The violence is quite brutal and graphic (though never gratuitous), as it is in the best of fairy tales; lessons are not learned when artlessly censored. ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" speaks to the child within, but does so with the unswerving eyes of an adult. It will definitely be a keeper on DVD."
"cobbler88","7","3","6","7 February 2007"," Good, but not what you probably think it is
","My impression has been that this film is being marketed as some girl's fanciful creation of a fantasy world into which she retreats during a time of upheaval. Technically, that's probably true. But not the way Americans might expect it to be.<br/><br/>If you expect to be drawn into Willie Wonka's chocolate factory for 90 minutes, you will be very disappointed. I would hazard that perhaps only about 30 minutes is spent in any sort of alternate reality. And that reality, while generally visually appealing, is actually much darker than Wonka's, for the most part.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed this film considerably. But it's not ""Chronicles of Narnia."" There are rather graphic acts of violence, and the escape the girl finds in her alternate reality isn't exactly as rosy as you might expect. Every time you think maybe you should turn away from the screen in anticipation of what is about to happen, turn away, because that's exactly what is about to happen.<br/><br/>The positive notes are not as readily digestible as they generally are in American movies. You have to be willing to accept that you have to work a little to find them.<br/><br/>Finally, I would recommend this movie, but don't go if you're expecting something light or fanciful.<br/><br/>Take care."
"mr-siyi-deng","7","3","6","5 February 2007"," A touching fairy tale, but not for the young audience
","It turns out that the lascivious Greek half-goat deity plays only a minor role in this movie. The name, posters and trailers all underlined its fantasy part, but you'll mostly be disappointed if you expect something like the Lord of the rings trilogy. In fact, even with all these fantasy elements ripped off, it would still be a meaningful war drama.<br/><br/>I'm not quite with the hype on this movie. I think an objective rating should be somewhere between 7 and 7.5, but definitely not the current 8.5 on IMDb. The good part is the vivid contrast between the cruel adult world and the fairy land which only exists for the innocent. The even better part is the ambiguous interpretations from various hints and charades masterfully intertwined together by the director. However the shortcoming comes directly from these same merits: the excessive violence and dark humanity make the fairy-tale elements seems superfluous for an adult watcher, while the allegorical cinematography is obviously too hard for the younger audience. <br/><br/>There is some heavy debate going on about whether the fantasy world was real or the poor little girl just imagined it up. Real-fantasy supporters backed their theory up with otherwise-hard-to-explain details such as the restorative effect of the magical root, the escape of Ofelia from the guarded room to reach her brother, the oracular nature of the magic book, and the blossom as well as the narrator's lines at the final scene. On the other hand, day-dreaming theorists dismissed above claims as insubstantial, because if one can make up stuffs as large as a satyr's labyrinth, how difficult it could be to invent all these puny details?<br/><br/>Such indeterminate nature leads me to think about another alternative. Namely, What if the fantasy is real, and the ""real world"" stuff is all from Ofelia's imagination? It's possible to put the whole story in a theory that Ofelia is indeed living in the fairy under-land, she imagined the life of mortals because she craved for it. The sole purpose she made up this detailed reality-tale is to impress herself. <br/><br/>Well, I don't really meant to confuse things up, my point is that it is really hard to tell what is real or not from what you've been shown. Let me quote a reader's opinion on this issue: ""We can debate this until the fairies fly home, but in the end one of the beauties of this film is its ambiguity. Guillermo has his own ideas about the reality/fantasy thing, but he has left the film open to interpretation. His own personal view is that it was real ... but he lets you all make up your own minds.""<br/><br/>Some final comments: Ivana Baquero is a true nymphet. With all the slenderness and feline beauty only found in girls just before adolescence, she is the crowned successor of the princesshood left vacant for more than a decade since Natalie Portman's unforgettable portrayal of Mathilda in Leon."

","Truthfully, I'm no cinephile, and I don't quite understand the laundry lists people are making of technical reasons why this film is objectively the best movie of the year. If you're looking for those sorts of qualifications, read another review.<br/><br/>With that said, I thoroughly enjoyed Pan's Labyrinth. It's the story of a young girl confronted with the ideologically-driven bloodbath of guerrilla warfare in fascist Spain, and her retreat from its chaos into a personal fantasy world. Over the course of the movie, all the adults (her mother most explicitly) tell her that the real world is a place of arbitrary and merciless brutality, and that it has no place for fantasy or imagination. Ultimately, they turn out to be right!! The truth is that I've got a soft spot for art that expresses the impotence of man in the face of an uncaring universe. It's great! This was a fantastic movie about, as Philip Ridley so eloquently put it, The nightmare of childhood. Bravo, del Toro!"
"radu-balanescu","8","3","6","1 February 2007"," Violent but so moralizing
","I don't understand the modern tendencies of impressing the viewer with straightforward violence. On the other hand this picture gives us a very good reason for all the blood shed in front of the audience. It's been some time since a character has given me such disgust as Capitan Vidal does. And if it hadn't been for the visual depiction of his horrific acts probably he would have remained anonymous among other bad guys. We have to admit that many of his actions are predictable and from the start you learn what to expect from him. What is great about him is the fact that he lacks all the drama that surrounds the bad characters in a classic Hollywood movie. If he has to torture someone or kill him, he just does it, he doesn't feel the need to explain himself or prepare the audience for the grand finale. This makes it very realistic and the tragedy is emphasized even more by this sadistic and cruel plain depiction.<br/><br/>I admire directors, or scriptwriters, who have the courage to kill their main characters in order to sustain their ideas. During the final scenes, with Ofelia lying on the ground in Mercedes' arms, I was praying that ""a miracle"" doesn't happen. It was so obvious that the point of the movie was to show that innocence can be broken and that it doesn't survive in our cruel world. It isn't a land of faerie tales nor miracles and even the purest may fall victims.<br/><br/>I'm still asking myself if this movie would have had the same effect on me had the language spoken been English. Although Pan was interpreted by an American actor I found all his lines magnificent. It really gave me the feeling that I had fallen back in times of magic and wizardry. Miss Baquero was incredible if we think that she is only twelve years old. Her character was strong and the chemistry between her and Mercedes, not to speak of the one with Pan, was great. You begin the movie by feeling sorry for this child, you go on by loving him and you end up hating the world.<br/><br/>To summarize I must say that it is a great movie definitely worth seeing but I can't give it a maximum for two reasons. First of all the violence. Maybe I am too sensible or more fond of classic ways to describe violence, without showing it. Here it serves its purposes but the simplicity it brings takes away some of the hate you should feel for the character and brigs to surface disgust and fear. Maybe this is what Mr del Toro wanted us to feel, but it doesn't really cope with the main idea of evil defeating innocence. Secondly I have to say that he could have found a better ending. I loved the line ""He won't even know your name"" but why give hope after such terrible events? Evil has won, Ofelia is dead, that child is his and may as well inherit his habits so let Vidal live and warn the whole world of what may happen if we don't control our evil side."

I must say that it has to be one of my all time favorite films.<br/><br/>First, the visuals and computer graphics were awe-inspiring. Second, the script was flawless, although some people will, of course, figure out some minor mistakes. The ensemble cast was incredible. <br/><br/>This film takes the viewer on a journey through Post-Civil War Spain, and the fantasy world Ofelia discovers. Once one reaches the, quite shocking, conclusion, one cannot help but feel so many emotions at the same time, never has a movie done that to me before.

My mind wanders back to the various nuances and details that needed to sink in.

"Det_McNulty","9","3","6","4 December 2006"," Simply Majestical Even In The Darkest Of Times; Pan's Labyrinth Is The Film Of 2006. The Finest and Most Inventive Fantasy Since, Say ""Lord of the Rings""
","With all the anticipation I had leading up to Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth I was not remotely disappointed with the final outcome. Usually when I find myself anticipating a film I may be disappointed or unimpressed with what was on offer, yet Pan's Labyrinth has everything you could ever want a Gothic fairy tale to have. At first glance a lot of people thought that Pan's Labyrinth was a children's film that looked like something that resembled Alice In Wonderland. Firstly people could not be more wrong, Pan's Labyrinth is a gruelling, disturbing, emotional and brutal journey of light and dark. And secondly even though the film has lose elements of Alice In Wonderland, it's still very different; plus the fact Alice In Wonderland was never a book intended for children anyway.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro has been slowly becoming a big name among big-name non-American directors. His first film Cronos was an early 90s film that had some small success, but somewhat unnoticed by critics. He then manages to get a deal for a more mainstream American horror film named Mimic. From there the rest is history with the likes of the chilling The Devil's Backbone, the underrated vampire flick Blade II and then the big money superhero film Hellboy. Pan's Labyrinth is with no doubt his best film to date and remains a modern benchmark in artistic, unadulterated fantasy.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is the tale of a young girl (Ofelia) who during WWII goes with her pregnant mother to a small army base in deep in the mountain forests of Spain to live with her adoptive father during the pregnancy. The Spanish fascist army are fighting off the rebels who want peace for the country and though the film does not follow historical accuracies as this is intended for the tale of fantasy and reality. Ofelia is not very fond of her adoptive father as her birth father died when she was younger. Ofelia can see that her adoptive father is a truly evil, arrogant and malevolent man so tries her best to keep away from him. One day she a Faun (you'll become suspicious of his presence) meets her, telling her she is a lost princess of an ancient world and says that she'll be able to return is she completes 3 tasks<br/><br/>Ofelia is a truly brilliant character and from the moment you are introduced to her you will realise that she already locked inside her own fantasy world as shown from her looking preoccupied, distant and the fact she has a stack of fairy-tale books. Her mother exclaims ""aren't you too old for fairy-tales?"" and the girl vaguely replies with a vacant expression showing her obsolete distance. When watching Pan's Labyrinth I felt that it was a very personal tale for Guillermo del Toro as it contained some very individual elements and structure. I felt there was a sort of religious subtext to the film and mystical/mythical symbolism to represent this.<br/><br/>The film's ambiance is one that feels dank, murky, melancholy and eerie. There is a lot of symbolism and metaphors to the fact that the mill is a dark and threatening place where violence looms over the inhabitants like a virus. This represents the general evil that lies in the area and there is not often a lot of light in the film and when there is it's subtler. One evident use of light to show ""hope"" is when Ofelia is around her mother (this is only evident at rare aspects in time). Scenes of fantasy-like states of mind and the stark reality generally occupy the film. Something that stands out is the fact that there is so much beauty to be found is such bleak imagery. This all helps to create a remarkable work of art.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth shows what is the best cinematography of the last few years and every shot feels like it's been pondered to the point of perfection. The inner-beauty even in some of the more disturbing scenes is there for you to watch. The uses of light pouring on a man's tortured face and the ingenious creatures, they're almost too weird for comfort. The film's use of heavy rain running through the trees is excellent and each shot captures the sorrowful expressions fantastically. The film also detains a certain amount of hope in even the darkest times; childhood innocence is another implication that the film holds.<br/><br/>While the film will make you sit back in admiration at its deep-rooted Gothic design you'll still be attracted to all the other fine details. For example the remarkable score accompanies scenes perfectly and vividly creates brilliant tones of ambiguity. Guillermo del Toro intensely creates astonishingly grotesque characters (both human and beast) because of handcrafted imagination that has poured into the work. One of the finest elements is in fact the the editing is so precise and unique.<br/><br/>An outstanding work of modern cinema that I'm almost positive will be regarded as a classic in years to come. Harsh, disturbing, bleak, pitiless, cruel and yet it still has a heart. It won't be forgotten as it's packed with thoughtfulness and imagery that will be lodged in your mind for the rest of your life. The best film of 2006 and one that is bound to suspend you in awe from start to finish."
"mickosaer","9","3","6","29 November 2006"," The work of a real director
","I watched this film yesterday and still have a little trouble putting the experience as a whole into words - but this is the gist of what i've managed to relay to everyone so far...<br/><br/>This is quite literally an amazing piece of work, i thought it would require a huge leap of faith to follow a so called 'fantasy for grown-ups', but i barely recall ever feeling so enchanted. I went into the cinema with the preconceptions of a fantasy-epic appealing to a child-like imagination, with some mature themes justifying it's 15 certificate.<br/><br/>Although that's not an entirely defunct analysis, the film has a depth that simply can't be expressed. It's seems such a personal film in terms of it's content, but too stylistically rich and impeccably structured to be considered 'art-house'. It just works perfectly. I'm not sure if this is because of the realism it's Spanish Civil War setting allows, or whether the special effects are so understated that you barely recognise them, but the film's authenticity is never a cause of concern for the viewer. For a high-concept fantasy celebrating the power of fairy-tales, that's no mean feat.<br/><br/>This review will become ridiculously long if i start praising the film's cinematography, sound, production design and general look (CGI+costume; George Lucas take note) in any real depth. It all seems so unified in the vision of the film as a whole that it basically blends into the same thing. That the film achieves such consistency throughout is the highest possible praise for each individual department.<br/><br/>I do, however, think specific mention has got to go to del Toro for the beauty of the film's writing and ultimate realisation. I've never understood complimenting 'good direction' in a film because i don't think it really means anything. But the pace, detail and relevance of each shot is so precise and complimentary that i'll afford del Toro that very accolade, if nothing else because he seems so completely in control of his vision. It is breathtaking cinema.<br/><br/>The performances he gets out of Baquero (Orfelia) and Lopez (the Captain) are astonishing. If you believe the actors, you believe the film. As mentioned before, i believed everything. As something of an aside, i recently posted a comment about the 'Casino Royale' Bond film and tried to put into words how devastatingly it managed to fail on every level. 'Pan's Labyrinth' reminded me why cinema really can succeed, and (if what i've heard is to be believed) all for around a tenth of of the former's budget. It's embarrassing. I can't request strongly enough that you really should see for yourself."

It's so good, the right balance of fantasy, drama, realism and emotion, plus it's beautifully directed, every frame is a work of art. You see a lot of well shot films that really have no substance behind them, but this had style and substance to spare! I cried at least three times with a proper sobbing-out-loud-people-staring-at-me at the end, but having said that, you have to be a very hard soul indeed not to be at least a bit moved in this film.

"LazySod","9","3","6","28 November 2006"," Definitely not meant for children
","Pan's Labyrinth, as the international title goes is a conflicting film - it mixes a fairy tale into the Spain of 1943, split up in a civil war. This conflict makes for two good bases for stories, rolled into one great story. The effect is weird like Big Fish, intense like Hard Candy and bittersweet like Thelma & Louse.<br/><br/>Be warned! Do not think this film is meant for children as it includes a fairy tale. I would not take any children younger than 15 years to see this film. Some scenes are pretty twisted and/or downright evil.<br/><br/>The story starts when a little girl and her mother travel toward a military base somewhere in the middle of a forest in Spain, to be safe from further harm. A sense of drama is added: the girls father is dead, a casualty of war, and her mother is throwing herself into the arms of the captain of the garrison. Then the film turns on its heels and goes into full flexed fairy tale mode as the girl finds a friend in a big grasshopper that turns into a fairy.<br/><br/>From there it rolls on and the film switched to/from reality a number of times, each time revolving into something else, each time becoming stronger and more overwhelming. The end effect is both lovely and grueling, both sweet and sour.<br/><br/>Spoken language is Spanish but that doesn't take a single thing away from the film. In the contrary, having English speaking Spanish people would have ruined it a bit.. Special effects used range from OKish to pretty good and the scenery is very good. Really gives the feeling of a war zone. Story is a little predictable, but not in a bad way.<br/><br/>IMO, a very good film that has made it onto my list of films to get on DVD when it gets released.

This is the film we all wanted to see when we saw Burton's Big Fish or Chronicles of Narnia or Columbus's Harry Potter movies. Yes, this was a paint by numbers set like all those others, but no it didn't suffocate itself with the imagery. Anthony Lane once wrote in describing Star Wars -- also a failed fairy tale in a lot of respects -- that in Lucas's movies ""style was strangled at birth by design"". This is one of the first movies that doesn't fall prey to that. Pan's Labyrinth in the same league as Cuarón's Azkaban, though the world in Del Toro's movie is more ambitious.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is the story of Ofelia, a young girl whose widowed mother marries an officer in Spanish dictator Franco's service. The officer is a sociopath and the skirmishes with the resistance are practically at her door when she discovers a world of magic nearby. She gets involved with extremely well-designed characters, and the plot splits into two related and complimentary stories. As each plot moves together the film comes to a fable-like conclusion.

","This is a review from SPINANDSTIR.com.<br/><br/>American audiences are most familiar with director Guillermo del Toro because of his two films ""Blade 2"" and ""Hellboy"", although he also directed a small horror film, ""Mimic"". But close fans know that the director from his Mexican roots where he made personal fantasy/ horror films, at a smaller budget. Now with his 7 million dollar ""Pan's Labyrinth"", shot in Spain, he has once again returned to those roots. But perhaps all his time in Hollywood has skewed his view of what a personal film is as ""Pan's Labyrinth"" suffers from tone and focus issues.<br/><br/>The story follows a young girl, Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her pregnant mother, Carmen (Adriana Gil), as they travel to the compound/home of Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), Carmen's new husband and Ofelia's adoptive father. During 1944, the Captain lives in the North of Spain and is surrounded by soldiers who fight off post-war rebels who are not happy with the Fascist regime. On the property Ofelia, who has a wild imagination and loves to read fiction, discovers a labyrinth that seems to hide some mystery. Soon she is met by a grasshopper creature that leads her into the labyrinth to meet Pan, a faun, who informs her she carries the soul of a princess who must now open a portal and go back to her father, the King. In order to open the portal she will have to carry out a series of dangerous tasks including getting a giant frog to spit up a key, avoiding a man with no eyes, and ultimately making a sacrifice. While Ofelia works her way through this fantasy world (which may in fact be real), the real world is torn apart as Carmen struggles with her pregnancy, Captain Vidal, a military monster, who tortures and kills rebels. The fantasy world and real world collide when Ofelia tries to open the portal in Pan's Labyrinth.<br/><br/>From the previews one might assume that this film offers a dark, almost ""Dark Crystal"" like, children's fairy tale. But be warned that this is barely digestible for an adult. There is plenty of gruesome violence both in the real world, with the Captain torturing rebels, and in the fantasy world, where a creature stuffs eyes into his hands and tries to kill Ofelia. It's not just the violence that is throughout the movie, but also the tense tone of not knowing what could happen next. Although this is probably very true to the nature of living in 1944 Spain, post- war, where you don't know who to trust and military personnel are abusing their power, it does beg the question: is this a post-war drama or a little girl's dark fantasy film? I would say the film tries to be both, utilizing some parallels and overlaps in order to justify mixing the two. But I feel this is the greatest downfall of the film because there's not have enough room in its 2 hour running time to handle both.<br/><br/>If I had to choose I would have opted for the fantasy film. Not just because visually that was often more inventive, or because it offers more escape, but because it would have been more effective at addressing the themes that are hit over our head in the non-fantasy scenes. It is far for more effective for us to gain understanding of what is wrong in post-war Spain from the perspective of innocent eyes, like those of Ofelia, then see it directly. Think of ""Alice in Wonderland"" or the kids of ""The Secret Garden"". They are not aware of what war really is, or how military politics play in. All they know is that they'd prefer to live in a fantasy world where they are a princess whose real father is waiting for them through a portal, then have to live in the real, depressing, world. When Ofelia is given the challenges and set on her journey there is plenty of opportunity to inform us through the creatures she meets, the environment in the fantasy world, and the rewards at the end as to how she feels and views the real world. Instead the filmmakers have to cut back and forth showcasing Vidal's brutality, Carmen's pregnancy troubles, and war in general. Each of these showcased scenes could have easily been hinted at and then left to be shown in the fantasy world. We don't need multiple torture scenes, near miscarriages, and rebel shootouts to let us know what is wrong in this world. So although I am making a suggestion as to another way to have made the film, I am merely pointing out that there are two films struggling to be heard and, together, they don't mix well enough to work.<br/><br/>READ more at www.spinandstir.com."

This movie fails in so many ways, and yet because it introduces unique makeup and costume and violence to make even the most hardened of viewers squirm, we are tricked into thinking it brilliant. Yet, it has no point, it has no depth, it is filled with trickery. It is a horror film, a nightmare in the guise of a young girls fantasy. This is not a young girls mind, this is one of man. It kinda sickened me. None of the characters are developed, (except the vilest) none of the heroes are to be trusted, the faun is evil and dark...the happy ending is mired in Christian/fascist symbolism, with a man on a throne with a long white beard sits in an auditorium with an audience clapping.

","Some people is cheering Mexico considering this film the ""first Mexican entry in the road to the Oscar"". I disagree. This movie is a full Spanish history: the plot is the typical hackneyed row about good and evil in the darkest hour of Spain seventy years ago. The right wing followers are always the bad guys, no matter the dreadful crimes the communists, anarchists and others could have committed against innocent people during the war, Franco and his armies were the evil. That is the official truth. That is the only truth we must believe. On the other hand, hey, have a look to the film credits: from the actors to the technical staff, they are all Spaniards. It was also entirely filmed and produced in Spain. What are the Chicanos claiming? DDT (an FX company, which is also Spanish)had done a nice work. Technically impeccable, with a good casting of competent (and semi-unknown) actors, in the US this movie could be a mainstream CGI show. But, since it is made in Europe it seems that an extra value must be added. In my opinion, is not that good..."

","Mix a war story (civial war) with a fantasy world then put some essence of tragic drama and some Bollywood emotions, you will get this movie right. The film would not have been very different even if you have omitted the fantasy part. They seems to be disconnected somehow. <br/><br/>The same old story of stepfather being unfriendly to a child and the child finds shelter in her fantasy. <br/><br/>Can you imagine? that after being shot at back, a man can take off his glasses, wipe his nose and then fall down. No joke - the doctor did. <br/><br/>Nobody knows why Mercedes left the Captain alive. If she can open his mouth wider, she could have cut his neck more easily. This is stupid, considering a war film. <br/><br/>The the faun suddenly forgave her without any real reason (just like he was so harsh on the child who has completed the second task) and ask her to do the third task. It appears, the film is better to continue that way. <br/><br/>How come the labyrinth, which opened up for the girl, also opened up for her step-father (when she was chased) ? Was it not that the fantasy world was only for the child? If her father can also enter her fantasy then everything would have been very different. <br/><br/>The child died when she came out of the underworld, and that is why she has to take a rebirth to get back to her real father who was waiting for centuries.

"Jacques98","4","5","13","31 August 2008"," How do people NOT find this typical?
","Sometimes I wonder if critics even notice anything except the cinematography. I mean, I think I could film someone killing a guinea pig, but if it were filmed with a beautiful camera the critics would love it. Because other than nice camera-work, this movie has nothing going for it. And I mean NOTHING.<br/><br/>First, I'll start with the boring factor. This has to be one of the most boring movies I've ever seen: no doubt at all. DO NOT think this is a fantasy movie like Lord of the Rings mixed with Saw-like violence. There are literally only 4 fantasy scenes, and each last maybe 10 minutes tops. The rest of the movie is nothing but boring conversation.<br/><br/>Secondly, I was told by countless people this movie was violent. And trust me when I say this: if you've played any T-rated video game, you've seen more violence in 5 minutes than there is in this entire movie put together. It did not even earn its R-rating, much less be considered a ""hard R"" as I was told. Also, the violence is NOT in the fantasy sequences, it's in the war sequences . . . which made it seem like a toned down (but darker) Saving Private Ryan. And that's not a good thing.<br/><br/>Third, the cliché factor. It is falsely called an ""original"" movie by critics. I'm sorry, but there is nothing to see here that you haven't seen in PG-rated movies like The Chronicles of Narnia or E-rated games like Zelda. The ending was such a cliché I wanted to slam my fist into the TV because I was so disappointed.<br/><br/>So why do I give this movie a 2 and not 0? Because as much as I hated the movie itself, I agree strongly with the idea behind it: fairy tales are bloody, dark, and for adults as well as children. Guillermo Del Toro failed miserably with this movie, but with his ideology, his skill, and his memories of a traumatized past, I know in the future he can make something that is truly stellar.<br/><br/>But don't expect this to be that movie. Try again, Guillermo.<br/><br/>4/10"

","I saw this movie about a week ago. I expected a goth-girl fantasy-fest with monochromatic visuals and I got....a goth-girl fantasy fest with monochromatic visuals and a Lot of brute violence! Whoopee, Inner-ruffian satisfied!<br/><br/>Like I said the visuals are really girly; think if Allen Lee and Tim Burton were lesbian lovers. Pan is like a Smurf version of Tim Curry's ""Darkness"" who acts like Dennis Hopper in ""Apocalypse Now"" and makes just as much sense and the most frightening monster (of the three you get, that's a lot, isn't it kids?) is a octogenarian old man who's eyes are in his palms. Seriously, I expected him to yell: ""Ye young whippersnapper!"" when Ophelia ate the grape and that the snail-like chase would end with him falling and breaking his hip.<br/><br/>Set design in this movie is simply fantastic; beautiful earth-tones and withered designs.<br/><br/>The CGI is a bit unconvincing at times, the praying mantis (or whatever) moved like one of those government projects where they administer caffeine and speed to insects for what ever reason, but that's only a small adverse point in this goth-girly Fantasy-fest.<br/><br/>But the best part of the movie was of course captain Vidal. I love that guy! When he smashes that bumpkin's nose in with a bottle and then that wonderful line follows like the catastrophe to the old comedy - when it is proved the hill-billies were speaking the truth - ""Next time search them before you waste my time."" Makes me applaud the cold neglect and harsh upbringing that create men like Vidal. His contemptible expression for life and people and his forced unfelt smiles are balm to my misanthropic heart... and the guy stitches up his own cheek, how awesome is that!<br/><br/>The ending was very sad though; Mercedes lived, unfortunately.<br/><br/>All in all, a very enjoyable movie. Enjoyable for all above 10 years of age. To be relished by men through the cruelties and human-right violations by Captain Vidal and the sappy fairy-princess story to be savored by girls, especially those who hoped there would someday be a black colored ""My little Pony"".<br/><br/>(Now lets watch the bottle scene again in slow-motion!)"
"WPenfield","3","6","17","9 February 2007"," A minority report  the enthusiasm seems absurd!
","This may be the loneliest I have ever felt as a film columnist I am utterly mystified by the universal acclaim. Is everyone else embracing the heady potential of writer-director Guillermo del Toro's concept so intensely that they are blinded to the soulless reality?<br/><br/>The idea is indeed beguiling. A plucky little girl, emboldened by her belief in fairy tales to magical achievements, finds that her abilities also have an impact in the bloody reality of post-civil-war Spain. It turns out, however, that this idea is mine only. Nobody is actually changed by anything that happens in the movie, not even herself. Her credulity is confirmed without a trace of dissonance.<br/><br/>Ivana Baquero, who plays the child (called Ofelia for no resonant reason) is marvelous, despite being required only to be plucky. The rest of the characters likewise display their one significant characteristic each with whatever strong appealingness, patheticness or loathsomeness the characteristic requires. The clever freedom fighters are uniformly brave loyal truthtellers and expert marksmen. The powerful fascists are thuggish witless dissemblers with toadies who are indistinguishably servile. Hints that their Captain came naturally by his peasant-torturing ways are intriguing, but come to nothing. Likewise nothing comes of parallelism in the death-bringing styles of the pragmatic good guys and the paradigmatic bad guys (e.g. extra shots to the heads of the mortally wounded). A few foreground women do exhibit flickers of human complexity, but we meet only one who has not lost her guts along with her innocence.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the first two otherworldly creatures Ofelia meets do seem interestingly (frighteningly!) ambiguous, but they aren't  they prove to have been cut from the same cardboard duality as the rest. Only once does the otherworld impact the real world, and it occasions the movie's punchiest horror: When a baby is thrown into a fire, the baby is actually a cute gurgling health-bringing root vegetable that only looks like a baby. Nonetheless when we get to watch it writhe and contort and char and scream until it dies, I'm not sure the distinction is important.<br/><br/>So we are left to suffer through two exhaustingly horrible stories before learning that if you are in fact the long-awaited magical incarnation of enchanted-world destiny, you'll be all right at the very end (and for the next three hundred years!, according to a voice-over), and that if you are scrabbling on the godless surface of the earth, most of you will suffer horribly, die young, and be forgotten before you rot, even by the writer-director.<br/><br/>The result is utterly unredemptive (except to the plucky girl, who goes to little-girl heaven). The rest of us  no, sorry, it's just me  must be left to mourn the craftsmanship wasted on sucking viewers into this joyless humorless schizophrenia."

","Yes, as the other respondents note in the comments section below, there is a very violent image in the film, one of many such images that seem unmotivated and unnecessary. I don't mind violence at all. But this movie really disappointed me. It was also a slow, boring, and relentlessly upsetting experience to sit through, and people in the cinema where I saw it were upset to be sure. What worries me is that we are meant to celebrate moments of violence in the film. After seeing innocent people hurt and hurt and hurt again, the violence then turns toward the villains in the third act. But I was disturbed by this lesson! Teaching sadistic revenge, as the film does, is not responsible. And the tragic ending just made it all pointless, without a payoff. This is one of the most inaccurately marketed and over-hyped films in years. In the months to come, I think people will begin to see through it, and call 'shananigans' on this weak film."

The young daughter of a brutish army officer begins to imagine herself in a dark realm, in order to escape real life. In her fantasy, she has to achieve a certain number of goals to be crowned queen of this bizarre realm. Meanwhile, the war rages on and her father kills virtually everyone in sight, sometimes sadistically. PAN has overtones of ALICE IN WONDERLAND, if Alice were on acid. The film is in Spanish with English subtitles, but it is pretty easy to follow. The CGI is mind-boggling, but the story is so death-obsessed, it doesn't really matter in the end. PAN is a nihilistic effort that goes much too far to present the horrors of war and the savagery of men. Approach with extreme caution, and no child under 13 should view this. It may be considered a masterpiece by the art-house crowd, but it is not a mainstream film."

In the end, it is the maturity near the main character which causes the most pain and suffering.<br/><br/>Technically, I've rarely witnessed such imaginative scenery and make-up effects in a single film.

Instead, I blew a free movie pass at the video store.<br/><br/>I honestly don't know what the fuss was all about. Accolades are numerous for this picture, and I have seen MANY movies both foreign and domestic but, quite frankly, I just don't get it. There are a few gross out scenes (but nothing worse than what you've seen in, say ""Saving Private Ryan""), allegorical development of the young girl's ""fantasy"" against the backdrop of the Spanish political revolution in the 1940's, subtitles (so you'd better be watching the screen), and it's fairly reasonable entertainment. Good effects, but not as good as what's around in other films currently. Reasonable story development, and execution by the actors but, they ARE speaking Spanish, so I don't really know if it IS good or if I just THINK that it might be. But I DON'T think that it deserves the very high ratings awarded by critics, or viewers in this venue. Is it highly rated because everyone thinks that it SHOULD be ? It all seems like very artsy-fartsy, herd mentality. <br/><br/>Compare to ""Apocalypto"". Again, a sub-titled movie, but it has a far superior ""feel"" to it relative to execution and flow. No one speaks English in it but the story and acting conveys a very high level of understanding that totally involved me as an audience participant. Same with ""The Passion"". Perhaps it's because Mel Gibson has a greater insight into American audiences' taste and understanding and can convey that in his execution?....beats me!<br/><br/>No matter. I found ""Pan's Labrynth"" to be ponderous and somewhat tedious to watch. I sped through a few parts because I was bored with the time it took to get from point a-b.

"come2whereimfrom","6","5","14","18 November 2006"," whats all the fuss about?
","With crazy characters, teasing trailers, amazing posters and from various magazines more stars than the night sky I was really looking forward to this film. Sadly for me it didn't live up to the expectation. Overly long but with hardly any character development it looks pretty but is actually quite boring. Set in Spain at a time of upheaval the film flips between the real world and that of a fantasy realm created by Ofelia, who along with her pregnant mother go to live in a rural area will the evil Captain Vidal, not her father but the father to her unborn brother. From the outset we quickly establish that Vidal is a nasty piece of work who only cares about the baby and victory over his enemies at any cost. Ofelia trapped between the captain, the fighting and her ill mother retreats into a made up world where she will be a princess if she completes three tasks given to her by the faun Pan. What follows is a story of the civil unrest in Spain, violence and all, with occasional dips in to Ofelia's vivid imagination as escape. The trouble is that when in Ofelia's mind we are treated to some of the most beautiful CGI committed to screen but its too few and far between to call this a modern day Alice in wonderland. Pan the faun is probably in the two hour film no more than ten minutes if you add together his screen time and the eye hand guy that dominates a lot of the posters and screen shots is only in it for a couple of minutes if that. Sadly billing this as a fantasy film is slightly misleading there is more set in the real world as Vidal and his soldiers try and flush the rebels out of the surrounding woods. All the elements are in place, a passionate visionary director, a story with some truth to it, top notch CGI, great actors, amazing score etc but it always feels that something is missing. I'm sure that the film is packed full of metaphors that when in Ofelia's mind relate to the real world but after sometime I stopped looking for them and started looking for what made all the critics salivate, I haven't seen so much praise heaped on a film for ages but unfortunately for me I couldn't quite see why it deserved so much. Pan's isn't a bad film just, unlike myself, go in without any preconceptions and you will probably enjoy it a hell of a lot more."

","I was very disappointed by this movie. I think the whole theater was. You can tell when you finish watching a good movie.. the theater seems to buzz.. hearing little chit chats about it.. but no.. not this movie.. it was dead silent..realizing ""what the heck did that movie have to do with the wonderful reviews??? ""Beautiful.. a Masterpiece""? Where was the masterpiece? Where was the Labrinyth? I will UNDOUBTLY say that the parts that WE'RE fantasy.. could of been expounded on.. could've been wonderful and I did enjoy watching them.. But the movie was more about ""the real"" than the ""unreal"".. We don't need the REAL right now..we don't' need a movie about war and fighting.. all we have to do is turn on the TV to see it happening all around us... we want and NEED the unreal. That's why, I think a lot of people thought that they were going to get.. an escape.. into the unreal. 95% of the movie was real. And.. it should've not been called Pan's Labrinyth.. something more appropriate (say something closer to the Spanish translation) should've been used. Oh.. and it's NOT a movie suited at all for Children."
"Aditya_Gokhale","10","3","7","18 December 2008"," The Labyrinth experience...
","There are very few films which provide a viewing experience which is riveting as well as moving at the same time. Guillermo Del Toro takes us to another world in his masterpiece, Pan's Labyrinth, which is perhaps the best film he has ever made.<br/><br/>I have seen his earlier works like The Devil's Backbone which was a decent watch, and Cronos, which I hated!<br/><br/>But I was awestruck by what I saw in Pan's Labyrinth, a haunting film which is difficult to get out of your head long after you've finished watching. <br/><br/>Revealing much about the plot will take out most of the fun of watching the movie. But just to make a mention, the story is set in post-Civil War Spain in 1944. Ofelia, a little girl, along with her pregnant mother travel to the mountains to join her stepfather, Captain Vidal where his military outfit is in the process of exterminating guerrillas. Shortly, Ofelia comes across an old Labyrinth in which she meets a faun, who gives her some very interesting information. And then, amidst the conflict between the guerrillas and the Captain's army, Ofelia finds herself getting into a rather mysterious adventure....<br/><br/>Technically, Pan's Labyrinth scores in almost every department. The background score by Javier Navarrete is superb and brilliantly haunting. Guillermo Navarro's cinematography is fantastic and perfectly brings out the bleak atmosphere to go with the proceedings of the story. And of course, there's some frighteningly well-done special effects and makeup effects by David Marti' and others. Performances from all of the cast are wonderful. Most notably, of course, Ivana Baquero, Sergi López and Maribel Verdú. Lopez is so good as the ruthless Captain, that you cannot help but loathe him! Ivana turns in a poetic performance as Ofelia, the lead character. Likewise Maribel Verdu as Mercedes, the housekeeper. <br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth, as rightly described by Guillermo Del Toro, is a fairy tale for adults. It has it's fair share of violence and some gruesome scenes which may be difficult for the squeamish to watch. But this movie deserves to be watched by one and all. It is one of those tales of finding hope amidst despair, but quite different in many ways from all other films with a similar message.<br/><br/>The acclaim this film received is well-deserved. <br/><br/>Do not miss!"
"screenman","6","3","7","11 October 2008"," Flashes In The Pan
","It's one of those continental movies that are so full of 'imagery' and 'symbolism' and 'metaphor'. Mostly, you either like them or you don't.<br/><br/>The special effects within the labyrinth itself are really quite excellent. The civil war scenes in the contemporaneous real world are also no less graphic in their display of violence and suffering.<br/><br/>The whole movie has a surreal feel in a way that perhaps wasn't intended. It's like an amalgam of 'Schindler's List' and 'Jurassic Park', but with the director blown out on LSD. If anything, it seems to have an identity crisis. The lead player who moves between the real world and the labyrinth is a child. That would suggest a juvenile target audience. But the graphic brutality depicted in certain military scenes, not to mention some of the creatures in the labyrinth would hardly be suitable for young viewers. Just because it's arty doesn't mean its fit for kids. <br/><br/>For the most part I found the story formulaic and largely predictable. The ending was particularly twee, with the blood dripping down from the child's hand into the underworld fountain. Very prosaic, and so 'symbolic' of maudlin Spanish sentimentality.<br/><br/>This movie does at least prove that Iberian cinema is catching up with the English-speaking world. Though it clearly has some way to go."
"Stampsfightclub","9","3","7","6 October 2008"," A unique and dark approach to a fairytale
","Ofelia (Baquero) loves reading fairy tales and during the 1944 Spanish war, she is asked by a faun to complete 3 tasks which will make her a princess.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy) uses his visionary genius to bring a dark and dramatic fairytale to life in this Oscar winning picture.<br/><br/>Filled with surprises, dramas and a dark twists upon fairy tales, Pan's Labyrinth is both different and unique in its own genre and fills a viewer's watching requirements with stunning entertainment throughout.<br/><br/>The general surprise of seeing a fairytale told in such a dark and dramatic way is what makes the film so appealing. How many fairy tales are realistic? How many are dark and reflect the true nature of their time? All run on the same format and offer no new thrills, but Pan's Labyrinth is unique and brilliant in achieving that diverse effect.<br/><br/>Toro's direction, plot and the costume design all come together superbly to achieve a dark and dismal reflection on Ofelia's life, and believe the plaudits, because this is one of the finest and imaginative films you will ever see. Toro is lining up to become the next Tim Burton with the use of dark materials and Gothic imagery.<br/><br/>The writing is equally impressive with plenty of twists and turns and a strong focus upon each character's personal issues. There was slight confusion regarding the beginning in relation to the ending on the first watch, but it is well worth watching again.<br/><br/>The plot is driven by fantasy and escapism, with Ofelia desperate to escape the war and set things right. Baquero is excellent as central character Ofelia and will set your hearts racing with a brilliant young performance.<br/><br/>Each character is interesting, from the stubborn and violent Captain Vidal to the silent and professional Mercedes, the film portrays realism through the realistic characters and their lives. The writing and dialogue keeps the audience hooked as Toro delivers twist after twist in a highly dramatic plot.<br/><br/>The use of fantasy was a necessity and was pulled off tremendously well, through the use of unbelievable creatures. From a gigantic frog to a blind hellish creature, Toro gives viewers a variety and an image that will be cemented into anyone's memory forever after watching. The settings help achieve the graphic and dark imagination behind the creatures, none more so than the labyrinth.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth simply achieves everything that a good film should need to, great direction, plot and characters."
"marlyly","6","3","7","4 October 2008"," Good, But Not Great
","I'm afraid I'm in the minority here but after watching Pan's Labyrinth tonight I've got to say, I was incredibly disappointed. I mean, there's nothing wrong with the film itself, it's an interesting, clever and dark story of how a young girl copes with her grief via fantasy's, set in the fascist Spain of 1944. What I found that let the film down was reading and hearing all these brilliant reviews of how this film was one of the greatest movies of the past 10 years, nay, one of the greatest films EVER created. And that was my problem - it was a good film, but it wasn't brilliant, and after expecting so much more, I felt hollow at the end of this film, like I'd been cheated out of an incredible movie.<br/><br/>The story follows 11 year old Ofelia, who's mother is pregnant and has recently married Captain Vidal, a brutal, cruel, abusive and unfeeling army man who is only interested in his new wife because of the baby she is carrying in her womb. Ofelia's mother is ill, and the country is in the middle of civil war, and Ofelia, to escape the brutality and cruelty of real life, creates a fantasy in her head where she is the princess and if she completes three tasks set to her by the faun, then she will be able to go to the world where her 'real' father is, and leave this horrible world behind. I've got to say, the imagination of the film is incredible - the story is beautiful -, the script is good (what was translated of it at any rate), and the acting is superb, but my issue was that I never really connected with any of the characters emotionally (the dramatic end didn't really move me at all), and that the world Ofelia creates for herself is too childish and silly for me to ever get drawn in to it's story. I feel like I have to mention Serji Lopez on account of his performance as Captain Vidal, which really was quite superb, and I also believe the director Guillermo del Toro did a great job with the film. Hence the three stars. But overall I didn't fall in love with this movie, and although I may watch it again if it is on the TV, I won't be recommending it highly to my friends, or rushing out to buy the DVD because I just HAVE to see it again. A good movie, not great, - just don't go in expecting a masterpiece. That way you may enjoy it far more than I have."
"RResende","Null","3","7","25 December 2007"," Good and Evil
","This was an ambitious project. The director was really aiming at producing something remarkable. And it does have beautiful moments, filled with intensity and visual poetry, something which warms a viewer but it is not immediately synonym to good cinema. Direct to it, i didn't really like this film, despite the overwhelming good reviews and sympathy of the audience. The narrative structure is clear and simple: we have a story that goes on in a ""real"" historical time, and we have another line which is ""magical"" and runs (maybe) in the head and vision of a little girl. The first thread should represent the cruelness and violence of the real world, right in the middle of a brutal war context; the second thread is the escape for those who are able to ""see"" magic, here impersonated by our little girl. She reads books, lots of them, story books, and those stories leak into the world she creates, representing this in fact the leaking del Toro intentionally wanted to make, crossing his own references and creating a magical world which is in fact a mist of several ""children"" stories. Well, the problem is here, to my view. Fernando Pessoa stated the paradox that a children's story should never be written for children. He meant that it should give juice to the minds of adult thinking as well. So, good children stories always include paradoxes, ambiguities and difficult decisions, remember Alice, remember Andersen, remember the Grimm, remember Sophia Mello Breyner... A good children's story, magical or not, is most of the times a synthesis of complex principles that exist in a grey world, beyond black and white. Well, here everything is black or white. You know, from beginning to the end what is good and what is bad, even the ""flaw"" of our little girl comes from disobeying, not through temptation. And this is a poor vision, to me, one that doesn't live up to the way all this was executed. Because there are very very strong moments here. The fantasy characters are really engaging, the Fauno is really engaging, the way its evolution is made as the film moves along, the character with eyes in his hands is a fantastic character, all that scene is brilliantly executed. And some references are really tender. The performances are good as well. But something just doesn't go well here, and that is what i mentioned. It's as if the winner of the war in the film was the captain, and who made this film thinks one sided, good-bad, by extremes, the way he would have taught his children... spooky.<br/><br/>My opinion: 2/5 this will be a good visual experience, if you can forget the weaknesses i pointed out. i couldn't"
"dereklarma","10","3","7","14 August 2007"," Amazing Film!
","Pans Labyrinth was simply amazing to me. I had never watched a film with full subtitles before and I didn't know if I was going to like it. But I sure did!!! I just thought that the plot and story was incredible. The film takes place in Spain in 1944. Spain was being ruled by Francisco Franco, a fascist dictator. Ofelia, a little girl, is a stepdaughter to an evil, brutal fascist military captain. Because her birth mother is pregnant with the Captains child, Ofelia and her mother go out and live with the Captain in his military outpost in the far countryside. Ofelia is troubled child. She completely dislikes her stepfather and she is caught in a terrible civil war. Now living on the outpost Ofelia encounters a mythical faun that tells her that she is a princess, but she has to prove herself first. The faun gives her three tasks that she has to complete to become a princess. Ofelia faces danger from the tasks and faces danger from the world she lives in. As the film progresses her mother becomes ill and her stepfather becomes more increasingly violent.<br/><br/>The film has two sides. Ofelia has to accomplish her three tasks and in the real world a bloody civil war wages between the fascists and the rebels. Their female servant along with their doctor are also secretly part of the resistance. Ofelia's world along with her military step-dad's world start to crumble. As Ofelia becomes closer to completing her three tasks the world on the outside becomes more unstable and violent. Her stepfather starts to loose control and becomes ever more desperate to crush the rebels. To do so he uses extreme forms of violence and torture.<br/><br/>Ofelia's fairy tale world maybe just as violent and dangerous as her real life. Ofelia's tasks test her will and courage. She encounters disgusting, violent, and dangerous situations. The monsters she faces in her fairy tale world are as horrific and as terrible as she faces in the real world. What's more horrifying, a monster trying to eat you or a brutal, sadistic fascist military captain. Ofelia faces two conflicts: the monsters in her three tasks and the monster in the real world who is her stepfather.<br/><br/>In the film there is conflicting evidence to tell if everything is in Ofelia's head or is it real. Is the violence that she encounters in her real life affecting her mind to a certain point that she is having out of body experiences. Is she insane? Does she Have a brilliant imagination? Or is this all real? The director makes you wonder.<br/><br/>At the end her fairy tale life and her real life collide in a dramatic climax that may sadden you.<br/><br/>I will warn you that the violence is very graphic. Probably some of the most graphic violence I have ever seen. But don't let this discourage you. The violent and horrifying scenes are what make this movie so great.<br/><br/>Also don't let the subtitles discourage you. After a while you forget that you are even reading. Plus its a poor excuse to miss out on this excellent film.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is a great film. Go rent it!"
"mathshop2","10","3","7","10 August 2007"," A movie for intelligent people
","This is by far the best movie I have seen in about 3 years. I made a point to see it in the theater and it was worth it. I have even bought the special collector's edition on DVD. But, I am sooo sick of hearing people complain about this movie.<br/><br/>Read about the movie people! Even if that just means glancing at the box. Most of the people complain about the movie because they didn't know what to expect. Before you see this movie there are some things you should know about it.<br/><br/>1. If you don't want to read subtitles then DO NOT watch this movie. First of all anyone who refuses to read subtitles is a tasteless moron, and would not like the film even if it was dubbed. As a side note I personally think the translation was too Americanized, I would have preferred a more literal translation. The movie should be called The Labyrinth of the Faun, the name ""Pan's labyrinth"" just confuses people, since Pan has nothing to do with the movie.<br/><br/>2. This film is rated R for violence. It is a violent movie, it takes place during a war! It is not violence like in a horror movie, it is very realistic and can be quite disturbing. If you are squeamish don't see this movie. Having said that I must also state that the violence is integral to the movie and necessary in every way and if you really want to experience the film you should see the entire thing including the violent scenes.<br/><br/>3. This movie is NOT for children. It is rated R and I would recommend that no one under 14-15 see it. It has violent content that is too intense for children under 13. I think it would be more suitable for an older child though, because it does have subtitles and the plot of the movie would probably bore a 13-14 year old. It is mostly about a war. Having said this it is really up to parents discretion, but it is frightening when I read parents asking if the movie is OK for a 7 year old.<br/><br/>4. Lastly I wanted to say that I recommend that everyone see this movie. It is a genuinely good movie free of hype or pretension."
"thaliangirl","10","3","7","31 July 2007"," Beautiful & haunting
","This movie is beautiful, haunting and utterly imaginative. It's a masterpiece of film-making and deserves a place in film history. Del Toro takes what on the surface (or in the hands of another director) could be a simple child's fairy tale, and gives it extraordinary depth. Every character is fully drawn, especially the central character around whom the story swirls. The story is so compelling that even without the fantasy elements, I would have been gripped to my seat. But the fantasy elements take the visuals to a whole other level and plunge the viewer into a world that is like none other you've ever experienced. It is amazing how real the fantastical is - is Ofelia making it up or is it really happening? This was absolutely my favorite film of 2006."

There she embarks a weird and wonderful journey, having to complete three tasks for Pan. You meet some scary and spectacular creatures and the special effects are glorious.

Guillermo has really defined the word 'fantasy' with a better, clearer meaning from his very own unique and creative perspective. This cinema can take your thoughts through paths not much traveled by, paths were harsh realities are mixed up with pure fantasies. For me, there was a whole lot of new things to be learned here. Presenting ones fantasies as his ultimate retreat, was highly imaginative and thought provoking.<br/><br/>In the story, we see a 'balance' existing between the fantasies and realities of life, and this simple concept of 'balance' itself is the most important part of the theme. Then there was some really great acting talents which helped director make his fairy tale more beautiful.Ivana Baquero was unbelievable as the little Ofelia and so was Sergi Lopez as the brutal captain...<br/><br/>I would like to call this a movie of hope, a movie exposing the beauty of man's imaginations.

"r-hart77","6","3","7","10 July 2007"," Much ado about nothing
","I just watched this on DVD and spent a lot of the time watching the DVD players time counter count out the 1hr 52mins this movie ran. The only thing that kept me watching was the excellent cinematography and dark atmosphere created by this film. This would have been better seen on the big screen, but for squeamish types the small screen is better.<br/><br/>Unfortunately that's all the 'ticks' I can give it.<br/><br/>This movie seemed to go nowhere. I was completely bored with the plot which advanced at a snails pace between a lot of completely unnecessary violence. My 20 year old daughter gave up on it due to the violence and left the room. There was absolutely no need for the graphic nature of this especially as it seemed to serve no purpose but to show the cruelty of the stepfather. This point was brought home to the viewers early in the film and did not need to be repeated over and over again.<br/><br/>Eventually the stepfather became a 'comic book' super villain, never smiling and, towards the end of the film becoming completely oblivious to what must have been incapacitating, extraordinarily painful injuries. This gave me the only laugh in what was a totally depressing film as these scenes of the stepfather at the end of the film were completely unbelievable and ridiculous.<br/><br/>The 'pale man' could have been an interesting character. The idea was great, make-up excellent but why wasn't he used more? Just as the scenes with him were becoming interesting he was gone, out of the film, not to be seen again. This was far too shallow.<br/><br/>The character of the housekeeper was stupid too. She gave herself away on many occasions but the stepfather never seemed to notice. I mean, anybody else who stepped out of line, just slightly, copped it big time as we so often saw throughout the film.<br/><br/>The young girl showed almost no emotion during the film. Where was her fear when confronted by the giant toad or the faun, or even the 'pale man'? (Aside - laughed out loud at the carefully daubed on mud during the toad scenes.) <br/><br/>To summarise, this was beautifully filmed but with an almost non-existent plot, stupid, unrealistic characters and wooden acting."

","A film that's supposed to be aimed to a very mature audience.<br/><br/>That said, I just want to tell the story (I mean, history) of the first screening of the film at Del Toro's homeland, Guadalajara... the name suggested a very naive and fantastic drama. So, the venue was full of children!!!! I guess there's no way to tell what happened when all of us were facing the first violent scene. Breathless, to say the least. I, as many others, couldn't even watch it. Someone has already pointed out this remarkable ""treat"" in the film. There's no remorse in the way it portrays violence. Maybe it's one of the most violent films ever.<br/><br/>But, as someone who's been in touch with the Civil War in Spain since his childhood, I must say this film is just a snippet of what happened during and after the War. Maybe you could peek into more obscure films that are related to the War in Spain,as Ragged Boy, for instance.But, sadly, the truth is that the full recount of what happened in both sides is just barely touched in all the books written in Spain after the war.<br/><br/>Technically, this is one of those films that goes beyond imagination. There's nothing left to chance. Each and every set is made to be believable, even when in the realms of Fantasy. Credit should go to all the people behind the scenes who made possible such a daring project. That could be said for makeup, wardrobe, construction, painting and photography. Lighting is a key mission in the film.<br/><br/>Above all, acting is the most outstanding feature. There are no flaws. The bad guy is the baddest guy ever. Even if you try the devil, it would be harder to play anything worse than what Sergi Lopez did. The rest of the cast is superb. Visual effects are above most of what you've ever seen (try to pitch this film against The Fountain, and you'll know what I mean)... and, as the base of all this, a plot and a script that have no glitches, no seams, no blackouts! Maybe that's one of the reasons why this film was awarded or nominated 104 times!!!!! Well done job, again: and this goes to Guillermo and all the team who made this film possible. But... just one thing... if it's rated R in the States, take it seriously. This film NEVER, ever, flips to the sunny side..."

During the night, she meets a fairy who takes her to an old faun in the center of the labyrinth. He tells her she's a princess, but must prove her royalty by surviving three gruesome tasks. If she fails, she will never prove herself to be the the true princess and will never see her real father, the king, again. This is truly one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen, it was robbed of the Oscar. The Academy that year, went way downhill.<br/><br/>Trust me, this is not a kids fantasy film. It is dark and some of the creatures will scare young children, especially the pale man who is easily the scariest fantasy creature ever made.<br/><br/>This movie is recommended to everyone but be prepared for a tragic ending. Everything about this film is perfect. The acting, the score, the directing etc. 5/5. See it now if you haven't."

","First of all, this is no Lord of the Rings. It has a beauty and complexity which is all its own. It took me three times to watch it and analyze it as a film. The mesmerizing beauty of the movie impede me to actually critique the editing, acting and so forth the first time I saw the movie. Although the film is too dark at times, it is just a little blemish in what is otherwise a gorgeous face. Pan's Labyrinth is a simple vessel that hides complex issues. Del Toro delivers a deliberate masterpiece where no stroke is unintentional. It might seem as if the characters are hammered into a position. The army is evil and the mother is shallow. Still, part of their nuances are shown. The Captain self hatred is shown when he slice the throat of his image on the mirror. The mother selfishness is an attempt for survival and maybe part of her disillusion. Whether Ofelia is truly a princes is also a question Del Toro gives to the viewer. If you are more like Ofelia, you will believe she is a princes. If you are like Mercedes, you don't believe but you allow others to be whatever they want. If you are like the Captain, besides being monster, you hate this movie."

","This was nothing like I expected it to be. I expected a Lord of the Rings type fantasy, but got a much more drama oriented film. Maybe like 25% fantasy, 75% historical fiction. Seriously, I was amazed throughout the whole thing. I had heard it was good, but did not expect something this good. A must see, even if you hate subtitles. The acting, cinematography, make up, direction and art direction were all superb. Sergi López and Ariadna Gil's performances were utterly unforgettable.<br/><br/>This film easily makes my top five, and could quite possible be 1 or 2 after I have reviewed it more. However, I can see how some people that may not be into the historical fiction, drama, or fantasy may not like it. If you are a bunch of college kids looking to watch a movie during a party, this is not for you. If you simply want to watch a great movie in a suitable atmosphere (don't get distracted from reading the subtitles, because you could miss a lot) then it would be foolish of you to not watch this movie.<br/><br/>A note on the violence. There isn't all that much of it, but there is more than I expected, and it is especially graphic. However, I feel it adds to the drama instead of creating the cheap thrills it is used for in other films. It really makes you feel for characters and see how atrocious or passionate others really are.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: 10/10"
"bm-25","6","3","7","21 May 2007"," Excessive fawning over an interesting but puzzling film...
","Yes, UK critic Mark Kermode went overboard about it, but his is one voice. (And he was wrong about the Borat movie, too, as far as I was concerned.)<br/><br/>Firstly, this is a very well made film, of that there's little doubt. Both the reality and fantasy elements are technically faultless. But as my wife and I were left puzzling after watching this film, ""Why?"" <br/><br/>If you separated the Reality element from the Fantasy you'd be left with two stories, one about a young girl and her troubles with a masochistic stepfather who is struggling with his father relationship (or lack of it) and is fixated on the production of a son. This is told well, if simplistically, and in excessively brutal detail. (Scenes of torture, disfigurement and other graphic violence.) Running concurrently with this is the same girl's introduction to her role as a Princess in the Fantasy world. <br/><br/>What was the connection between them? I couldn't see it. All other aspects of the storytelling were unsophisticated, (the role of the partisans and insiders, the inevitable breaking of the rules in the girl's fantasy ""test""), so the likelihood of some deep and subtle meaning seems unlikely. <br/><br/>So you can have half an OK tale about the end of the Spanish Civil War, and half an OK fantasy tale. Intertwined, for no obvious reason. (But very well made, oh yes, I mentioned that already!)"

","I saw Pan's for the second time tonight. I just can't really come up with the correct adjective to describe the way I feel after watching it again, it's just a very special movie. Unique. While I really liked it at my first viewing, I fell in love with it the second.<br/><br/>I know as far as a movie experience, what I really loved; the lighting, the atmosphere, the fairy tale, the acting, etc. But the experience of seeing it touched me deeper than that, something about it just connected. Can't explain. It's one of those movies that I will store away for a long time. Its one of those movies, either you get it or you don't.<br/><br/>I highly recommend to anyone who is contemplating seeing it, to see it on the big screen, with a good sound system, while it is still out in theaters. The sound effects (those squishy bugs crawling around, the boots creaking as the captain walked), and just the dark magic of the forests looming on the screen so largely, cannot be fully appreciated unless you immerse yourself in the experience."
"jzll7","9","3","7","28 February 2007"," more about reality than fantasy
","I was hoping/expecting a grim but glorious flight of fancy, but this film is very much about raw reality. More of the film was about the war than it was about imaginary landscapes and creatures. I didn't find any escapist relief, and neither did the characters, in my perception. Everyone I think will have their own sense of what it's about - it is a layered, complex story with a lot of blood and drama and emotional intensity. <br/><br/>I noticed del Toro did not credit the 1973 film The Spirit of the Beehive as an influence, which disappoints me. He MUST have seen it, as it is a very famous Spanish film, and one of the finest art films ever made. It is about a child around the same time, dealing with the Spanish Civil War indirectly, via fantasies about the 1931 James Whale ""Frankenstein"" film. Beehive is quietly understated, and deeply powerful for those who pay close emotional attention to its slow unfolding... very different from the high drama and visually spectacular creatures of Labyrinth, but thematically very similar."
"cdoelle","6","3","7","19 February 2007"," Not that Amazing
","Pan's Labyrinth was a total shocker. From the previews, I was expecting a fairy tale. I literally thought I was in for fairies, goblins, and all manner of fantastical creatures. Sure, there was some of that in PL... but this is no kids film.<br/><br/>I was blown away by the sheer violence and gore. Don't get me wrong, I love a good bloodbath film, but this just seemed a bit too gratuitous. The story itself was okay, but in reality it was just a retelling of an old theme with added gore.<br/><br/>One of the reasons I watch films is to be surprised... to not know what to expect... to have a film lead me somewhere as I follow engrossed in it all. The only thing that wasn't standard ""I know what comes next"" fare were the occasional bouts of violence. I have seen both storytelling and violence handled much better."
"ms_jade_li","9","3","7","11 February 2007"," Fantasy Horror set in historical context. Excellent film-making.
","We went to see it last night, late showing. The theater was sparsely populated, and we had the best seats in the house with no effort. We'd snuck bottles of pop in. I had a coupon for a medium bag of popcorn, and my boyfriend got another bag, as well as some Reese's pieces.<br/><br/>We were all set to be entertained and perhaps frightened a little. Our local paper and a few online synopses characterized the film as horror rather than fantasy. Pan's Labyrinth can easily fit into either/both genre(s).<br/><br/>The film is set in 1944 Spain, and was written and produced by a Spaniard, Guillermo del Toro. The language is Spanish, with English subtitles. The scenery, including magical sunlight, is distinctly southern European. The myriad shadows in the film are also striking.<br/><br/>The cast of PL is impressive! The actors are unknowns to me, but I haven't seen many Spanish films, so it's no surprise. The character development for several of the characters is also impressive. I will leave it to you to decide whether there is a dichotomy between good and evil or whether what you see in them shows light and shadow depending on which perspective you're taking...<br/><br/>The plot follows that of a classic fairy tale. The special effects have been meticulously manifested, and you'll believe them when you see them. The sets are likewise impressive. You should not wait to see this film as a video rental. It cannot be fully appreciated unless seen on the big screen.<br/><br/>One thing that stands out for me in Pan's Labyrinth is the non-hysterical response of the heroes in the film to magic, where the most gruesome human character responds to it with panic. It's a calming change of pace to not see people freak out when ""magic"" shows itself to the ordinary person."
"jason-1649","9","3","7","2 February 2007"," Great movie... Finally a Labyrinth with 100% less Bowie crotch...
","When I went into this movie I wasn't really sure what to expect. I soon started to think, ""Ah crap I have to read this whole thing?"" Also the beginning seemed somewhat like an eighties fantasy/children's movie. Indeed things were looking bad. However, I must say I was quite pleasantly surprised rather quickly.<br/><br/>For starters, the subtitling was not poorly done, you know the whole, white text on a white background thing, the movie was too dark for that one. Also, there was none of that let's try to flash the fine print of an automotive contract across the screen in under two seconds thing either. Believe me, I'm not trying to badmouth subtitled films, it's just sometimes you end up reading so much you miss what happens on screen.<br/><br/>Also, that whole child fantasy movie thing ends quite abruptly with the first ""guy getting his face smashed in"" scene. Indeed, this movie takes what could be considered a childish fantasy feel and makes it creepy, violent, and disturbing. The imagery in this movie goes through a myriad of changes; from war drama and violence, to childish fantasy, and finally makes a long stop in Child Nightmare Land with occasional trips back to Warville with no further layovers in Child Fantasyberg.<br/><br/>Most of the ""magical"" creatures in this movie skip the normal fantasy realm and jump straight into that ""weird kid in your Jr. high class who draws fairy tale creatures in a very disturbing fashion, and later took out a whole post office with an AK-47 five years after graduation"" realm. The faun in this was definitely no where near the friendly Mr. Tumnus of Narnia. However, the most disturbing creature is the one with the eyes in its hands. You know the one you see in almost every screen shot of this movie, that thing just gave me the creeps. I'm not entirely sure what the most disturbing feature of this creature was. The eyes in the hand thing wasn't too awful, but when it held the hands up to its face, its fingers formed what looked like gaudy large eyelashes, this would be comical if it wasn't for the eerie resemblance to Tammy Faye Baker's eye makeup, and as we all know, there was nothing funny about her. However, the whole skinny leg thing that creature had going on really did it for me, I couldn't stop staring at them, and while you may not consider that disturbing, I did, I had nightmares about being chased down by anorexic eighty year olds for two days following.<br/><br/>It was refreshing to see a fantasy movie based on a Labyrinth that didn't involve David Bowie's crotch every six scenes. This movie is most certainly not the childhood fantasy/adventure movie you remember starring Tom Cruise's yet unfixed crooked teeth, no this movie was more disturbing than one of Willie Wonka's fetish fantasies (Just think about that one for a second, believe me that would be disturbing.) All in all, a great movie, it tackled a childish genre and made it adult very convincingly. The ending even placed me somewhere between happy and sad in a way that was very odd and I can't describe without spoiling the movie and therefore won't, just take my word on this one. A great movie, just don't bring your kids to it thinking of childhood memories of the Dark Crystal; it's not that kind of fantasy movie."
"CyMaddux","7","3","7","31 January 2007"," Definitely not your typical Peter Pan of a movie...
","I saw this movie last week with my girlfriend. We are in the mid 20s age bracket and both enjoy thrillers, although I would classify this as more of a film-noire<br/><br/>After that preface, let me say that I went into this movie with high expectations, having seen the hefty 8.5 score that it was given on this site. Well, the score was perhaps ballooned by the few scenes that are quite dramatic and vivid with the emotions that are going on and the violence. I didn't have any major qualms with the movie, although I surely would have liked to see the background developed more on the whole idea of just what the ""underworld"" is comprised of and what the heck the thing in the buffet room was all about.<br/><br/>The gripes I DO have with the movie include Mercedes towards the end running into the woods after stabbing the captain SEVERAL times with the knife. She runs for maybe 15 seconds, the guards see her, jump on horses and follow her into the woods, yet she seemingly makes it hundreds of yards into the woods- far enough to be saved by the group of rebels that just happen to spring out when she's about to get captured after being surrounded by the guards.<br/><br/>Secondly, the captain himself. After taking a severe stabbing, he is able to meander about the complex, stitch himself up and is seemingly in good health until poisoned by Ofelia. <br/><br/>Lastly, I HATED the ending, far too predictable, if you didn't see that coming you should remember the whole ""blood of the innocent"" line that the faun tells Ofelia. <br/><br/>Definitely not a bad movie, but it could have been so much better if the backgrounds were developed, and the last 2 tasks were a bit more encompassing. The whole ordeal with the ""baby-eater monster"" in the buffet hall was cool cinematically, but very poor telling the viewing just what the heck the monster's deal is. <br/><br/>7/10, a solid movie, worth seeing, but somewhat overrated. No super-strong acting performances, all the leads were solid, but no one was knock em dead outstanding."

","After a systematic and cross-examining approach, whereby found and retrieved holding-terrain samples are being scrutinized and analyzed for unmistakable evidence of design mastery and perfection, it has become unambiguously clear that we are facing an enormous accomplishment in terms of the utmost exuberant repertoire of intricate pictorial rendition.<br/><br/>And not only that, their well-accomplished makers are ""fully aware of everything that is, has been, or will be"" which is to say ""they can control the destinies of this entire micro world called Earth."" In essence, humanity in all its great might and power appears more like a ""barely discernible force in the contemptuous and exhilarating world of the beyond"" more so than ever. And it is, indeed, a shame that we are placed this low in the universal hierarchy of beings whose works tell of such magnificent details, sculpted in otherwise ""plain, useless rocks."" The depth and breath of these findings should leave the average-taught mind totally breathless and in deep despair, to say the least, and yet there is a promise of better things, greater objectives, and a more equitable and wonderful existence for all.<br/><br/>Some of the key lessons seen thus farto which I am now acknowledging and reacting completely in favor ofrotate around the example of the feeling of unselfish mutual sharing. This simply entails that everyone and everything is part of everyone else and everything else and by having such tightly interwoven environment there is very little chance of inflicting permanent damage to diminish the value of the whole subject kept in such delicate structural balance.<br/><br/>This ""colony of beings"" receptacle causes immediate turnaround effects that revolve the entire essence of such creature (as shown in stone micro constructionsactually made to order from bare substance onwards) thus providing a first-level feedback to all its integrating elements as if they are the directly impacted recipients of their own actions. To translate this into more mundane terms, it would be as if I am wielding a knife, brandishing a gun, etc., and every time I attack someone out there with any of these weapons, the force of the weapon's destructive power is executed right through my own flesh, and I am not talking the recoil energy here.<br/><br/>In this fashion, where everyone is 100 percent its own friend/foe simultaneously, the ambiance for malignant activity is practically eliminated.<br/><br/>Of course, to reach such level of awareness a series of juxtaposed processes have taken place that permeates small remnants into the so-called genetic architecture. But then by looking at the complexity of the ingrained relationshipsas represented in some of these rocks, where incrusted diamonds (some even showing labyrinthic-type, nano-carvings with seemingly facial features) and other crystalline compounds mix with more ordinary materialone has no other option but to conclude that, indeed, matter, space, time, and energy are all one and the same.<br/><br/>Filename: MasteryDepictionControlJan01-2007"

"ociopia","10","3","7","29 January 2007"," Exquisitely realized
","Pan's Labyrinth manages to be a number of things, beyond visually stunning and stunningly imaginative. It could be a bookend to ""For Whom The Bell Tolls,"" showing the day-to-day pressure and horrors of the army Pablo and Pilar were fighting, the army mirroring the sadistic brutality, with a peculiar lyrical beauty, of the Third Riech. Serqi Lopez is brilliant as the army's tormented and almost mechanically sadistic leader, as though he is acting from compulsions beyond himself. I thought his performance one of academy award level, like taking The Good The Bad and The Ugly's tormented evil leader who keeps listening to the melody in his pocket watch and turning him into a real character, played by a brilliant actor. This is a movie, in and of itself.<br/><br/>Then comes the young girl who is thrust into this men's world - truly a world where the vulnerable have no place or chance - and she is filled with fear for herself and her pregnant mother, the new wife of the violent army leader. This movie is dark. It is about the underworld, those parts of life and as well as the self that we wish to remain hidden, the places we are pulled down and into. Most movies portray that part of life thru awful and flat movies like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and the like, focusing only on the terror. This movie is lushly full - a true masterpiece of realism, told as a fantasy.<br/><br/>This young girl lives in a world of fairy tale books and suddenly, a magical portal to another world opens - an ancient and equally violent world, yet in it she has power, bravery, importance and the opportunity to become a princess. She does not question its validity or rules or her role. Instead, she puts on the mantle of hero and takes up a frightening quest, given to her by an ancient and eerie faun, whose intentions are unclear. Is he good? Is he evil? Is he beyond either? He will give her three tasks, and if she fulfills them, she will become a princess in a place of ancient magic - all this is beyond our understanding, of course.<br/><br/>In many fairy tales, a quest of ""you must fulfill these tasks or"" is given and the hero, along the way, encounters the most horrible of events, and seems emotionally very removed from them, as though he is sleepwalking toward his destiny as he encounters and slays monsters and men. The brutality that goes with the quest is dulled. Think of Arthur and the deaths of his knights, as an example. Or, brutality is embodied by Orcs and the like, so the realism of the brutality is diluted into parody. Del Torres's brilliance is how he circumvents this by having the present be so horrifying, thus constantly pulling the princess/hero back into the world in which she has no power.<br/><br/>Lush, layered, rich and imaginative, while real, brutal, dark and terrifying - this is an extraordinary movie, to be experienced in a theater."
"sidewinder572","10","3","7","29 January 2007"," El Laberinto del Fauno
","A supposed twenty plus minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival, already in the top one hundred at the Internet Movie Data Base, every major film critic and their mothers are giving this film the highest possible praise. Naturally I went in hoping for the best and at same time expecting the worst. How can a film with this much praise possibly live up to the hype? Well it does, and then some.<br/><br/>El Laberinto del Fauno is the latest film by director Guerillmo Del Toro. It is easily his best work to date. Although I am basing this view having only seen two of his other films (Blade 2 and Hellboy). Those films were entertaining popcorn films. This however is something else all together. El Laberinto del Fauno tells the story of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is goes with her pregnant mother (Ariadna Gil) to live with step-father (Sergi López) who is a Captain fighting with the Nationalists at the time of the Spanish Civil War. The film takes place immediately after the war, when small pockets of Loyalists continue fighting the Nationalists. (For more info on the Spanish Civil War read a book) El Laberinto del Fauno however is not a film about the Spanish Civil War. It is a fairy tale and a dark one at that. Where this movie succeeds is that the lines between fantasy and reality are completely blurred and never once to the things happening in the fantasy world contradict those things going on in reality. Ofelia escapes into a fairy tale in order to escape the horrors around her. There are fairies, monsters, and a faun (Doug Jones) that sends her on various tasks. I won't get into those here as I like to avoid spoilers.<br/><br/>I waited until my second viewing in order to write this review. It is not that I did not like it the first time. I feel that this movie warrants multiple viewings in order to really sink in. The film works pretty much works on every level. The acting is top notch especially by Sergi López and Ivana Baquero. Ivana Baquero gives one of the best performances by a child actor in recent memory and López plays the villain to perfection. The special effects are never distracting, the storyline is innovative and above all else the film never drags. I'm reviewing this movie after my second viewing. The most important element of any film is its ability to hold up under multiple viewings. Will my opinion stay the same after several viewings? Only time will tell. For now however El Laberitno del Fauno remains a visionary masterpiece and one of the best films of recent memory"
"jlkramer1","10","3","7","28 January 2007"," One of the greatest films ever made...
","It opens with a haunting shot of a little girl, lying on the ground, breathing heavily, bleeding profusely from her nose. And we know right away that we're not seeing some PG-rated fantasy. In fact, Pan's Labyrinth is Rated R, and considering the violence, profanity and sheer content of the film, the rating is more than appropriate. That one can label Labyrinth a fantasy, a realistic history lesson and a beautiful poetic tragedy all in one is rare enough. That it unfolds as one of the most moving film experiences in years makes it a pure gem. <br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth centers around a young girl named Ofelia (played with realism, subtlety and wonder by relative unknown, Ivana Baquero) who is stuck in the devastating realm of World War II, Spain. She is the mistreated step-daughter of a sinister Spanish military captain, Captain Vidal (whose character is made into the quintessential villain of our time - a raging and murdering madman - by the brilliant actor, Sergi Lopez). Sofia 's mother (and Vidal's wife) is a sad character who has obviously lost the strength to believe in what's right and believe in herself. It's not that she's a bad mother. In fact, she loves Ofelia with every breath and every beat of her aching heart. But fear and hopelessness have obviously taken their toll. What's worse, Ofelia's mother is completely meaningless to Vidal so long as she gives birth to his son. Poor little Ofelia's only escape from the devastation around her is exactly that: escapism, and in the purest fantasy only a young child can dream up. That her world of fantasy has political implications and subtle connections with the real world with which she escapes is something only a brilliant screenwriter and filmmaker can dream up. <br/><br/>With sweeping and beautiful camera work, Pan's Labyrinth takes us through both worlds, the horrifying reality of Ofelia's life and the desperate realm of fantasy she creates to escape it. We move from a scene in which Vidal brutally murders two innocent farmers, directly to a scene in which Ofelia converses with a Faun and travels with guiding fairies. The juxtaposition of sobering reality with that of Ofelia's dreamlike world makes the story and its themes all the more effective; how awful it must be for a little girl to have to watch her mother slowly die while her stepfather maliciously runs people's lives (and brutally ends others'). But not all hope is lost. Fantastic escapism isn't the only player on Ofelia's side. Other forces are at work, like Vidal's slave worker Mercedes, who sympathizes dearly with Ofelia and also happens to be secretly helping Vidal's war rivals. Actress Maribel Verdu plays Mercedes with such raw emotion and power that we find ourselves literally cheering her on with excitement. <br/><br/>Similarities of the film's story can be made with that of Life is Beautiful, another brilliant foreign picture about escaping horrific reality. But director Guillermo Del Toro has made something, if at all possible, far more effective with Labyrinth. I haven't seen a movie this original, this engaging, this magical and this devastating in years. The year 2006 didn't produce many memorable films. I really liked The Departed and had a ball of a time with Casino Royale. But my excitement for the movie-going experience, frighteningly enough, has been slowly diminishing. Pan's Labyrinth restores my faith that there's still truly incredible movies to be made. Many critics have said it's one of the greatest foreign films ever to hit US soil. I think Pan's Labyrinth is one of the greatest films ever. Period.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"

","It's such a treat to be able to go to the multiplex and see a film like Pan's Labyrinth, when more often than not, there are 4 screens showing the latest Adam Sandler or Tom Cruise flick. It's even more exciting when the theatre is half full on a Saturday afternoon. I'm sure there wasn't a disappointed movie goer in this theatre.<br/><br/>The film is an interesting mix of genre, part Spanish Civil War tale/part children's fantasy fairy tale. Between these two lies a beautiful depiction of how a child can cope with horrors both real and imagined, possible and imminent, and a testament to a child's strength in the face of adversity. When a child is living a most wicked life, even the most terrifying supernatural being pales in comparison, even this one: So the movie sways, between the real life horror and the complex underworld reminiscent of classic European fairy tales. You know the ones, where Hansel and Gretel cook the witch, instead of just running away. Or Little Red Riding Hood is saved because the woodcutter disembowels the wolf, but not after poor grandmama is savagely eaten. There are no apologies for wicked behaviour, real or imagined, in this film, as the closest fairy tale element Pan's Labyrinth shares with Disney is a tinkerbell like creature from a movie with a similar name.<br/><br/>The fantasy is breathtaking and frightening in equal amounts, causing the viewer to gaze dumbfounded against their better instincts to look away. It is Ofelia's (the child in the film) courage that pulls us along, as she knows nothing can hurt her in this fantasy realm as much as the pain she feels in her everyday life for her mother and unborn sibling, trapped in a marriage of convenience for the lead villain.<br/><br/>And what a villain this film has! A memorable fairy tale depends on its antagonist to be unnaturally cruel or morally corrupt. Sergi Lopez plays the adversary with such menace, such cruelty and such inhumanity that you'd swear he was someone not from this world. Yet we can see and understand his drive and motivation as a direct result of his unfaltering belief that orders must be followed and rituals held fast. It is this contrast between making moral decisions for oneself, and blindly towing the line that situate the characters as good or evil.<br/><br/>Though not an entirely easy film to watch, in that triumph is born only out of pure suffering and sometimes the right choices are not the easiest or safest ones, Pan's Labyrinth is able to somehow feel exhilarating in its telling of a story quite distressing. This can be attributed to its stellar cast performances, lush musical score, and eye popping fantasy visuals juxtaposed with its gritty wartime realism.<br/><br/>This is one fairy tale that will stand the test of time to rest alongside other greats. It is truly deserving to be on so many year end critic's Top 10 lists. Go see so for yourself.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"oneloveall","6","3","7","24 January 2007"," Not a masterpiece, but a master of pieces
","An intriguing mixture of fantasy and period drama, this curious hybrid moves along wonderfully but seems a tad overrated in my book, perhaps due to a lavish praise being heaped upon the very concept itself, which may ignore some of the smaller lulls that weigh down the film a bit. By no means slow-paced or uninspired, Pan's Labyrinth still flounders slightly with it's somewhat forced contrasts in brutality and magic.<br/><br/>Everyone has been praising writer/director Guillermo del Toro's visionary tactics enabling the film to walk a fine line between the stark, fascist violence that exists in the 1944 Spanish villa owned by a tyrannical general, and the surreal, escapist world the general's soon to be daughter wields as her defensive mechanism in coping with her depressed reality. Slipping further and further into the backyard woods that eventually becomes the visually intensive labyrinth of discussion, del Toro does create a fascinating parallel world, but in contrasting the two, becomes a little more tedious then I was led to believe. <br/><br/>Young Ofelia's various ""quests"", through which the fantasy arc takes root, are visually inventive but do not make for much of a convincing narrative, mostly feeling pieced together instead of a cohesive adventure. Despite the rigorous attention to set design which complement the original creatures, the contrasting world of reality appears littered with stereotypes and a stifled predictability.<br/><br/>While I would not call this all important contrasting of realities underutilized, I also would certainly not call it completely adept; Del Toro has moved away from the adolescent joys of previous work, but still has a little to go before making a certifiable masterwork. Still, the overwhelming technical proficiency demonstrated mostly in the engrossing fantasy sequences prove to flesh out a further emotional and mental statement that help make Pan's Labyrinth one of the more mature and critically acclaimed fantasy films to come along in years."

","A film like Guillermo del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth"" rarely comes around. In it he has merged the epic fantasy with grisly war drama creating a brooding, horrific, yet blissful experience for the eyes and the mind. Its visual scope might be in the ""Lord of the Rings"" realm, yet del Toro keeps his film in under two hours. There's a sense of a far more mature ""Neverending Story"" during that film's second act. Maybe there are echoes of Alfonso Cuarón's brilliant ""A Little Princess"". Some of the drama comes from a child during wartime, like the harrowing tales told in ""Forbidden Games"" or ""Hope & Glory"". Sure, there's all of that and more in ""Pan's Labyrinth"", but honestly it defies all comparison and holds up as one of the most original works to hit screens in many years. It tells the story of a young girl as she travels with her pregnant mother through war-ravaged Spain to live with her new father, a downright evil man. Twelve year old Ivana Baquero offers a marvelous performance as the innocent yet confident, young yet intuitive, Ofelia, who discovers a certain refuge and power in a magical world of mystery and peril lurking within and beneath her new home. In a way the film rekindles that certain innocence in the viewer as well. As we follow this journey, we are bombarded with imagery that may even make the most jaded adult viewer squirm."
"fwomp","10","3","7","21 January 2007"," The Brutal Beauty Of It All
","Prepare to be immersed in PAN'S LABYRINTH, the excellent adult fantasy film by Guillermo del Torro. Note the words ""adult"" here, because this is not something parents should take their little ones to see. Although stunningly beautiful in presentation, it holds back absolutely nothing when focusing on the barbarism of mankind. This includes gunshot wounds to the face, the sawing off of infected limbs, or the torturing of one's enemies.<br/><br/>Set against the backdrop of 1944 Spain, Generalissimo Francisco Franco has his forces set to squash any rebels prepared to inflame Spain into civil war. Into the woodland areas of Spain's countryside is sent Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), a commander so selfish and heartless as to kill anyone or anything that gets in his way. This is immediately noticeable when his unhealthy and pregnant wife Carmen (Ariadna Gil) is sent to live with him at this distant wooded post. Vidal cares not that she's ill and shouldn't be traveling in the late stages of pregnancy, but only wants his son born where his father can see him. With Carmen comes her preteen daughter Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), the daughter from a previous marriage in which the father died at war.<br/><br/>The unabashed horrors of war are close to Ofelia and her mother's new war post home. Ofelia, feeling helpless and frightened, goes off into the woods and discovers strange runes and eventually an old stone labyrinth of indeterminate age. Soon a faun appears and discloses some interesting information to Ofelia: she is the princess of a lost underworld, a world of immortals where her father-king awaits her return. But in order to find her way back to this wonderland, she must accomplish three tasks in short order.<br/><br/>But as the battle with the independent fighters draws near to the human world, the tasks set for her in the magical become nearly insurmountable ...and more dangerous.<br/><br/>The question as to if Ofelia is truly a princess or not is completely left up to the viewer to decide. Whether all of the fantastical elements in the film were solely a part of Ofelia's imagination  and a way to get away from the horrors of the war  or were real are never given over to the audience. A definite high point for the movie.<br/><br/>Pulling from Greek mythology, the faun (played by Doug Jones) is Pan, a half-goat, half-human, better known as a caretaker of woods and shepherds, and also a bit of a trickster. When we first meet Pan we're told that fauns ""aren't to be trusted."" Usually a wise thing when dealing with the unknown. Added to this problem is the dark nature in which we find Pan. He's in a tomb-like structure, full of shadows and decay. It's also noteworthy to mention that Doug Jones plays a double-role in the movie, as both Pan and Pale Man, a freakishly dangerous creature with eyes in its hands.<br/><br/>Spinning the audience between the brutality of war and the beautifully surreal world Ofelia explores, the merging of the two comes to a close in a most satisfying way. But it's an adult way, not a fairytale one. Pan's Labyrinth isn't designed to be a feel-good flick. It's a historical recounting of the Spanish Civil War and what one young girl's reaction to it might've been.<br/><br/>The film is a foreign language flick (Spanish) and subtitled, forcing those of us who aren't Spanish speakers to pull our eyes away from the sumptuous sets and down to the bottom of the screen; a necessity but still bothersome considering the extreme high quality of the sets.<br/><br/>Young Ivana Baquero as Ofelia deserves all the award nods she's sure to get. Her performance was truly outstanding, making movie watchers cringe whenever she's in danger and applaud when she succeeds with one of her tasks. Her tough choices are felt more than seen, making us care about her all the more as she wanders into unfamiliar and potentially dangerous terrain. That she has to make tough decisions for such a little girl will cause many-a-viewer to reach for the Kleenex box.<br/><br/>Because of these terrible decisions forced upon Ofelia, the audience is left to ponder one important thought: Caught between the stark beauty of a (possible) magical world and the brutality of human warmongering, which would you choose?"

It is a wonderful story, full of passion, love, hate and great imagination."
"dfranzen70","10","3","7","20 January 2007"," Absolute must-see - don't worry about the subtitles!
","Are you the kind of moviegoer who just doesn't cotton to subtitled films? If you're like me, you have enough trouble following the spoken words and the images on the screen without also having to wrestle with text. For me, it's especially tough when the movie depends strongly on dialog for its success. So for the most part, I avoid subtitled movies. I'll watch 'em, but it darn well better be an awesome film.<br/><br/>Pan's Labryinth is an awesome film, and I mean that it's both awe-inspiring and excellent. The movie is full of lush imagery that at times cascades gently over the viewer, lulling them into acquiescence, and other times jarring him into reality. It's simultaneously beautiful, arresting, dreamy, and terrifying.<br/><br/>The story centers on young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a bookish sort who's been uprooted by her mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to live with her new stepfather Capitan Vidal (Sergi Lopez) in a remote military stronghold in Spain during World War II. The Franco government has just assumed control, and Vidal's troops are there to fight rebels stationed in the woods, all while rationing food to the needy villagers around them.<br/><br/>As if this situation weren't unnerving enough, Ofelia's mother is very late in her pregnancy (by the Capitan, of course), and the pregnancy isn't proceeding smoothly; in an ominous sign, the caravan ferrying Ofelia and Carmen to the castle has to stop when Carmen becomes ill.<br/><br/>On top of dealing with these very real problems, Ofelia finds herself drawn to a huge labyrinth located in the garden of the vast estate. The housekeeper, Mercedes, warns the imaginative Ofelia not to enter the labyrinth, because its myriad turns would be very dangerous indeed for her young charge.<br/><br/>In the middle of her first night in the castle, Ofelia awakes and finds herself drawn to a pit near the labyrinth. Descending its narrow stone stairs, she finds Pan (Faun in Spanish), a servant of the Lord of the Underworld. Pan tells Ofelia that she is actually the Princess of the Underworld, and that she must perform three tasks so that she can leave her human body and return to be by the side of her father.<br/><br/>To describe these three tasks would be to give away a bit too much, but suffice to say that they aren't as simple as saying one's prayers or sneaking a loaf of bread away from the kitchen. But Ofelia does choose to complete them; she decides that given the evil of her malignant, torturing stepfather (a despot in training during the Fascist regime), she would rather follow her limitless imagination.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a parallel storyline involves the rebels, who have a source inside the castle: Mercedes. Vidal is determined to root all of the rebels out of the woods and exterminate them all, and they are equally determined to overthrow him and return freedom to the masses. As well, Carmen's pregnancy becomes even more difficult, and it is only a matter of time before the three threads come to a head.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most striking of the many visual desserts in the movie is that of the Pale Man, one of the demons that Ofelia must encounter during her travails. The scene is a banquet table with a lush array of foods and drinks. At one end sits a creature. The creature is tall, but humanoid in shape. It has long arms and arrow-sharp fingers with nails resembling talons. It is hairless and virtually skinless as well, and it has no eyes. Its mouth is a gaping maw, bereft of lips; a cold, stark, ugly beast that immediately fills one with horror and dread. On the table before the creature are two eyeballs; when the Pale Man is aroused, it grasps the eyeballs with its gnarled hands and slaps them into the palms, then holds the arms at head's height in order to see its prey.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro's film is highly imaginative, almost decadent in its lushness, evocative in both beauty and ugliness, in Ofelia's innocence, Carmen's and Mercedes' love, and Vidal's demonic cruelty. Vidal is a terrible sight, a by-the-book murderous fiend who will stop at nothing to completely eradicate everyone who opposes him, including the weak and the infirm. Lopez's performance is gut-wrenching, despicable, and sincere. The precocious Baquero, as Ofelia, is a perfect foil to the haunting Vidal, combining her natural, wide-eyed naiveté and curiosity with resolve, intelligence, and self-sufficiency.<br/><br/>This original film is Mexico's 2007 entry as Best Film in a Foreign Language for the Academy Awards, and it really should win. Had it been in English, I have no doubt it would have been considered for Best Picture. It really is that good; don't let your aversion to subtitles prevent you from seeing one of the most magnificent films of the decade."

"ptb4life","10","3","7","16 January 2007"," Not only meets, but exceeds the hype!
","Every so often a movie comes along that is so incredibly hyped that there's just no way it could live up to that hype... There are exceptions to that rule of course (LOTR, V For Vendetta), and I'm sooooo happy to say that Pan's Labyrinth is now included in that list. Not only did this movie meet all expectations (which were incredibly high), it has easily surpassed them! I have been reading about this movie for about a year now, and have heard nothing but amazing things.....then about 6 months ago I found out that the movie was not in English, and I was really bummed out. I have never enjoyed a subtitled movie, so I pretty much gave up on Pan's. I've obviously had 6 months to think about it and change my mind, and I decided to give this subtitled movie a chance. I am shocked to announce that after watching this movie, I truly don't think I'd want this movie to be in English, as it is absolutely perfect the way it is.<br/><br/>For those of you who don't know what this movie is about I'll give a brief summary. It takes place in Spain at the end of the Spanish Civil War. A Spanish Captain (he's pretty much evil) has sent for his pregnant wife and step daughter to come to his home/base to stay with him so that he could be there when his son is born. Basically this is two movies in one. I'd say about 2/3 of the film centers around the real world stuff of the Captain, the mom, the war...and 1/3 of it revolves around the magical world that only Ofelia can see (the young girl whose biological father died in the war). Along the way, Ofelia meets a fairy and she eventually finds out that she is indeed the underworld princess reincarnated in human form. Pan (the faun) tells her that she must complete 3 tasks in order to return to her world and be with her true father (instead of her tyrant step-father).<br/><br/>The beauty of this movie is that for the most part things are left up to the viewer to decide. Is this fantasy world all in Ofelia's head, or is she REALLY a princess? The answer is really simple if you ask me (and the film's director has gone on record stating that it .....oh come now, I'm not telling! I'll leave it up to you! If you want to know, look it up yourself. Though I'm actually kind of surprised at all the debates I've read online, after going over the movie again with my friend (whom I saw the film with), there really is only one explanation as to what happened. Regardless, I applaud the movie for basically letting the viewer make up his own mind.<br/><br/>The little girl who played Ofelia deserves an Oscar nomination if you ask me, she carried this film better than most adults I've ever seen. I promise you, she will break your heart. I will tell you this; I have only shed a tear two times in my entire life in a movie theater......make that 3. Try as I may, I was so incredibly moved by this movie that I couldn't help it. The wonderful thing about all of it is that whether you believe the movie is in her head, or real, you will be moved. The movie works either way.<br/><br/>This review is a bit shorter than most of the ones I write, the reason is because I want you to see it. I don't want to spoil it. I want you to go into the movie not knowing what to expect. That's how I went in....knowing that people loved the movie....but not knowing much else. This is by far the best movie I've seen of 2007, and definitely the best movie I've seen since V For Vendetta (my #1 movie of 2006). If I had had the good fortune of seeing this movie in 2006, I honestly can't say if it would have dethroned V or not. I just know that every so often a movie comes along that changes your life...and this is one of them. I loved Pan's Labyrinth. I can't wait to see it again....and again.<br/><br/>10/10"
"adslut","6","3","7","14 January 2007"," Unbelievably violent
","I was very disappointed that this film that looks so magical in the trailers is unbelievably violent. And most of this violence was gratuitous and wasn't necessary for this particular story. Although it's about the fascists in Spain during WWII and you would expect a certain amount of violence in a story like this it was so over the top I almost walked out at two points in disbelief. Be warned that the trailer doesn't give you any clues of what this film is really about and if you're thinking about taking teenagers forget it. Having said that, it's not without merit but it wasn't what I was led to expect and therefore a huge disappointment. My daughter and husband felt the same way and they can handle violence more than I can. My husband actually thought that the violence in Apocalypto was easier to take because it made sense in that story. This was just too much."
"user-14567","9","3","7","13 January 2007"," Don't wait for the DVD
","If your idea of a ""great movie"" is ""White Chicks"", you'd best move on, this movie is deep water for you and you are in danger of drowning. Del Torro has created his opus with this movie, it is everything everyone else has praised it for and more.<br/><br/>This film is easily characterized as gory and violent. At times, yes, it is. This is a an ADULT fairy tale. It is no less than ""Schindler's List"" meets ""Alice in Wonderland"" in style. It is also no spoiler to say that this movie is an allegory of Spain's return to democracy after the Franco years. In wonderful Del Torro style, the ending is told to you right at the beginning of the movie, much in the style of ""Grave of the Fireflies"", yet it is the trip TO that ending that will make this movie haunt you long after other movies are nothing but dim memories and ten wasted dollars.<br/><br/>I know many of you will want to see this movie because you've been told the special effects and visuals are stunning. They are, but don't go expecting George Lucas style gee-gaws. The special effects add up to maybe 15 or 20 minutes total screen time, and frankly you won't care. They are 20 minutes of some of the most magical visual effects to come along in the last 8 years. The storyline weaves in and out of reality so fluidly you yearn to see more of the Labyrinth storyline and when it arrives you realize you are on the edge of your seat to learn what happens in the Reality storyline. That is how seamless the directing is.<br/><br/>More importantly, go and see it in a theater. Do not be one of those poor souls who will only know it on the small screen. The impact of the movie will still be there, but the gorgeous, sublime effects will be lost. In school I saw thousands of pictures of Michaelangelo's ""David"" and wondered ""what's the big deal? It's just another statue"". Then I saw it in person, up close, and realized I had deluded myself. I had never known that Michaelangelo had carved veins into the statue, that he had carved pores, and muscles, and folds of the skin in the elbow, and cuticles on the nails and furrows above the eyebrows. All these beautiful details carved out of marble perfectly.<br/><br/>It's the same with Pan's Labyrinth. See it in a theater as it should be seen and watch the glint of dew on the fairy's wing, the dying leaves on the Faun. Don't deny yourself the sublime beauty that will make this movie a classic."

It was a shame they were not successful, and we had to put up with Franco until 1975.<br/><br/>So, for me, the movie represents a great tribute of these heroes.<br/><br/>Thank you, Guillermo Del Toro."

","I've only felt this way straight after seeing a film once before, and that was when I first saw City of God (which I returned to see twice on the following two nights). Pan's Labyrinth is THAT good.<br/><br/>The film is sold as the story of a little girl's escape into a fantasy world during tumultuous times for her country. But the fantasy world the child escapes to is perhaps the film's weakest point; it doesn't seem enough like the creation of a little girl's mind. Yes it should have dark elements as it's an allegory for dark times, but even the brighter aspects of the world lack sparkle. But that's a minor niggle. The story unfolding in the fantasy world is a great parallel narative to go alongside the unsettling post-war story in the real world... and the brutal acts of the military, and their capitan in particular.<br/><br/>I'd seen Sergi Lopez in a coupe of other films (Harry he's here to help and A Pornographic Affair), in both of which he gave strong, but believable, performances. In Pan's Labyrinth he delivers what must be a career best performance; chilling to the core. The scene where he is about to begin torturing a captive is almost cartoonish in the way it is written (""let me show you my tools"") but Sergi resists the temptation to ham up the character of the Capitan, and the whole film benefits from the believability of the central bad guy.<br/><br/>The supporting cast (though many of them having pretty significant role0 also play the parts perfectly. The doctor and the housekeeper are particularly strong, but there's not one moment in the film where I felt someone played a part wrong (except the little girl once or twice, but generally her performance is excellent).<br/><br/>One of the most amazing films I've ever seen"
"fertilecelluloid","7","3","7","19 November 2006"," Incongruous mix of fantasy and reality
","Certainly in the tradition of del Toro's ""The Devil's Backbone"", but the fantasy elements are not as well integrated into the film's neo-realist drama. A beautiful young girl, Ofelia, superbly played by Ivana Baquero, is forced to live in a fascist compound in Northern Spain by her sick mother's new husband, Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), a sadistic egomaniac. After Ofelia releases a fairy from a statue, the fairy leads her to a stone labyrinth where she meets a creature who sends her on a short quest. As this story plays out, Captain Vidal's war with a bunch of freedom fighters is depicted. del Toro, who scripted, has plenty to say here, but his pacing is a little too languorous and his characters, with the exception of Ofelia and Maribel Verdu's Mercedes, are difficult to relate to. Gripes aside, this is still a worthy fantasy with elements of Clive Barker's ""Nightbreed"", ""Hellraiser"", and Jim Henson's ""The Storyteller"". The resolution, in which the fantasy elements and the bloody reality meet, fails to reconcile these polar opposites and the result is incongruity. The technical wizardry on display is impressive and the violence is extremely graphic at times. The cinematography, by del Toro regular Guillermo Navarro is stunning. An admirable achievement, but not without serious flaws."

The music could be taken as a dark horse in the nominations, is wonderful and surprising, giving that plus in the most tense moments.<br/><br/>This film is not Narnia, is not a pic for children, due to the extreme violence. It's not also an epic or science fiction film. ""Pan's Labyrith"" is a Fantasy Drama motion picture, and it's vision, is more like ""Turtles can Fly"" than ""The Chronicles of Narnia"". The film provides horror and kindness equal. And the final question that provides me the film is: do the innocence has lost the battle against war and would finish to split blood too? It probably would be nominated as a Foreign Language Film, and the only competition it has comes from ""Volver"", an Spanish film form ""maestro"" Pedro Almodóvar."
"cinemart","9","3","7","11 September 2006"," Another great del Toro
","There are terrifying moments as we witness the fated journey of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) but the true horrors in Guillermo del Toro's film stem from the sadistic Captain Vidal (Sergi López), her stepfather. Austere, severe, he holds few people dear with the possible exception of his unborn son. Captain Vidal is determined to root out the communist rebel fighters who hide in the ancient forest and hills surrounding his country base of operations. Yet, the Captain's own servant Mercedes (Maribel Verdú) and personal physician (Álex Angulo) are in league with the fighters. In her own way, Ofelia is helping them too as she keeps Mercedes' secret.<br/><br/>Added to this riveting war drama is a good dose of magic and magical realism as Ofelia finds the fairies of the forest and learns that she must make several sojourns to the underworld in order to claim her rightful place as heir to the Underworld. At times, it feels like there should be more of this story but it's more of a longing to see the fantastico. <br/><br/>If the pattern holds, we can expect a few Hollywood films (some good, some bad) from del Toro before he does another smaller Spanish language film set in wartime with overtones of horror/fantasy again. That future film along with THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE and PAN'S LABYRINTH will be dubbed ""Guillermo del Toro's Somethingerother Trilogy"" and sold as a box set of DVDs. Look for it at your local Target store."

If someone would remove 2 or 3 of the violent scenes which don't contribute to the movie anyways, it would be suitable for an audience of children.

There are no brilliant ideas in the plot or ""layers and layers of intelligent writing"" as someone claimed.

"gigan-92","10","4","11","27 October 2010"," Undeniable evidence del Toro Can Deliver A Masterpiece.
","A+ Up until this film in particular, many were quite critical of del Toro's work. ""Cronos"" and ""Devil's backbone"" are widely respected, but not widely known. Del Toro considers ""Mimic"" a cluttered mess, while ""Hellboy"" and ""Blade 2"" are among his better known films. This is only natural as they appeal to the common movie goers' thirst for action but (me!!) find them more worthwhile with his artistic visual style. With this film I believe, it seems he pulled out all the stops for the critics.<br/><br/>For starters, the cast is incredible. Main stream crowds are used to star studded cast in order to find in their perspective a good film. I will honestly say prior to this film, other than Doug Jones, I was unfamiliar with any of these actors. But regardless the performances are perfect. It is rare to find such talent at a young age, but Ivana Baquero does just that. She portrays innocence, tension and vulnerability, so many emotions the climax will bring you to tears. Maribel Verdu was more than admirable, but Sergi Lopez practically takes the cake. Of course far be it from him to over shadow the other characters. He's still perfect as our antagonist. Every time he enters a scene there's an aura of dread, as well as pride. Doug Jones is dubbed over to fit the film but his role is no less memorable. He plays near opposites, the Faun and the Pale Man, and yet he fills them with personality and zest.<br/><br/>The story is just another well done aspect of the film. It takes a lot of inspiration from ""Devil's Backbone, mixing a child-like fantasy world with a grisly war-ruled one. However, that film was a well told ghost story; this something far different. It's a story of brutality, loyalty, to a degree sin, but over all sacrifice. All of these themes are present in both of the film's settings, which are intertwined. Never before has a fantasy film been presented in such away. Comparisons have been made of it to ""Narina"" and ""Bridge to Terabithia"", which is somewhat true I guess. But this is a much deeper and more involving story.<br/><br/>Excellent photography as usual by Guillermo Navarro I must say, while the simple yet beautiful score provided by Javier Navarette is stunning. You could watch the film in isolated score and it wouldn't lose any of the tension, somberness or mystery and awe. That should really be a feature on the 2 disc, but alas it is not. And not even being a Hollywood spawned film, the visuals are fantastic and the lighting is never off. In short, Guillermo del Toro has created a masterpiece, one of my personal favorite films. A work of unimaginable are and an unforgettable story full of many well orchestrated themes and emotions."

Ofelia also meets and befriends Mercedes (Maribel Verdu), the housekeeper whose brother is fighting in the Spanish resistance. Ofelia discovers a labyrinth in the garden of the house where Faun (Doug Jones), keeper of the labyrinth, tells her that she is the long lost princess of the underworld and she must complete three tasks before the full moon in order for her to take her place in the underworld. Meanwhile, Mercedes smuggles food, letters, and supplies to her brother's resistance army under the nose of the psychotic Captain Vidal. Once again an adult story told and seen through the eyes of a child. Like ""The Devil's Backbone"" the child's innocence is what protects them from the horrible world of war and political suppression. This film is so visually stunning and the story really takes you in and never lets go. Ivana Baquero is a star in the making! Lovely and innocent as Ofelia she carries the film so bravely and with the genteel of a young lady. Maribel Verdu is also lovely and wonderful as the woman whose own journey mirrors to that of the little Ofelia. Sergi Lopez is absolutely the villain that you do not love to hate...he plays his character with the sinister and sadistic manner that is similar to that of Ralph Fienne's Amon Goethe in Schindler's List. This film is without question a top ten film to see in time for Oscar season."

","I started watching this film with very low expectations based on clips I had seen previously, however I was left feeling shocked and empty. Although i watched it a few months back it has stayed with me and that in my opinion makes a good film. Keeping that in mind though it won't be everyone's taste as it does have some strange aspects and weird characters, but I would recommend giving it a watch."

"vorsa-25090","10","2","4","6 May 2019"," A Wonderous and Bittersweet thrill ride
","In the events of this linear yet thrilling story, we follow the adventure of a young girl, Ophelia, who lives in a violent time period within Spain. As she goes through the movie starting off as rather innocent and naïve, she progressively becomes more mature, yet never truly gives up that innocent nature of hers. Whether it be in the face of her sadistic and cold Stepfather, also Captain of a regime of fascist soldiers, Vidal, or in the face of mystical and terrifying creatures in the cases of the elusive Faun and the horrific Pale Man she keeps her light alive. Though Ophelia is the focus of this story, it is important to note that the story also switches perspectives to Captain Vidal for a majority of the story, and later to characters on the opposing side of his forces; however his point of view as opposed to Ophelia's is what I believe to be the focus of the story.<br/><br/>When the film seeks to evoke a particular reaction from viewers it gets that desired reaction. Going by two particular instances we can see excellent camera work and dramatic audio cues making up these intense scenes. The first example of this is the grueling scene in which Captain Vidal shows off some of his sadistic tendencies, in a shot where before he executes the man before him the camera focuses between the two men, before the audio cues several ""BANG!"" Like sound effects to the timing of each bash Vidal brings upon the man's face with his night stick ending with a cut away to let the overwhelming display of violence set in. The second example of the excellent camera and sound work. is right before what the viewer expects to be a chase scene, yet starts out with Ophelia disobediently eating fruit she was told not to as a pale creature sits and sleeps at the end f the table behind her; much like the Vidal scene this one makes a point of making the unsettling creature stir every time she consumes a fruit, until t awakens and the shot focuses on its hands as it is revealed that the creature's eyes are in fact embedded in its hands and as the camera tracks them it brings them up to its face to see Ophelia. and the shot focuses back on her reaction to turning around and viewing the monstrosity in utter horror.<br/><br/>A final point to touch upon is how each of the four mentioned characters are costumed and made up, the two humans and the two creatures. As mentioned before I believe that Ophelia and Vidal's appearances are directly infinitive of their personalities and backgrounds, and serve to mirror each other; Vidal is the cold and battle hardened soldier behind his garb and his darkened sunglasses to show the darkness in his gaze, while Ophelia is the innocent and childlike little girl dressed youthfully with nothing covering the brightness of her eyes. The two creatures are opposite in design not by characterization in this case the Pale Man is not really depicted as a character, it is just a monster meant to evoke fear. The Faun is meant to be a devil esq depiction of its peaceful natural counterpart with elements of a tree incorporated into his design, he moves unnaturally and disturbingly making him a difficult character to trust; the Pale Man is meant to be unsettling all around, with his saggy and disgusting skin, long slender hands, and especially his ""Hand eyes"" which allow him to have a screen presence all to his own as he stalks Ophelia shambling his way down the hall.
Though this review has admittedly come late and doesn't quite touch upon every intricate and wondrous detail, I would highly recommend it to any fan of the film media. It has aged so well in fact, I believe it will continue to be great and hopefully untouched in the decades to come."

","I saw this movie a while back and I did not know what to expect. Everything in this film fits perfectly with the rest. Actors, make up, story, and of course the music.<br/><br/>The movie seems kind of creepy but magical at the same time<br/><br/>It makes me feel similar to when i watched Legend (80's), lots of dark elements, monsters but also love, motherhood, friendship, secret portals and dimensions which can make this movie very balanced, similar to several comic books but with a more twisted and realistic scenario going on behind all of the girl's imagination.<br/><br/>I really like the acting in this film, and to be honest I hadn't noticed it until I finished watching the film. You get so stuck in the story and the plot that you barely notice if there are any problems with the film itself, tho at the end of the film you do realize how well shot it was, how good the acting was."
"Manya086","9","2","4","9 November 2015"," Unexpectedly good dark fantasy film
","I just finished watching PAN'S LABYRINTH and it was an unexpectedly good film. At first I was confused because it was in Spanish, I thought my DVR recorded the airing from the Latin channel; but as it turns out, that's the way the film is. If you understand Spanish it should be no big deal, and if you don't understand Spanish don't worry, there are English subtitles.<br/><br/>Set in Spain of 1944, a young Ofelia, escapes to a dark fantasy world of The Labyrinth. The set design is spectacular, it's very dark, very Tim Burton like. The creatures of Labyrinth, particularly the old faun, are great. Through the whole film I could not figure out if the faun was sincerely trying to help Ofelia or manipulating her for evil deeds. PAN'S LABYRINTH really reminded me of a dark Chronicles of Narnia film. The cast as a whole gave great performances, but the one who really stood out to me is the performance of Captain Vidal by actor Sergi López. Whenever I tried to anticipate Captain Vidal's next move, he did the complete opposite.<br/><br/>Overall, PAN'S LABYRINTH is an entertaining dark fantasy film that will take you on a ride. I was surprised to see that this film is rated R, now I know why. PAN'S LABYRINTH is a dark fantasy film that is NOT FOR CHILDREN, but great for adults. Don't let the film being in Spanish stop you from seeing it. If you get pass the subtitles, you will enjoy this film."
"jscherber","9","2","4","13 September 2015"," Great movie blends fantasy and reality
","What is really great about this movie is it's alternating stories. Part of the time it focuses on the army fighting the guerrillas and the other part it focuses on Ophelia trying to prove herself to be worthy of returning to the underground realm. The stories do not intertwine until the ending when even then they do not fully mix. The direction was awesome, knowing when to be mysterious, when to be exciting, and when to be tragic. The music had a creepy and mysterious tone to it, which matched the movies tone. The sets were pretty cool also. My favorite scene from the movie was Ophelias second trial. It was really suspenseful at first and then intense and scary. I thought the pale creatures design was brilliant. The only things I thought could be improved on were that Ophelia isn't a very interesting character as she is not meant to be much more than an innocent, imaginative kid, and that I wished the story would focus a bit more on the fantasy part which I found to be more interesting than the realistic part. This is a must see if you like dark fantasy movies."
"SteffDaza","10","2","4","28 August 2015"," Pan's Labyrinth Analysis
","The film is torn between reality and fantasy, it shows us the two verges as true, letting viewers reach their own conclusion: whether, Ofelia has created an Utopian fantasy that helps her escape her harsh reality into a world ""without lies or pain"" or she is truly a princess trapped in a dangerous and violent situation. Both explanations are perfectly credible:<br/><br/>Long ago, the princess of an underground kingdom escapes, curious to see the world above, but was blinded by the bright sunlight and all of her memories of her past were erased.<br/><br/>Spain; 1944. The Spanish Civil War is on and small groups of rebels continue to fight. A ten-year-old Ofelia, a lover of books and fairy tales, is travelling with her mother, Carmen, to a rural village where Carmen's new husband, Captain Vidal, stationed with his men at an old mill. Carmen is heavily pregnant with Vidal's child. Ofelia's father had died during the war.<br/><br/>It that old mill Ofelia meets a Faun, a supernatural creature that is half-man, half-goat. He explains to Ofelia that she is really the long-lost princess from the underground realm. The Faun addresses Ofelia as Princess Moanna, and explains that he had been sent by the King to bring her home, but that she must first prove herself worthy of returning. The Faun presents Ofelia with a magic book that will detail three tasks which she must complete by the next full moon. With Mercedes, Vidal's housekeeper, as an ally; Ofelia goes through a number of danger situations, both from the magical world and from the cruel Spanish war. Her mother dies in childbirth and her last task is to take her baby brother into the Labyrinth. Meanwhile, the rebels are violently attacking the mill. The Faun tries to convince Ofelia into bleeding her baby brother to open the door to her kingdom (just a drop) but she refuses. Vidal then takes the baby from her and shoots at her. He's later killed by Mercedes brother. Ofelia then seems to have returned to her kingdom with both her parents alive, but then we see Mercedes crying and holding her body. At the end of the film, when Ofelia has died, we see a white flower blooming in the tree, meaning the tree from the first task is alive again. This last intriguing detail lets the audience wonder if Ofelia was indeed Princess Moanna for she was the only one who could 've saved the tree and that she hasn't died, she just returned safely to her own world. The mystery remains, did Ofelia hallucinated or did she really returned to her home?<br/><br/>OFELIA, a 10 years old girl whose father died leaving her mom to marry Captain Vidal. She's innocent and likes reading fairy tales. She seems to have created a world of fantasy in which her true father is alive and waiting for her. Or she's Princess Moanna trapped in a reality she doesn't belong to: On the one hand there's an initial force that reveals the magical world when Ofelia finds a stone that fits in a monolith that looks like a gnome. From it, an insect comes out and Ofelia takes it as a fairy. Later on she discovers the labyrinth and from this her fantasy takes form. We see the insect again at night which then takes the form of a fairy; notice that at the request of Ofelia and that just before she was scared. This could be taken as an element that comforts, that is, as psychological self-protection. Finally, there's another iconic character named ""Ofelia"", Hamlet's fiancé; which goes mad. Coincidence? Or is the director trying to tell us something?<br/><br/>In both scenarios there is a central figure who governs and who designates the fate of others: in Franco's Spain is CAPTAIN VIDAL, who is presented as a cruel and arrogant character. He is the main villain and could be seen as the monster that devours children, the Pale Man; both present a danger to Ofelia, but only until you are tempted they turn against her. The FAUN is who rules the magical world and looks dark and evil. It emanates a certain danger and sometimes we doubt whether or not he's an ally to Ofelia, sometimes he even seems sarcastic. There is a certain resemblance between him and Vidal, as if the Faun has been ""contaminated"" by the evil influence of the second. Maybe in her fantasy Ofelia couldn't help but bringing some danger to the magical world.<br/><br/>The colours are mostly cold: blues and blacks. They present the desolation of war and the coldness of the forest and the labyrinth. Whenever there's danger, the colours turn to red and orange. Most of the film takes place at night or indoors, leaving little room for hope. In addition the camera movements (traveling shots following the character) achieve the feeling that something lurks in the darkness, of constant danger and they are being watched."

","Pan's Labyrinth is one of the few films I call beautiful film. It has a great main character with complex emotions. The cinematography is beautiful and Guillermo del Toro's direction is great. All the acting is great and Ivana Baquero who plays Ofelia the protagonist gives the best child performance of all time. Not only does she give one of the best child performance, but one of the best performances of all time. The creatures which is a staple in Guillermo's films are all practical effects which show the dedication to make a great film. This is one of my favorite films, so I recommend this film to everyone.

The creatures are all really cool and scary when needed (seriously that creature with eyes in his hands is terrifying). I also like how it incorporates the use of secrets. It has very good acting, even Ofelia (the child) is a very good actor. Cgi is very good.

I have never had loved a fantasy movie so much;The story, the script, the backdrop, the music, everything about the movie was amazing. <br/><br/>All the major cast gave spellbinding performances, though special mention must be given to Ivana Baquero who played the girl Ofelia, Sergi Lopez, who played captain Vidal, the monstrous army honcho, and Ofelia's stepfather and Maribel Verdu, who played the caretaker Mercedes.

"melissa_romein_8","10","2","4","21 November 2014"," One of the best fantasy movies.
","This is my first review ever so this may sound a bit crappy.<br/><br/>First of all I want to say that this movie is excellent and that everyone who loves fantasy movies should definitely watch this film.<br/><br/>The story is very fascinating. It takes place during the Spanish civil war. I think this is very nicely done since it blends a child's imagination with a very real war. <br/><br/>I was surprised by the amount of violence because at first I thought this was a movie for children. Make no mistake, this is not a movie for young children.<br/><br/>The acting work is good and convincing. The innocence of Ofelia the main character and the evil of her stepfather Captain Vidal is a very big contrast which shows the difference between fantasy and reality. <br/><br/>The costumes and sets are amazing. It really looks like they spend a lot of time and care about how the characters look like. No overuse of computer animated effects.<br/><br/>If you want to see a good and original fantasy story I really urge you to watch this movie. <br/><br/>This film proves that foreign movies can easily match the expensive Hollywood ones."
"thrillerrayne","8","2","4","5 September 2014"," An amazing adventure with Guillermo del Toro.
","I will try to keep this review short and to the point without containing any spoilers(i don't like spoiling movies for those who haven't seen it).<br/><br/>Guillermo is an awesome director/writer. Whatever he visualizes is reflected on film in a way that it feels like you're in his brain. And this movie is no exception. The story is set in 1944 Spain. And i have to say i'm not much of a movie buff but it's filmmakers like Mr Del Toro that really suck me in to their work from the first minute mark(no matter what the topic is). I love the visuals and being that i don't understand Spanish it didn't feel like a foreign movie because in a way you can understand everything that's going on. The acting the movement. It translates well to any country. This movie i feel can be enjoyed by any age demographic. Sure there's a little blood and violence. But i do believe the message is there outweigh whatever negative a parent can find. I thoroughly enjoyed myself watching this roller coaster ride of emotions. Because (trust me when i say this) you will be glued to your screen the moment you see beautiful Ofelia.<br/><br/>8/10"
"jkuhlmorgenhille","10","2","4","28 July 2014"," Stunning!
","I found this film to be one of the best I've ever seen. It mixes such wonderful genres with ease: War, Politics, History, Foreign Film, Fantasy, Family. The fact that it is in Spanish and is completely subtitled doesn't change a thing. The acting is so superb, you don't need to read the subtitles to understand what is happening.<br/><br/>The depth of emotion portrayed by 12 year old Ivana Baquero as Ofelia was second to none - a well seasoned actress could not have done a better job. Her range and believability was so strong I am just captured by her. Doug Jones was a real treat to watch as the Fauno & Pale Man - the movement of the Pale Man gave many nightmares to a lot of people where as the Fauno was played so well that there always was a question to his intentions. Maribel Verdu gave so much heart to the role of Mercedes - you really feel for her plight & victories. Sergei Lopez was very appropriate in his portrayal of the Capt. Vidal. His cruelty and small back story made an interesting villain. The cast was just so brilliant and so real - you get sucked into the story immediately.<br/><br/>The visuals must also be mentioned. The locations, sets & art were so breathtaking. The mood was always set so perfectly, the details were so well attended - I truly hope that future art direction in the fantasy genre take a page from this film's book.<br/><br/>I do not recommend this movie for children - but teens+ must see it. It is truly a feast for the mind, eyes and heart."

","What can I say that has not already been said? Pan's labyrinth is one of those movies that effects you so deeply, all you can do is sit there in silence and awe because of what just transpired before your eyes.<br/><br/>Cinematography, stupendous. Makes you feel like you're there, experiencing every grueling, emotionally-draining moment.<br/><br/>Scenery, beautiful. This mixed with the cinematography makes for a visual paradise. Call to mind the beautiful landscapes and that awesome Spanish mansion.<br/><br/>The story, compelling. Very original and very Guillermo del Toro. Are the girl's visions a reality or her imagination incorporating her thoughts and views reflected on the warring outside world?<br/><br/>The acting, phenomenal. The young girl who plays the lead is relatable and does a fine job.<br/><br/>I rank this film up with my top fifteen, maybe even top ten, favorite films of all time. Amongst the even flow of top 20 pop garbage and sequels to sequels of Michael Bay movies that weren't so hot the first time, there are few occasions when we rise over the disgrace, and conquer it. The end result is that of Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth."

","I had my first viewing last night and this is definitely one of the most imaginative stories I've seen in a while. The suspense this movie creates is a bloody thrill. Guillermo del Toro will be remembered forever for this work. There was no compromise made here on his part, and he was able to have a realized dream. <br/><br/>This movie effectively drew the child & adult realities, and portrayed them both with fairness. The play these two realities create is what drives this movie. What it does best is to force the audience to question our world's constructed norms of bravery, courage, humanity, responsibility, truth and ultimately what is real? <br/><br/>A great movie to me has become that which can create a deeper understanding by drawing connections throughout our joint realities and showing the significance any single action can cause. What is worth living for, and what is worth dying for. This story has an opinion, and I enjoyed it."
"rtp4242","9","2","4","12 October 2013"," Pan's Labyrinth: A-Maze-ing.
","A little girl named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) imagines a world filled with faeries, a labyrinth and a faun, a half-man, half-goat. (Doug Jones) Ofelia desperately wants to escape her painful life, with a sadistic stepfather, named Vidal (Sergi Lopez) and a bed-ridden mother named Carmen (Adrianna Gill) The faun makes this escape possible by telling Ofelia that she is a great princess named Moanna, whose soul has been reincarnated in this body at this time. To return to her father a great king, she must complete three tasks. While Ofelia imagines this splendid world, the brutality of the Spanish civil war continues in the real world. Vidal, a captain in Franco's army kills the remaining resistance at will, not knowing that his personal cook, Mercedes (Maribel Verdu) and wife's doctor (Alex Angulo) are spies for the resistance, plotting against him and the rest of Franco's army. Does Ofelia complete the tasks given to her by the faun? Does Vidal crush the resistance? <br/><br/>I love this movie. The viewer can take it any number of ways, a simple child's fable, a brutal war movie, or a spiritual allegory that explains the joys of the next world. Part of Pan's Labyrinth is definitely reminiscent of Alice In Wonderland, but there is also something deeper conveyed in the story. Is the faun a demon, tempting Ofelia with food when she is hungry? Or is he an angel guiding her from this world to a world without hatred or pain? How do we gain admittance to that perfect world, through deeds (her tasks) or through the blood of someone who dies for us? The juxtaposition of a brutal world, and the promise of a spiritual world of bliss is sheer genius, and deserves praise. This is a war movie though, and therefore not meant for kids, the violence is abrasive, and meant to be so, as if to shock the viewer back to reality. The ending is fitting for a movie like this, I would have been disappointed if it ended any other way.<br/><br/>The acting is spellbinding, especially by Ivana Baquero, who portrays Ofelia with a childlike innocence, but also an adult's courage. It's an amazingly complex performance for a 12 year old. Sergi Lopez is just evil personified, but he is also smooth and confident, so one can see why a woman would fall for him, a well-rounded performance. Maribel Verdu is also impressive as the cook, who's a spy, she also becomes a surrogate mother for Ofelia as her mother gets sicker. Verdu shows an edge in her interactions with Vidal, but also shows tenderness with Ofelia.<br/><br/>Finally, the direction and writing bring all these disparate elements together. Writer and director Guillermo Del Toro combines the stunning visual beauty of a child's fable with the ugliness and brutality of the Spanish Civil War, and the effect is breathtaking. This movie is both a visual feast, splashed with bright colors, and deep spiritual ideas done in a thoughtful, persuasive way. If your only experience with Del Toro is Pacific Rim, give this one a try, it's a much better film.<br/><br/>For more amazing book and movie reviews, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com"

","I had high expectations for this movie. It was impressive as far as the work that went into it, but I didn't enjoy the story that much. I liked the symbolism and I appreciated the fact that everything had a purpose-- every visual, every line of dialog had something to do with the theme. One analysis I've read suggested that Ophelia, by clinging to her books and fantasy world represents a need or appreciation for stories, which is ""human,"" and that the dad is ""inhuman"" because he only cares about routines, procedures, and the passing of time. The creatures were great to look at, and there were many moments that I enjoyed, but I don't think I'll watch it again."

","The film is a mix of fantasy and originality of struggle, in all forms. It is a story about a girl who loves to read a lot of fairy tales. Destiny has something very wonderful written for her. The beauty of the film is represented in the combination of the two stories. One belongs to fantasy which the girl sees and the other being of the captain who has his own aims. The film may not be suited to all, but you'll not feel bored during the 2 hours.<br/><br/>PROS: <br/><br/>I am not very good in finding the pros and cons of cinematography or art direction, but in this film the most important part was the art direction which has given it a Gothic look as well as cute look sometimes. The story is very well in the way that it is full of suspense and twists. You will experience the unexpected all the time. The acting is fine. The ambiance of the film at all times is haunting and this helps to set the mood which is really required while watching. The sets, costumes and soundtracks have all contributed to the greatness of the film.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>The girl – Olefia is cute but at some times her acting looked to be wooden.

","Pan's Labryinth provides a wonderful combination of imagination and powerful story telling. The setting is perfect for the plot of the story, a young girl named Ofelia, lives in war torn environment where in her mother has had the misfortune of marrying a crazed general of Franco's army. Her escape is one of her making, through her imagination she creates a world filled with horrifying monsters and elaborate stages for her surreal escape from reality. The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10 out of 10 is because I felt there was some disconnect between some of the ideas that the various monsters Ofelia will interact with throughout."

The fact that the main character, an 11 year old girl, Ophelia can be caught in two such dangerous worlds, is quite astounding. The other characters in this film are participants in one or another, the faun and fairies in the fantasy, the captain, mother and servants in the midst of the Spanish Revolution. The youngest, and therefore considered weakest, least mature of the characters is given the task to not only survive in both worlds, but to thrive and succeed in the tasks given to her. Despite bombs, and the loss of her only biological parental figure, as well as being hunted by monsters and suspicious fantasy characters alike, we find that Ophelia beats all odds and becomes the most prosperous of the characters. Despite that to the eyes of those grounded in the revolutionary realm, Ophelia dies, there is still hope that from death, life can still prosper. This is one of the most successful movies I have seen at merging what is considered real, from what is imagined, and leaving the audience to decide which is the truth."

Especially the small mythical creatures, and the pan are animated very well and are cast with a lot of detail on the screen. The best was definitely the monster with the seeing hands, which certainly has not only startled the little girl. The acting skills of the performers are located in the upper level and can definitely convince. Especially fascinated was the cold, brutal nature of the villain, played by Sergi López. But the little girl pulls with your naive nature the audience on your side.<br/><br/>At the end, this is a film that has two story elements associated with each other and thus not a typical fairy tale, but not a purebred war drama. Although this is the balance between the reality and the fantasy world this works quite well. The film is recommended in any case although some scenes are brutal. Although the film has not enchanted me completely, you should not miss this story ... only the children should first be sent to bed, is is magical but not for the kids.

","Weaving a fairy tale into a harsh war environment, combining historical drama, fantasy elements and horror and make everything work when it is played against each other is not an easy task. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" works. Mexican director Guillermo del Toro tells a little girl's story in fascist Spain of 1944, and it is full with mythology, symbols, lush colors, jaw dropping scenery, dreamlike music and lots of imagination. Coming from his heart, conceived years before he finally could commit it to celluloid, del Toro knows what strings to pull in the film which he also authored. As a director he prefers real sets, miniature shots and actors over CGI, and while the latter has its part as well, it is more a supportive role in order to tell the tale. Said tale is far more than the traditional good versus evil, it's about contrasts and the collision of worlds for sure, but also about choices within and outside realities if you will, about convictions and truths only found in one's self.<br/><br/>In a way ""Pan's Labyrinth"" has a lot to do with Terry Gilliam's absurd fantasy retro-sci-fi film ""Brazil"" or even ""Tideland"", though it differs distinctly in style from these examples. And like Gilliam's pictures ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is like a breath of fresh air for those who want to get out more of fantasy than the common orc bashing. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a fairy tale and tragic reality at the same time, a visual feast for the eye and food for thought, filmed poetry to be enjoyed and appreciated more with every viewing. If you like intelligent fantasy, this is your thing."

I rate my movies in 4 categories; Cinematography, film-making, acting and the overall experience. <br/><br/>Cinematography: This one of the best visuals I have ever seen in a movie, the whole movie is enclosed in a dark and eerie tone that looks amazing, everything fits perfectly. Nothing ever looks happy in this film, and that is what brings out the picture. 25/25<br/><br/>Film-making: Guillermo del Toro is a brilliant film maker. He's the foreign version of Peter Jackson. His editing is superb, the Pale man and other creatures look absolutely amazing and the setting of this movie is amazing. 25/25<br/><br/>Acting: It's hard to rate the acting, because you have to focus on two things. The body language and facial expressions of the actor and how the actor speaks. With the body language I see nothing wrong, but seeing as it is Foreign I can not tell. 25/25<br/><br/>Overall Experience: I highly loved this film.

","Pan's Labyrinth-****- A Masterpiece- Directed by: Guillermo del Toro. Written by: Guillermo del Toro, Starring: Sergi Lopez, Maribel Verdu, Ivana Baquero, Alex Angulo, Doug Jones, Ariadna Gil, Manolo Sol, Roger Casamajor.<br/><br/>When the term fantasy film comes to mind, one normally thinks of Lord of the Rings or Alice in Wonderland. What does not come to mind is a masterpiece made for art house viewings. Yet that is exactly what this film represents, a contradiction to Hollywood fantasy. The story covers a young girl (Baquero) who finds peace and security in a fantasy world where she must prove herself as queen of. However, reality rears its ugly head and forces Baquero into the sinister world of fascist Spain in 1944 under the wrath of her violent step-father (Lopez).<br/><br/>What gives this art house film by Guillermo del Toro its brilliance is how it combines a brutally violent reality with a truly beautiful fantasy. The two do not play off each other and that is where del Toro's talent as a filmmaker comes in. He makes sure the two contradicting parts of the story do not play against each other and make the movie uneven, instead the two work together as a consistent whole. This is where most current Hollywood filmmakers go wrong is their inability to bring even the slightest of contradicting story elements together.<br/><br/>The bleakness of reality is shockingly portrayed through Lopez's character who murders people for his own satisfaction. The innocence of the fantasy is portrayed through Baquero's innocent character who simply wants a world of love around her. del Toro understands that a masterpiece of art does not just have one level, it has multiple levels of thought process in order to completely understand it. He uses characters to convey the symbolism of both of his worlds he has created and he also questions us in the fact that the fantasy world actually exists.<br/><br/>Is the fantasy world just an imaginary place or a real place discovered by a young girl? He leaves those questions up to us. He tells his story and then leaves the rest for us to reflect on. That is what makes this a work of art, not a work of commercial filmmaking. It's beautiful and horrifying, it's lovely and hateful, it's a masterpiece."

"Kubris","9","2","4","1 September 2011"," Beautifully realized fairy tale- for adults
","Pan's Labyrinth, or El Laberinto del Fauno, is a film that will amaze you. Both delicate and brutal, del Toro created what he perfectly described as a fairy tale for adults. The film follows Ofelia, stepdaughter to a fascist Spanish Captain, as she uses her imagination to cope with life in the country, in a mill occupied by fascists headed by her stepfather. It also follows the rebels as they try to take the mill. They're very well interwoven, bouncing off each other.<br/><br/>In the prologue by del Toro on the Blu Ray (the film looks breathtaking in HD), he tells of how he put much love into making the film, and it's absolutely true. The shots are gorgeous. The lighting notably sets the mood, starting off bright but becoming darker. The sets are grand, especially the fantasy ones. The orchestral score accompanies throughout, quietly affecting your emotions. The visual effects are stunning, and the make-up is scary in some scenes. No corners were cut making this film.<br/><br/>Ofelia meets a faun, and is informed she is a princess who must complete 3 tasks to return to her old realm. She meets creatures, which are cool (Faun), gross (toad) and the iconic Pale Man, in the best scene in the film for many reasons. These creatures look wonderful.<br/><br/>Other creatures, like Ofelia's stepfather Vidal, are not wonderful. Pan's Labyrinth make look childish, but it is R-Rated. A man's face is effectively destroyed. A leg is severed. Stitches are graphically shown. While not as explicit as shock movies, the contrast with innocent Ofelia makes the violence hard to watch.<br/><br/>Lots of thought has been put into Pan's Labyrinth. Themes and motifs are layered deep, and wrapped up in a package of sensitivity. You can interpret it how you like. The ending is bittersweet, and very fitting to the atmosphere and aura of the film. Pan's Labyrinth is a top- notch film, and most certainly one of the best ever. It offers you a reason to think. 8.7/10"
"bigbossfilms-1","Null","2","4","21 March 2007"," Panned Labyrinth
","Equal parts Lewis Carroll, Hieronymus Bosch and the Greatest Skits of Martin Scorsese, Guillermo del Toro's lysergic, Franco-era fantasy will entrance those with a taste for gruesome hocus-pocus and leave others unfulfilled by its hybridised riffing on timeworn themes.<br/><br/>The story concerns a young girl, Ofelia (played with considerable charm by Ivana Baquero), who is taken by her pregnant mother to a Fascist outpost under the command of Sergi López's brutal Captain  the father of our protagonist's unborn half-sibling. Once in her miserable exile, played out against a backdrop of forest insurgencies by leftist guerrillas, Ofelia soon encounters the titular maze, meeting therein a mysterious faun, Pan, who reveals to her three tasks that might lead to her redemption and rebirth as a princess of his realm. <br/><br/>The shadow of Clive Barker hangs brooding over Pan's Labyrinth, which often cranks up the squirm and shock factors in a bid for authentically adult kudos. Del Toro determinedly steers clear of the kind of whimsical escapism virtually patented by Terry Gilliam: for every cutesy fairy, there's a bullet in the head; wherever stardust falls, a bloodied civilian follows suit, grounding the piece in a bedrock of unpleasant reality. This principle of balance works, up to a point. After the second act, it becomes rigidly metronomic.<br/><br/>Subtlety in the way of emotional depth is likewise in short supply, as are broader dramaturgical complexities such as motivational or moral explorations in what is a Manichean fable. The Captain, who comes across like Vito Corleone with a migraine, rams home his nastyboots credentials in a series of heavy-handed attacks against all and sundry. Indeed, all the film's central characters are by-the-numbers Good or Bad, two-dimensionally sketched and for the most part thematically sidelined in favour of what are the real attractions here: the inventively grotesque, Narnia-gone-septic monsters in which del Toro obviously delights.<br/><br/>Moviegoers with a predilection for Hellraiser et al will find much to enjoy here, as will older Jim Henson fans who have not yet had lunch. But, Pan's Labyrinth is ultimately a meretricious exercise in aesthetic showboating. Though it looks undeniably sumptuous, and its set design is pungently evocative, mythologists and militarists alike may find its themes  of trial and redemption, warfare, loyalty and love (in the latter lies real magic, boys and girls)  unpalatably hackneyed. We've simply been through this looking glass, down this rabbit hole, behind this wardrobe, onto this battlefield and into this chamber of horrors before, and no amount of visual panache can disguise this when it hides in plain sight. Perhaps the only thing truly special about the ""visionary"" del Toro's admittedly handsome mise-en-scène is that he has, in plumping for a magic-realist mish-mash that only partly succeeds in either sense, lucratively overhauled a trite schema, and in so doing moved the risible Blade II down a line on his CV. Pan's Labyrinth, superficially beguiling as it is, is in the end little more than a lovely-ugly Wonderland of face-smashing clichés."

","Someone else has commented that a knowledge of Greek Mythology and Freudian Psychology would be useful when watching this film. Without that (and my knowledge of both is poor) I think it's difficult to grasp the ""message"" (if there is one). I am not sure where the links are between the Spanish Civil War and a young girl's nightmarish fantasy world. However, my thoughts are that this film is about what we live and die for. What is worth sacrificing. The blurred line between fantasy and reality. Loss of innocence (shame, guilt, fear, failure, sexuality, death) and redemption.<br/><br/>This film left me feeling very disturbed without being able to say why exactly. I found myself unable to think about much else for hours afterwards. There's a cleverness and a powerfulness here (mostly in the cinematography) which is ""brilliant"", I guess, in its own dark way.

","Pan's Labyrinth AKA Laberinto del Fauno, El is a one-of-a-kind movie. Thinking this would be a dumb child-fantasy movie and I would fall asleep during it, I was surprised by almost everything in this thriller. A girl, Ofelia played by Ivana Baquero and her pregnant mother traveled a long way to live with her new step dad, who happened to be the leader of a communist-like nation.<br/><br/>Ofelia's mother was days from dying. Her father, Capitán Vidal played by Sergi López wanted a new male child, who would follow his footsteps and lead their nation to victory over a group of rebels. Ofelia knew not to trust her step dad, because she knew he didn't care about them. He only cared for the unborn baby. While the day seemed dark and nights seemed darker, Ofelia's mother died giving birth, leaving Ofelia all alone.<br/><br/>Although the majority of the film was all about the life of Ofelia and the war of the communist-like nation vs. the good rebels, a good part of this film was also based around Ofelia's imagination. The Pan Man was a creature from another world which came to Earth to take Ofelia back home, to her real father and mother who were Kings and Queens of a perfect imaginary world. But before she could leave Earth, she would have to complete three dangerous steps, given to her by a magical book.<br/><br/>I would give this film a 9.5/10.

It keeps you teetering back and forth between fantasy and reality and even if you were to remove all the fantasy aspects of this film it would still be an excellent vision. The performances by Ofelia and the Captain are amazing and I hate to say it's a shame that they are Spanish speaking actors because I would love to see more of them in American films. I left the theater entranced by the world that was created in Labyrinth and it keeps you thinking about the characters for quite some time after. The beauty of this film extends beyond the story as the cinematography is breathtaking, I felt like a child as I marveled at the images flashed before my eyes.

Who knew the director of ""The Mimic"" and ""Hellboy"" (Guillermo del Toro) would have this movie in his back pocket?? Even though I was slightly disappointed that there weren't more fantasy scenes in the movie (I was thinking along the lines of Narnia), but was still awed by the expert directing that del Toro used to mixed harsh reality with terrifying fantasy. The movie keeps everyone guessing on whether the fantasy is completely in the little girl's head, or if it actually exist in reality. This puzzle keeps the audience on the edge of their seats, especially during the dangerous sequences where the girl tries to escape the fantasy world. In the end, when everything is revealed, the solution is satisfying and original.<br/><br/>The cinematography is superb in this movie, accentuating the mood and atmosphere of every scene and sometimes blurring the lines separating reality with fantasy. I was in awe the entire time at how vivid, complex, and frightening the girl's imagination was, and how necessary it is for her to escape the painful life she lives in.<br/><br/>For me, it was the ending that glued the entire movie together into a very powerful work of art. I won't spoil the movie or the surprise here, but I strongly encourage everyone to see this wonderful movie!

","A month has passed since I saw this film and it still leaves a lasting impression on my mind. Every aspect of this film fits into place to leave a jigsaw of perfection that is built up from the first scene. The story moves at exactly the right pace, slow at first whilst characters are built and emotional responses to situations mark out the variety of human personalities. Captain Vidal is set out initially as the evil and powerful bad guy as set out in the first and second acts. Nevertheless, he is shown as vulnerable through delusion in the third part of this film. The virtuous show their imperfect sides too as witnessed by Ofelia's temptation in an almost biblical scene. Ofelia being the vision of sweetness whose selfish side almost results in her almost certain doom. The supporting characters battle with their respective turmoil's of loyalty versus fear. The storytelling concentrates on the variety of emotions displayed by all humans - no-one is truly good or evil, just differing shades of grey in-between. The acting really is the stuff of professionals who do what they do for the love of the craft and puts the high-paid Hollywood set to shame. As far as special effects are concerned, this is a relatively low budget film by today's standard. The effects are supplemental to the movie, rather than overbearing. Del Toro uses the funds and tools at his disposal in a masterful if under-stated way. You'll be left remembering the fantastic Faun and Pale Man far longer than anything seen in Lord of the Rings or Star Wars. It really is a case of less is the new more in this picture. Scenery is suitably bleak and fantastical by turn depending on the scene. In the real world, we see an overbearing forestry location of Spain that is overlooked by visitors to the country Finally, the score is helpfully underplayed - I'm not a huge critic of music one way or the other in a film, but the music in this film contributes hugely to each scene and never oversteps the mark of being overbearing. In a world where action film sequels and brain-dead rom-coms rule, this film is a shining beacon of originality and passion for the art of film-making for the masses. It's a crying shame that this film has received such deserved excellent critical acclaim but will probably be sadly over looked by the majority of film-goers and award givers alike. Nevertheless, I loved this film and have recommended it to everyone I know as my film of the year for 2006."

In the landscape of current film there are so many films that seem to vanish from your mind as the end credits roll. 'Pan' is certainly NOT one of those films. It's a welcome breath of fresh air and a marvel to behold.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of young Ofelia, whose father has recently died in the Spanish Civil War. Her pregnant mother, Caremen, has married again. Her suitor is the incredibly vicious and despicable Captain Vidal.<br/><br/>To escape the harsh realities of her life, Ofelia falls deep into a world of fantasy. Here she meets a faun who tells her the story of a young princess who's soul was taken from the fantasy world and put into the real world. It's the faun's belief that her soul rests in Ofelia. To prove her worthiness, Ofelia must complete three tasks. One of these tasks envolves facing The Pale Man. Those who have seen this creature will most certainly never forget him.<br/><br/>Back in the real world, a housekeeper and personal doctor who work for the captain, are sneaking supplies to the nearest rebels. This could cost them their lives at the cruel hands of Captain Vidal.<br/><br/>'Pan's Labyrinth' is a film so richly textured and beautifully made that it holds a huge requirement for repeat viewings. The film presents a world so vivid you loose your sense of place and are engulfed inside a world of alternating fantasy and reality. For two hours, this is the only world you know. You are transported. Every detail and nuance is nailed by the people behind the scenes.<br/><br/>Though the film has many noteworthy performances, I will single out Sergi Lopez, whose portrayal of Captain Vidal has many critics drawing comparisons to Ralph Finnes in 'Schindler's List'. That comparison is extremely apt. Lopez is fittingly calm in his brutality. This film has many critics raving and slapping the term ""Masterpeice!"" on to their reviews. It is, in this case, one of the few terms that can justifiably describe the vivid beauty that is 'Pan's Labyrinth'!<br/><br/>The #2 Film of 2006."

My partner has a low tolerance for the depiction of brutality on screen and found some elements of this film hard to watch. so i guess a word of warning not to watch this film mistakenly with kids as some of it would leave them squirming for months. all in all a fantastic watch and an amazing achievement in cross genre writing"

In fact the camera never shies away from these shocking scenes. The characters are very aware of what is happening around them and many of them become caught in a stalemate. Some try to struggle against the oppression - you can feel their burdens and distress - and win back their freedom <br/><br/>The weathered art direction and evocative makeup is sensual and nostalgic. The colours are very dark browns, greens and blues which suit the macabre content and atmosphere of the film, but this also contrasts well with the labyrinth that Ofelia escapes into.<br/><br/>The film is very ominous at times and more balanced towards telling the story of the war rather than this young girl. I felt the film was a bit lopsided towards the violence and politics and not wondrous enough in the element of fantasy. I would have liked to know more about Ofelia, and delve deeper into her fantasies. Ofelia is played with such charm, inquisitiveness, with intelligence and beauty that it she becomes irresistible to love. I was disappointed that her storyline was not made exploited more in the film as Ofelia's interpretation of the world around her would have made some for thrilling scenes.<br/><br/>In addition, we do not see much of her fantasies and they do not push the film's plot greatly in any way. The film's editing was also a but choppy at times and there were some moments that seemed to lack energy or a spark, and I found myself hoping the plot would move along.<br/><br/>In any case, this is fine film, held up by the wonderful set decoration, make-up and vivid recreation of evergreen civil war Spain. The score sustains the film's horror and hope, ravishingly composed by Javier Navarrete. Thanks to the likes of del Toro and Iñárritu, Mexican cinema has been deservedly celebrated with a rich narrative and fantastical cultural elements. These are stunning filmmakers. Don't miss your chance to see this one.<br/><br/>P.S: This film has been nominated for an amazing 6 academy awards without being recognised in the major categories and as a foreign film. This is fantastic cinematic craft."
"EUyeshima","9","2","4","25 January 2007"," An Audacious, Magical and Eye-Wincing Epic of Emotional Power
","The remnants of the bloody, three-year Spanish Civil War were still deeply felt in the throes of WWII, and Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro captures the virulence of the country's relentlessly oppressive state in no uncertain terms in his beautifully realized 2006 film, a powerful combination of vivid history and fantastical allegory. Be forewarned that this movie is not for the faint-hearted, as it contains some of the most grisly images I have seen on screen. However, they are truly essential to the story that del Toro unfolds with emotional precision since they reflect and echo the brutalizing violence during that time when Franco's armies were still eliminating what was left of the Republican rebels in hiding five years after the war's end.<br/><br/>Set around D-Day in 1944 as the Allies are turning the tide of the war, the film takes place in a remote area of northern Spain where ten-year old Ofelia and her pregnant mother Carmen come to live with her new stepfather, Captain Vidal, the deceptive and sadistic commander of the local outpost. Steeped in her fantasy books, Ofelia is a child often lost in her imagination, and she is drawn to a mysterious stone labyrinth on the property. It is here that she meets the Pale Man, a pedantic faun who assigns three onerous tasks which she must complete by the next full moon in order for her to realize her throne as a princess of the underworld. While this sounds like the trappings of an optimistic fairy tale in ""The Wizard of Oz"" mode, it turns out to be far from it, as del Toro creates a purely Gothic world of eye-wincing creatures and actions not far removed from those found in mainstream American sci-fi horror movies. The genuine power of the film comes from the way he juxtaposes this fanciful, scarifying world with the persecution of the resistance fighters and the absolutist, ego-driven domain Vidal has established at the outpost. Each distinctive piece of the movie brings resonance to the other, all the way to the climactic point where they collide in an inevitable way at the end.<br/><br/>Looking a bit like the pre-adolescent Natalie Portman, Ivana Baquero brings a plaintive, yearning quality to Ofelia that is thankfully free of precociousness. As Vidal, Sergi López effectively brings steely resolve to his role while hinting at the paternal approval his character never received. Maribel Verdú, memorable as the older woman in Alfonso Cuarón's ""Y tu mamá también"", brings coiled power to the pivotal role of Vidal's house servant Mercedes. Also solid are Ariadna Gil as the frail Carmen who acquiesced to Vidal's need for a son, Álex Angulo as a kindly doctor, and Doug Jones as the special effects-laden Pale Man. Special kudos need to go to Guillermo Navarro's striking, moody cinematography; Eugenio Caballero's imaginative set designs; and the special visual and sound effects crucial in creating such an otherworldly mood. Unafraid to show scenes of unrelenting horror, Del Toro has created what ultimately is a magical film so audacious in execution that it defies description. Along with Cuarón's ""Children of Men"" and Alejandro González Iñárritu's ""Babel"", this film shows a true renaissance among Mexican filmmakers on a global landscape."

","If is what I thought of the movie.<br/><br/>When I heard it was in subtitles I was saying to myself ""OH CRAP!"" But I seen it anyways. You forget that you are reading the subtitles because there was always a part that made the movie interesting. The Lybrinth isn't really a Lybrinth. Its more like a temple in a Zelda game. Actolly, the movie is exactly like a Zelda game. There are only a couple monsters and you only see them for a few. The chase scene is short. And one part a girl is getting chased through the labyrinth, what does that sound like? OH YEAH! The Shining! Most of the movie was about World War 2, and the movie had a lot of the main people dieing. I wont tell who though! Its sad, violent, and interesting. AND NOT FOR KIDS!!! Lol, so see the movie!"

","This is a film after which I simply cannot find the words to express it's brilliance. And these kinds of films are a rarity not only in the modern day film, but in the film history as such. This film proves that fairy tales are not dead, if done right. And this one is done more than right.<br/><br/>I guess I should say that I have always loved classic fairy tales. El Laberinto Del Fauno takes the formula of the classic fairy tale, but throws in elements of many other genres, such as horror, drama and war. But at it's core, Laberinto is a fairy tale. I wouldn't suggest seeking any symbolism or super deep thought in this piece, because this film doesn't really have any of that. Or at least I didn't found any of that. Or maybe I didn't want to find that? Because, seriously, what are fairy tales made for? Challenging your imagination, exploring human emotion, finding the inner child. Fairy tales find a warm place in your heart and stay there, they don't care about your mind. Laberinto, however, progresses and shows that fairy tales have grown up and they follow the changes around them. Laberinto is a brilliant example of the evolution of a genre. It is a fairy tale for those who have grown up, who want to see the brutality and honesty of the real world, yet want the innocence of the classic fairy tale, the one that stays in your heart.<br/><br/>Laberinto works on all levels possible. The acting, the cinematography, the story, the editing, the music, the imagination, the honesty - everything is top notch and straight up brilliant. This is an instant classic, something everyone can remember. Something everyone can keep in their hearts forever.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Pandora_box","10","2","4","25 January 2007"," A very original and gripping film
","Have just watched this and thought it was excellent. The fantasy and real-life stories complemented each other well. The special effects were great, and as a viewer you were transported into Ofelia's secret world which she uses to escape her unhappy life with her step-father, a Captain in the fascist army. The girl who plays this protagonist, Ivana Baquero, was amazing. So too was Maribel Verdú who plays Mercedes (also in 'Y Tu Mama Tambien'), a close friend of Ofelia. Perhaps the best thing I liked about the film was its unpredictability, even until the end. Although there are a few traumatic scenes to sit through, they are there to show the horrors of Spanish fascism and resistance during the 1930s."
"bpreston41-1","7","2","4","22 January 2007"," There is really no escape into fantasy here, just distraction
","(There are really no spoilers below; I mention only what reviewers have already commented on.)<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth"" combines del Toro's two fascinations: fantasy a la ""Hell Boy"" and fascism a la 'The Devil's Backbone."" He combines these two in such a way that they do not at all seem to be opposites. There is no chance for the ten year old girl, Ofelia, to escape into a fantasy world of fairies and magic to avoid the harshness of life with her stepfather, a fascist Captain, and her suffering, pregnant mother, not when the world of fantasy she finds in an ancient labyrinth near where she is staying is just as dark and fearsome for her. Thus we are only momentarily distracted from the horrors of the fascist world by the horrors of the fantasy world she finds. (<br/><br/>Even Pan, the faun who makes Mr. Tumnus of ""Narnia"" fame look (as one reviewer said), like Woody Allen, is a scary figure, enormous, with horns that would unbalance any other decent antlered creature in a second and eyes that desperately need re-aligning by plastic surgery. And 'seeing' seems to be one of the themes here, for there is also the monster Ofelia encounters who is able to see only with the eyeballs in his hands--a new take on the ogre, as the paintings around him suggest. Yet what is the meaning to this theme of seeing?<br/><br/>It's not that Ofelia needs to see or understand anything in particular. She is instinctively able to tell that her stepfather is a monster and that the housekeeper, Mercedes, is someone she can trust. Half the time, the viewer wonders if the things that Pan tells her to do are really just things that her instincts tell her to do, given full shape and voice. (Except for the business of the mandrake root. No child could come up with that idea. It's worth the price of admission to this film to see the mandrake sequences that leave you wondering what kind of odd, chthonic belief system it came out of.)<br/><br/>What the 'seeing' image seems to relate to is our vision: of what fascism is really like. If all you know of it has been gained by studies of the Holocaust and images of Hitler shouting at massive crowds at Nurenberg, it is enlightening to see personal fascism, the kind where someone believes so strongly in a master race or simply a definite class system that he is willing to kill anyone he doesn't like, shows no pity, never sees his own flaws or mistakes, and is so brutal that he actually is scarier than the ogre with the eyeballs in his hands. Even scenes where he's shaving with an old, straight razor keep you on edge; you keep wondering if he'll slash out at someone, even though he's alone in such scenes, and I kept hoping his hand would slip and make him draw his own blood.<br/><br/>Against such a back drop, Ofelia's tasks (hat she must accomplish before going back to a kingdom in the earth where she really is a princess) are just part of a cruel landscape. She is a plucky little heroine, like Alice, if one could imagine Alice returning from the rabbit hole frequently, only to meet monsters instead of a pretty British meadow and her nanny.<br/><br/>I don't know if I can recommend this movie. At least twice, I had my eyes screwed tight and fingers in my ears and was doing a mental 'la la la' in attempts to not hear what was going on on the screen. The rest of the time I was clutching John's hand and he was clutching back. If you don't mind scenes of torture, or if you can simply refer to this as a horror film and forget the fantasy label, you might be able to see it and enjoy it the way you might 'enjoy' ""Saw"" or some other such horrific, bloody entertainment."
"jaredmobarak","9","2","4","21 January 2007"," My mother told me to be wary of faunsPan's Labyrinth
","Finally Buffalo is able to see the phenomenon Pan's Labyrinth for itself. All the hype and the acclaim have definitely raised expectations for this film by visionary Guillermo del Toro. For myself, I really just wanted to see a del Toro film outside of the Hollywood realm. Sure I liked both Blade II and Hellboy, but it's the other Spanish language films, Cronos and The Devil's Backbone, that have been intriguing me for years. After watching his latest effort, I can say nothing less than that I can't wait to check those other two out even more. Pan's is an amazing feat of imagination and great storytelling put together as no one else could.<br/><br/>The one aspect that lingers upon its completion is the fact that everything that occurred seemed so original, and each plot progression a surprise. Maybe this fact impresses me more because of the homage to other films. Many things here are so familiar and have been seen before, yet each instance seems fresh. The ability to make these activities his is astonishing. Also, the deft handling of the fairy-tale narrative with its real world war counterpart is expertly done. The film never delves completely into the mythical realm, (actually this fact disappointed me), and keeps its two paths running parallel while also enhancing each other. There are some very nice transitions between both environments as well as great editing montages showing glimpses of each at one time.<br/><br/>In the end, this film is about war and fighting for what you believe is right. When the time comes to defeat an unjust tyrant, you need to be willing to sacrifice yourself for the cause of humanity. We are thrown into a civil war in Spain against the regime that has recently taken over. The rebels refuse to back down to a general, (Sergi López exuding his malicious intent at every turn), who is a brutal warlord that does not see all of Spain as equal. This monster is not just up against the people's guerilla rebellion, however, but also on the other side of his stepdaughter's quest for identity. Young Ofelia, played magnificently by Ivana Baquero in a role that normally plays in child-fare yet needs a greater sense of weight in an adult tale like this, (it is R-rated after all), sees her mother making the error of marrying this ruthless army man. Her mother is sick with child after the general made them travel late in her pregnancy in order to see his heir born. With utter disregard for all but his namesake, Ofelia must disappear into her imagination to find out what she is truly made of. With the death of her father and the slow detachment to her mother, the child puts herself into a fantasy story she has read about a girl from an underground world that came to the surface, allowing for her soul to remain forever. Ofelia takes the mantle of this princess and begins her quest to leave the atrocities happening around her for the royal life of a happier realm.<br/><br/>I really like the fact that del Toro was not afraid to make this film for adults. The underlying morality is similar to Jim Henson's Labyrinth, yet here it does not cater to a young sensibility. This is not a girl renouncing her brother and needing to go on a quest to discover her love for others, this is a child trapped amongst the hell that earth can be. Death and pain surround her at all turns and she then must manifest that danger into her fantasies of survival. There are no cute and cuddly creatures on display here. The fairies guiding her are created from insects and have agendas of their own, the conduit between worlds, Pan, is an aging faun with a temper and disgust for humanity, and the evil entities are truly scary, (the toad and the Pale Man). There is blood, and lots of it, throughout the duration, whether during battle scenes or not. This is the world these characters are living in and rather than cop-out saying Ofelia is just a child who does not understand the gravity of what's happening, del Toro allows her to not only realize everything, but be the one that the audience watches battle through the hardships.<br/><br/>All fantasy moments are beautifully orchestrated and gorgeous to look at. Whether at the portal to the underground world with Pan, to the majestic hallway of the Pale Man, you really get to see the director's imagination to full effect. I don't believe it could have been pulled off quite as effectively without Doug Jones becoming these mythical beings. Like he did as Abe Sapien in Hellboy, he truly creates these creatures and makes them real through motion. Maribel Verdú is also amazing as heart and soul to Ofelia while her mother lays sick in bed. The relationship these two strike up is necessary to counteract what is happening with the war, and her Verdú's involvement in that story thread is also effective.<br/><br/>My only real problem with this film, a true visceral masterpiece otherwise, is the treatment of the mystical storyline. While it is executed to perfection, it is merely just an afterthought to what is happening. The fantasy aspect almost appears to only serve a purpose in keeping Ofelia away from the battles and never truly fleshes itself into its own unique identity. I wish for there to have been more fantastical elements rather than just being used as an escape. With that said, however, the conclusion truly is as effective as it can be in bringing the two worlds together. Del Toro surprises again, right to the end, unafraid to finish a fairytale against the genre's usual type."
"LadyLiberty","9","2","4","21 January 2007"," Pan's Labyrinth a Real Find
","Pan's Labyrinth takes place in Spain in 1944. The Spanish Civil War is over, but Franco's fascist troops continue to root out the Republican resistance. It's in the midst of these unsettled times that young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her pregnant mother, Carmen (Ariadna Gil) travel to the northern countryside to stay with Carmen's new husband  one of Franco's officers  Capitán Vidal (Sergi López).<br/><br/>Ofelia is more than a little unsettled by all of this, but her mother admonishes her that the Captain has been good to them and she urges the girl to call him ""Father."" Ofelia doesn't refuse, but she doesn't agree, either. Instead, she buries her nose in one of her beloved books.<br/><br/>Upon arrival, Ofelia reluctantly greets the stern Capitán Vidal and meets his housekeeper, Mercedes (Maribel Verdú). While the adults are distracted with luggage and other such details, Ofelia escapes into the surrounding forest where she chases a large insect she finds fascinating. Soon she ends up at a stone archway that leads into a ruin. Just as she would explore further, Mercedes calls her away.<br/><br/>When Ofelia finally falls asleep that night, she wakes to strange sounds and discovers the insect  or one very much like it  fluttering about the room. She first accuses it of following her, and then smiles and asks it if it's a fairy. Surprisingly, the bug stops and sits on her legs almost as if it's considering. Ofelia pulls a book of fairy tales off the bedside table and opens it an illustration of a fairy on it. The bug promptly begins to move oddly, and then to contort itself into an entirely new shape and configuration. In just another moment, Ofelia is overjoyed to find she's right: the bug is a fairy!<br/><br/>The fairy beckons her to follow, and with all the trust of a child, Ofelia does. Soon, she's all the way back to the ruins. With the fairy to guide her, she finds a deep well with a staircase leading downward. When she finally reaches the bottom, she's disappointed to find nothing but more stones and an ancient statue. But with a sudden startling movement, she learns she's not alone after all when a frightening creature steps forward and introduces himself as a faun (Doug Jones). And the faun has an important assignment for her!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Carmen's pregnancy isn't going well and she's confined to bed rest by the kindly Dr. Ferreiro (Alex Angulo). Capitán Vidal, who is obsessed with the notion of having a son, leaves the execution of such things to others as he's occupied with tracking down and obliterating the rebels that infest the forested hills nearby. And he intends to do so, no matter the cost or the ruthlessness he might need to employ!<br/><br/>As Capitán Vidal tries to second-guess the rebels, Ofelia works to do what the faun has asked of her. She struggles in her tasks almost as much as the Captain does in his, and both emerge from their efforts covered in filth though of very different kinds. Intent on their own focus, the two try to ignore each other as much as possible. Still, they have a surprising amount in common as they both step into danger. It's what they do next, though, in the face of that danger that illustrates how the two really have nothing in common at all.<br/><br/>Sergi López is just fantastic as the hateful Capitán Vidal. His malevolence is so complete that I was actually shocked to read that the actor is more typically cast in light comedic roles! Ariadna Gil is just fine as the weak and fearful Carmen, while Maribel Verdú carries off very well the depiction of the efficient housekeeper with some dark secrets of her own. Doug Jones is surprisingly expressive despite being thoroughly covered with an intricate latex mask and costume, and the rest of the supporting cast is also quite good. 12 year-old Ivana Baquero (she was 11 when the movie was filmed) is a revelation. She stepped up to the plate and hit it out of the ballpark with a performance that puts many veterans to shame.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth was conceived of, written, and directed by Guillermo del Toro. His work in this film is brilliant The cinematography is utterly breathtaking, and the special effects are spot on. The sets are spectacular, and then there's the make-up which, whether it was depicting war wounds or fantastic creatures, was terrific. Adding to it all were more than a few inspired and flawlessly rendered edits.<br/><br/>The story itself is fascinating on any level you'd care to examine: On the surface, Pan's Labyrinth is a delightfully dark fairy tale. Deeper down, the escape of the child from war and tragedy into another world is unsurprising, but the fact even the other world holds its horrors is a lesson not lost on either Ofelia or her audience. And, of course, there are the inevitable intersections between worlds...<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth still isn't in wide release and, as a subtitled foreign language film (Spanish), it may never arrive in some smaller markets. But if you find it showing within driving distance, I assure you that it's well worth the time and effort. In any language and in any venue, Pan's Labyrinth is just plain one of the finest examples of movie-making and story-telling I've ever seen.<br/><br/>FAMILY SUITABILITY: Pan's Labyrinth is rated R for ""graphic violence and some language."" The violence, including scenes of torture, is truly graphic. The subject matter is also quite adult and somewhat complex. Add to that the fact that subtitles are involved, and you can completely eliminate young children from consideration for this film. For older teens (I'd say 16 or 17 and up) and for adults, though, Pan's Labyrinth offers a truly rare experience for theatre-goers. What a wonderful  and wonderfully affecting!  film!"

","A mother and daughter arrive at a mountain army camp in Civil War Spain. The Woman is married to it's commandant. The daughter is a reluctant visitor. Her father is dead and she has no liking for her new Step Father. We are made aware early on that the young girl either has a fanciful imagination or is in touch with an alternate reality.<br/><br/>While her sick mother stays in bed the girl is visited by an insect she saw in the woods, and this soon morphs into a fairy who beckons her to follow it. She is led to some ruins near by and there meets a Pan like creature, who tells her she is a long awaited Princess, and that she must perform three tasks to be able to become the Princess of the other world. Now we realize that the girl's imagination is hard at work.<br/><br/>The movie continues in these two layers: reality and fantastical imagination. Her Step Father turns out to be a fascist brute, whose only interest in the girl's mother is for her to deliver him a son. He is pursuing a gang of rebels hiding in the mountains and forests surrounding the camp. The camp has a mole who is the sister of the gang's leader.<br/><br/>The daughter's fantasy grows more and more elaborate as she uses it to escape from the loss of her father, and the mixed loyalties of her mother. Both stories grip one's attention. Brutality and heroism exist in both; sacrifices are made; and potentially fatal errors occur. There are monsters in both worlds! The cinematography is brilliant. The CGI superb. The makeup and costumes are flawless. Best of all it all comes together without jarring or disturbing juxtapositions.<br/><br/>While a child is the center piece of the movie, it is definitely not a movie for children. It is a violent and frightful world in both places, but it is also a place of heroic struggle between good and evil.<br/><br/>The ending surprised me and left me in tears. It was at the same time tragic and inspiring; depressing and uplifting.<br/><br/>The metaphors abound but are so well weaved that one can experience them without having to dissect them, until much later."

The cinematography is outstanding the acting so real and the effects so startling that you will live this movie in your memory for days after seeing it. The initial review on this board mentions that there are elements that we have seen before and I agree but have never seen them worked so perfectly. I wanted to mention that I took a 15 year old with me and she absolutely loved the film and has not stopped talking about it.

"samuelding85","8","2","4","20 January 2007"," The Labyrinth of A Innocent Child and Vicious Adults
","Pan's Labyrinth proves to be a fairy tale for adults and matured kids, or should i say, a fairy tale strictly for adults only? Guillermo Del Toro takes a very different approach in his 2nd tale revolving innocent children and adults with vicious hearts after his previous The Devil's Backbone. With both movies share the similar time line (where both stories were set in Spain during WW2), Del Toro once again brings the audience to the mysterious underworld, through the eyes of a child.<br/><br/>Devil's Backbone tells us about ghosts. Pan's Labyrinth tells us about fairies and demons. OK, enough about wandering ghosts and spirits seeking vengeance. We had Ofelia, a little girl who was said to be the princess of the underworld, where fairies lives together. However, in real life, she was a daughter of a late tailor and a housewife who became a Captain's wife, who rules a army belonging to the Fascist power. When Ofelia discovers a labyrinth with a bug that was actually a transformation of a fairy, she was drawn into the other world where she found out that she was a princess. However, she must pass through 3 test to regain her position of a princess.<br/><br/>Del Toro led the audience into a world of fantasy that was bizarre and amazing. Truly convincing and attractive, it draws the adult back into childhood memories, just like the bedtime stories told by the parents. However, Del Toro do not want to make the fantasy world too attractive, that people do not want to come back to the reality world. Thus, he blended and matches few characters, such as the Captain and Ofelia's mother, Mercedes (Captain's housekeeper) and Pedro, who are siblings joining the side of the guerrillas fighting against the Fascist power.<br/><br/>Ofelia's innocence and Captain's cruelty makes the movie a big comparison of human beings inner world. While Ofelia goes all the way to pass through the test, the Captain would do anything to save himself and his power. Every single test everyone goes through in Pan's Labyrinth tells the audience that life is not a bed of rose, where everything comes with a price. And to survive, they have to pass through the test, just like how Ofelia gone through the test, and survival of the human beings during war time.<br/><br/>The underworld puts the audience back to childhood, where Del Toro has successfully captured the heart of the audience, making them wanting to stay for the movie. However, reality seems to be longer than fantasy, as it was presented in the movie, where Ofelia's contact with the underworld takes up slightly lesser than half of the total duration of the film.<br/><br/>The tour of the labyrinth gives the audience a not so sweet adventure, with distasteful scenes related to war violence. But still, it is fun and exciting to explore them.<br/><br/>Take the opportunity to explore the labyrinth, and surprises awaits you."

I believe this film will go down as a classic in years to come and really should be seen by everyone who has an interest in film.

","After seeing the preview for this film during ""The Fountain"", I was eagerly awaiting it. However, I was unaware of it's being subtitled, but that did not deter me at all. I'm always up for a little reading. This movie was, without a doubt, one of the best movies I have ever seen. It was a superb story that takes it's roots deep into the harsh coldness of reality and the branches into the wildest parts of any imagination or dream. Senior Del Toro wastes no time in letting you know who the bad guy is, and why. Or does he? The twists and turns are easy to follow but surprising none the less. Not a fairy tale for children. The monsters in it are quite creepy, especially the gentlemen with the long fingernails and no eyes (in his head). Just seeing the pictures of the baby-eater made my skin crawl, as well as the rest of the audiences'. Definitely worth seeing, and if you like it as much as I did, you will be purchasing it upon release. Pan's Labyrinth was magical yet sad, much like ""What Dreams May come"" yet creepy like ""snow white: a tale of terror"". Excellent!<br/><br/>The audience I was part of actually clapped at the end.

This movie, however, made me want to stand up and scream. While this sounds like something that is bad, it adds to the reality of this fairytale and pushes the story forward it seems.

","I'm incredibly critical with movies, and that's probably why I haven't submitted any comments on this website thus far- a fear of offending bad movie fans. I am usually the worst about fantasy and sci fi films, because, for some reason, they more clearly reveal the director and writers' passion for ""brightening"" their viewers minds than any other genre. I can't stand it when a plot attempts to be so deep that you can practically see the director weeping of his own creative genius and that just no one could ever understand how incredibly marvelous he is.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth, the be-all end-all of fantasy films that captivated my heart completely. When I left the theatre, there was no need for me to try to balance the good qualities versus the bad in an attempt to convince myself of my own approval- it was perfect. I gasped, I cried, and I'm sure for more than one scene my mouth was unconsciously hanging open. Three, maybe four times have I ever seen something on screen that made me feel the way this movie did- and all I can think is how did they do it? How did they come up with such a beautiful story? And, being an artist, I was astonished by the settings and the colors and the creations set before me. If you have any creative spark at all and want inspiration, or if you just want to see the most spectacular movie to date, go see Pan's Labyrinth."
"cwrdlylyn","10","2","4","18 January 2007"," PANS LABRYINTH : This Adult Fairy Tale Is 2006's Most Visually Stunning & Absorbing Film...
","PANS LABRYINTH <br/><br/>With PANS LABYRINTH, Guillermo Del Toro has managed to create an adult fairy tale that pays homage to classically dark children's stories like ALICE IN WONDERLAND without ever abandoning a purely adult tone. The film is a masterpiece on many levels, but perhaps what is most impressive about PANS LABYRINTH is the fact that it can seamlessly blend such dangerously varied genres (fairy tales, war films, coming-of-age drama, horror film, etc) into a piece that is capable of reaching fans of each genre without alienating the other. PANS LABYRINTH is a film that truly could, and should, be enjoyed by everyone over the age of 15.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of Ofelia (played with stunning maturity by Ivana Baquero) as she moves in with her new step-father, Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez, in an intimidating performance). Ofelia's mother is pregnant, and Captain Vidal's only reason for taking on this new family is to ensure that he has a son to carry on his legacy. Captain Vidal is a brutal man, willing to kill anyone who presents opposition to him, and young Ofelia, with a wandering imagination, wants out.<br/><br/>One of the most delightful elements of PANS LABYRINTH is the way Del Torro never seems to make a concrete decision as to whether the fantasy elements are reality or not. It's the same approach used in THE WIZARD OF OZ and ALICE IN WONDERLAND, in which the viewer is left wondering if Dorothy ever really left Kansas, or if Alice ever really went down a rabbit hole. Once Ofelia arrives at her new home, fantastic things start to happen to her. First, a fairy visits her at night and leads her to the bottom of Capt. Vidal's backyard Labyrinth. It is here that Ofelia meets Pan, the faun. Ofelia learns that she may in fact be a long lost princess of the underworld, and only by completing three very specific tasks can she ever escape the nightmare that is Post-War Spain.<br/><br/>PANS LABYRINTH can be appreciated on many levels. From some angles, it seems like an interpretation of what heaven may be to the young girl. In another way, it acts as a propaganda film for keeping our earth healthy and alive. Perhaps some might see the movie as an exploration of how one's sanity is destroyed in war. And from yet another viewpoint, PANS LABRYINTH is simply an engrossing fairy tale with high stakes and incredible tension. Masterfully wrapped together by the hands of Guillermo Del Toro, the film works on all these levels.<br/><br/>Alongside the LOTR trilogy, PANS LABYRINTH is one of the greatest examples of how incredible a fantasy film can be if it isn't given the care and attention it deserves. The creativity is literally pouring from the screen, and believe me, PANS LABYRINTH is without a doubt the most stunningly visual film of the year (though THE FOUNTAIN is a strong second). The creatures that inhabit this fantasy world are simply incredible to look at, whether they are lovable (the image of a praying mantis-like creature trying to take on the appearance of a fairy) or downright terrifying (the image of an eyeless creature who rests in slumber till a child comes for dinner), PANS LABRYINTH's creatures are never second rate.<br/><br/>Absolutely everybody should see PANS LABYRINTH. It will mean different things to different audiences, depending on the viewers skepticism and age. However, one thing is for sure... no matter what feelings PANS LABYRINTH stirs for it's viewer, it is the most absorbing 2 hours of cinema released in 2006. Del Torro has relished in the fact that his film never has a set structure or audience, and in doing so he has blessed us with one of the most creatively exuberant fantasies ever.<br/><br/>...

"lee_a_scott","9","2","4","16 January 2007"," Superb!
","How often does a film manage to be serious, meaningful and exciting? Be visually dazzling, inventive and put across a serious message? Contain childish flights of whimsy and sickening violence? Well, not that often, but this tour de force from Guillermo del Toro is one that does. This is an excellent movie based upon whatever criteria you wish to apply, although the most difficult criterion would be ""what's it like and is it better?"" as it is quite unlike anything else. The fantasy sequences and characters are astonishing, and are used sparingly and so more effectively than you may anticipate from the trailer. This is far from Jim Henson's Labyrinth  a grim meditation on the evil that men may do rather than a happy-go-lucky coming of age parable, and is a film that truly explores the horrific darkness that lies at the heart of the best fairy tales. Not uplifting and not for kids, this is intelligent and serious cinema and is truly excellent."
"wahzoh","8","2","4","16 January 2007"," Inventive and Disturbing
","First off, if you don't know yet - this is not a movie for kids. It is a fantasy, but a sometimes horrifying one. Normally, I steer as far from violent movies as I can. I went to see this picture because a friend of mine who works in the special effects business had some pals who worked on this picture and she wanted to see their efforts.<br/><br/>Having said that, this was a remarkable picture, genuinely unique in its vision and images. The character of the ""Captain"" - that is, the little protagonist's stepfather, is a real live monster -- much worse than anything you will find in a mere fantasy. Much, much worse. I think if I ever met that actor in real life I would wet myself and run away. The images from this picture really stuck with me for days afterward, and it's very hard to put out of my mind. Really a remarkable picture."

","What a beautiful, sad, haunting film. My friend and I can't stop talking about it. Definitely an award winner. We were wondering: Why there was a labyrinth behind the mill? Was the stairway to a pit actually there and if so, what would it have been used for? The film does acknowledge that the mill and house are hundreds of years old. Merecedes says that the labyrinth has been there for a long time. Historically, were labyrinths built as a punishment? As a type of prison? As a form of recreation, much like corn mazes that you can experience today? It seemed like such an unusual thing to have on a mill/farm."
"rh86","10","2","4","14 January 2007"," Beautiful fantasy, brutal reality
","I saw this on a preview disk with not great quality and this film looked fantastic on that. Eleven year old Ofelia (the amazingly talented 12 year old Ivana Baquero) discovers a fantasy world in her new home, a world that is filled with amazing creatures that look more real and amazing than any recent Hollywood creation and filmed beautifully. However this against the background of her stepfather's (a Spanish Army Captain) fight against leftwing forces in the Spanish Civil War. His brutal sadism against Ofelia, her mother and their servants contrasts amazingly with the fantasy world and is played amazingly by Sergi Lopez.<br/><br/>An amazing film, certainly the best of 2006, possibly the best of 2007."
"KuRt-33","9","2","4","14 January 2007"," The Civil War trilogy continues: from ghosts to creatures
","Guillermo Del Toro has made quite a few extraordinary movies: his debut was Cronos, which sadly never got the attention it deserved and should've been added to at least a couple of Hall of Fames. When he released El Espinazo del Diablo (The Devil's Backbone) in 2001 I was under the impression Del Toro had reached a point where he could no longer top himself... or could he?<br/><br/>Mixing personal movies for an in-crowd with movies for a bigger audience with a few personal touches (I'm thinking of Mimic, Blade II and Hellboy), Del Toro is quickly becoming a director one shouldn't avoid. Unless you don't like the supernatural at all...<br/><br/>El Laberinto del Fauno (a.k.a. Pan's Labyrinth) blew my mind, but I was all too aware that Del Toro added so much fantasy in this movie Fauno would not get the praise from audiences Espinazo had received. Initial reports proved me wrong, but these days the grapevine informs me of critical voices. This can only be classified as ""a shame"".<br/><br/>El Laberinto del Fauno tells the story of a young girl, Ofelia, who is on her way - with her pregnant mother - to her 'new father', Captain Vidal. Vidal is a vicious commanding officer, relentless against anyone he suspects is against him. Needless to say, Ofelia doesn't like him. This brings more worries to Ofelia's mind, which already had trouble coping with the war. El Laberinto is set in 1944, just after Franco's victory. Incapable of facing the real world, Ofelia invents her own. But Ofelia's imaginary world isn't a peaceful world, it's full of mythical creatures and monsters. A mirror world only slightly favourable to the cruel reality. <br/><br/>That is so quite special: at the same time we, the audience, get to see the world through Ofelia's eyes as well as experience a tale which is typical for wartime stories. As protesting against church and state could cost you dearly in times of war, your criticism had to be covered. And what better way to cover them than by creating a fable? The monsters in Ofelia's dream world are perfect representations of church and state, adding a thinly veiled layer to the movie.<br/><br/>The real world is also shown is all its bloody reality: people are tortured and executed in several cruel ways. When I saw the movie several people had to look away during certain scenes, occasionally accompanied by ""eek"" and ""yuck"" sounds.<br/><br/>Now, whereas El Laberinto manages to exist on several layers, not every layer will be equally obvious to audiences. El Laberinto del Fauno is the second movie in Del Toro's trilogy about the Spanish civil war. El Espinazo del Diablo, which was set in an orphanage with a ghost and an unexploded bomb, was the first part (2001) and 3993, a ghost story about 'the hostages left to fortune by the past' set in 1990's Spain and with connections with the Spanish Civil War in 1939, will close the trilogy in 2009.<br/><br/>I myself have been trained in literature and movies enough to see the allegories in El Laberinto, but I have heard of disappointed cinema-goers who didn't pick up on what the film is trying to show. That is why I deeply recommend El Laberinto del Fauno, but only after you've seen El Espinazo del Diablo, another Del Toro movie that never got the credits it deserved.<br/><br/>El Laberinto del Fauno is supported by a great cast: Ariadna Gil (Ofelia's mother) and Sergi Lopez (Vidal) should be familiar by now, Ivana Baquero (as the young Ofelia) is a nice discovery. Aside from directing it, Del Toro also wrote the script. The special effects are mind-blowing, even though some will probably look a bit outdated in a few years (filmmakers should always beware of trying the latest technologies). Then again, as this is a fable, it is not that bad when an effect will not look 100% realistically. Is El Laberinto del Fauno a perfect movie? No, almost but not completely. But is it the best and most original movie of 2006? Without a doubt!"
"nobbytatoes","9","2","4","14 January 2007"," magical, adult fairytale
","Fairy tales have always been with us. Tales for children, stored with life lessons, morals and universal parables and themes. Fairy tales all carry a dark element, dug into their subtext or subtly played upon. The Grimm Brothers tales played on that darkness more, while Disney left it in the background to be dug out. Pan's Labyrinth is a fairytale that isn't one for the young; an adult fairytale, yet tapping into the imagination of the young at heart and that inner child. Written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, Pan's Labyrinth draws out that darkness, pushing it right to the forefront, creating a magical film to behold and go down as a defining film in del Toro's career.<br/><br/>Comparison and a parallel could be drawn between Pan and Alice in Wonderland; but this isn't rightly so. Wonderland had it's nexus point at the rabbit hole, the fantasy of Pan's Labyrinth roots itself into reality, grounded by the protagonist Ofelia. Set at historical point, Pan starts on the decline of the Spanish Civil War, and the Fascist regime. Ofelia with mother Carmen, pregnant with child, move to live with Capitán Vidal, right in the middle of his mission of eliminating the guerrilla army and his own emotional war of so to be fatherhood and demons of his own father.<br/><br/>The Labyrinth World is an elusive place. It's depth and grandeur are hinted upon, with our exploration only the tip. The allure of the Labyrinth World wields so much pull, it's deterring we're dropped back into reality and the emotional drama. Yet both realities carry one another and require a harmonious balance. The Labyrinth world draws it's power on imagination and power of the innocence, but it's the war ridden world that really plays on the darkness of fairy tales. While reality may be laced with a magical presence, the darker elements are used heavily in del Toro's use of violence. Not the bloodiest story told on film, but del Toro unflinchingly doesn't turn from the torture and violence; many deaths leave gruesome impressions. But both worlds exhibit that true nature of the fairytale; a true danger and horror. Ofelia's task in the lair of a child eating monster exudes this perfectly.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro is an extremely visual director. The wonder and beauty held in Pan's Labyrinth is the visual aesthetic. Pan the Faun, other creatures and their worlds, are so vividly brought to life with brevity, based that they are created in a ""old fashion sense""; utilising sets and puppetry. Computerised effects are minimal for a more visceral experience. You can feel the dirt and grit of the Labyrinth world, with a genuine warmth. Pan is a wondrous sight to behold, amazingly acted by Doug Jones, along with strong performances by Ivana Baquero, Maribel Verdú and a commanding performance by Sergi López as monstrous Capitán Vidal.<br/><br/>Superbly imaginative, beautifully dark and wondrous, just like a labyrinth, del Toro takes you on a journey of twists and shocking turns, leading to the inevitable center for one emotional ending. Pan's Labyrinth is truly magical."
"ethayes","10","2","4","13 January 2007"," There's more to the story than just the fairy tale
","El Laberinto del Fauno is heartbreaking. It is a story about the fragility of innocence, and the ultimate helplessness all people can experience in life. While the beautifully imagined Labyrinth is the attraction in this movie, the grotesque and frightening reality of civil-war Spain makes this movie effective and memorable.<br/><br/>After reading about a dozen reviews of this movie, my expectations were set for something of a fantasy comparable to Ridley Scott's ""Legend"", the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, or even some of the more popular Disney animated films. I was very surprised (and relieved) to find that this movie was actually an adult drama and tragedy. The fairy-tale 'Labyrinth' is exactly that: just a fairy tale.<br/><br/>The compelling acting from all the characters in the film makes the story work as a gripping war time drama. Ivana Bequero's portrayal of Ofelia should be at least nominated for an Academy Award. She really owns this film from start to finish. Sergi Lopez, portraying Capitan Vidal gives us one of the most frightening and memorable movie villains of all time. The sadistic and abusive Vidal personifies true evil while Ofelia represents pure innocence. American actor, Doug Jones gives a quirky and bipolar performance as Pan, the faun character that guides Ofelia through three separate tasks.<br/><br/>This is Guillermo del Toro's definitive work. He has given us a well balanced movie where the story hits all the right points and leaves no one confused. It is a sad and frightening film, but after seeing it, most movie goers should realize that fairy tales exist because of the bitter reality behind them."
"laura-bingham1975","8","2","4","13 January 2007"," Not Just a Gripping Escape from the Horror of Reality into a Surreal Faery World
","Before watching this dark and sometimes violent adult fairy tale, I was expecting something alike to Jean Pierre Jeunet's City of Lost Children. While I do prefer City of Lost Children, Pan's Labyrinth is an excellent film, well deserving of the accolades and attention that it has been spurring in every film festival since its release. <br/><br/>It begins when a heavily pregnant Carmen (Ariadna Gil) and her imaginative, book absorbed daughter, Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), arrive in the Spanish countryside during the post-civil war period of 1944. Here, Ofelia meets with her step father, Captain Vidal (Sergi López), who leads a merciless battle against anti-fascist resistors hidden in the surrounding woods. <br/><br/>It turns out that the forest is replete with guerrillas, one of which, Pedro, is enamoured with the housekeeper, Mercedes (Maribel Verdú). Mercedes collaborates closely with the humanistic Dr Ferreiro who has been assigned to Carmen's bed while secretly lending his services to the resistance. Ofelia learns of their alliance on the first night and through her mature silence, we learn of Ofelia's nature. She quickly establishes herself, not as a scatterbrain whose mind is filled with the senselessness of fairy tales but as a well-meaning, caring daughter, concerned for her mother's well-being and for the safety of her new friend, Mercedes. Ofelia so recalls Miette in her determination to better the bleak reality that surrounds her that I refuse to admit that she used her created world merely as an escape. Ofelia does not retreat into Pan's Labyrinth because she is weak and ill-equipped for the real world, since the world of her dreams is after all, equally dark, but because it is in her world that she can find the strength to remedy the problems that surround her. It is in her world that she can create solutions for the troubles that haunt her. And so while it is true that the oppressive forces of the dangerous reality, the loss of her beloved father - so unlike the sadistic Captain Vidal - and the gloomy prospect that her mother's delicate pregnancy presents, all impel her to escape into a fairy world, it is her courage and longing for betterment that drives her. Her world remains psychologically tainted by the dark reality and it is here, in that dreamscape, that Guillermo del Toro's genius fascinates, through the wonderful surrealistic landscape that he paints.<br/><br/>Ofelia descends into the labyrinthine structure nearby and meets the limp haired, sharp eyed faun. This most eloquent, yet ever dubious Faun declares Ofelia to be the reincarnation of Princess Moanna and offers her the chance to reopen the portal that will lead to her heavenly kingdom. He presents Ofelia with three tasks through which she must prove herself before she can be reinstated as Princess Moanna. While struggling through those tasks, Ofelia must not only grapple with her own and our suspicions of the Faun's intentions but must also combat with herself. As with all moralistic fairy tales, each test seems designed to ascertain Ofelia's character and test her resolve. <br/><br/>The first horrendous task seems to call on this city girl to prove her will in this marshy, insect infested countryside! The second task which sees her enter the dining chamber of a sleeping, prawn-like figure calls on her to avoid the lush temptations of the banquet table. In terms of its nightmarish quality and Freudian relevance, this sequence is a standout. There are walls stained with blood, bone-like columns in an empty hallway, even the dining room walls are ornate with demonic depictions of infanticides while the banquet, with its rich reds and burgundies, evokes yet more blood. Most chilling is the cannibalistic prawn creature equipped with hand eye-sockets who extends his palms out to spy and catch potential prey, all the while stumbling after a running Ofelia. But it is in the third task that Ofelia proves herself most and where dream meets reality in a heart breaking, yet uplifting, conclusion. <br/><br/>The Pan's Labyrinth characters as in every dark fairy tale are striking figures of good and evil, of weakness and strength. None are more convincing than the cruel, cold Captain Vidal. He is the epitome of self-interested chauvinism and narcissism. While he proudly flashes his wedding band, he considers Carmen as a mere vessel for his son and shows nothing but callousness towards Ofelia. It is a man who prefers to publicly humiliate his wife's romantic nature, rather than admit to weak sentiments that would render him otherwise than the brutal, energetic role that he so enjoys assuming. It is a man obsessed with time, punctuality and order. On the first night, we watch him viciously murder innocent peasants and soon after, lay the blame for their mistaken identity on his soldiers. Vidal is a vain, self-dramatising man who accompanies his morning rituals, his routine shave in front of the mirror, to the sound of glorifying record music. <br/><br/>Interestingly, Vidal's passion for the ticking mechanism of his watch and the film's repeated focus on this old-fashioned contraption, are reminiscent of another one of del Toro's characters: the self-winding knife-wielding warrior in Hellboy. It is of no coincidence that the antagonists in both of these films, the first as Dr Ferreiro so piercingly points out, functioning blindly as an arm of the fascist regime and the second, functioning as a tool for the underworld, should both be symbolically governed by time. One could say that del Toro likens evil to heartless, mechanised order. By contrast, through Ofelia, goodness and purity of heart is associated with imagination, innocence and the pursuit of a dream against all odds."
"agmoldham","7","2","4","13 January 2007"," Brilliant Movie
","As a general rule I tend to steer clear of foreign language films, but critical acclaim of this movie tempted me into the theatre. I've got to say that I'm delighted about this because this is a delightful film.<br/><br/>The film is set in the Spannish civil war as the fascist regime, brutally put down the resistance. The film is full of contradictions. At times it is brutal and shows sadistic graphic violence in a similar fashion to Schindlers List. At other times it is a fairy tale and similar to Edward Scissorhands. This comes together in a beautiful mix to make a mesmerising film and isn't it a shame that Hollywood can't make a few films like this rather than the latest instalment of a dated movie franchise.<br/><br/>Don't let the subtitles put you off from seeing this film."

"nived84","10","2","4","12 January 2007"," Del Toro's Masterpiece
","For me, the great thing about the winter  besides Christmas  is that this is the time of year when we finally get to see some of the very best films. In October we got The Departed and The Prestige. In November we got Babel, Stranger than Fiction and The Fountain. And this December we got Apocalypto, Children of Men and this film; Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth, which is yet again, another great film, and in my opinion one of my favorite films of the year. I know I've been saying that a lot this time of year, but it's so true. This is the last great film to what I have considered to be a relatively good year for movies. This year's Oscars are going to a very close race, and as I see it Pan's Labyrinth has already won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year. I shall accept nothing less; my mind is already made up.<br/><br/>In this dark, unique picture; part war-time drama and part horror/fantasy, set in 1944, during a Civil War in Northern Spain, it tells a story about a 12-year-old girl, Ofelia (played wonderfully by the young Ivana Baquero), who moves with her pregnant mother and new stepfather into a new home in the countryside. Her stepfather is Captain Vidal, played with a truly evil presence by Sergi Lopez, has been sent to this remote area to rid it of a small Republican militia. Disliked by the sadistic Vidal (who might as well be Hitler himself), Ofelia buries herself in fairy tales, and discovers an immense and ancient labyrinth guarded by a faun named Pan. He tells her that she is the long-lost daughter of the king of a magical underworld, and to regain entry to her kingdom she must carry out three tasks. So Ofelia enters a strange and no less dangerous world of fairies and extraordinary creatures to complete her tasks.<br/><br/>Director Guillermo Del Toro, whose largely known for such popcorn movies as Mimic, Blade II and 2004's underrated comic book smash-up Hellboy, is at the top of his game and taking a step forward; growing as a filmmaker. The film is both visually imaginative and brutally violent, and sometimes it's not always easy to watch, but Del Toro mezmerizes you so much you can't look away, even when you'd like to. This is a fantasy film where you don't just go to admire the visuals and fantastical elements that are on display, it's also a deeply emotional and sad film with real flesh and blood characters. At the heart of the film is a great performance from Spanish born actress Ivana Baquero, who I think delivers one of the best performances from anyone her age. This Labyrinth most certainly isn't a film for children. Pan's Labyrinth is rated a strong R for graphic violence, and is in Spanish with English subtitles (don't be a pussy, you can do it!). And for it's entire two hour running time I was instantly swept away with Del Toro's uncompromised vision seen through the eyes of an innocent child and I was left heart broken by it's tragic finale, and it moved me to tears. This is one of the best films of the year, and for filmmaker Guillermo Del Toro it is without doubt the finest film of his career. A true masterpiece. I was left stunned and utterly speechless."
"jegerdoven","10","2","4","12 January 2007"," Your definitely in for a treat
","I did expect more of the film to be in a fantasy universe (geuss its about 50/50), but it just blew me away, the mix of realism and fantasy was blended perfectly, the two sides of the storie are so good separately that its almost scary and combined even better. This is a defenent top 10 movie of all time (in my eyes anyways) At times it makes me think of something Takashi Miike could have made. Zebraman, hobgoblins and the great wall, audition and several other of his movies has this dream/fiction/reality theme going that reminds me a bit, but Pans labyrinth just seems to have a whole lot more work behind it than (I make 5 movies every year) Miike usually does. Also Hayao Miyazaki comes to mind with the colorful and almost magical storytelling, hell parts of it even made me think of the master him self Terry Gilliam. The monsters are awesome, and even though the pale man is freaky and scary as hell, he is no match for the truly utterly nasty monster ""captain evil"". In a really solid 2006 when it comes to movies I would personally have to put this outing on top as the best of the year."

It took a hard look at how even in present times the seemingly fantastic fairy tale can still be couched in reality.<br/><br/>Amazing performances as well as amazing scenes. I can't shake some of the horrific scenes out of my head. Captain Vidal is quite possibly the worst screen villain in recent memory, in contention with Ralph Fiennes' Goethe from Schindler's List. <br/><br/>It's so scary, sad, funny, and creative. Best use of CGI I have scene in film. Not overdone, it meshes with Del Toro's camera tricks and lighting creating an environment that at once seems both frightening and inviting.<br/><br/>A definite must see for anybody who loves fairy tales and even for those who think they don't.<br/><br/>I went into this movie having very low expectations, I mean, it's in Spanish, I was basically expecting a Spanish Harry Potter, but instead I got a Spanish Sin City mixed with Alice in Wonderland and Schindler's List.<br/><br/>AMAZING!"

The captain's character in particular was performed brilliantly to make the viewer absolutely despise him, and you have to admire Ofelia's innocence and view towards the world. While I did feel that the characters were for the most part very one sided, an the story seemed to grand to be 2.5 or so hour movie, but the ending is so profound and moving that it ties the movie together very, very nicely. I would recommend seeing this movie"
"drexelspivey","9","2","4","9 January 2007"," Brilliant fairy tale not for kids
","""Pan's Labyrinth"" ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a fairy tale film for adults, an astounding visual feast that is as gorgeous as it is gory. Do not be deceived by the fairies, castles and the presence of a little girl as the main protagonist, graphic violence is everywhere, from scenes of war, grizzly torture (though, to be honest, probably not much worse than what is shown on ""24"") and genuinely frightening fantasy moments.<br/><br/>Having done my duty for the MPAA, I am now compelled to discuss the devastating brilliance of writer/director Guillermo del Toro's film (""El Laberinto del Fauno,"" in Spanish). Known for his work on acclaimed horror/fantasy films (""Cronos,"" ""Hellboy""), del Toro uses ""Pan's Labyrinth"" to examine the effects on a child living in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, a conflict and concept he has alluded to before, in ""The Devil's Backbone."" Like M. Night Shyamalan, Mr. del Toro has a gift for extracting emotional depth from young performers, and Ivana Baquero's turn as little Ofelia is no exception. We meet her on a journey through the woods, traveling with her mother, Carmen (Ariadna Gil) on their way to her new father's estate (Sergi Lopez as army Capitan Vidal).<br/><br/>Still suffering from the trauma of her biological father's death, and the fear of her new home and father, Ofelia has found escape in books. However, when she uncovers an insect that turns into a fairy, del Toro and his visual effects crew will leave you blinking in amazement. Ofelia is lead to a labyrinth of rocks behind Capitan Vidal's estate, where she embarks on a quest that will, hopefully, lead her to a castle where she will become a princess.<br/><br/>While Capitan Vidal hunts down and tortures rebels hiding in the woods, and her mother battles a difficult pregnancy, Ofelia is left to complete tasks designed by a faun named Pan. The story never grants us the knowledge of whether or not Ofelia's creatures and tasks are real, so we are left to infer as to their validity.<br/><br/>The omnipresent gloom of war leads to a vital plot shift involving rebels and Capitan Vidal's servant, Mercedes (Maribel Verdu in an outstanding performance), who has become a surrogate mother to Ofelia while also secretly helping the rebels. We see the horror of Capitan Vidal's violence, and the depths of his black soul. Sergi Lopez's performance is powerfully chilling.<br/><br/>Ofelia's tasks take her to mystical places, from the inside of a large tree to uncover a key hidden in a toad's belly, to a frightening encounter with a child eating creature with eyes on his hands. Mr. del Toro's vision is laudably brought to life through stunning audio and visual effects, intricate set pieces and brilliantly constructed costumes.<br/><br/>The tragedies mount for poor Ofelia as her quest goes astray, and Capitan Vidal's rage becomes increasingly uncontrolled as the film nears a brutal conclusion.<br/><br/>Wisely, the film grants us the freedom to draw our own conclusions at the end. Those hardened by the harsh cruelties of human nature may be saddened, but those who still hope for a better world will leave the theater believing in magic."

","Pan's Labyrith, a Spanish language film with English subtitles, is a beautiful movie that explores the brutality of man and the beauty of the fantastic. It is one of the rare 'creature' movies where the brutality and the inhuman actions throughout the movie are perpetrated by the humans in the film, not the creatures. The portrayal of the fascist captain, Ophelia's step father is dead on with history as I know it in that he shows a certain apathy for humanity, seeing people merely as enemies and allies. Not even his wife or step daughter are really seen in an affectionate light by him. The only thing he cares about is his son, seeing his bloodline and memory passed on and it tickled me when he got his just desserts."

His other film highpoint is ""The Devil's Backbone"" (2001). I would not have expected a great film such as this, from his fantasy/horror film background. I wonder what kind of inspiration he had to create this remarkable film.<br/><br/>This is the story of a young book loving girl who possesses a powerful and rich imagination. The film depicts both her fantasy world and the real world she lives in, both to powerful complimentary effect. Both an emotionally powerful drama and a beautifully realized fantasy, this film is certain to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language film of 2006. It has been nominated for The Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival. <br/><br/>This is one of the most emotional and beautifully realized fantasy films I have ever seen. It has left a strong impression on me. Cinematography, production design and visual effects are excellent throughout the film. The main and central character's are emotionally engaging throughout the film also. The central villain is chilling and convincing. Two fantasy creatures stand out: the faun and more impressively, ""The Pale Man"". The real life story of the girl is occasionally graphic, the film is always a feast for the eyes and a triumph of the heart.

Everything about this film was perfect. Casting, acting, storytelling, special effects/ visuals and cinematography.<br/><br/>The premise of the story is quite simple.<br/><br/>Girl goes with pregnant mother to meet stepfather, who is captain of a unit fighting the rebels at the end of the Spanish civil war.<br/><br/>During her stay, she comes across a fairy who leads her to Pan.

"Surecure","8","2","4","6 January 2007"," An excellent adult's fable
","Pan's Labyrinth is easily one of the top ten films to arrive to theaters this year from a visual point of view. The design and direction of the film shows Guillermo Del Toro to truly have a gift at crafting lush, strange worlds that attract the eye. This film stands as his most mature directing to date, as he certainly pulled back the reins and elevated the real world aspect of the film. The country setting most likely helped in establishing this, but it could certainly not be achieved with a director who doesn't feel there isn't enough ""stuff"" on screen at any given time.<br/><br/>Del Toro allows his characters to breathe without the claustrophobic eye candy of other effects driven directors. Thus, the performances certainly stand out as the characters are richly drawn and given freedom to expand. While many of Del Toro's previous films stand on the strength of their action sequences, Pan's Labyrinth stands as being his most character driven to date with a wide host of characters each displaying a wide diversity of motivations and desires.<br/><br/>I went into this film with high expectations, which probably contributed to the fact that I was not as impressed with the film as I had expected I would be. While it is an excellent film, it could have been improved with a greater connection between the protagonist's different ""tasks"" and the real world she lived in. There was a significant disconnection that made her real life and her fantasy life seem like two different, unrelated stories at times.<br/><br/>As well, the brutality of the film seemed gratuitous at times. Del Toro certainly isn't shy at showing brutal visuals (and I am in fact a fan of such visualization when appropriate) but there is a time where the audience gets the point, most notable of these is the Captain's sewing sequence which tended to go on for much longer than necessary. This could have been a fault of the editor, but ultimately the responsibility to draw the scene out was not entirely appropriate for the pacing of the film.<br/><br/>All in all, Pan's Labyrinth is one of the best films of 2006 and stands as one of the best adult fable/fairy-tales I have ever seen. Del Toro's unique visuals and gifted design sensibilities raise the film and outrightly vindicate his position as one of the world's top fantasy directors."

","Pan's Labyrinth surprised me completely. It was like watching a film concerning the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War and also a parallel fantasy film at the same time. The actual 'fantasy' contained within Pan's Labyrinth was far less then I imagined. 'Lord of the Rings' it isn't.<br/><br/>I hope people who aren't inclined to watch a 'fantasy' film go out and watch 'Pan's Labyrinth'. Everyone is obviously talking about Guillermo del Toro and his fantastic direction, and rightly so, but the performances of all the actors concerned, particularly Ivana Baquero as Ofelia, Sergi Lopez as Captain Vital and Maribel Verdu as Mercedes are exceptional.<br/><br/>The cinematography was of very high quality, which helped capture the whole essence and vision of the film beautifully, although, I definitely want to see the film again to really experience all the nuances of the film that you sometimes miss when watching a film with subtitles, while concentrating on the plot.<br/><br/>I also have to mention the sound of the film as it's extraordinary. The cinema I visited had a decent sound system (I'm a music lecturer/producer and engineer) and it seemed that del Toro wanted to use 'sound' as another character within the film.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth was actually released here in the UK before the US, which is very rare, although apparently in its first weekend in the US it was only shown in 17 theatres! It also doesn't seem to be shown in many UK cinemas, which is a shame.<br/><br/>But I would definitely recommend this film to any movie lover, particularly those of an open mind who can watch a film with subtitles!"
"Mxzplk","Null","2","4","21 December 2006"," The Beauty of Horror: in the extraordinary Fauno's Labyrinth, a little girl enters the underground of imagination - and finds the key to defeat fascism
","Mexican director Guillermo del Toro, 42 years-old, says he has gone through most of the years of his life trying to recover from his first ten - spent in the company of his fanatic religious grandmother (that advocated also the physical punishment of the body) and of other monstrous creatures (these taken from his imagination). May Del Toro forgive egoism: it is done here votes so that he will never be able frighten his ghosts, which served as raw material for several interesting movies, such as Chronos, The Devil's Backbone and Hellboy, and now a work truly extraordinary. In El Labirinto del Fauno (Pan's Labyrinth), little girl Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), age eleven, is taken to the inside of the wolf's den: an advanced post of the army of Francisco Franco, to the north of Spain, where an assassin captain (Sergi López, exhaling threat) tries to crush focuses of republican resistance. The captain just married Ofelia's mother and already produced on her an heir. What is inside her mother is, to Ofelia, a mystery. It can be someone like her - an innocent - or then somebody like her stepfather.<br/><br/>Surrounded by fear and brutality, the girl finds an exit. Enters a labyrinth, at the back of the property, and then sees herself into an underground world, staged in colors and details so vivid that, since the beginning, it's what appears to be more real. There, an ancient fauno informs Ofelia that she is the princess of this kingdom. If she fulfills three tasks, she can return to it. The tasks follows the classic rules of fairy tales, with frogs, mystical doors, keys and prohibitions - such as to never, never, taste any food when you're inside a magical dimension. (Rule that Ofelia, by the way, breaks, awakening a pale man, with his eyes on the palm of his hands, at the same place of the stigmas of Christ.) Del Toro knows the conventions of fairy tales inside out and back and forth, and return to then their traditional sense: the codes that serves at the same time to simplify and codify the great fears of existence. With the ownership of them, Ofelia manages to handle with the crushing reality that surrounds her. More: she manages to dominate it. Del Toro knows that fascism doesn't have any worse enemy than pureness and imagination - ""the most disobedient of the qualities"", as defined by the director in interview to the press. Ofelia possesses both, and because of them will become a formidable adversary to her stepfather.<br/><br/>The Labyrinth is one of the rare cases in which the narrative and the metaphor not only live well together but multiply each other's effects. The imaginative world of Ofelia is powerful on itself, because Del Toro believes in the symbols he is using and the force they hold. And it is equally efficient as representation of the unique century Spain has gone through. Ofelia steals the just-been born brother and allows, thus, that he grows up without knowing the ominous name of his father. It is the Spain of resistance giving birth to the uneasy and creative Spain that resurged from the subterranean with the end of the franquist dictatorship. More than anything else, however, the Labyrinth is a promise - of an original director, that gives indications of holding so many other magnificent movies inside himself."

","I'm not sure why it's called Pan's Labyrinth in the English translation because I'm fairly sure that the Faun never refers to himself by name or is referred to by name throughout the running time but the real mystery surrounding Del Toro's fantasy is why is engages in the cinema, stays with you afterwards but still leaves you cold.<br/><br/>Its certainly not for want of creative energy. This is a rich and unusual enterprise, occasionally hauntingly beautiful, a bit like the corpse of a stunning 20 year old who's died from electrocution and lies tantalisingly inert on the mortician's slab. Obsentisably its a Spanish civil war drama with a liberal sprinkling of fairy dust, horrific in its real world setting, baroque and artistic in Ofelia's fantasy realm. But Pan's Labyrinth has problems beneath its carefully layered visuals. The two halves marry successfully but to no real end. The opening scenes promise a more substantial payoff but instead its a fascinating but ultimately hollow piece about childhood escapism. That the fantasy is real as the narrative suggests hardly matters in the end as its had such a negligible impact on the non-magical world.<br/><br/>Alluring, well made and often captivating, you should see it, just know that the real magic is that you won't notice the lack of dramatic integrity until its all over...but you will notice."

","It was 1944 in Spain, and the smoke from the civil war had not yet cleared.
Major fighting in the Spanish civil war ended in 1939. That year, the left party led by the republican army defeated, general franco led the fascist officers overthrew Spain's second republic, the establishment of a military dictatorship. The surviving republican army was forced to organize into small units to wage guerrilla warfare in the mountains. The military regime carried out a ruthless campaign against the guerrillas to consolidate the fruits of victory.
Ophelia, 14, took her book and followed her pregnant mother to the mountains where her stepfather, captain Vidal, was stationed. The captain was ordered to round up the guerrillas hiding in the mountains. He was an outstanding fascist soldier, self-disciplined, cold, resolute, brave and inaccessible.
Here ophelia, a lover of fairy tales, found a dilapidated maze. Carved on a beam at the entrance to the maze was the face of pan, with three black holes in its eyes and mouth, giving it a wild and mysterious look. Right in the middle of the maze was a round chamber in the ground. Down the stone staircase, in the middle of the chamber is a miniature maze. In the middle was a stone statue, the top of which was the face of the same pan with the three black holes. Below was a girl with a baby in her arms.
Legend has it that the spirit of the underworld princess still roamed the earth, and her father had been waiting for her reincarnation and to take her home. Ophelia found an old pan in the maze. He will give ophelia three tasks. If she can successfully complete the three tests before the full moon, she can return to her father's palace.
From then on the story jumps back and forth between the magic kingdom and the mountain battlefield. One moment it was little lady fighting ugly toad; One moment it was guerrilla informants trying to smuggle letters, food and medicine; For a while the little princess in the white devil's hand narrowly escaped death, for a while is the captain of the captives of the bloody methods. Together on the night of the full moon, we saw the end of a story that fantasy and reality cannot tell apart. It's all so powerful.
In Shakespeare's famous Hamlet, Ophelia is the lover of prince Hamlet. Hamlet feigned madness for revenge and abandoned her. Later, the prince killed her father, Polonius. The double whammy sends ophelia into a real frenzy, and she ends up drowning while trying to break flowers.
The name ""ophelia"" is like a huge shadow hanging over the little girl. The beautiful ophelia was forced by the reality into a person's fantasy world, she told her unborn brother a story of roses. The rose that gives immortality grows on the top of a high mountain. To get close to it is to go through a number of terrible trials and tribulations. Gradually people forget the original purpose, just pass on the difficulties along the way from generation to generation. Long in the mountains, can bring people eternal roses so lonely waiting for the end of time.
The fairy tale ophelia tells her brother also hints at the future of her early death. Ophelia in Hamlet falls into a river while folding flowers. Our ophelia died while pursuing her dream of an eternal kingdom.
It's not them that are crazy, it's the reality they live in.
At that time, people did not know whether they could see the sun of tomorrow. Or yesterday they were reading newspapers and letters home in the cave, and today they were killed by cold bullets. They all aspire to build a better country, but the path they choose makes it impossible for them to co-exist.
The reality of cruelty is that soldiers will expertly fire a second round at the head of a dead enemy to ensure a clean sweep of the battlefield -- something that both sides can do regardless of political position. Torture tools small, simple but the effect of the ""good"" is extremely horrible.
The cruelty in the magic is that the white magic that eats children has even its fingertips soaked in the blood of old people. Next to the ogre's table laden with delicacies were hills of children's shoes.
Most cruelly, ophelia was killed, and she breathed her last in the glory of the underground kingdom. And that world turned out to be just a fantasy of her loneliness.
The camera tells these details calmly and carefully. No emotion, no big close-up, no blur, no emotion.
That's the end of the 1944 story. It was a long thirty-one year before the day on which general franco and his regime were to return to normal. There are many more children whose lives will pass quietly."

Ofelia found the maze with a simple and mysterious Mayan style under the guidance of the elf. Just like Alice got into the rabbit hole, her curiosity led her to step into the fairy tale door. The strange-looking Pan Shen tells an ancient story. The heroine suddenly finds that she may be the protagonist of this story. It is no longer a dream for Cinderella to become a princess.

The stepfather becomes more and more cold, and only the child in the mother's womb is his concern. Ofeilia became more and more helpless, and only felt a little warm when she leaned on her mother to tell the unborn brother a fairy tale completely contrary to reality, and the desire to return to the kingdom of fairy tales became stronger.<br/><br/>The unfortunate fate finally began. The greed of the child almost shattered the hope of returning to his hometown. The mother died of dystocia. The stepfather was frustrated and mad. However, luck and hope still favored this kind and beautiful little girl. When the stepfather's whistling bullet was shot into Ofeilia's chest, she seemed to see happiness that she had never seen, a splendid palace, and the father and mother welcomed her return Finally, she found her home with a happy smile.<br/><br/>About others<br/><br/>The story is bigger than the characters. The character of the whole film is characterless. Some impressions are the cold stepfather who plays with pocket watches and the doctor with the same expression. Pan Shen in the labyrinth is not only reminiscent of Minotaur in the labyrinth of Crete. It looks so weird, really worrying about Ofelia's safety. The architectural style in the fairy tale tends to Maya, perhaps due to the participation of Mexican companies in film production. For the entire film, fairy tale fantasy and cruel reality are intertwined. The lightness of fairy tales dispels the heaviness of reality. The cruel despair of reality reflects the hope of happiness in fairy tales. A good balance appears. It is no longer meaningful to discuss whether the story is a child's conjecture to escape reality or the real underground kingdom. The key is that the smile she finally hoped has brought her back to where happiness is.<br/><br/>Finally pay tribute to the great Master Calvino"

Fantasy is a difficult genre to get right and it seems that Guillmero Del Torro understands world building to an artform. Coupling that with the cimetography it is a nice film to look at. But I can't help as an adult being unable to overlook the fact that I was questioning what I was even looking at the whole film, and every 10 minutes thinking to myself, ""Why'd that character do that? Was there a reason? seems like unnecessary conflict to me but whatever.""<br/><br/>The villian seemed pretty unconvincingly evil, I wish they had done some scenes where I could believe he was at least a human character, I do suppose they were comparing him to a unfeeling monster, so they could include the idea that fantasy monster's are more human than the villian but it still feels incredibly forced.<br/><br/>I also have no idea who this film is for. This seems too violent and terrifying for people below the age of 12. But seems too freeform and random for someone like me actually enjoy it substantially. I would say 13 to 19 is a good age to watch this film. Personally I didn't understand why it needed to be for an older audience since it is very clearly taking from an alice in wonderland style of storytelling anyway, just make it for kids and get a larger audience that would enjoy it more. It may have even made the villian more convincing since he wouldn't be killing people every 20 minutes.<br/><br/>Not something I would revisit in the the future. Had I watched it younger I imagine that I would be so blinded by nostalgia that logic doesn't matter. However, that isn't to say I won't watch more Gullmero Del Toro films, he seems to be extremely talented at making films, and he recently has been producing and directing more adult oriented horror films. Which is good because some of the best aspects of this film was the more horror oriented scenes. He may be one of the better Spanish speaking film directors and I hope to see more from him. But I am personally not interested in this genre of films clearly directed towards teenagers."

","I avoided this film for a long time, even after the beauty of The Shape of Water, due to the foreign language used throughout the film. I regretted that decision within the first five minutes. This film is beautiful and terrifying, but not in a ""jump-scare"" way. It's full of suspense and tense moments, but at heart, it is a twisted version of a children's story. This is easily my favorite Guillermo Del Toro story. If you are hesitant due to the subtitles and native Spanish of the film, don't be. By 10 minutes in, you'll be so stunned by the cinematography that you won't even notice that you are reading subtitles. The actors portray themselves so well in their facial expressions that this entire film could be without dialogue and you wouldn't miss a thing.<br/><br/>Spoilers below:<br/><br/>The plot follows a young girl, Ofelia, who encounters a Satyr in Pan's Labyrinth in 1944 Spain. The Satyr assigns her several missions that include mystical creatures, including a giant slug-frog and a being with eyes in his hands."

","""El Laberinto Del Fauno (Pan's Labyrinth)"" is a 2006 Spanish fantasy drama directed by Guillermo Del Toro starring Ivana Baquero and Sergi Lopez. After the recent watch of ""A Monster Calls"" I thought it was time to rewatch one of the film's most obvious influences. What makes this watch so special is the simple fact that I experienced it in the original Spanish version, of course with subtitles. Cause you know, I don't speak Spanish at all, but I wanted to see it as original as possible.
In the past, a trio of Mexican directors have established themselves in modern Hollywood and are jokingly known as the ""Mexican Trinity"" nowadays. Those directors are Alfonso Cuaron, Alejandro G. Innaritu and Guillermo Del Toro, all three are not only Academy Award winners, they also managed to make successful films in both English and their own mother language. In the case of Del Toro, his hugest success is this fantastic fantasy drama. As initially stated, I've already seen it roughly two years ago and it already amazed me back then. Now upon a rewatch, I see myself appreciating it even more. The director has put all blood, sweat and tears into this project and it's palpable in every single minute of runtime. He's created a nightmarish fairy tale that consists of countless small facets that make it so incredibly outstanding. What probably makes this film so legendary is simply how it looks. From start to finish it's absolutely picturesque and colorful, the visuals are nothing but stunning. On top of that, it doesn't only look incredible, it's at the same time ingeniously captured. DP Navarro did his best work in here and is one of the main reasons the film works out so well. But it's not only the superb style, it's also the story that makes it so uniquely precious. The Mexican mastermind has written and enacted a compelling and perfectly paced dark coming of age tale of a young girl during the Spanish war. In the course of this, he doesn't only manage to create realistic characters with complex personalities, he also succeeds to draw on a number of genres without letting it become a mess. What this film combines is nothing short of masterclass writing. On the core it's a packing history drama that elegantly weavers to together itself with fantasy and horror elements. Fairies and Fauns in a war drama? So strangely experimental. The Pale Man? Absolutely horrifying and iconic. As if that wasn't enough, the film even offers subtle social criticism with a juxtaposition of the war infected reality with the terrifying fantasy world, but it obviously comes to the conclusion that the reality is the true horror in this. While the CGI isn't quite the most outstanding (come on, it's no Hollywood blockbuster!), it still offers shockingly brutal make up effects that underline this statement. All in all, this film is hands down one of the most masterfully crafted feature films of all time. Not only does it have a breathtakingly beautiful story, it also has excellent acting performances a captivating plot and eerie visuals. It's a unique piece of art that combines countless aspects to sheer brilliance. Its overall tone end especially the ending might be sad, but it's never too depressing. The film effortlessly manages to hit you at the whole range of human emotions. Every director has a masterpiece and this is without a doubt Del Toro's magnum opus and probably one of the best Spanish films of all time. An absolutely beautiful dark fairy tale that anyone should have seen at least once."
"TheMovieDiorama","10","0","0","27 March 2020"," Pan's Labyrinth exquisitely navigates a ruined maze of dark fantasies to escape a sorrowful grim reality.
","Francoist Spain, 1944. Five years after the Spanish Civil War, a dictatorship controls the meandering roads and bustling cities. The political authoritarian ideology of unifying Spain and eliminating regional separatism. An emergent battle between Falangism and the republican resistance formed. Innocent individuals punished with ration cards and intense scrutiny. Only enforcers of the totalitarian principles garnered true freedom. Captain Vidal, the son of a famed commander, treated like royalty. A king. His new wife, inflicted with the pain of a brutal pregnancy, ordered to join him at a rural command post. Her daughter, ten year-old Ofelia, reluctantly obeying her mother's wish. To treat the captain as a father.<br/><br/>War ravages on. The Falangists luring the rebellious Spanish Marquis to the very abode Ofelia and Carmen rest at. The young, imaginative Ofelia is not alone during these times of turmoil. A pointed stick insect, believed to be a mystical fairy, leads Ofelia to an adjacent stone labyrinth where its walls echo tainted history for the trials soon to arrive. Once successfully navigated, an imposing faun greets the naive child, persuading her that she is the reincarnation of an ancient princess whose father is the king of the underworld. She must successfully complete three trials in order to acquire immortality and be resurrected in her kingdom. And thus beings a fantastical quest of escape. A desperate flee from the grotesque reality Ofelia currently copes with.<br/><br/>Del Toro's legendary dark fantasy drama is a seamless blend of compelling war tirades and endless imagination. Both encompassing the thematic portrayal of disobedience and choice, two pivotal convictions that commenced the feud with the dictatorship originally. Ofelia often disregards her adolescence to allow her mind to distract from the nihilistic virtues of Vidal. Disobeying the captain himself, her mother and the faun. Challenging the orders given to her, in reality Ofelia symbolises the Spanish Maquis. Her fantastical tasks that she endeavours to complete however, perpetuate the greed and oppression of the captain. Retrieving a key from the belly of filthy giant toad, who prevents an ornate tree from flourishing. Retrieve a dagger from the lair of the terrifying child-eating monster, where she is instructed not to consume any of the food items presented. These dream scenarios immortalise the oppressive consequences of fascism, integrated seamlessly in an already melancholic reality.<br/><br/>Del Toro, whom hints at various mythologies, crafts a fantasy that relishes in its darkened style. Whilst being inspired by Carroll's 'Alice in Wonderland', a young girl who seeks to escape her reality, the Mexican director wholesomely places his own spin on the tale. The trials are just as nightmarish as the reality Ofelia imagines herself out of, supplying the harrowing idea that reality is inescapable. She's constantly reminded to ""stop reading fairy tales"", to ""grow up"" and to ""stop believing in fairies"". Removing her child-like qualities indefinitely. All that remains is loss, grief and destruction. Bolstered by a screenplay that explores the painful bonds of a broken family during a time of distress, Del Toro inserts a sense of hopelessness throughout. Innocence is extinguished. Happiness devoured by the jaws of retribution. The important yet depressing conclusion surmising the preceding journey exquisitely, as poetic as the lullaby strung throughout Ofelia's arduous quest, composed hypnotically by Navarrete as he heightens the allurement of dreamlike qualities.<br/><br/>The fairy tale of Princess Moanna brought to life through expertly crafted production design and creature aesthetics, utilising minimal visual effects in the process. Jones, dual-casted as the faun and Pale Man, enduring extensive costume and makeup applications to materialise two cinematic icons in the fantasy genre. Exceptional work from all departments. Baquero's vulnerable performance as Ofelia simultaneously conjures an infliction of sadness, fear and joy in an incredibly nuanced multi-faceted character. López as the antagonistic Vidal brings life to one of cinema's most degenerative characters ever. Ruthless and remorseless. He himself endures some succinct makeup and visual effects when relentlessly slaughtering the rebels he captures. Navarro's cinematography, frequently accompanied with a pale blue tint, enhances the illusory nature of Pan's Labyrinth with the bright, golden shades of the underworld juxtaposing the cold shades of reality. In theory, the two colour schemes should be reversed, yet it cements Del Toro's vision that Francoist Spain was even more hellish than the underworld itself.<br/><br/>Without discussing the pivotal role of Mercedes or Doctor Ferreiro's heroic deed, Pan's Labyrinth has substantial depth to its visual narrative. Producing a surreal, ethereal and phantasmagorical tale of a country's ""unity"" relinquished by oppression, reducing a nationwide battle into a whimsical fairy tale. The grim realities of warfare paralleling the descent into an idyllic underworld. Pan's Labyrinth is Guillermo del Toro's magnum opus. A poem that surrounds itself in visual perfection and imaginary wonderment. And with that said, Pan's Labyrinth undoubtedly claims an elusive perfect rating. A labyrinthine parable that succinctly cements itself as timeless."

","These days, fairytales leave a lot to be desired. Many of them are too cliche or just uninteresting. But Pan's Labyrinth was able to break the mold. Just by hearing the setup, the movie grabs your attention. We have a little girl in Spain during the mid 40s of all decades and her mom isn't doing so well, being pregnant and marrying a man and all. But after stumbling upon some ruins and meeting a goat man, Ofelia believes there's a way to make things better. And throughout the movie, it's a pretty good adventure. There are some scenes that relate to the war going on and they aren't as entertaining as the scenes with Ofelia. But that's where my complaints end. The rest of the movie is very imaginative. The stories that are told are very interesting and the missions Ofelia go on are pretty engaging. And you end up caring about the characters rather quickly. The relationship between Ofelia and her mom feels real and natural and you find yourself wanting them to be happy. Just keep in mind that this movie is dark.

"thejipjap","8","0","0","13 May 2019"," A high schoolers review of Pan's Labyrinth
","Pan's labyrinth is a foreign movie that came out in an odd time in cinema. If you ask someone what movie they remember from 2006 chances are it will be an animated movie like cars, or ice age but there was some memorable live action movies like 300 and the second Pirates of the Caribbean movie. Not exactly a year where cinema tried to do anything different but continue franchises and start new ones. Pans Labyrinth wasn't about starting or continuing a franchise it was Guillermo del toro wanting to make a great movie and he did. Pan's Labyrinth received over 34 awards and made over $83.3 million in the box office.<br/><br/>The initial idea for this movie was based on many fairy tales and fables that inspired the design of many creatures and how the story progressed. The tone of the movie starts out bright and hopeful as it follows a story that the main character Ofelia reads to herself; but the tone changes as she's reminded of her new life the captain as her father living under his jurisdiction. She escapes this reality when she sees the fairy and fawn but we learn towards the end that what she is seeing and experiencing are all in her head.<br/><br/>Aside from the tone the movie presents the movies score composed by Javier Navarrete has some memorable tracks especially Ofelia's lullaby. Sound design in the movie does a phenomenal job of making every movement from a soldiers foot step to the fairies wings fluttering sound great on the ears.<br/><br/>While Pan's labyrinth has many memorable parts to it such as the soundtrack, the special effects, and cinematography its characters aren't one of them. Aside from Ofelia and the Captain many of the other characters don't go through any major changes or revelations to stand out. ....<br/><br/><br/><br/>Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth is an interesting take on fairy tales and how fantasy stories can play out. It's a great watch and another success from the works of Guillermo del toro."

","Set during the Spanish Civil War, Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth is a wonderful, dark fairy tale. It is a metaphor for Spain itself, teeters on the edge of nightmare dreamscapes of corruption, violence and the death of innocents.<br/><br/>This film is a fairy tail and is also has a couple of violence that wouldn't be good for a young viewer. Although the fantasy sequences are gorgeously realized, and are fairy tales in the truest sense, most of the story is based outside of the dreamland."

","This film pans labyrinth was a wonderful film as a whole. From the costumes to the acting to the lines. Everybody fully fulfilled their roles and acted to the best of their abilities even looking past the low budget used for this film.<br/><br/>So let's start out on the actors lines and acting. This was not the best but yet it still satisfied the roles and properly portrayed the plot. The main actor Ofelia was a decent actor at times the would portray the incorrect emotions but other than that she was a wonderful actor. The general had no emotions in his acting but yet was able to look intimidating and dominant.<br/><br/>The lines were more realistic or as realistic you can make a alternate world of fairies and demons. The lines at times were extended past what they had to say but other times they would hit the point and would be perfect for the situation. Sometimes I feel as if the lines would have been best if switched up.<br/><br/>The costumes were rather detailed and well done. The behind the scenes showed that the way they did it was one of a kind of way that most don't use but made it easier on the actors and the makeup crew. Seeing that all he had to do was put in a 2 piece suit and some stilts. As far as the rest of the makeup it was wonderfully done.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was a wonderful movie and was well written and executed and had great costumes and makeup."
"keyliruiz","8","0","0","8 May 2019"," film analysis
","In the film the main character, Ofelia, is a young girl who believes in fairy tales. Ofelia and her mother, Carmen, move to the country where Captain Vidal lives. Ofelia and her mom move there after Ofelia's father dies and Captain Vidal takes Carmen in as his wife. Throughout the movie the storyline consists of two worlds in which Ofelia lives in. She lives in the real world, which is living in the same house as her cruel step-father, and also in a world full of fairies. Once Ofelia and her mom arrive to the Captain's house she comes in contact with a fairy. The fairy leads her to the labryinth where she meets the Faun. The Faun tells her that she has to complete three very difficult tasks in order to grant her immortality and live as a princess of the underworld. Ofelia takes action to complete the tasks because the Faun helps her escape into the fairy tale world whenever things get really difficult in the Capatin's home.
The costumes and make-up of the characters are done really well. The Faun's costume, especially, is done really well to portray the fact that he is in fact a creature sent from the underworld. The horns, the long fingers, the eyes, and every little detail all contribute to the Faun's characsteristics. As for Ofelia, Carmen, and Mercedes, the Captain's housekeeper, are all dressed up and made-up to represent women in Spain living in 1944. The layers of clothing and dresses, the way their hair is done, and the make-up put on the women did a good job reflecting the way women looked and dressed during that time period. The Captain, along with the other soldiers, are wearing their uniforms to show the audience that the movie takes place after the civil war in Spain.
The director, Guillermo Del Toro, makes the different types of settings look very realistic. From the scenes in the labryinth to the scenes inside the Captain's house. The scenes inside the labryinth are done really well because all the details makes it look like it was an actual antique. Inside Captain Vidal's house it is more of a dark place, physically and emotionally. It looks old and the mood changes as soon as Ofelia walks in there. The atmosphere inside of the Captain's house feels like people live unhappily and like if too many people have died or have suffered a tremendous amount of pain while living there. The atmosphere inside the house is a perfect way to represent the Captain himself. In the movie Captain Vida plays the role of a cruel, heartless, selfish person. He is mean to Ofelia and doesn't treat Carmen as if she were his wife. Captain Vidal tortures and beats people when they do something wrong and kills his soldiers when he thinks they are no longer useful.
Overall the film is done really well. The director did a good job overall with the costumes, the character costumes, the setting, and the storyline. The sound effects and the soundtrack match up along with whatever is going on in the movie."
"mnguyen-79046","7","0","0","5 May 2019"," Magically thrilling
","Pan's Labyrinth, directed and written by Guillermo del Toro, masterfully intertwines the mysteries of the fantasy world with the historical and political features of the real world. The plot of the film centers around a young girl named Ofelia. In the film, Ofelia and her mother move to lived with her stepfather, Captain Vital, a tyrannical and sadistic military officer. Post-civil war in Spain, Ofelia escapes the evil of the real world when she discovers a mysterious labyrinth where she meets a faun who tells her she is the long lost Princess Moanna of the underground world and her three tasks to complete before the full moon. The film, then, continues with Ofelia completing these tasks, fighting the evils in her real world, and eventually dying to live and reign in the underground world. Guillermo del Toro successfully and creatively conveys this and the struggles of the real world and fantasy world through the use of the film's linear storyline. The story skillfully transitions back and forth between the two worlds to illustrated their parallels and to convey the similarities and messages. The structure of this was well thought out and executed thrillingly and did not distract from the clear storyline of the film. Guillermo del Toro maintain the simplicity of a clear and linear storyline, as well as, the creativity of the parallels to illustrate and compare the two worlds. One of the components Guillermo del Toro used to establish the story is the use of the setting. The film is set in Spain in 1944 during the early Francoist period. Already, this portrays the historical aspect of the film by building the story off of a history Spain shares. In addition, Guillermo del Toro hide the fantasy world within the real world to show the belief of the story. This realistic but fantasy like setting brilliantly attracts the audience to believe in the story and also excellently emphasize the power of the fantasy world and the use of imagination. Another component used within the setting that forwards the narrative of the story is the use of lighting and space. In the real world, it is set mostly in the day with bright and natural lighting, whereas, the fantasy world is mostly mentioned during the night or with very dim/dark lighting. The purpose of this is to show the difference between the two worlds; the light in the real world showcases only the surface of what ordinary people see and the darkness in the fantasy world showcases the mysterious of the underground world and the wonders it carries from the ones who can see it. The spacing of the two worlds also contributes to the narrative by adding mystery in the fantasy world and structure in the real world. The fantasy world, inspired by the forests and earthly objects, has empty space of mystery and the real world, inspired by the war-like history, is structured with less space to show the commanding and formal world. Overall, Guillermo del Toro successfully created a fairytale horror story that conveys hidden messages of real life and imagination through his purposeful direction of lighting, space, setting, and the likes."

","Pan's Labyrinth's special effects department showed amazing effort and results in their work. The faun's delicate and withered appearance played well with the scenes he appeared in, and was versatile as his mood and the scenes' moods shifted, with the fairies as a well-crafted bonus. The Pale Man was perfectly creepy, his design working perfectly for his actions and scene. The work to create realistic wounds was well reasoned and showed in the final product of the film.<br/><br/>The muted green and gray tones throughout the film's clothing gave a platform for Ophelia's more bright clothing, as well as the blood spilt during the story. The costuming fed the story, through Mercedes' apron and the sickly tones that Carmen wore, as well as setting groups apart by uniform or repeated style. Between the more muted and soft appearance of the protagonists and the sharper uniforms of the Captain and his army, the clothing shows characters' sides in the impending conflict almost immediately.<br/><br/>A largely dark film, the lighting was well placed to accent the highest action points in the film. The darker portions of the film hide figures when necessary without taking away or distracting from the film. The regular appearance and disappearance of the Faun is made more magical by the lighting, and the explosions at the end of the film show the action without being distracting or seeming tacked on."

","Years ago when this movie first came out, I decided to watch it because of all the hype. But back then, I did not have subtitle capability and while I speak Spanish I do not speak Spain Spanish I speak Mexican Spanish and yes there is a difference. So it was hard to follow and get a lot out of it. And over the years my memories of the movie were tainted and that I didn't get to truly enjoy the movie because I was constantly trying to understand what people were saying because they were talking so fast and it didn't seem like there was that much enjoyable in the story line and I was so caught up in the militaristic portions of it.
But when I saw that this movie was on Netflix, I decided to give it a chance and sure enough I had the ability to use subtitles and it didn't detract that much from enjoying the story. So if you're going to watch this I truly recommend you do so with subtitles on. Otherwise you're going to go nuts trying to figure out who's who and what's going on in the story line.
This movie is a true gem if you enjoy immense cinematography and beautiful orchestration. Myself being a person who likes to delve into movies, especially anything that is fantasy and reminds me of all the books that I read growing up to escape, I liked it fully delve into a movie and if the cinematography/ locations and the proper scoring all the films Ambiance is done, you can't help but jump into the deep end and not want to leave! The acting was top-notch! These actors are just amazing and I know it had to help having Guillermo del Toro at the wheel! More on him in a minute. The person in charge of doing the period Costumes was just fantastic! The effects people in charge of not only the Faun, which we know from Greek mythology as Pan, but also the sightless monster, did an amazing job but those characters but quite honestly Pan what's my favorite! He looked every bit the part of a Druidic Faun! So everyone who worked putting this movie together was fantastic! I know the bits and pieces of the real world were very important to character motivation, but for as long as this movie was, I think I would have enjoyed more of the fantasy world and less of the military drudgery and evilness of the Captain's world.
So I've always been a huge comic book fan going back to the 80s when I first got my Chrystar comic book at a garage sale with my grandmother and I cherished it! Then I got back into it in the early 90s when the guy I've been dating for years turn me back on the comic books and what a way to go I ended up with loads of comic books! One of those being Hellboy! I'd heard that a man named Guillermo del Toro was doing a Hellboy movie and I was very concerned because a lot of these comic book movies were just awful! But then I had heard that he had done Pan's Labyrinth, and I checked that out to see what kind of chops he brings to the table. I'm in music industry executive and I deal with bands but in many ways are two different worlds are quite similar. So I wanted to see his qualifications and how good he was. Well like I said earlier it was not easy for me to watch because of all the Spanish going on but I did enjoy what I saw I was not super impressed I was kind of bored because of all the military stuff going on but I thought okay let's see where this goes. But when Hellboy came out, it was completely different from Pan's Labyrinth and it was just funny and explosively full of action and just amazing so he certainly did not let me down! But upon coming back now and watching Pan's Labyrinth again, I can see much more of Guillermo del Toro's influence in this movie, and I'm definitely not disappointed! This was definitely worth watching I recommend it highly, just make sure to turn your subtitles on!"

","Combine Harry Potter, The Lord of The Rings, Inglourious Basterds and you end up here. A most magical story set in post civil-war Spain, a little girl stumbles upon a faun in a labyrinth and discovers she is a long lost princess of an ancient mythical kingdom. She struggles to complete the quests given by the faun, as her step dad continuously battles his enemies, in this wonderful story told in Spanish.<br/><br/>This is for sure director Guillermo del Toro's best ever film, and also one of the greatest stories told in the 21st century. There are many great stories indeed, but nothing quite as spectacular as this one. The creatures are very original and fable-like and creatively decorated. They can bring sheer terror as well as enchant anyone watching. It's in these moments del Toro is lucky to have his go to man, Doug Jones, that make for brilliant and mythic performances.<br/><br/>The movie feels like a classic already the first time you're watching it. It has that energy of an old fairy tale, that is truly captivating and spellbinding. This is a movie that endures due to its extraordinary story telling, but some things feel a bit unmotivated. For example, why did Ofelia have to eat that grape, when the faun specifically told her not to. Yes, they looked delicious to be sure, but still, she wasn't suffering from amnesia. But perhaps that is the magic behind stories like this one, that things doesn't need to be motivated, they just happen and we go along with it.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie isn't breathtaking either, but neither is it bad. It is simply not the priority here. The best performance comes out of the faun, both the body movements and the voice acting, making it really come alive and feel so magical that it could have been a tree bewitched by Harry Potter himself.<br/><br/>It is not to say that other parts of this movie is bad, I just believe it is not as good as it could have been. But hadn't the focus been so fixed on the story, perhaps we wouldn't have got the wonderful piece that we have. The story is what it excels in, being one of the best story telling movies of all time.<br/><br/>Should I say it again? The story in this movie is out of this world and just absolutely wonderful and brilliant and classy, that you'd wish it was a trilogy. But something should stay untouched, and simply take its place in history as the most remarkable story of this century."
"ElMaruecan82","10","0","0","22 February 2019"," There was Disney, then Cocteau and finally Del Toro!
","I remember these Sunday afternoons in the early 90s where movie versions of classic Grim tales were aired and I could tell from my parents' enjoyment that they were made for both an adult and a child audience. I still remember the ""Red Hot Riding Hood"" movie and the nightmarish sight of the wolf posing as the sickly grandmother and whose face managed to fool the little girl.<br/><br/>So It would be an unfair trial to accuse Disney of watering down fairy tales when you recall nightmarish moments such as the Evil Queen's metamorphosis, Pinocchio's friend turning into a donkey, Bambi's mother etc. Disney understood what made these stories from the Grimm Brothers and Perrault so vivid in our memories, begging to be translated into a visual language, Disney for children and Cocteau for adults proving there were more than fairies in fairy tales, they could be dark stories exuding wisdom and poetry.<br/><br/>And then came the third (ram's?) head of the triumvirate, Guillermo Del Toro with his ""Pan's Labyrinth"", a maze of a plot and a masterpiece that uses the basics of fairy tales: supernatural elements, fantastic creatures and coming-of-age story through an allegorical language that also ventures in the realms of politics while I was expecting something in the vein of ""Narnia"" or ""Lord of the the Rings"". How misguided I was. This is is certainly one of the all-time greatest fantasy movies and original fairy tales.<br/><br/>The reason why the film works so much is because it prepares you to venture in the realms of fantasy but it's the juxtaposition with a clearly defined historical period that marks its first intriguing novelty. Set in wartime during the fight between Franco's soldiers and rebels at the end of the civil war; it's that element of context that gives the story its full meaning.The parallel's relevance is highlighted by the contrast between that period and the narrated 'prologue' about a princess who disappeared from her kingdom, a world where 'no lies and pains' exists.<br/><br/>We're plunged in a world that seems like the antithesis of that kingdom and while we wish for the princess' soul to get back to that world of her own, so many things happening in reality prevent us from envisioning any other alternate world as if reality was too cruel to make us believe in fairy tales. And Del Toro doesn't underestimate our intelligence, he knows we'll suspect the 11-year old girl Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) who reads the story, to be the potential chosen one, and while we're tempted to see the world from her child's perspective, we realize that the distinction between the real world and the fantasy isn't just stylistic but also narrative.<br/><br/>This is more than ""Alice in Wonderland"", what happens in reality escapes from Ofelia's attention as if it had a narrative relevance of its own and the monstrosity of the Pale Man for instance is nothing compared to what the main antagonist of the film has to offer. Indeed, Ofelia must clearly deal in the real world and above everything, her abusive adoptive father who impregnated her mother, a ruthless Captain named Vidal.<br/><br/>Vidal is a soldier who lives by the fascist code and has only contempt for anyone below his rank: rebels, women, children. The man is blinded by his power, uses his patriarchy as a terror weapon but beyond his menacing aura, is capable to display bravery, considering death as the true measure of a man. Vidal doesn't prove that vileness lives with rules but that rules can be evil in the way they force blind obedience and lead to blind violence.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ofelia must also follow rules and accomplish tasks that are not devoid of blood spillages. The tasks are given by a ram-headed creature, a Faun she met in the middle of an ancient labyrinth. And never question the validity of these tasks as if the ""fantasy"" worlds had more legitimacy to call for obedience. It's until the second task where Ofelia meets the infamous Pale Man and refuses to follow an order that we understand the absolute value of obedience before it's questioned again in the final task.<br/><br/>Once we start to draw parallels between Ofelia's journey and the war in the background, that we value her courage and the heroism of everyday fighters, a doctor, a servant against the ordinary tyranny of fascism and other institutions that sacrificed generations of Spanish people, that we anticipate with thrilled expectations the convergence between these two worlds. The final task wonderfully ties up the plot together in a parable of infinite wisdom, and whose use of violence is the best tribute to its maturity and intelligence.<br/><br/>Indeed, I have always avoided the film because I heard about how disturbing it was and when I found the DVD, the ""beware violent scenes"" made me expect the worst and I knew I had to be careful. But I was caught off-guard when the first disturbing scene happened. Many fantasy moments were repellent but they never equaled the violence reached by Vidal, played by a disturbing but effective Sergi Lopez.<br/><br/>The film establishes the heights of horror and disgustingness reached by the two worlds and how it all comes down to simple issues ""should one follow his heart, his principles or follow blindly the rules?"". The film manages to raise such intelligent question by providing great insight about the horror of the Franco's regime and make us adults root for the adventure of a little girl, with a fairy tale that embraces the true essence of a genre too sugarcoated today.<br/><br/>I have seen the film once but it touched me deeply through its visual, the little girl's performance, the haunting lullaby melody that I shall never forget. Or let's just put it simply, if as they say, a film is as good as its villain, then ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is truly a masterpiece."

","The movie does a lot of things well but they could've made more of it.<br/><br/>Camera, colors, actors and sound are good, CGI totally fine. The plot seems a little random at times because we don't get to know more about this World you want to keep exploring after the movie is done.<br/><br/>
The film has some very brutal scenes which were very well executed.<br/><br/>
I'd expect a sequel since there seems to be so much more to explore beyond this foundation.
They announced a prequel called '3993' but it never came out til today which is a bummer because I think they can keep developing this story and make the 2nd movie even more for a mature audience (at parts this movie feels more like a Family-Fantasy (besides the very brutal scenes I mentioned))."

","Guillermo Del Toro's dark fairy-tale is at its best when it delves into its own twisted fantasy and our young protagonist comes face to face with some of the most unique creations within the genre, and yet its civil war backdrop plays just as important a role in shaping the overall story. 'Pan's Labyrinth (2006)' provides a surprisingly brutal stark contrast to the sense of wide-eyed wonder we feel whenever the lead steps into her newfound world of fawns and fairies, a world which isn't actually all that much safer. The tangibility of both these aspects is commendable considering one was created from scratch and the other was recreated from a war-torn era over fifty years ago. It is the believability of the world that makes the stakes seem all the more real, considering that danger is almost constantly present even in the places where the protagonist goes to escape - or seek a remedy for - her real-life woes. This is a layered, magical and mature piece that almost demands dissection. It's affecting, engaging and enjoyable. 9/10"

","This movie might come off as a traditional fairy tale directed at children during the first few minutes, but it doesn't take long for one to understand it's far from it. Guillermo del Toro truly has done a lot of brave things here, resulting in a gritty and gruesome, yet beautiful, unique and memorable story. The movie also features swell acting, a serviceable score, as well as decent visuals. The main flaw to this movie in my opinion, are some of the creature designs. Sure, they're not bad, but to make them even better, they would have needed to have more of a connection to the protagonist's mind. Some of the characters also feel very one dimensional, the captain in particular. Though, the aforementioned faults are negligible, and Pan's Labyrinth is ultimately a pretty good movie."

","""Come, sit beside your father. He has been waiting for you so long.""<br/><br/>I am at a loss for words after seeing this movie.<br/><br/>""Magic does not exist. Not for you, and not for anyone else."" These are probably the most penetrating words of the entire film. They are preceded by ""You're getting older. Soon you'll see life isn't like your fairy tales. The world is a cruel place.... and you'll learn that even if it hurts."" I believe in the heart of every person, we want to see the world as a mythic place. We want to believe in magic, but somewhere along the way, we were told to 'grow up.'<br/><br/>I believe in magic. I've seen it for myself. It exists in expertly crafted film, and in the creative minds of people who are not afraid to unleash it. If magic exists in film, then 'Pan's Labyrinth' is the most powerful spell there is. <br/><br/>I'll begin with the story. It revolves around a young, creative girl who, after loosing her father during the war, moves with her pregnant mother the house of her new husband - a fascist army general commanding an army in Spain. Ofelia, though, is young and innocent. She sees the world as it is - a mythic, extraordinary place, full of magic, wonder, and things only imaginable by a child. Upon exploring her new backyard, she finds a stone labyrinth, at the center of which is a faun.<br/><br/>He tells her she's fallen into a story where she plays a crucial part - she is the princess of a land unknown by humans. She is given a new name - Princess Moanna of the Underground Realm, and is sent on a dangerous adventure filled with peril, danger, and magic.<br/><br/>All the while, conflict breaks out between her step-father and his endeavors to sweep the land clean (i.e., kill) all those who do not agree with the fascist laws set into place. Constantly avoiding her violent and angry father, Ofelia tries desperately to fight for the kingdom she was told about by the faun - a kingdom where she has a place.<br/><br/>This story speak to my heart like no other - it's so filled with spiritual truth, magic, innocence, and just... awe-inspired wonder that you cannot watch this movie without feeling like you are watching a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The acting is phenomenal. What I wouldn't give to be fluent in Spanish, so I could have paid more attention to the actors' faces as they performed, rather than the subtitles, but it made no difference. Every single character was played beautifully. <br/><br/>The visual effects in this movie were outstanding as well. Not ground- breaking, but the cinematography (which, I learned after watching, actually won the Oscar the year of it's release) combined with the visualizations are simply magnificent. The faun, the fairies, the labyrinth, the trees, even down to the little particles floating in the air - it brings a level of magic to this movie not thought possible; at least by me. <br/><br/>I do wish to make clear, though, this is not a kids' movie. Not in the least bit. It well deserves it's 'R' rating. It has violence, language (although, you only have to read it, not hear it), and sometimes, the magic and creatures of the film are rather intense and frightening to look at. All this is set during a war, too (though there aren't any kind of huge battles or anything). What came to mind while watching this was 'This is a Disney movie for grown-ups.'<br/><br/>The music was masterfully mixed and written and flowed so well with the story. The score during the closing credits was extraordinary, and the sheer tender simplicity of it all was beautiful by itself.<br/><br/>As I sit here writing, I am trying to find at least one negative thing to say about the film. There is not one that is coming to mind right now. I'm entirely serious. It was that good.<br/><br/>I was extremely happy to discover, during the end credits, who directed this movie. Guillermo del Toro. I'd never seen anything by him before, but I did know he's directing the two 'The Hobbit' movies slated for release in coming years. After seeing 'Pan's Labyrinth,' I am almost certain 'The Hobbit' will surpass 'The Lord of the Rings.' I would be surprised if it didn't. <br/><br/>This movie was astonishing, in every way a person can be astonished. Maybe it speaks to my creative mind, and maybe you won't see what I saw in it, but the film I viewed was a masterpiece. There is no question.<br/><br/>My favorite part, though, was the story. I'd like to share a quote with you. I will not give it proper context, but I will say it might spoil the movie for you. But, I feel I need to share it. It's placement was nothing short of enlightening and beautiful.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** ""...and it is said that the Princess returned to her Father's Kingdom. She reigned with him with justice and a kind heart for many centuries. She always loved her people. She left behind small traces of her time on Earth visible only to those who knew where to look."" ***END SPOILERS***<br/><br/>That is my dream. The create magic like Guillermo del Toro did with this film. To leave 'small traces of my time here on Earth' so people, generations, after me can know the mythic world I lived and believed in, and that they, too, can enter into their Father's Kingdom, who, too, has been waiting for them for so long.<br/><br/>5/5"
"dunmore_ego","8","4","12","4 October 2009"," A wondrously grim fairy tale.
","PAN'S LABYRINTH is a fairy tale, but it's not for kids. Ironically, the fairy tales that are for kids are as dark as this tale.<br/><br/>Spanish with English subtitles.<br/><br/>Set in the lush woodlands of 1944 Spain, during the waning of WWII, young bookworm Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and her pregnant mother (Ariadna Gil) move into an army barracks with stepfather Captain Vidal (Sergi LÃ³pez), a ruthless fascist, bent on weeding out the last resistance fighters hiding out in the woods. Maribel VerdÃº is their maid, secretly aiding the resistance.<br/><br/>The marketing for PAN'S LABYRINTH is misleading, where they push the magical wonders. You won't find monsters appearing around every turn, rather, Guillermo del Toro writes and directs this very grim fairy tale as a drama, rooted in the real world of war - violent, painful and unforgiving. Ofelia escapes this world of constant suffering by becoming a part of the imaginative books she devours.<br/><br/>Unlike Jim Henson's LABYRINTH (1986) where a girl is transported to a magical world wholly separate from ours, the ""magical"" world in PAN'S LABYRINTH is so woven into the fabric of the real world that the transitions between the two are seamless and we don't get the sense of being transported to another dimension, so much as the magical world infiltrating into ours.<br/><br/>One night, a fairy leads Ofelia into the labyrinth behind the barracks, where she meets El Fauno - Pan - who informs her she is a long-lost princess of a subterranean world and can only return to her true father, the underworld king, by completing three tasks. It's the old Three Tasks gag again, in a modern movie about ancient occultism.<br/><br/>Doug Jones (HELLBOY's Abe Sapien) is Fauno, a faun unlike any you've ever seen; designed to look like he sprang from the living Earth, half-humanoid, half-goat, twigs and gnarled bark his skin. Although I think this is the first time I've heard a mythical beast speak Spanish. All those old Euro Sinbad tales and Italian Hercules movies always overdubbed English, so we take it for granted that - like STAR TREK - every un-human in every culture has to speak English for our convenience. It is almost jarring to hear Fauno use the language of the day-worker soliciting for odd jobs outside Home Depot. (Although he doesn't look as scary as some of them.) Doug Jones also plays The Pale Man, a gangrel creature who presides over an uneaten banquet, who has to insert eyes into his hands to see.<br/><br/>The gore in PAN'S LABYRINTH is an organic part of its violent reality and comes at us gruesome and shocking; a doctor saws off a man's leg - without anesthetic!; there are point-blank executions; Maribel VerdÃº never gets to show off her magnificent figure under those frumpy maid skirts, but goes hog-wild with a kitchen knife; Captain Vidal tortures a prisoner with a hammer, before his own cheek is sliced open and he must stitch it together - in closeup! <br/><br/>Like every fairy tale - were it to be examined deeply - there is a disturbing resolution, as Ofelia tries to save her newborn baby brother and discovers that Fauno seeks to sacrifice him to the Labyrinth - the portal to the lower world is opened by the ""blood of an innocent."" The only fairy tale I can think of more gruesome is the King James Bible.<br/><br/>--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania)."
"DICK STEEL","5","4","12","7 January 2007"," A Nutshell Review: Pan's Labyrinth
","A lot have been said about Pan's Labyrinth, and having critical praise from all many corners and circles, have piqued my interest in the movie. However, I was apprehensive as well, because by virtue of it being a fantasy like fairy tale, I suspect it was not up my alley, given my lack of sustainable interest during the screenings of recent movies of the same genre, made by prolific filmmakers like Terry Gillian's Brothers Grimm, or Mirrormask as scribed by the renowned Neil Gaiman.<br/><br/>True enough, I was bored with Pan's Labyrinth. Really bored. Not that it wasn't a beautifully made film. It is, and the sets and costumes all looked like no effort was spared in trying to recreate the 1940s Spain, as well as the fantastical elements in the storyline. It wasn't the story as well, as the worst thing that could happen is incoherentness and inconsistency. No such thing in the movie, and the pacing was tight too. Perhaps I didn't enjoy director Guillermo del Toro's vision for this particular movie?<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth tells the story of a little girl, Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), whose love is for the fairy tales she brings along with her pregnant mother, en route to live with her new stepfather. Things start to get interesting (for her at least), when a mystical faun comes visiting, and offers an illusionary life that she was supposed to be leading. Now, depending on whether you believe in fairy tales, or how much you'll allow yourself to be affected by, and buy into the plot, you'll be in either camp - if you do believe, then you'll find this a blast. Otherwise, like me, it seemed rather forced, and you'll prefer to look at it from the angle of psychosis. <br/><br/>I think because of past history that I don't believe in fairy tales anymore, so that innate fact took its toil when I was watching Pan's. I'd rather look at it from the angle that there's something totally wrong with Ofelia's mind, or to put it midly, she's got a wild imagination that allowed her to allude that she's seeing things, more like.<br/><br/>So I officially sanction myself, and state it clearly here. Every reviewer has their likes and dislikes. Mine unfortunately turned out to be movies of such a genre. I would love to have enjoyed it, but somehow it didn't turn out the way I would have liked it to be. So there you know my innate bias, so don't take my word for it, watch it to see if you share the same sentiments."

Every competent, well-written, well-acted, well-made film isn't another Citizen Kane or Les Enfants du paradis, if it were then Kane and Enfants would soon be debased.

","I was hesitant to watch Pan's Labyrinth with high expectations despite hearing nothing but rave reviews, lest I end up disappointed, but I was foolish to even worry in the first place; del Toro has created a captivating masterpiece. A Spanish-language dark fantasy (watch in Spanish with English subtitles), it's a fascinating journey into a young girl's adventurous mind and the courage, often lacked even by adults, which she musters to overcome her fears and the hardships she faces.<br/><br/>Very simply, the premise is this: Ofelia, a young girl, travels with her pregnant mum to a mill in the middle of the Spanish woods where her stepfather, a heartless Captain, is leading a group of men against the remaining remnants of several Spanish Maquis. She stumbles across a fairy and a faun located deep inside a labyrinth who assigns three dangerous tasks for her to complete. For what reason, and whether she completes them, you'll have to watch to find out.<br/><br/>The strength lies in several areas, but most notably in Ivana Baquero's stellar performance as Ofelia (she was only 11 at the time!) and the various supporting roles. In fact, it's unfair to label the other actors/actresses as supporting characters as they held considerably main roles as well. Maribel Verdú, as the caring housekeeper, Mercedes, carried out an especially powerful and astounding performance (I knew I recognised her somewhere; ah, right! She was in Y tu mamá también, portraying a very different character).<br/><br/>In addition to the acting, the Cinematography and Art Direction is superb (it didn't win those Academy Awards for nothing!). The shots (especially the panning shots) are so natural but integral to the film, providing well balanced pacing and expertly works the audience's emotions.<br/><br/>But what establishes this film as different from other fantasy films is not only the creepy fantasy element (do remember, it is a dark film), but also the intense and thrilling background story of the conflict between the Fascist regime led by the Captain against the rebelling anarchists. In fact, the war element is just as strong as the fantasy element. They both surprisingly and naturally work well together.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, and if you have the chance, do watch it. It's been a while since I was so emotionally attached to a film. You're in for an electrifying ride, I guarantee it.<br/><br/>Personal Highlights: In one of the tasks entrusted to Ofelia, del Toro crafts one of the most riveting and suspense-filled scenes in the entire film, carried out brilliantly by Ivana. According to del Toro, Stephen King, the master of horror, squirmed during this very scene!"
"a05102267","9","3","8","23 July 2008"," The last task is for the viewer
","""Pan's Labyrinth"" is one of those movies that deserved all the praise that it receives. Now imagine if a movie has the cruelty and the horror of movies as ""In Company of Wolves"", the dark beauty of Tim Burton's films and the nostalgic tone of the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" has all that and more. The story could be taken literally as the way that everything that happens in the movie is real, but also could be seen as a symbol of the feelings of the characters in the hard times that they live. Ofelia, the main character is a girl that dreams with her own world of fantasy when the reality fails her miserably. And after he mets the strange faun (played wonderfully by Doug Jones, who also made a great work playing the terrifying Pale Man) she finds her hope, but also learns about all the evilness around her, the cruelty and the lack of humanity of the world that she lives, something that seems more terrifying than giant frogs or strange monsters. At the end, the faun offers her chose between her dreams and what is good. And she chooses, and then the ambiguous (and yet, somewhat hopeful) ending came. So here is a last task for the viewers of the film made by Guillermo del Toro: If that those viewers are able to accept the fantasy or if they will reject it considering that everything was in Ofelia's mind. Many theories have been mentioned in different web sites, some trying to prove that everything related with the fantasy (the faun, the fairies, the monsters and the magical kingdom) were only imagination, while others are convinced that all the events of the movie were real. However, there is nothing to prove: The film's tone is ambiguous, letting the viewers chose whatever they want according their perception of the reality. I guess that it is the message of ""Pan's Labyrinth"": how our perception of the world makes us chose our decisions, to chose between right and wrong, to chose to believe or not. It is very much like believing in the after-life, and some religious imagery shows us that this wasn't unintentional. Besides that, the film is wonderful: the direction is great, the atmosphere is very well made, the performances are incredible (Specially Sergi López as the evil Captain Vidal, that is by more terrifying than any of the monsters of the film) This is a good example of adult fantasy, and is probably a unique movie in his genre. Now that Guillermo del Toro is working on ""The Hobbit"" we know that we could wait for the best."
"fosterino","10","3","8","17 February 2008"," Bold, Lyrical, Unforgettable
","I watched this movie on my good friend's recommendation. In hindsight it may have been the best movie recommendation he or anyone else has ever given me. This movie is incredible on so many different levels that other fantasy movies appear superficial and timid by comparison.<br/><br/>The story opens with a tale about Princess Moanna, princess of the Underworld, who ascends to the human world and dies as a result. The tale prophesizes that one day the princess will return, possibly in another time and place....<br/><br/>After this prologue, the real story starts. Set in civil war era Spain, this is a melding of both a political/war drama and a fantastical fable. A bookish young girl named Ofelia is traveling with her sickly pregnant mother to the outpost of the sadistic but utterly enthralling Captain Vidal. From this outpost he hunts down and kills the communist guerrillas in the surrounding hills. As an escape from this unfamiliar and hostile environment, Ofelia escapes into the fantasy world, populated by fairies and fauns, that stems from an enigmatic labyrinth in the nearby woods. The thing is, this world becomes equally dangerous and dark as the real world she wishes to escape, especially after a faun reveals to her that she is Princess Moanna and she must accomplish three tasks to prove it.<br/><br/>This is where the whole duality of the story gets really interesting. We never know for sure if the fairy tale portion of the story is actually real, or is in fact part of Ofelia's imagination. For example, throughout the film these dual plot lines remained separate never interfering with the other, but they seem to influence each other in mysterious ways. At the end, the two plot lines converge; the two worlds come together, and the result is truly magical, lyrical cinema. It still leaves this question unanswered, but each viewer will have his or her own interpretation.<br/><br/>On top of all this, both of the separate stories would work well on their own and be equally good movies. The war drama half very compelling, relying on an extraordinarily commanding performance by Serji Lopez as Captain Vidal. This particular half of the story grounds the action in reality and serves as a point of reference for the fantasy side of the story. The fantasy half is just as dark, though. Ofelia's encounter with an endlessly creepy creature called the Pale Man is genuinely discomforting, and the faun himself seems to channel both good and evil, thereby offering Ofelia the choice between them.<br/><br/>The look and set design of the film are equally impressive. Every set in the film was purpose built, and the result is an original world; there is mysterious monolith that stands in the center of the labyrinth that would inspire awe and wonderment even if there was no story or narrative surrounding it. The cinematography is good too. All of the technical aspects elevate the film to a completely different plane of artistry.<br/><br/>(What you are about to read is NOT a spoiler. The film shows you this in the first minute.) The film ends where it begins. I will say no more, although I encourage you to draw your own conclusions about the specific reality and framing of the story. No matter which way you see it, however, this is one incredible and unforgettable film.<br/><br/>On another note, believe the rating when it tells you about ""Graphic Violence."" It's being truthful, this is a REALLY violent movie - don't take your kids to see it."

","The movie was not as fantasy-filled or imaginative as I had first anticipated. This movie was always being marketed as an adult fairytale, set in a totally imaginative world, with lots of odd but beautiful looking characters. But basically the main character only visits the fairytale-like world on 3 occasions during the movie and the number of characters within the world is actually very limited. I understand the marketing approach and it was not like I was disappointed or missed anything, but just know what to expect when watching this movie. It's more a story of fascist Spain of 1944, through the eyes of a child, who seeks refugee in her own fantasy, from the evil world and events and characters around her but above all the movie gets still set mostly in the 'real world'.<br/><br/>The movie knows to create a nice and credible mix between the real world events and the fantasy world of Ofelia. Sometimes the two worlds even mix, which also makes the viewer unsure of how much of it is actually real and what is the fantasy of Ofelia.<br/><br/>And for people who still think this is a children's movie, which are still quite a lot; Believe me, it's not! No people get shot trough the head or are being tortured graphical in a children's movie. This movie is the definition of an adult fairytale. A genre that is not completely new by the way, but will bring many more movies in the near future I hope, after the big success of this movie.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie is truly a beautiful looking with, with some good camera-work, production design, make-up effects and its special effects. The movie has the smooth look you would normally expect from a big Hollywood production. But Guillermo del Toro of course is no stranger to this world and type of film-making and has more than enough experience, resources and contacts to make a movie such as this one in his native language as well. It's not hard to see why this movie won 3 Oscars for Best Achievement in Art Direction, Best Achievement in Cinematography and Best Achievement in Makeup. The movie was actually being nominated for 3 more Oscars and it deserved to win at least 2 more of them. The music really deserved a win! A real crime Gustavo Santaolalla beat Javier Navarrete over this one.<br/><br/>But the movie might have the same smoothness of a big Hollywood production, it's everything but a standard Hollywood movie, with all of the formulaic events. The movie is creative in its directing and story-telling. It's makes sure that everything happens as a surprise and you won't ever know or guess what would happen in the next scene or the ending, since this is such an original and far from formulaic movie. So also don't expect a big happy cheerful ending, although some people might still regard the ending is an happy one. It at least is a satisfying one that suits the movie most perfectly imaginable.<br/><br/>This is an big project and therefor an heavy burden for the young Ivana Baquero to carry the movie. But she does it and she does it well. Also Sergi López knows to impress, among others.<br/><br/>Perhaps not all of the elements are handled well within in the movie and there are some missed opportunities here and there in my opinion, such as a better portrayal of the relationship between Ofelia and Capitán Vidal. Small things like this prevents this movie to me from being an absolute masterpiece or must-see but nevertheless the movie of course remains more than a great one and most definitely also a very creatively original one.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"andrefbento","9","3","8","2 November 2007"," Brilliant movie
","What I really appreciate about this movie is the mixing between the ""real"" story and the ""fantastic"" story.. I used the """" since the director really surprises us all in the end, and apparently the ""real"" story in the sense that it is not an illusion in the movie can be viewed as the one that we at the first instance would considered as the fictional. The fantastic underworld of Ophelia is quite real in the movie, and she is being tested in our ""real"" world so that she can prove that she deserves to come back to the place from where she had escaped. I believe this could be the perfect allegory for a scenario of war, irrespective of the location and the time. The director has chosen the Spanish war but any war scenario would work for this movie. Although my opinion is quite subjective, I would say that the point of this movie is that any war can be so horrible and inhuman that even a perfect fairy tale should be seen as anything more real than it for us. This is why the characters are so stereotypical in the movie, except for the ones that are more closely related to the ""fairy tale"": Ophelia and Mercedes. This inversion is really original and this is why it works so well in the end."
"scruffydog724","10","3","8","9 September 2007"," A beautiful fantasy
","Never have I seen such a real and honest film. I find the fantasy world created by Guillermo del Toro to be amazingly cutting edge. This isn't your average, run of the mill fairy tale. The director uses the horribly violent background of the Spanish civil war to contrast against this mystical story that this innocent young girl is a part of. Her childish innocence accepts the fantasy without question, making it all the more believable for those unwilling to accept a fairy tale. The Labyrinth becomes her retreat from a world wrought with violence; a world that she wants no part of. The extreme violence, mixed with a wonderful sense of realism creates a strange story that keeps you enthralled until the very surreal ending. A definite must-see."

","I just saw this film 2 days ago on DVD, but I think it's a must-see movie. I know Del Toro's films ,but I expected something else. I didn't think that he can make such a beautiful and cruel, brutal fairy tale. This film is the best I've seen in the last 4 months. And I have to speak about the music. It's brilliant and sensitive but mysterious and dark at the same time. Javier Navarrete should get the Academy award for the best Music. Beside the music and the film itself I have to mention the fantastic actors. My favorite is the young Ivana Baquero. I think she's got a great future. I hope I'll see her in such a good movie like this in the near future."

","When I watch films normally I can always find something I would have changed about the film, but this film is so aesthetically pleasing to the eyes through its use of lighting and cinematography that I would not change anything. The story is precisely thought out so as to use the cinematographer's tools to enhance it. Any violence in the film is there for the purpose of telling the story. The makeup and the costumes add to the characters and make them more lifelike. It's easy for the viewer to become lost in the Labyrinth themselves. My favorite character is the faun of course or Pan as he is known. He is the most eloquent faun I have seen in any film. It is my favorite film of 2006. It is a must to watch, even if you do not like subtitles."
"sullibrandon","10","3","8","22 January 2007"," A Brilliant Coming-of-Age Fantasy
","It's been known for awhile that somewhere in the good directing skills of Guillermo del Toro there has been a great director just waiting to spring out. With his latest film, del Toro proves he has that rare great directing spark. Pan's Labyrinth is a brilliantly directed film that excites, amazes, and terrifies, shining with impressive performances, a captivating storyline, and dazzling special effects that are refreshingly lacking in CGI.<br/><br/>The film takes place near the end of World War II in Europe, in a war-torn Spain, where our main character, young Ofelia, lives with her mother who is pregnant with a son and is to be wed to the leader of a battalion of the Spanish army. The film opens with a brief fairy tale explaining how an underground kingdom's princess reached the surface and forgot about where she came from, living out her life and eventually dying. Ever since then, the legend goes, the kingdom has been waiting for her return. After this little backstory we see Ofelia, obsessed with reading fairy tales, and her mother traveling to the outpost in the woods, where Captain Vidal awaits his new bride.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth involves fewer fairy tale elements than you would think. The trailers present it as this epic fantasy adventure, but most of the action actually takes place in the ""real world."" We are shown this war-torn, horrible world through little Ofelia's eyes, revealing it as ruthless and terrifying, clearly a world that a child should not be forced to experience, but Ofelia must face it every single day, and her only escape is the world of Pan's Labyrinth.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth raises some very interesting questions, and it doesn't do them sloppily. This is a very cleanly directed film, with a clear and intent purpose  it doesn't bounce all over the place raising questions for the heck of it; everything is clean and to the point, and there is barely a second of wasted space. More than anything, it is one of the most beautiful coming-of-age tales I have seen in a long while. This entire movie is about Ofelia, growing up, the loss of innocence, and this process is captivated ingeniously by telling it through the medium of dark fantasy. By no means is this a kids' fairy tale story. It is unrestrictedly violent  del Toro does not hesitate in showing us a man get killed by having a bottle neck smashed into his face repeatedly. He doesn't do it so much that it desensitizes, but he gives us just enough gore to place us squarely in Ofelia's world. Ofelia must wrestle with this world in which she lives, and even the fantasy that she creates (doesn't create?) for herself is dark and mysterious and foreboding. The film also seems to be a kind of eulogy for childhood innocence, an acknowledgment that it must end, but also a recognition of how truly fantastic it can be. Ofelia's imagination and wonder hold a solid power in this world, a power that can truly be felt even by those in the world who do not believe it.<br/><br/>Ofelia's imagination and the fantasy world that she escapes to is also creatively and captivatingly shown through some impressive special effects work. Aside from some little ""fairies"" that show up from time to time, the film is virtually devoid of CGI, making it so much more real. Not only this, but the creatures created are ingeniously original and frighteningly creepy (not the least of whom is the terrifying Pale Man). When a special effects team still has the power to come up with a grotesquely beautiful image or to scare without cheap thrills or useless gore, you know they're good. And the very real lack of ""fake"" monsters or backgrounds only makes Ofelia's world that much more engrossing.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is truly a great fantasy masterpiece. Del Toro, with his usual dazzling vision, carefully crafts and completely keeps the essence of this dark world from the first frame to the last. It's difficult to even necessarily find anything wrong with the film. The acting is superb all around, especially from the actress who plays Ofelia. Some people may find the violence to be too extreme for their taste, but I found that it was an extremely effective way of portraying the world in which Ofelia lives. Another criticism could be that there is not enough of the fantasy element, but this only, to me, showed how overpowering and all encompassing the war-torn world was. It's what Ofelia lives in, and it is an entirely appropriate decision considering that we are seeing things from her perspective. Ofelia's lack of incredulity is also another strength of the movie  she is a young child, nearly a teenager, true enough, but what young child in her situation would not believe the incredible things that she sees? She needs to believe them; it's her only escape. Its only fault may be that it drags at parts, but even that is negligible considering the sheer awesomeness of the rest of the film.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is not a perfect film. It does not carry the import of a cautionary tale, such as Children of Men, or the brilliantly dazzling acting of Helen Mirren in The Queen (which I haven't seen). It does contain extreme violence, which will turn some people off. Others may find the fantasy element difficult to grasp or understand. What Pan's Labyrinth does so intelligently is to perfectly capture the world in which it exists. This is an intensely amazing world that del Toro is wrestling with, and the fact that he pulled off portraying it picture perfect should be applauded. Everything that del Toro attempts succeeds with flying colors. This movie is a prime example of expert film-making at its peak."

"Sevenmercury7","6","3","8","13 December 2006"," Barely a fantasy
","Visually, 'Pan's Labyrinth' is an artistic triumph. It's a grim, grimy downer of a tale shot by a brilliant cinematographer. The set designs are all grey and earthy, which is absolutely right for rural post-Civil War Spain. The few creatures we meet are nicely done, particularly an ingenious monster with eye sockets in his palms. Performances are excellent.<br/><br/>So why the average rating? Well, for a purported fantasy there's far too much time given to the villain of the piece - a relentlessly nasty Captain in the Spanish army - who has no redeeming characteristics, and is too obviously meant as a symbol for the oppressive regime. He's an amoral butcher; OK, we get it, let's get back to the labyrinth. But no, the fantasy takes a definite back seat. And it's relentlessly depressing. Del Toro's trying for an Amon Goeth with the Captain; unfortunately, his depth is confined to obsessing over his father's watch, which stopped at the time of his death. And that's it. The faun (and guide for our heroine) is a confused creation: is he helping the girl or setting her up for a fall? With the reality of the movie so downbeat, do we really need our one and only talking fantasy creature to be an ass as well? <br/><br/>The tasks she has to perform are inventive but silly. And a ridiculously short time is given to each, compared to the protracted scenes involving the bloodthirsty captain. The strongest character of the film is in fact the head servant of the house, a lady with a dangerous secret, who drives the story forward at every turn.<br/><br/>Don't let the hype fool you. It's a good movie, strongly acted and directed, but a fantasy it is not. It's a violent war movie consisting one part magic, three parts very bleak adult drama."

","Don't let the fact that it is in Spanish throw you. This is a dark, moving and sometimes terrifying masterpiece of a film. Director Guilliemo Del Torro directs with briskness and deep understanding of the film. The film looks gorgeous, very beautiful in one scene, and quite Gothic in another. Another director I can think of that directs visually stunning films is Ridley Scott. The music score by Javier Navarette is haunting, poignant and beautiful. The script is very mysterious, suspenseful and genuinely moving at times, and there are some genuinely memorable characters, the idealistic protagonist, the brutal stepfather, the pregnant mother and the caring housemaid. Here is one of the few fantasies where the images stay with you forever. There are beautiful costumes and a stunning forest set, the labyrinth is very Gothic and dark, as is the wise and mysterious faun, and the war and torture scenes are unashamedly graphic. Another honourable mention should go to the monster that tricks children into eating his food when he is asleep, and then he wakes up and eats them. He was so terrifying, the very look of him, made my blood run cold. He is one of the most terrifying creatures I have ever seen in the history of film. All in all, a visually stunning and absolutely magnificent film, with a definite 10/10. Bethany Cox."

The next, it is a grown-up war flick. As a result of the ping-ponging between these two poorly realized plots, the viewer can never can a true feel and sympathy for either.

I sense a political agenda at work, but am not aware enough of European history or religious/political cultural stereotypes to be sure what that agenda is. Anti-fascism is one thing, but the portrayal of 'bad guys' in this film is just too simplistic and laughable. Are western moviegoers so inured to media-spun fairy tales masquerading as reality that they can't recognize trite clichés when they see and read them?

"durkin01","8","3","9","30 October 2010"," Pan's Labyrinth
","Pan's Labyrinth, directed by Guillermo del Toro, is a captivating fairy tale of dark sorts, incorporating two stories into one. It is the story of a little girl, Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), who seeks an alternative to the world she lives in by way of reading and believing in fairy tales. It is also the story of the post Spanish Civil War era at a military station in the mountains. Both of the parallel story lines have the theme of making choices. We each have a path to chose and a choice to make. Pan's Labyrinth shows the path of a little girl in a mythic world, and of a military Captain's world of cruelty.<br/><br/>The film opens with narration describing the story of the underworld and how Princess Moanna ventured up into the world above on Earth and died. The King of the Underworld still waits for her return. We are then introduced to Ofelia, who is traveling with her pregnant mother, Carmen (Ariadna Gil), to live with Captain Vidal (Sergi López i Ayats). The Captain is stationed at the mountain military post. Carmen married Captain Vidal after Ofelia's father died and is pregnant by him. On the way to their new home, they briefly stop due to Carmen's pregnancy sickness and Ofelia wanders into the woods ahead. She befriends a fairy and her fairy tale begins.<br/><br/>Upon arrival to the military camp, Captain Vidal's cruel meanness is seen the second he arrives on screen to greet the travelers. The Captain's kind caretaker, Mercedes (Maribel Verdú), is introduced and Ofelia knows that she can trust her. Their relationship bonds throughout the movie as Ofelia comes to care for Mercedes like a mother.<br/><br/>Captain Vidal is anything but sane. Filled with overbearing lunacy, he is on a mission to weed out guerrillas that are hiding the surrounding mountains. The Captain is absorbed on this war path as Carmen is put on extreme bed rest after a bleeding incident. With the Carmen and the baby's health threatened, Ofelia is pretty much left to herself. She develops a relationship with a faun that tells her she may be Princess Moanna, but needs to prove it by completing three tasks before the full moon.<br/><br/>While Ofelia is working towards completing the accepted tasks, she encounters situations where she has to make a choice to listen to what she has been told to do, or do what she feels she should do. At the same time, Mercedes and the doctor (Alex Angulo) taking care of Carmen secretly care for the hiding rebels in the mountains. While this is going on, Captain Vidal brings wrath to those he encounters allowing for spectators to be appalled and frightened by him.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is a magical movie of sorts, filled with fantasy and creatures. The surreal quality of the movie is brought to life through the use of computer generated imagery, animatronics, and costume. The lighting quality is dark, which give the film an air of fear and caution. The effects of the movie are like a realistic Tim Burton film.<br/><br/>The unsure world that Ofelia is introduced to almost mirrors the unsure world that the Captain lives in. Ofelia chooses to believe in something different than what she knows and accept the assignment of completing three tasks. Sometimes she chooses the expected path and sometimes she does not.<br/><br/>The Captain chooses to be in the line of work he is in and react to situations without regard for human life or dignity. By continuing to choose the path of hurting others and holding himself higher than those around, the Captain is delivered to his final destination.<br/><br/>Making decisions based on moral conviction will lead down a path. One must chose which path they REALLY want to choose."

Where I was right that thats what it was i was dead wrong that it wouldn't help me learn. I was lucky enough to understand what was going on with my vast knowlage of the Spanish language so I didn't NEED to watch it with the subtitles, if you do however don't worry the subtitles were created by the writer and director himself, Guillemro del Toro if this name sounds familiar thats because he made a more American film Hell Boy. Pans Labrinth had a lot of the same effects that hell boy had. The area that this most shows is in the character ""Pale Man"" it looks a lot like the fish man in hellboy.

","I'll be honest, I didn't get half of what I thought I might me walking into. This is a film that had rather had me in it's grasp ever since I was 10 years old. But having finally watched it... I'm disappointed. <br/><br/>What did I expect? A cleverly devised, well presented storyline unfolding within a labyrinth. What did I get? A film more focussed on the war aspect than the fantasy, with some unimaginative characters, a story that doesn't deliver and the most generic plot I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The labyrinth, while very cool, only takes up 1/6th or less of the movie. Most of it is set in a WWII Spain setting, with a huge lack of fantasy elements. Captain Vidal was truly brilliant, but, just like in The Godfather, his extreme concentration of shocking moments means you get used to the way he acts; and it all eventually just becomes a kind of 'let's get this torture scene over with' approach for the viewer.<br/><br/>Ofelia is, in a lot of ways, rather boring as a character. She seems to be a quite generic 12 year old girl with all the same personality traits that come with one. Her actions sometimes seem to completely contradict how she acts at other points in the movie, most notably during the pale man scene, at which point the things she does are just to drive the story forward in a plain way. <br/><br/>The scene with the frog is boring, uninventive, quite frankly disgusting and doesn't fit in with the dark tone of the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The story is atrocious; the only good bit about it is the way the ending plays out, which is sort of clever; but if you are good at picking apart stories, you might still find it is nearly as generic as the rest of the plot. So why is the plot so bad? Well, if you've ever come across the plot of 3 tasks, fail one, character storms out, gives main character a second chance then everyone lives happily ever after; that's literally the entire plot summarised. <br/><br/>This film is not half of what I hoped for and doesn't deserve the rating it has."

As she struggles to complete the task demanded, she finds out that her step-father is a corrupt leader of the Spanish army during a civil war in Mexico. Pan's Labyrinth definitely shows two sides of imagination: scary and fun because Ofelia's challenges are extremely horrifying in an entertaining way. <br/><br/>Trailers of the film may give you the initial idea that the it is intended for a audiences of all ages, surprisingly, the film is rated R. The film is not found suitable for children because the film is entirely in Spanish and contains subtitles throughout the entire movie that must be followed in order to understand the storyline of the movie. Younger children who are not fluent in Spanish will tend to lose interest in a short period of time, being that audience of young ages will get fed up having to reading subtitles throughout an entire movie. Along with that, there are some very graphic scenes in the movie, for example: Ofelia's step-father bashes in a trespasser's face in with a gun and shot the other in the face before even giving them the chance to prove their innocence. Horrifying creatures that can only be imagined with the help of our deepest darkest fears are shown throughout the movie well. <br/><br/>Ofelia faces many challenges throughout the movie one of them is the typical childhood problem of adults not believing her. Ofelia tries to tell her mother and Mercedes, who is a butler to her family. When she tries to tell them what she is seeing, she is told to stop reading books because it is filling her head with nonsense and such creatures do not exist. As the story goes on, antagonists are introduced, such as The Pale Man and the giant toad. Both antagonist are symbols for something much larger than what they are. For example, Ofelia is told to destroy the giant toad that lives in the roots of the tree. It is explained that the giant toad is blocking the trees roots which causes the tree not to bloom. The giant toad is symbol for her mother's pregnancy complications, whom is unable to give birth to her younger brother just as the tree is not able to bloom because the toad is blocking the roots. Unfortunately, midway through the movie, Ofelia loses her mother while giving birth to her younger brother. <br/><br/>A majority of Toro's film are of the same genre; they contain an insane amount of imagination along with a great fictional story line. A great example would be The Book of Life, which is one of his first animated films, a story of a prince and a great bull fighter who share the same childhood crush and compete to win her love. Guillermo's films are known for creativity, for example, he has directed Hellboy, Pacific Rim, The Hobbit and Blade. Pan's Labyrinth is different from his other work because usually his work is usually filled with action at the climax, this particular film was very calm for the most part. This film is truly unique in comparison to all of his other films because it is something out of the ordinary and very fascinating at the same time. <br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is an extremely fascinating film because it shows how much creativity an individual can possess and shows the positive and negative sides of your imaginations with the story line and characters. The film has many ups and downs with a wide variety of emotions stirred, while teaches great lessons with the story being told within the film."

There are some incredible performances in this film especially from Sergi Lopez as Captain Vidal and as central character Ofelia, newcomer Ivana Baquero delivered a performance that looked like that of somebody involved in the business for years!

It was a fantastic movie; great plot, great actors, and great direction. That said, I simply cannot give it a perfect 10-star rating just because there were so many scenes that were way too sadistic and gory! This is definitely not a movie you want to show to your kid (it's R-rated just for the violence), and you might consider not watching it yourself if you're a faint-hearted person. The sensitive parts aren't just simple fighting or whatever's shown in the average movie. They're pure savagery! I mean, I guess it'll be fine if you're watching the movie on DVD, but if you don't have the option of skipping or fast-forwarding I really recommend you check the Violence & Gore section of the Parent's Guide before you watch it.<br/><br/>The thing about the violent scenes in this movie is that they aren't just implied, they're actually shown to you directly, with all they're ruthlessness and cruelty.

","Like any great myth, Pan's Labyrinth encrypts its messages through displays of magic. The result of the intricate interplay that we witness on screen is a fairy tale for adults that is violent, sometimes shocking, yet utterly engrossing.<br/><br/>It's 1944 and Spain's Civil War has left the country ravaged and battling pockets of rebels. Posted to regain order in one such enclave, tyrannous Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez) travels to a remote home in North Spain with his pregnant wife and 12-year-old step- daughter, Ofelia (Ivana Baquero). Besotted with ancient tales, Ofelia disconnects from the violence around her by wandering into a derelict labyrinth to encounter creatures that once existed only in her fertile fantasies. Here she meets the garrulous faun who informs her she's the princess of a subterranean kingdom, and in characteristic fairy-tale fashion, she's given three tasks to perform before the full moon. And thus begins del Toro's unnerving fairy tale that blends fantasy and gloomy drama into one of the most magical films to come along in years.<br/><br/>It's a heartbreaking tale of cruelty and hopelessness, softened only by the wondrous fantasy of Ofelia's imaginary world. A bold juxtaposition of real and unreal worlds is at the heart of Guillermo del Toro's visually inventive fantasy. Del Toro presents both the narrative strands as equally real, equally plausible. There's no attempt to rationalize Ofelia's parallel universe by suggesting it's a dream or a fantasy. In fact the two sides of the film come together to constitute an allegory about the soul and the national identity of Spain in an almost surreal fashion. Ivana Baquero is in brilliant form manifesting a child's fears and uncertainties through little more than widened eyes and shortened breath. Through sheer force of personality, Sergi López turns Captain Vidal into a convincing yet allegorical metaphor for chauvinistic masculinity and in the end, offers an incomparably sinister character.<br/><br/>Guillermo Del Toro gives us a film which is both searing and haunting as it takes us from the bleak to the sublime. It imagines both the beauty and horror inherent to escapism and, while weaving an intricate tale, vividly draws a world more enticing but no more monstrous than our own. The spell it casts lingers long after the final reel!"

Every few minutes a huge plot twist occurs, and you change your mind on a character you thought you figured out already.

"aquastorm7-365-843541","10","2","5","8 May 2012"," Beautiful blend between two engrossing genres.
","First i would like to state that while this movie is incredibly violent and definitely deserving of its R rating, i believe that it was all necessary to make the movie what it is today, a masterpiece. If the violence wasn't present, the effect would be the same. You wouldn't understand the desperate attempts made by Ofelia to flee from a time and place that was uncaring and extremely volatile. When The Captain smashed the face in of a rebel, it not only showed the cruelty in an actual event, it proved the need for the event to occur. It made the viewer realize how out of place Ofelia really was. She belonged in a land of fairy tail in a time of peace. Now comes in to play the faun, my real and total reason for writing this review. I read a review for this movie stating that this movie was misleading in its title ""Pan's Labyrinth"" because the movie had absolutely nothing to do with Peter Pan. If someone is to know the true origin of stories and legends, which do not be mistaken, this movie is most definitely linked with that of legends, one must go back to one of the earliest records of stories/legends we have. Ancient Greece. Now, Atryeu_II, pay attention(for those who do not know his/her post, look a few pages back, he gave this movie a terrible review). In ancient Greece, they were a polytheistic society, which means they believed in multiple gods/goddesses. One of set gods was Pan. Pan was the god of nature and took the direct form of a faun. THIS is where the title PAN'S Labyrinth originated from. One of the main characters in the movie, which some have said is creepy is the connection to the title, which is connected to the ancient Greek faun god Pan. The faun in this move, while he is creepy, i believe is the best way to connect the fairy society that Ofelia wants to return to and the world that she actively lives in, a violent society. The tasks that he has Ofelia complete I also find slightly horrifying, but makes sense when you look at the movie as a whole. The movie can be defined as having a cruel, violent undertone. It is literally the best representation of a dark fairy tail. I would suggest this movie to anyone I know, but you have to have a certain taste in movies to truly appreciate the genius that is Pan's Labyrinth."
"Desertman84","10","2","5","7 March 2012"," Alice in Wonderland For Grown-ups
","Pan's Labyrinth is a Mexican Spanish-language dark-fantasy film,written and directed by Mexican film-maker Guillermo del Toro. It was produced and distributed by the Mexican film company Esperanto Films. <br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth takes place in Spain in May–June 1944, five years after the Spanish Civil War, during the early Francoist period. The narrative of the film interweaves this real world with a fantasy world centered around an overgrown abandoned labyrinth and a mysterious faun creature, with which the main character, Ofelia, interacts. Ofelia's stepfather, the Falangist Captain Vidal, hunts the Spanish Maquis who fight against the Fascist reign in the region, while Ofelia's pregnant mother grows increasingly ill. Ofelia meets several strange and magical creatures who become central to her story, leading her through the trials of the old labyrinth garden. <br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth suggests that fairy-tale violence helps the vulnerable process and overcome real-life conflicts and that real-life violence permanently smashes the soul and the heart.This magical film from Guillermo del Toro manages that intellectual high-mindedness, even as it resonates on a primal, mythic level.It is Alice in Wonderland for grown- ups, with the horrors of both reality and fantasy blended together into an extraordinary, spellbinding fable. Told through the eyes of a little girl whose imaginary world is inhabited by nightmarish creatures,it also is a visually imaginative and allegorical take on the fears she faced in Spain during World War II."

","Five years have passed since the end of the Spanish civil war, but the biggest European conflict to date, the second World War, is still running strong. A fairy tale loving, innocent girl, Ophelia, and her pregnant mother move into a military base in the middle of a savage and unforgiving guerrilla warfare ridden countryside of Spain. The land has its stories of lore and mystique, which Ophelia ends up finding as an escape from the grim reality which is her life, and which end up being the defining point of her whole life. Her future lies beyond three tasks given to her by creatures never seen by anyone else alive.<br/><br/>This film was one of the most touching and beautiful things I have ever seen. The direction, editing, and - most of all - acting was beyond words. I am a complete stranger to Spanish cinema, but whatever it may be, this is very probably considered a masterpiece there too.<br/><br/>The film itself is a dark fantasy film set in the middle of the biggest war in recorded history. The mud, blood, fear and primal human actions are presented to the viewer in a way that really makes one immerse into the story and its setting. But it also succeeds in being a story based in a war zone without being an actual war film.<br/><br/>Ivana Baquero as Ophelia does, right next to Natalie Portman in Leon, the most convincing and emotional child actor role I have ever witnessed in any film. She is a beautiful and charismatic actor who alone makes this film more than worth watching. Sergi López is very convincing and scary in the role of the ruthless captain Vidal, and every other actor seem to work around those two mentioned characters like they were born to do it.<br/><br/>The cinematography and editing have nothing to do with the modern, ""fashionable"" gimmicks so many films cling to nowadays. Most of the cuts are subtle and graceful, and take advantage of the surrounding set. One of the few reasons I will not give this film a 10/10 rating is the poor portrayal of firearm usage. But even that does not bother me that much with this film, which i can honestly call a masterpiece.<br/><br/>All in all, I recommend this film to everyone. If you like fantasy, watch this. If you like war films, watch this. If you like films in general, watch this. And, most of all, if you have never watched a film before, watch this as your first one. Your two hours will not be spent for nothing."

","There is nothing that can be said about this film that is negative; the direction from Guillermo Del Toro is flawless, obviously he has show us his talent in other films, but in this he expresses his full range and brilliance. The effects and make-up are wonderful, showing that not all movies need high tech special effects to achieve the beauty of what a film maker is aiming for. The acting and characterisation are exceptional; every character is fully developed and expresses what the character is like, without going over board on their personality traits. Overall the story is beautiful, expressing wonder and innocence, amid the setting of fascism and war. What I really love about this film, is the fact that it allows you to think for yourself; you are lead to believe that what is happening is real, that is until the Captain catches Ofelia, while she is talking to the Fauno and yet he does not seem to notice it's presence, making you wonder, is the Fauno actually there, or is it all her imagination? I know what I think, but it's up to you to come up with your own conclusion. If you have seen this film advertised, but decided not to view it, put those assumption aside and watch it, as it is a highly worth watching film and those of you who do not come away loving it (though why you wouldn't is beyond me) you will definitely admire it and agree that it was worth watching. There is no other film quite like it and it will forever be my favourite."
"mia-manns","10","2","5","22 March 2011"," Captain Vidal in Pan's Labyrinth
","Pan's Labyrinth is an incredibly brutal film that will make you feel the harshness of the world, particularly because of the contrast with a beautiful fantasy. There is a realist story intertwined with a fantastic one, where the world of the adults is dark, cruel and without any justice, and Ofelia, as a child, is able to access a just and beautiful world if she overcomes dangerous obstacles. Her part of the story is the Fairy Tale. Captain Vidal is the bad guy for both the realist of the Spanish Civil War and the fairy tale of Ofelia's quest. His character really gets the idea across that there is no cosmic justice. Vidal represents the cold, irrational brutality of the world.<br/><br/>He is overly villainous, creating an aspect of the realist story that is bordering on the fantastic. Del Torro gives us a bleak, hopeless movie that will leave you feeling dark. In the realist portion of the story, Vidal is one-dimensionally evil with explicitly sinister motives – he's a symbol for cruelty and lack of mercy in the world. One of the most memorable and gory scenes in the movie is when Vidal unjustly kills a man, and only afterwards checks the validity of the man's story. His reaction upon finding out that it was true? He reprimands his soldiers: ""Maybe you'll learn to search these ---holes properly before you come bothering me."" He shows no remorse. He's unrealistically evil because he is an embodiment of injustice. Vidal's unrealistic cruelty and malevolence is more fitting to Ofelia's fairy-tale.<br/><br/>The fairy-tale archetype that Vidal exemplifies can exert irrational cruelty in a fantasy story – wicked witches poison princesses and that's just how it is. Just like the wicked witch, he has no hesitation or remorse for taking the life of Ofelia, just as cruel ""fate"" can senselessly take the life of a child. There is no meaning for the loss of an innocent.<br/><br/>Vidal commits acts of senseless, irrational and merciless violence. His character in both the realist story and the fairy tale embodies the idea of cosmic injustice. Tragedies occur without reason or meaning."

","I read several reviews on Pan's Labyrinth, most of them very enthusiastic but warning about the violence and brutality. Now, I usually hate bloody and gory films, but I heard that this was a different kind of movie and I decided to watch it. I'm very impressed! Guillermo Del Toro really created a masterpiece with this movie about the innocence of a young child, who is thrown in the brutality of war, and even though I'm German, I think this should have won the Foreign Picture Oscar instead of The Lives of Others. The plot brilliantly weaves two stories together in one, obscuring reality and imagination until we forget which one is which. The young girl Ofelia and her pregnant mother arrive at the small military base of her stepfather Captain Vidal who is in charge of killing the rebells in the mountains of Spain during the Spanish Civil War. Vidal is a sadistic and dominant soldier, who is extremely strict with everyone and uses extreme brutality to get things done. Ofelia explores the surrounding area and discovers a labyrinth nearby, where she meets a faun, who tells her that she really is the daughter of a king, who can only return to her kingdom if she performs 3 dangerous tasks.<br/><br/>It is true that there is very strong violence in this movie, but it is essential in this movie, because it shows that sad and horrible reality surrounding Ofelia and why she tries to escape it. The great and beautiful music, especially the theme, will give you goosebumps from time to time and as sad as the movie is, the message is that there are always wonderful things out there in the world, no matter how bad things may seem.<br/><br/>Sergi Lopez does an excellent job as Captain Vidal. He perfectly shows his sadistic and frightening nature and even his eyes will send shivers down your back. Ivana Baquero as Ofelia also deserves high praise, because she manages to play the torn character of the young girl with such an emotion, that you will sometimes forget she's just acting. Same with Lopez by the way.<br/><br/>All in all, you must have seen this movie which has won 3 Oscar, Best Art Direction, Cinematography and Make Up, and was the deserving winner of the Best Foreign Language Movie that year. But even though it can be described as a Fairy Tale, don't show it to your kids! It's really brutal and frightening at some points."

"fearfulofspiders","10","2","5","30 August 2008"," One of the Best Fantasy Films Ever...
","Pan's Labyrinth is one of the best fantasy films ever because if its harsh reality of war and its realistic use of fantasy. Guillermo del Toro's style is so riveting and unique, it would make the audience want more. Just to note, this is not a film for children, in fact, this isn't for anyone under 15 because of the depth del Toro has used here. There is no sex or nudity, only some vividly disturbing images and violence.<br/><br/>First off, the acting is superb. From Sergi Lopez to Doug Jones in makeup, this film is grade-A in performances. Lopez's portrayal as the dark and evil captain is so good, you fear him whenever he is present on screen. Ivana Baquero is great as Ofelia, as well as Maribel Verdu.<br/><br/>The writing and directing is just as amazing. Guillermo del Toro shows that even a fantasy world is no escape from the harsh reality that is life itself. From the Pale Man (a beast that devours children) to Pan himself, this film has great aesthetics. There's blood in this film as mentioned earlier. The Pale Man rips a small fairy in half with his deformed mouth, and a farmer is beaten to death with a bottle of liquor by the infamous captain (bashing it on the old man's face multiple times).<br/><br/>The music is beautiful and haunting. The central theme developed by Javier Navarrete is so chilling, it's just gorgeous to hear, especially as it evolves throughout the film. It is also a score that does not distract from the scenes they are incorporated in, which makes it well worth a buy should one like it enough.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a dark fantasy motion picture. The end is tragic in a sense, though not really considering Ofelia's fate. The imagery is astounding, never seeming to lose grasp on atmosphere or tone. The violence is graphic, and the captain makes for an underrated villain. I'm a fan of fantasy, and if one is not into this specific genre (one akin to The Lord of the Rings or The Wizard of Oz) then that individual will not see the masterpiece that is Pan's Labyrinth in the same light as others. Definitely see this film.<br/><br/>** While not similar in style, this film is a great hint as to what one can expect from Guillermo del Toro has he helms the next Tolkien films."
"ackstasis","9","2","5","29 February 2008"," ""My mother told me to be wary of Fauns.""
","The success of Peter Jackson's 'The Lord of the Rings (2001-2003)' and Tim Burton's 'Big Fish (2003)' demonstrated that adult audiences still enjoy stepping into the magical and wonderful worlds that captivated them throughout their childhoods. Mexican director Guillermo del Toro has made fantasy his speciality, having achieved critical success in the past with such films as 'The Devil's Backbone (2001)' and mainstream comic-book adaptation 'Hellboy (2004).' Though I had previously never seen any of his films, I now consider del Toro to be a director-to-watch, since his most recent release, 'El Laberinto del fauno / Pan's Labyrinth' is one of the favourite films of 2006, second only to fellow Mexican director Alfonso Cuarón's dystopic futuristic sci-fi, 'Children of Men (2006).' An ""adult fantasy"" in every sense of the word, 'Pan's Labyrinth' unfurls a marvellous fantasy fairytale amid the bloody backdrop of the aftermath of Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). A young girl learns to endure the violence and devastation of warfare by retreating into a world of fantasy, occupied by fairies, fauns and other similarly-wondrous and terrifying creatures.<br/><br/>Young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is an intelligent and imaginative girl with a fondness for fairy tales. After the death of her father, a simple tailor, Ofelia's mother, Carmen (Ariadna Gil), marries an ambitious and sadistic Falange commander, Captain Vidal (Sergi López), who has been assigned to an old homestead from which to root out the remaining Marxist guerrillas. Vidal is ruthless in his attempts to exterminate the sympathetic rebels, often employing torture and intense violence to achieve his objectives. His primary ambition in life is to be remembered as a brave soldier, and, like his father, he wishes to die in battle so that his own son {currently developing in the womb of Ofelia's heavily-pregnant mother} will know the exact moment of his death and will be proud of him. With her mother seriously ill in bed, Ofelia is generally neglected by the household, with the exception of a kind-hearted servant (Maribel Verdú) whose sympathies lie with the rebels. In order to escape the horrors of the ongoing conflict, Ofelia devises an elaborate fantasy-world in which she is the returned spirit of Princess Moanna, destined to return to her glorious underground kingdom.<br/><br/>Whether Ofelia's fantasies are, indeed, authentic or not {I tend to believe that the creatures are figments of her imagination, stemming from a subconscious desire to escape the violence of the real world}, there's no doubting the magnificence of del Toro's creations. Intricate make-up, puppetry and computer-generated imagery combine to create an assortment of the most mesmerising fantasy creatures I've ever seen: Doug Jones' Faun {named as the Greek god Pan in the English-translated title, though del Toro has denounced this due to the possible sexual connotations} is absolutely spellbinding in his every single word and movement, and one need only compare him to the rather ordinary faun in Adam Adamson's 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005)' to confirm the superiority of del Toro's artistic vision. 'Pan's Labyrinth' brilliantly blurs the borders of the story's real and fantasy worlds, and young Ivana Baquera delivers an assured and mature performance in the leading role, lending credibility to her character's interactions with each fantastic creature. Guillermo del Toro's picture proved successful at the 2007 Oscars, winning awards for Art Direction, Cinematography and Make-up from six nominations."

The imagery is nothing short of breathtaking, and he has made a major discovery with the young actress, Ivana Baquero, who commands the screen for a majority of the two hour running time. It is 1944, in Franco's Spain, during the time of civil unrest. A combination of history and fantasy, blended so seamlessly that I was completely lost in Ofelia's adolescent world of woe. We meet her on the road, traveling with her mother, Carmen(Ariadna Gil), where they stop for a moment, and Ofelia spots a strange, winged insect which she follows to a hole in a tree. It trails the car to a compound where she meets her new stepfather, Vidal(Sergi Lopez), a Captain in the fascist army, fighting guerrillas hiding in the nearby mountains. Carmen is pregnant and a widow who has chosen a loveless marriage to an evil man in order to provide for her children. The insect leads Ofelia to a tree with a labyrinth inside and she is introduced to a faun(a tall et like creature, played by Doug Jones, the one American in the cast who was taught Spanish line by line). He is her teacher and guide to the underworld. He gives her three tasks to perform before the full moon; the first task is removing a key from a giant toad; the second being the retrieval of a knife from a lair, and the third, a daunting task with her new baby brother. She must complete the three missions in order to become Princess Moanna, the queen of the underworld. The story is compelling and the acting tremendous, from Baquero to Sergi Lopez's scowling villain, Captain Vidal, there is nothing to criticize in Pan's Labyrinth and I give it a 10/10."
"slinkov","10","2","5","27 January 2008"," Beautiful, surreal, chilling masterpiece
","This film is definitely one of the best I have seen in 2007, if not in my life. <br/><br/>Its dark, dreamy and surreal fantasy elements (Faun, child-eating Pale Man, giant toad, etc.) offer a stark contrast against the horror and macabre realism of the portrayal of Civil war Spain. However, the two elements are so professionally intertwined that they could not have made half as good a film had they existed separately. <br/><br/>I will not go too much into the story, because I want to promote the viewing of this amazing film, but I will say this: The heroine is a young, imaginative girl, Ofelia, who dwells in fairy tales. All around her is the reality of war, her mother's difficult pregnancy and her fascist stepfather's brutality. It is impossible to know whether the fantasy is her imagination, or whether it is taking place for real. Yet the message is clear: Ofelia's innocence-driven courage triumphs in its own, if small and not universally significant, way. <br/><br/>This film is definitely not for children. Its fantasy is mature and frightening (and there is not *too* much of it), not the sugar-coated Disney kind. The director is not afraid to portray war in all its pain and terror, and makes us sick to the stomach with the bloody slaughter and torture scenes. None of the violence is gratuitous and pointless though, and it all serves a purpose. The film's central plot stays remarkably human all the way through, sneaking in some beautifully moving scenes of true love, mercy and devotion amongst the destruction. And the sad and moving ending is not Hollywood style. It is fascinating listening to the Spanish language, and the dialogue is so natural and artistic (as is the whole film), I actually enjoyed reading the subtitles! <br/><br/>Do yourself a favor - watch this amazing film!"

","I don't get it. I mean I understand the movie as it plays out before me, I know who everyone is and what they're doing and why, but what I don't get is the huge critical response to this movie. Some people really thought this was the best movie of last year? It's a fine movie, with great amounts of imagination and perfectly acceptable production values. It is not a bad movie by any stretch, but it is not perfect.<br/><br/>I've liked most of the Guillermo Del Toro movies I've seen, but they may be because most I've seen were action/adventure extravaganzas (Blade 2, Hellboy, even Mimic). The Devil's Backbone, which I didn't like much, is not and neither is Pan's Labyrinth. (A bad title since the faun's name who inhabits the labyrinth is not the Greek god Pan.) The story takes place in fascist Spain and concerns a little girl named Ofelia. Her single, pregnant mother has started a relationship with a sadistic military captain and the movie starts with mother and daughter headed towards a secluded base in the woods. Her natural curiosity leads her to find a huge stone labyrinth near the base one day and she quickly finds herself living inside a fairy tale. This one ain't of the Disney variety though The Faun inside the labyrinth claims she is in fact the princess of an underground kingdom, but to regain her crown she needs to complete a series of tasks. Pretty standard storybook setup. But these tasks she is charged with begin to reflect the real world she is otherwise surrounded with - a world of soldiers, freedom fighters, life, and death. Some of the overlaps are intriguing, like the importance of a key in both stories, but a lot of it seems quite arbitrary. There are themes of acceptance and resistance throughout. The captain, for instance, follows orders blindly, not hesitating to brutally kill someone if they're in a place they aren't supposed to be. Ofelia, on the other hand, prefers to ignore directions given to her. Sometimes it serves her well, sometimes not, as when she dares to eat some grapes off the Pale Man's table.<br/><br/>The design of the creatures Ofelia meets (all done by Del Toro himself) are astonishing all by themselves. You could bury yourself in the details of those creations as well as in all the great set design. The Pale Man scene is notable for truly feeling like a nightmare. The spindly, almost sightless monster is one of the most terrifying things in a movie since John Carpenter's The Thing.<br/><br/>The fantasy and reality portions, while sharing some themes, never quite mesh together well. I think they would have each made fascinating movies on their own - sharing screen time detracts from both. Perhaps the fault lies within me regarding this movie. From all the talk, I was expecting nothing less than brilliance. But I can get by with simple goodness.<br/><br/>http://www.movieswithmark.com"

I have never seen such a truly profound film in my life. It's not about a Faun, a girl, or an end of childhood. It's really about strength, courage, innocence and a will to do what is right above all else, no matter what the cost to one's self. This is a true masterpiece of film-making, from the gorgeously lush countryside to the dingy interiors. I will say this, as much as I truly enjoy this movie: I will never forgive Guillermo for making me cry so hard I almost heaved. No one else has ever hurt me that badly, and done it so beautifully.

","Of course, Pans Labyrinth is quite brutal, but I think it is the amazing thing which makes it so good. The violence of everyday life which surprises us again and again.Of course, it is not the film for sensitive people who close eyes to do not see the true, cruel world and prefer the world of lies where everybody smiles, says only nice words and does only nice things. But for the others it is absolutely great! Throughout the film you only sit in horror and tremble because of disgust and surprising cruelty of people. This is the film which you will know for a long time. But it is not film for children, not only because of cruelty but also because of the plot which is really complicated, full of metaphors which a child do not understand. Of course, there are some clever children who can understand it so I think we should let them to see this film if they feel they are prepared for it :-)."

"kenvandenbussche-2","8","2","5","22 October 2007"," One of the greatest European fantasy films ever made!
","For a long time, I thought that this film was based onto a book by Stephen King. It had the same peculiar atmosphere where fantasy and reality comes together. However: this Spanish movie has nothing to do with the famous American horror author.<br/><br/>""El laberinto del fauno"" tells the story of a little girl named Ofelia captured in a harsh reality of the post-civil war in Spain and how she dreams up a sinister yet captivating fantasy world in order to escape the cold reality. Neither her pregnant and sick mother nor her stepfather who's a sadistic army officer will tolerate this kind of behaviour and they both feel the little girl has grown too old for reading children's books and believing in magic.<br/><br/>The big question is of course: is this dream world of hers real or not? Some things suggest that it's definitely real whilst other moments confirm that it most certainly is not. The beauty is that the answer to this question is never given and as such: anyone watching this Spanish movie gets the unusual freedom to decide themselves whether or not the little girl's fantasy is true. It's a rare thing in movie business and also a lot of fun trying to figure out the truth yourself.<br/><br/>I loved both worlds and their mutual diversity and that's why I firmly believe this fantasy world to be just as much a reality. There are some things that the little girl couldn't possibly have known herself. For example: at a given moment, the pale-looking and very sick mother is suddenly recovering and nobody - not even the local doctor - could come up with a plausible explanation for this miracle. Truth of the matter is that this mysterious healing is caused by a simple root of a specific tree in the forest that one of the fantasy creatures gave to the little girl. This part unmistakably proves that there is another world out there. Besides: the film would be no where near as interesting if the fantasy world of hers would turn out to be a fake one.<br/><br/>The only flaw in this movie that I can think of, is the lack of tension. There wasn't a single terrifying moment to be found in this soft fantasy-thriller. The closest we ever came to being scared was the introduction of the sickly and skinny humanoid alien. This creature was amazingly original and very cool. It had a face with no eyes. Instead, it had eye sockets in its hands in which it had to place its eyes in order to be able to see. But even so: it wasn't very scary and this movie could've easily used a couple of horrific scenes. The beating of an innocent young man by Captain Vidal, a brutal and unforgiving idealist, actually provides the biggest shock of all! The only other strange creature is the Faun. Even though this one looks pretty gloomy as well, it is in fact a warm-hearted companion who only wants the best for Ofelia. It somehow kept me reminding of the man-made plague Randall Flagg in Stephen Kings classic tale ""The stand"". Both creatures do look alike more or less. There are also a few elves in this story and a disgusting toad which the little girl will encounter during her trial for proving that she is in fact a genuine princess. These are but a few of the wonderful special effects that are being used.<br/><br/>Since this is a Spanish film, I honest-to-God don't know too many of its actors. But all of the acting is quite good. Especially Sergi López as the ruthless Captain and Ivana Baquero as the little girl Ofelia really shine in their performances. Director Guillermo del Toro is the most famous of all involved. He isn't a stranger in making movies about weird and wonderful creatures. Both ""Blade II"" and ""Hellboy"" were directed by him.<br/><br/>In short: This is certainly one of the very best Spanish films I have ever seen! The reality of war in this movie is cold and brutal and its opposing fantasy world is warm yet mysteriously menacing. Too bad this film feels like a children's movie from time to time when they could've created a full-blown dark thriller."

This continues to be my favorite film, just because it really WAS the only film that blew me away. Exhilarating.

"arabesuku","9","2","5","24 September 2007"," Stunning, poetic, brutal - ELdF packs a hell of a punch.
","El Laberinto del Fauno is a faerie-tale in a terrible world. Set in post-Civil War Spain, bookworm Ofelia is living in a tragedy with her increasingly ill and pregnant mother and her stepfather, the cruel and sadistic Captain Vidal. The family is moved to a mill (where Vidal is stationed) and it is there that Ofelia meets her destiny, and the opportunity for something better. She is drawn to a labyrinth near the mill by a 'faerie', and it is there she is introduced to the Faun (also known as 'Pan' in the English adaption, but the faun introduces himself as 'Faun'. 'Pan' comes from the mischievous faun god in Greek mythology). The Faun tells her that her true identity is Princess Moanna, born of the moon, and she must complete three tasks to prove her royalty.<br/><br/>What I particularly loved about the princess concept is that it can either be interpreted as reality or escapism (fantastising about something better whilst being forced to live around death and pain). I think a lot of us (the less cynical) like to think that it is real, especially at the end.<br/><br/>The juxtaposition of the brutality of Vidal and the war in general with the beautiful, surreal faerie-tale of Ofelia is a very intriguing contrast. Some of the scenes with Vidal I had to look away, some of it was too cruel and gory to watch. It's very cleverly done, especially as Vidal is drawn into the labyrinth with Ofelia at the end and sees her talking to no-one - is this because it doesn't exist (it's in her mind) or he is an adult/doesn't believe? Del Toro leaves this to our imaginations and forces us as an audience to come to a decision.<br/><br/>Stunning visuals and effects, creative storyline and fantastic conclusion. El Laberinto Del Fauno is not something you want to miss."
"johnnyboyz","8","2","5","23 September 2007"," If you're going to see a high budget foreign language film, see this.
","The reason Pan's Labyrinth works is because it's a clever film that tackles numerous different subjects on various different levels giving the viewer lots to focus on and get involved with. The film studies good and evil, loneliness, love or lack of love towards human beings as well as made-up creatures such as fairies. It's also able to draw the viewer into its world of intrigue and fantasy; tempting us and forcing us to think for ourselves whether or not what's happening is real as although this is a realist film, there is enough material to suggest otherwise.<br/><br/>Setting is so important in the film, so much so as the film begins in a car en-route; there is no such time for introductions and pleasantries. The majority of the film is set at an army base in the Spanish woodland but locations within locations are so much more important: the barn, the woodshed, the bedroom and the woods themselves all serve as dangerous and bleak locations  this twinned with excellent cinematography gives off a sort of 'trapped' feeling that anywhere you go, you're in trouble. Of course, Ofelia's (Baquero) visions or dreams or whatever you want to call them up until the closing fifteen minutes act as an escape from these bleak surroundings but what an escape. In order to get away from her living, Ofelia must put herself in situations and places that are far more dangerous than the camp, she must face foes that are far more dangerous than an uncaring father in law or Spanish soldiers in the hills who are outgunned anyway and each sequence makes for fascinating viewing.<br/><br/>There is enough talk and build up through dialogue early on to suggest all is not right in the house at the camp. Very early on in the film, it is slightly impossible to say whether or not Ofelia is dreaming or really is living out a fantasy: a flying bug, wind whistling through the house 'talking' to the occupants and the faces on inanimate objects (even the fireplace) create an eerie build up to what awaits but all these things are possible in the real world: wind through houses making them 'creak', flying bugs and the patterns that make up faces around the place  can you honestly say you've never looked at a pansy flower and thought it might be smiling back at you? However, Pan's Labyrinth is such a clever film that it turns us around not instantly but slowly. It smells our interest and curiosity and toys with it like it's a waft of a freshly cooked pie resting on a window ledge. Ofelia is given a book that will 'show her' things but it's completely blank until it wants to work; the bug turns into a fairy but Ofelia's been reading books about fairies just before bed and the old faun may be an impossible thing to encounter in the real world but is it just a delusion of an animal she saw or is it her imagination mixed with the new, country air she can smell and has never smelt before? After all, she did say it smelt of 'earth'  maybe as an urban child, she has never really smelt 'earth' before and created an image of what 'earth' might look.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is not just a film about a confused girl but also a double act of brilliant storytelling when thinking of the soldiers stories. The two sides are at loggerheads throughout, leading to bloody and compelling shootouts throughout; there is even space for betrayal and forbidden love between sides, something that is woven in superbly. I watched as the Fascist soldiers set themselves tasks; small tasks and objectives to defeat the enemy or secure their own safety. Maybe Ofelia is watching and setting her self these tasks  since her father in law is in control, maybe she's copying him and trying to win her own war that she has created in her mind; either way, the way both sides of the film are sewed together is just a joy to watch.<br/><br/>I am yet to mention the emotional depth the film carries when dealing with friendships, a mother before birth, betrayal, a child just trying to help, isolation and a smashed watch as it would just spoil it. If I do have a gripe it's because I don't like it when a character blatantly does something wrong just to spurn an action scene and here, it involves some grapes but this should in no way put you off as Pan's Labyrinth is a class act in storytelling, unpredictability and cinematography; amongst so many other things."
"paulmamak","9","2","5","22 September 2007"," Outstanding! The best modern fantasy to date.
","The brilliance of this film is that it was able to shift between fantasy and reality, which is a challenging task, and del Toro nailed it. <br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is unlike any other fantasy as it was not at all light hearted, it was in fact much darker than any other fantasy films to date and emphasised the true pain and suffering that was present during the post war era. The storyline was truly moving and mesmerising and has a great climatic ending to it.<br/><br/>This film would not have been what it was if it were not for Ivana Baquero's portrayal as Ofelia. Only being twelve you were really able to relate to her character's ordeal throughout, by inflicting her emotion upon the audience. Sergi López as Captain Vidal, gave that film that extra sense of darkness in reality and acted the part to such such a believable extent. Maribel Verdú, who played Mercedes, was surprising in that she undertook an almost heroic figure and you really feel for her character in the way she has to experience being torn between the army and the guerrillas. <br/><br/>This film certainly has given more of a different opinion to del Toro as he has produced a true masterpiece."
"dbborroughs","7","2","5","16 September 2007"," Good but...disappointing
","Guillermo del Toro's fairytale for adults.<br/><br/>Yea.<br/><br/>How do I write about this film? (I think you should prepare yourselves for a ""but..."") Across the board this is a masterful motion picture. The acting, the writing, the craft are all super but I didn't completely connect with it, certainly I'm left puzzled by the ending.<br/><br/>More horrors of war story with fairytale elements added in this is the story of Ofelia, a young girl who goes with her pregnant and very sick mother to join her new step father. The stepfather is a Captain Vidal who is stationed in the Spanish country side looking for rebels.Vidal wants his wife near so that his son will be born near his father. The story follows as Ofelia ""escapes"" into the labyrinth and the fairy tale world, it also follows Vidal's attempts to ruthlessly put down the rebels. (Its probably a 75/25 split) To be honest I'm going to have to watch this again. No I don't think watching this at 4am had anything to do with my almost ambivalent disappointment with the film. Its good, it follows the classic fairytale forms but I'm not sure what del Toro was getting at. I can see why people love the film but at the same time it eluded me. (I also could see the wheels of its construction in motion). I think on some level I'm puzzled that del Toro didn't make things seem less moved by the directors hand. I will not discuss what happens simply because it would require more spoilers than are allowed by law.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong its a good movie, not a great one, though I reserve the right to change my mind on a second viewing.<br/><br/>Graphically violent (an early scene has a man's face smashed in with a bottle) this is pure undiluted Grimm Brother territory. Everything is dark and bleak. The villain of the piece, the wicked Stepfather, is one of the vilest characters to ever cross the screen. He's the sort of person who would put red hot shoes on the wicked queen in snow white and make her dance herself to death (and del Toro is the guy who'd show it.). Its not make believe violence.so be warned."

A viciously brutal, ice water-artery army captain rules with an iron fist in the Spanish Civil War as he battles forest guerillas and a camp traitor. In the alternate plot his visiting, fantasy-loving step daughter falls into a Lord of the Rings type world where a king is seeking his lost daughter. The captain's evil, cold-blooded manner, especially nasty torture scenes, and some small scale but effective civil war fights, mix nicely with a faun who guides the step child back and forth between the war zone and a fantasy realm. There is plenty of tension, and solid characters, especially Baquero as the brave and strong-willed child, and Verdu as the guerilla placed inside the captain's camp. She battles a fearful and cowardly nature and winds up strong and loyal."

The fantastical elements don't overwhelm the senses and the rest of the movie doesn't make it in any way stale. This in the most part is down to the standout performances from all of the cast (especially Captain Vidal).<br/><br/>There's not too much that i can say about this movie except to ignore the hype and ignore your preconceptions about the fantasy genre and just go out and watch and enjoy then make up your own mind because no one will make it up for you.<br/><br/>One final note though is to anyone who is a slight bit squeamish as there are some violent elements to the film put down to the civil war plot.

","'Pan's Labyrinth' uses the format and borrows characters from the fairy tales genre, but takes it into extreme allegory territory. It is set in the Spain of year 1944, a year where Spain was just starting more than three decades of fascist rule. The principal hero is an 11 years orphaned girl, who is witnessing the tragedy in her family, the tyranny of a cruel stepfather, and the political turmoil around caused by oppression crushing the last remaining fighters of the Republican army. As many fairy tales heroes of her age she searches refuge in dream and imagination. The difference is that here the alternate reality may be as complex to cope with for the young girl and reality is.<br/><br/>The whole idea of the film plays on the equilibrium and interference between the two worlds. While the fantastic world is built with the imagination of a Gothic thriller author, the real world seems to be impregnated as well with an aura of mystery despite the cruel and sordid deeds happening within. Although there is a clear delimitation between good and evil in the real world, decisions in the fantastic realm seem to be more complex, and the director refuses to make it a complete balance of reality. At the end what is different is actually the artistic treatment that the two alternate worlds receive in the movie. While the fantastic scenes are full of imagination and create a complex and interesting visual composition, the real world seems schematic and too much close to the conventional and politically engaged view of the period. This lack of balance is the one that makes so that this very interesting film does not reach in my opinion the level of a real masterpiece."

","In Fascist Spain, 1944, Ofelia and her pregnant mother travel to live with the mother's new husband, the cold and brutal Captain Vidal of the Spanish Army. As he fights the rebels, and her mother suffers, Ofelia is drawn into a fairytale world, where she is told that she is a princess and must complete tasks to return to where she rightfully belongs.<br/><br/>I can see why many love this film, and it has many positives. Technically its absolutely gorgeous - the music is haunting, and the cinematography of the 'real' world and the 'fairytale' world seamlessly compliment each other. The art direction is beautifully imaginative but never overkill. At its heart is a fantastic central performance by Ivana Baquero as Ofelia. And she's not one of these teenagers who just looks young either - she was only about 11 when they shot this. She rarely puts a foot wrong and makes you believe everything she's going through. She's the glue that holds it all together.<br/><br/>The main problem I had with this film is that it takes a while to warm up. Half way through, the film still felt like it was setting things up rather than moving forward. It felt frustrating and I was worried that this would turn out to be like writer/director Guillermo del Toro's 'Hellboy,' where I felt that not enough happened to sustain the movie. That it would be all a tease.<br/><br/>But the film gets better and simply casts a spell on you. Captain Vidal is such a violent, temperamental asshole that you can completely understand why Ofelia retreats so readily into fairy tales and the world of the Labyrinth. The more committed filmgoers will argue whether or not the fairytale world is 'real' or not, but the rest of us can be content with the knowledge that its real if the girl believes its real. Personally, I think it all was really real but I'm a bit of a sap. The ending is perfect and one of those that you can revel in.<br/><br/>This is not really for kids because of the violence and the maturity of some of the themes. But if you're an adult, don't be put off by the idea of giant toads and underground worlds. The magic in this is totally character driven and that makes it all the more special."
"tenthousandtattoos","8","2","5","29 August 2007"," Breathtaking in its beautiful simplicity
","I'll be careful about my spoilers, because I don't want to ruin this film for you. <br/><br/>That was the LAST time I listen to critics...i almost skipped this movie based on comments i read, which would have an ignorant movie goer like me believe this is a fascist, gruesome, bloody, excessively violent gore fest with only a trace of fantasy elements...that only, and I quote, ""a closet sadist"" could enjoy.<br/><br/>This is a FANTASTIC movie...in the true sense of the word. Where do I even begin trying to review it? <br/><br/>Okay, so there is a not-so-subtle message in the film to the effect: ""Fascism is BAD."" Far from being out-of-place in this day and age, I think a message like that is now as relevant in this world as it ever was. But enough about my world view.<br/><br/>Yes, the film has a body count...but the violence was pretty much what you'd expect a group of isolated, fascist pigs in uniforms with massive superiority complexes to indulge in. It's brutal.<br/><br/>And it is precisely this brutality that forces Ofelia to escape to this fantasy world of the faun, which is breathtaking in its beautiful simplicity.<br/><br/>The faun (mistakenly, I have learned now, referred to as ""Pan"" - he is not called Pan in the film, nor does he really behave like the mythological Pan), is such a wonderful character. Such a fantastic delivery of lines by Doug Jones despite the costume/suit and also despite the fact that Spanish is NOT his first language...wonderful performance. Inspired so many emotions and thoughts...when I first saw him, I was transfixed, curious, as Ofelia was, then later when he yells at her, i disliked the character for a moment, didn't trust him, was a little afraid, as was Ofelia...then ultimately I grew to trust him, believed in the magic. Just as Ofelia did. All credit to Del Toro for weaving such complexity into this characterisation, and to young Ivana Baquero for such a great performance in being able to convey all those emotions in such a seemingly effortless way.<br/><br/>While we're on performances, I have seen few villains I have DESPISED more than Vidal (Sergi Lopez). I doubt I could watch him in anything else without thinking of him in this.<br/><br/>SPOILER This film is, of course, full of imagery. It is also remarkable in the way it (gently) manipulates your emotions. For instance, when I first saw the stick insect, I was repelled, I hate creepy crawlies. Yet when we see what it truly was, my repulsion was at once replaced with curiosity and wonder. When I first saw Mercedes (Maribel Verdu) I thought nothing of her.that she was simply a sounding-board of sorts for Ofelia's story. Then I grew to love this character when I realised how very brave and honourable she was, even in the face of such barbaric evil as Vidal. END SPOILER <br/><br/>On subtitles, I must admit I prefer films in my own language because I am a reasonably lazy movie-goer. That said, I own a few subtitled films, but to be honest I just haven't seen that many that I've enjoyed enough to buy on DVD. Spanish has many words that are similar to English anyway (I'm fairly certain both languages are derived from Latin) so it was pretty easy to figure out what they were saying even when I wasn't paying attention to the subtitles. Plus, Spanish is such a beautiful language to listen to anyway, that it all just added to the film's dream-like quality for me. And reading the subtitles made me feel more like I was reading a fairy tale before bed, adding to the magic as well.<br/><br/>I think this film is hard to categorisenot that we really NEED to categorise it, but for those, like myself who were torn as to whther to watch this or not, I'd say it's closer to being like Lady in the Water than it is to say, ""Labyrinth"" (1986), in it's overall ""feel"" and of course with the additional element of fairly graphic violence. The war drama elements to the film feel more like ""Downfall"", than other more Hollywood war films like Saving Private Ryan. Depressingly cold and brutal. Devoid of theatrics.<br/><br/>While the external world is beyond her control, and is dark, depressing and savage, Ofelia's world is bright and very theatrical, but not so bright and wondrous that we lose sight of where Ofelia is, or what is going on around her. The scenes with her mother are heart-wrenching.<br/><br/>The music begins like a lullaby, a soft woman's voice hums a tune which gently segues into the orchestral score. In the film, you barely know its there until it gently tugs at your emotions.<br/><br/>The violence in this film, far from being gratuitous, is brutal and often ""efficient"" (eg executing the wounded), just as I've read wartime violence is. That's how it's presented here  matter of fact. As shocking and offensive as a cold, hard slap in the face. Yet, it is not presented in a ""voyeuristic"" way, but as if we've just witnessed something horrid, and yet can't look away.<br/><br/>SPOILER I found the ""rebel-sympathiser"" doctor character very good, I liked his humanity, and the way he stood up to Vidal, even if it did cost him his life. That would take so much courage. He should have hidden those damn vials of antibiotics!!!! END SPOILER <br/><br/>So to conclude, if you think this is your kind of movie, it probably is. Don't listen to the criticsif I had of listened to them I would have missed a truly mesmerising movie experience. This is a beautiful story, with great characters, too many stand-out scenes to name, and really is a testament to the power of imagination."

","Just a beautiful and breathtaking film. The real wonder in this is that it's so many things at once: scary and beautiful, magical and grotesque, bloody and sweet, vicious and hopeful. Everything seems to fit, there's so much going on.<br/><br/>In a time in which most movies are remakes or sequels, this movie is so original and enervating, I haven't seen anything like this in years.<br/><br/>It is a story about a bookish young girl named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and the fantasy world she creates, to survive the harsh reality of Fascist Spain of 1944.<br/><br/>This is one of those kind of movies that the line between fantasy and reality begins to blur. Is Ofelia in her own fantasy world? Or is it actually the real world? The fantastic thing about the movie is that everything is deliberately ambiguous and there are many clues that support both theories. Amazing, ending. It is a film that takes you places that other films rarely go.<br/><br/>Not many films can break your heart and blow your mind at the same time. This is one of them. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>What a performance from Sergi López who plays the sadistic Capitán Vidal. Wow. I can't say, I was surprised by what happens to him..... those foreshadowing recurrent images of him shaving with a straight razor; esp. the scene where he slashes at his own reflection.<br/><br/>One scene that really stood with me was that scene where he was egging on the young parstian.

","THIS POST CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>OK i want to start by saying that i believe the film is meant to be taking as a fairy tale and thats all there is to it. meaning that the magic and fantasy truly existed and was not simply in the little girls mind as some like to say.<br/><br/>there is proof to this throughout the whole film. the voice over at the beginning talks of her being reborn, most people i think take that literally but i think it was actually talking about her death. her mortal death. through her mortal death she was reborn as the princess of her world. hence the fauns constant references to mortality.<br/><br/>also the root was actually under the mother bed to be seen by others, and did make the mother better while it was there. then as soon as it was removed she feel ill again.<br/><br/>another strong piece of evidence proving the fantasy was real was that she escaped her lock and guarded room to retrieve her brother at the end. there's no way she could have done so unless the chalk was truly magic allowing her to draw a door.<br/><br/>plus i believe the director himself said that its real. its a fairy tale through and through and you are not meant to question the magic of fairy tales. you just accept that its real and thats what makes fairy tales what they are. a place for magic to exist.<br/><br/>OK now onto the actual film review. i really liked it. there was some poor writing in some areas IMO, like the girl eating two freaking grapes of all tings despite all the warnings. also the girl going out of her way to place the chalk on the captains desk for him to see. also some of the production seemed like it could have used a bigger budget.<br/><br/>all that aside, its a great film thats more than good enough to make up for its flaws. i like many would have liked to see more, a lot more, of the fantasy world and in general would have liked the film to been More fairy tale than war drama but still its a great film that i liked very much. its creative, magical, and enjoyable."
"mestanzade","9","2","5","10 August 2007"," A movie worth seeing
","Overall it is a very original movie, definitely worth seeing (but not for kids). I watched this movie expecting another fantastic movie full of computer effects and action. It is not. It is so much more. Many were angry for not finding what they expected. I was glad, because it exceeded my expectations so much. Unlike others who knew what the film is about and already had high expectations about the movie before watching it.<br/><br/>In case you did not watch it and don't want to be surprised here are the spoilers.<br/><br/>The film seems to contain two quite independent stories -- the first about about a child's fantasy world, with Ofelia as the main character, the second about rebels confronting a cruel army officer, with Mercedes as the main character. I say independent because, though the two stories interconnect, it is possible to take the Ofelia out of Mercedes' story or Mercedes out of Ofelia's story and the content would not change much. It looks like a technique to show several short stories in parallel. While each of the stories may be impressing, showing them together makes the effect they leave even stronger. It also makes much easier to fill a film with standard runtime ( around 2 hours ) with meaningful content.<br/><br/>In the main story Ofelia has a rich fantasy world, sometimes beautiful, sometimes scary and thrilling. Actually it is not clear where that world and its characters are imaginative or real. There seems to be some clues that the magic of the fantasy world is real. Still I'd like to believe the magic is imaginative. This way the film reminds us how real their fantasy world may seem to children; and how important it may be for them. Ofelia seems to be barely aware of the rebels. The things that matter for her are her imaginative characters and her dear mother, who is pregnant and severely sick.<br/><br/>The story that goes on in parallel is about Mercedes that works as a servant in the house of Captain Vidal, an army officer that seeks the rebels. Rebels hide in the woods and one of them is brother of Mercedes. Mercedes helps her brother. This story has some violence. This is not ""cool"" violence of video-games. But a kind of violence that makes you sick, makes you want to close your eyes and never see any violence again, makes you wonder why they do violence at all. Larger part of the violence is done by Captain Vidal, a brutal and cruel man. Among all the characters in the film Captain's personality was elaborated most of all. He has negative male characteristics: violent, obsessed about control, wants a boy child. As if Guillermo del Toro was trying to understand why is Captain so merciless. I am not sure whether he succeeded in understanding, I didn't. Another notable character in the movie is the doctor. He seems to be sympathetic to the rebels but questions whether it is worth to fight. I dare to believe that he reflects the view of Guillermo.<br/><br/>It must be noted that Guillermo is both the director and the writer of the screenplay. This makes the movie very cohesive unlike some other movies of this type.<br/><br/>Besides the story everything else is perfect too. The cinematography, the music. Ah yes, the music. The music was beautiful. So simple, yet so beautiful and so fitting to the film. I did not hear the other musics nominated for the Oscar but I still think that pan's labyrinth should get the Oscar for the best music."

","I was hesitated about seeing this film at first because I heard that there were a lot of violent and gory scenes. However,it turns out not that bad. Yes, a few scenes have graphic violence but comparing to many other movies,it's not too bad.<br/><br/>I have to say that this movie is an art. It combines the fantasy world and the real world very well. I was very impressed with that eyeless monster, the way he has to put his eyes into his hand and raise his hands up to see. It's quite a sight! Never see anything like it. Yes,some imagination presented in this film are a bit creepy but they are very original indeed. The reality world is also well-acted and directed. The story is interesting and really grab my attention from the beginning to the end.<br/><br/>One thing I must say, the ending is very good. This kind of film can be just a pointless fantasy without a good ending that gives meaning to it all. But this film ends beautifully.<br/><br/>The whole cast did very good job,especially the acting of the girl who plays Ophelia. She looks so natural. She just simply be Ophelia, a simple ordinary girl who just wants to live in a place where she can be safe, loved, and happy. Her eyes express her feeling well and her acting is not too deliberating. Way to go, girl!"

","What can I say about the creator/director of this feature that isn't known by cult movie watchers? Guillermo doesn't disappoint with his take into his interpreted world of darkness and the fantasy elements doesn't mask this either.<br/><br/>If you have been taken in by the possibilities of breathtaking art and fantasy do not be mislead because there is nothing whimsical about this movie.<br/><br/>It is ultra violent and in Del Toro's case, this is the norm. I would say that the movie had succeeded in turning me off or disturbing me in which I believe was the intention. <br/><br/>I have given this a 6 because it isn't bad in a Argento kind of way but being that I have a child myself, it is not the kind of thing that I find ideal for a young person to watch. But this is not clearly a case of a moral stance but I for one have thought that it was something that a young person could watch and be introduced to the darkest elements of life but I will take that mistake on my own account of ignorance and not that of those who presented this opus. I have also given this movie a 6 not because I am downplaying it with what I've expressed thus far but for me, the storyline is something where I take the attitude of ""been there, done that."" But I am not the type of person who bash cinematic art critically with unrealistic high expectations either.<br/><br/>With that being said, I believe that this is the darkest fantasy movie ever created because the contents mixed in well to give a very powerful atmospheric working. Yes folks, worlds collide and there are uncomfortable moments and this is coming from someone who's seen the most artsiest of films to the most violent of films down to the most trashiest of ones."
"jamesnicolay","10","2","5","22 July 2007"," Best Spanish!
","Winner of three Oscars in the recently held Academy Awards, this Spanish cinematic baby by Guillermo Tolentino is more than just a modern fairy tale for the mature viewers. Its complex juxtaposition of the evils of war and innocence of a child trapped into her own psychological and fantastic labyrinths provides multifarious layers of meanings and depths that current sci- fi/fantasy movies fall short on or struggle to achieve--unfortunately--miserably. <br/><br/>Being one of the very few movies that made my tear ducts function, it is a deeply sad and moving tale--at times, extremely frightening and violent--definitely, it is reminiscent of the original Brothers Grimm fairy tales, which are themselves very twisted and gory. The wit of the screenplay, the complex animation and effects, and the brilliant cinematography surpass most of the movies released last year. <br/><br/>It's destined to be a classic. In all probability, as what ""Amelie"" did to the French, ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" has made the Spanish proud for standing out as one of their best contributions to the modern world cinema."

","There are hundreds of individual reviews of this film. Why? Because it is so moving. Set at a time when Franco's troops were finishing of the resistance to their move to power after the Spanish Civil War it is a fable of the the roles of duty and independence. The sadistic Fascist army captain Vidal played by Sergi Lopez has to be one of the most awesome Top 10 Movie Villains. The themes for each of the many intertwining plots seems to be the conflict between the importance of unquestioning duty or obedience and the importance of impulse or affect.<br/><br/>But I think it is almost better to go into this film knowing very little about it and just go with the tale.

","Set against the backdrop of Franco's oppressive rule in 1944, Spanish filmmaker, Guillermo del Toro, offers us a historical fantasy which accurately depicts fascist Spain. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is both vile and sublime, painfully true to the facts of the period. To human nature, as well, unfortunately. It is a story that touches too many of us in our everyday lives and is a film that is difficult to ignore.<br/><br/>Traveling with her pregnant mother to meet her new step-father, played brilliantly by Sergi Lopez, our heroine, little Ofelia has a world all her own. Ivana Baquero, aged 12 years-old portrays her character with uncanny innocence. The entire piece holds historical significance and del Toro's screenplay impacts the senses in such a way, that we witness, or suffer, the horror of the times through a child's eyes. In this case, her imagination; her only refuge against the world around her. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is rare achievement, for it holds innocence against evil and evil wins. Or does it, truly?"

","This stunning film is a bizarre blend of fantasy and the harsh reality of war. I felt the film was telling two stories, in two very different worlds yet somehow they were one. It showed me that even though there is a war going on in our lives, with people being butchered and murdered before our eyes, the innocence of a child can still escape into a place of beauty and fantasy.<br/><br/>Ivana Baquero was amazing. She captured the innocence of the film while Sergi López portrayed a villain that showed you the extreme opposite. Thrown into the mix is Maribel Verdú as the mother figure for Ofeila, offering a bridge between the two worlds.<br/><br/>I was expecting the film to explain itself as it drew to the end. Telling us that the Fawn was Mercedes, that the General was the ""creature"" in her second tasks, and I loved the fact that it didn't. I loved it even more with its magical, childlike ending. For me it made the film complete, the happy ending in a world that doesn't seem to have one."
"jaywolfenstien","Null","2","5","3 July 2007"," Caressed by a Lullaby
","The paradox I usually face with Guillermo Del Toro is that I rarely like the stories he chooses to tell even though I adore how he tells them. His talent as a director is undeniable. And many times I find myself coming away from his films feeling a weird mix of satisfaction and disappointment, wishing I could like the story as much as I liked the telling. And I always wondered, ""what if, for once, one of the stories clicked with me?"" Now I have the answer  I would be swept away entirely.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is an ingenious juxtaposition of dreamlike fantasy and nightmarish reality. Innocence and violence. Mythological beasts and human monsters. It sets up a dual narrative to explore the world of young Ofelia's fairy tale that exists within (and beyond) the cruelties of a fascist regime. Ofelia arrives at her new home with her pregnant mother, and soon finds herself face to face with a faun who unlocks the rest of Ofelia's adventures. Alone, she descends into a dark underworld, facing exotic (yet charming) mythological creatures whose horrors curiously pale compared to the monsters of the intertwined story.<br/><br/>While the young Ofelia fulfills her destiny with magical stones, mandrake roots, and chalk-drawn doorways, the world around her unravels its parallel plot of a war between freedom and fascism with instruments of torture, cold blooded murder, and oppression spelled out in excruciatingly graphic, yet not gratuitous, detail. Here resides the sadistic Captain Vidal, human only in appearance, who early on states "" I want my son born in a clean, new Spain"" with a not-so-subtle invocation of atrocity's past. Is it any wonder we soon see Vidal washing his hands in the blood of the innocent? Is it any wonder Ofelia pursues the promise of the faun  the only ray of hope in the film  despite the dangers she faces? And is it any wonder that the single most terrifying moment comes when Ofelia faces not a fantastic mythical beast, but Captain Vidal alone in the labyrinth? <br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is an intimate exploration of the dark side of human consciousness, both childlike (represented by Ofelia) and mature (Captain Vidal), and, more impressively, it's not afraid to deal with the consequences when these two worlds collide.<br/><br/>I adore this film. The virtuoso cinematography, score, direction, editing, writing, and performances combine to paint a beautiful picture of the most vile and ugly human attributes. I loved watching Vidal ride off to strike at the resistance, and the camera pans past a tree, where upon it cuts to Ofelia wandering alone through the forest. And when Ofelia tells a story to her unborn brother, her head resting upon her mother's belly, and the camera sinks down showing the unborn fetus in the womb, then pans over to visually represent the tale Ofelia tells, finally drifting back to the reality of the bedroom bedtime story.<br/><br/>And I loved that the movie possessed an unmistakable awe and wonder for its material. Del Toro energizes this bedtime story with the same dreamy fascination of a youth succumbing to sleep, listening to his mother's soft voice caressing him with a lullaby. Many films present fantasy and fairy tales, but Pan's Labyrinth genuinely believes."
"Cinema_Fan","9","2","5","3 July 2007"," Magnificent and beautiful movie making.
","""Suffer the little children at the hand's of evil men"".<br/><br/>Ofelia's love of fairy tales is obvious from the beginning of Mexican born Guillermo Del Toro's 2006 movie El Laberinto del fauno. Set in the not so tranquil woodlands during the Spanish Civil War of July 17th 1936 to April 1st 1939 , where a small but dedicated band of anti-fascism rebels are hiding out, this is where Ofelia and her pregnant mother have come to live, in the company of Capitán Vidal, Ofelia's new stepfather and soon to be father of her half-brother. It is with the brutal, unforgiving and totalitarian idealist Capitán Vidal, and his fascist troops, who must weed out these resistance fighters of the hills and woods, that Ofelia finds her release and distraction of the new world order and its warring factions and delves into the older, mysterious and enchanting world of fairies, faun's and giant frogs.<br/><br/>El Laberinto del fauno is intertwined with several stories, and each carrying their own with sufficient character and strength for the movie not to warrant sub-plots. The delivery of these plots are well matched and paced to lift El Laberinto del fauno into the realms of a magnificent story of love, death, bravery and fairy tale magic.<br/><br/>It is in the eyes of young Ofelia that we see her world around her becoming more intriguing with each passing day, her journey into the labyrinth and the cold reality around her pushing her deeper and deeper into a world of innocence.<br/><br/>Then, it is in this contradiction as to why El Laberinto del fauno works its own magic so well, El Laberinto del fauno is a dark and evil place to reside, not only the twisted and tangled roots and branches of Ofelia's newfound world, but also, the perils of war. The darker side of human nature is shown without pity or remorse, death is always close by, and for the eyes of a child, only dreams can overpower the nightmares of this horrific, often graphic and extremely uncompromising grown-up world.<br/><br/>Sometimes tense, sometimes sentimental, sometimes astounding but always magnificent in the delicate handling's of this young child's world, this too is the world of how we deal with war and those who suffer it, literally.<br/><br/>With beautiful set designs, imaginative artwork and crafted edits and a story that holds no compassion for War, El Laberinto del fauno is a charming period piece that goes far beyond the dreams of a child. El Laberinto del fauno is also, at best, a reminder of how, as human beings, we can become so narrow minded in our beliefs that we forget to remind ourselves that this world is more than just ideas and hidden agendas but that we must transcend ourselves into a higher plain of understanding, tolerance and respect for one another. It is this philosophy that makes us different from the rest, as human beings we have always had this right to choose."

","I saw this movie on the DVD, which has English and Spanish subtitles -- a rarity as very few videos in Spanish available in the US have Spanish subtitles. The (English) audio commentary by the director is very interesting and informative, and his enthusiasm for this production just shines through the commentary, so I recommend it highly.<br/><br/>The language, direction, acting, cinematography, and music are all extraordinary. This is a true fairy tale, with a villain you can't miss unless you happen to like fascists, and one of the most beguiling heroines in all literature. Not for children, a key theme is death and immortality. The movie haunted me with two thoughts: that even children can easily recognize good and evil, and that when things are going as bad as possible, maybe something good is happening if we open our minds to it.<br/><br/>Why one of the main characters is called Pan in the English-language title I can't imagine... he does not have the name Pan in the movie and is not the mythical Pan. The title in all other countries (The Labyrinth of the Faun) is much better and more evocative of the many symbolic levels of the labyrinth."
"LivingDog","10","2","5","1 July 2007"," Original, creative, Spanish!
","Let me explain my summary. When I was a photographer I paid attention to art. I visited many galleries and saw a pattern among all of the artists. Only the Spanish are original, individual, creative, and true to their heart (I am listening to del Toro's commentary and the word I am looking for is: integrity). I have to add this, the Canadian film industry is very similar in this way.<br/><br/>Let me give you an example by contrast. When I was a photographer I visited an ""art party"" in the village. While I was there I overheard the guy who invited me say to a group of his buddies: ""Well, we sold 150 paintings this week."" I was taken aback and said: ""Is this how success in art is measured?"" Well, the group went silent and only starred at me. I waited for a reply - nothing. So I left feeling that art is dead - at least in their hearts ... and they're the artists! So now you know why I feel so strongly about the Spanish - their integrity to their heart.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this movie is about violence and innocence coexisting in the world, and the fantasy created to escape the violence. (E.g. del Toro comments that he loves a 2 second shot in a short scene where Ofelia gets an exceedingly small victory - this small comment proves my point.) If you are bothered by subtitled movies you don't have to worry about following this one. It is graphically beautiful, visualizations dominate the script (but I did miss a few sentences - to no ill effect), and there is no way you won't enjoy this movie. 10+/10<br/><br/>-LD<br/><br/>_____________________________________________<br/><br/>my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/"
"oyason","Null","2","5","30 June 2007"," A forthright exploration of what an adult world at war looks like to children
","Director Guillermo Del Toro's film PAN'S LABYRINTH is one of the most thoughtful fantasy/horror pictures that has been brought to mass (or mainstream audiences) in many years. The work is a sort of cross between THE NEVER ENDING STORY and Gunther Grass' Hitlerite Germany storyline THE TIN DRUM. Though there is little to find here in the way of original storyline or exploration of fantastic themes, it is a forthright exploration of what an adult world at war looks like to children, and deserves the continued attention of those film lovers who have a special hankering for the Gothic genre.<br/><br/>The work is set against the background of Franco's Spain, which is in the process of consolidating a fascist victory over the Republican government that was defeated in 1939. The year is 1944, and Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a precocious 12 year old girl with a passion for fantasy literature, is the step-daughter of a military specialist, Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), who has married her mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil). Ofelia is isolated, and has an ally in the head of the housekeeping staff in Vidal's compound, a woman named Mercedes (Maribel Verdu).<br/><br/>Captain Vidal has been sent to the countryside in Spain in order to shut down the partisan resistance which is still waging guerrilla warfare in the mountains, and the arrival of his adapted family is the note the film begins on. Ofelia's mother Carmen is experiencing a difficult pregnancy with Vidal's child, and looks to her daughter for the little stability and support she is able to attain living in a military compound. Ofelia's main comfort is in the world of dreams and nightmare she is able to create for herself, an activity that is frowned upon by her mother and condemned by her rigid-spit-and polish step father. She also some support from Mercedes, who is a sort of socialist ""fellow traveler"" and supporter of the guerrilla resistance hidden inside the Captain's household. Ofelia's world of personal folklore leads her into a fantasy relationship with a mystical faun (Doug Jones) who, in her thinking, patterns for her a quest and boon she must endure in order to reclaim her status as a princess in the realm of the fantastic, and thereby save her mother and unborn brother. And it is her life, both within the bounds of imagination and the strictures of the real world, that makes up the bulk of this story, which can only end in madness and death.<br/><br/>I don't think I've said too much here, but having noted all this, it should also be observed that, despite the graphic quality of the violence in this film, PAN'S LABYRINTH remains an interesting and compelling chunk of film. The overall message of the work is sweet in its essence, and lacks the world-weariness of much of the junk that passes for mainstream entertainment in these here United States. If you haven't seen it yet, it's definitely a ""ringer"" for the fantasy film audience."
"pc95","6","2","5","27 June 2007"," Gratuitous violence/setting, dull characters detract from story
","Pan's Labyrinth is particularly graphic it its violence - surely gratuitous- having a repulsive affect. Viewing people being shot different ways and multiple times or tortured for the sake of show is not entertainment. Neither is the sadism and the brutality of one of the main characters - a Captain in the Spanish military. However the backdrop (yes backdrop) story or fairy tale is well depicted and conceived and twisted in an almost Burton-like way. One of the lead fairy tale creatures is a definite rip-off from ""The Cat's Eye"" troll (with Drew Barrymore), but that's OK. Too bad the setting/war completely ruins any wonder or art related to the fairytale. The fairytale itself lifts the movie as best it can, but with so much senselessness and a boring lead character with little charm coming off a little dull, the movie suffers. Keeping the fairytale as a base and some rework could've done justice. It ultimately and sadly is lost on the potential the fairytale cant reach."

","Well, the art direction is fantastic, but the story doesn't quite hold together. Unnecessary gruesome violence and a really, really bad guy, and the point is..? Yes, there were such bad people in fascist Spain, but I derive no thoughtful insights from this portrayal. The little girl's fantasy world is an equally frightening escape from the horrors of humanity, and the point is..? I guess I should not be expecting this to be a cut above the usual blockbuster fare in terms of story, but somehow all the film festival hype around it lead me to think it would have some deeper literary qualities. It is entertainment that keeps one's attention with thrills and suspense and moments of beauty, but the black-and-white good vs. bad didn't quite satisfy me. Too bad, the premise of the story had such great potential."

","I simply cannot rave enough about this film. Thank you, del Toro, for bringing us such a multi-layered, beautiful story set like a fire opal against the stark matrix of civil warfare. An instant dark fairy-tale classic for a complex modern world; villains whose motives we comprehend, yet cannot condone, classic nythic formulae served up ice-cold, just as the brother's Grimm would have it, and startlingly inventive visual effects to enhance and enlarge the film's fantastic characters. And all of this balancing on a razor's edge of reality. I'm still trying to think up ways to use it in my English honors class. I set this one right up there with 'Cite des enfants perdues"" and -- creative story-telling and visual imagery some of the best I've ever seen. Quite simply, 'Pan's Labyrinth Kudos and more kudos for this highly original work! In many ways, the film itself is a labyrinth: a new surprise around every odd bend."

","This is a very sad, dark fantasy film with quite some realism. From the beginning on, you will somehow suspect that things will not go uphill and bad things will happen. But when they do, they won't leave you untouched. The tragedy unfolds more and more, with slight glimpses of hope here and there, until the climax will leave you in tears. I can't remember the last time a film moved me like that.<br/><br/>Even though I am more fond of emotionally uplifting films this is such a brilliant, elegant and efficiently told film (at the cost of having caricatures) that it must be seen. Like most great fantasy films (Neverending story, Labyrinth)there is the idea that imagination should be cherished, rather than ridiculed (which the adults of course do in this film). And like in those classics, but in a much bleaker way, there is also a harsh reality that has to be faced.<br/><br/>While depressing, the film ends on a positive note. Even though the killings that occur are meaningless, the lives that were taken were not. The idea that everyone is special (the main character is told she's a princess) and the value of self sacrifice are the ones to stick to despite all the misery."

","This film was such a pleasant surprise. I slightly put off watching it due to ignorance and narrow mindedness that a foreign film really wouldn't match up to the American and English films and the subtitles would distract me away from the story...<br/><br/>HOWEVER, this really didn't happen. Once the film gets going you really don't realise you are reading subtitles, i think also because the director, Guillermo del Toro wrote the subtitles himself was a great move - as we were able to capture and understand the essence of the dialogue.<br/><br/>Many people i see from other comment complain how this was a fairytale that was demented etc... however i think it is quite clear from earlyish in the film that there is two parallel stories going on. Not knowing much about Spainish history i was able to understand the basic jist of the ""war"" side of the film.<br/><br/>Looking at the ""fairy tale"" perspective, it was truly magical and the detail was immense. It was heart-breaking how a child used this fantasy land to escape away from the terrible world she was living in.<br/><br/>I would strongly recommend watching this enchanting film it is in my top, and has an essence that many films don't have these days."
"rajdoctor","8","2","5","10 June 2007"," Pan's Labyrinth
","This is a Spanish movie, and I saw it in Dutch subtitles. I do not know both the languages. I had seen the trailer of the movie and found it too childish and weird in associating war scenes with fantasy. I was not much interested in seeing the movie, but just because of the excellent review of the film on various web-sites, I went and saw the movie.<br/><br/>The story is told from the viewpoint of a 12 year old girl Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), who is brought by her mother (Manolo Solo) to the step father and Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez) of Spanish battalion during the fascist 1944 era. There are two plots running in the movie. One of the brutal guerilla wars of cruel Captain Vidal and the other of the fantasy and dream world of Ofelia, who finds and sees a fairy tale beyond human imaginations. The story unfolds side by side and ends up in how the young girl succeeds in her mission, with the help of a fantasy Jinn (Doug Jones), through the defeat and killing of the sadistic Captain Vidal.<br/><br/>The Director Guillermo del Toro has told this tale with sheer brilliance in weaving the two story line with such a ease and simplicity that neither of them disturb the flow and narrative of the movie. The brutality of the war and the terrifying images of the fantasy world  both live up to the expectations and audience's satisfaction.<br/><br/>The musical score is excellent and the production, casting, set, make up designers have played a pivotal role in the movie's high quality output. All credit to Guillermo, who has achieved international fame and reputation through this movie  that has won many awards (among them 3 Oscars).<br/><br/>Sergi Lopez has played the hated role of Captain Vidal and leaves us in resounding hatred towards him. But the movie is all and all dependent on the girl Ivana Baquero who has grabbed the impossible opportunity of the life time to play this innocent yet vulnerable role of the young girl who loves to dream and live a fantasy life.<br/><br/>A unique and totally satisfying movie experience; Go see and cherish the joys of good cinema. A mild warming  the movie has many gory and violent scenes that might disturb you too.<br/><br/>(Stars 8 out of 10)"

It was a truly great film.

There is even a scene with a leg amputation although it cuts away at the last minute. No pun intended. Plenty of brains being blown out and torture. Despite the fairy tale theme this excellent movie is not even for children who you might think have seen it all. It's also all in Spanish with English subtitles for those of you who might not know.

The girl lives in an imaginary world of her own creation and faces the real world with much chagrin. Fascist repression during the first years of Franco's dictatorship is at its height in rural Spain and the girl must come to terms with that through a fable of her own.<br/><br/>I am happy to say this is the first film I have read subtitles instead of hearing other actors talk in English. It's not that bad, really. I also have to say this film is very depressing, showing the ill-mannered actions during a war era.<br/><br/>This film will take you in the movie, making you experience something you never had before. It's very imaginative, with great special effects, a great production designs and some camera work. This film is very dark, and although I'm just a teen, don't let children watch this movie.<br/><br/>There are some scenes where I think it was unnecessary to add the violence and blood. Written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, this is probably his best film to date. I liked the acting by Ivana Baquero, Sergi López, and Maribel Verdú.<br/><br/>This is a worthy film in Guillermo del Toro's collection of movies he had made.

"mcsheehey","10","2","5","26 May 2007"," A Perfect Blend of Fantasy, History, and Horror
","After finally seeing this film after waiting months for the DVD release, I am enormously surprised about a number of things. First of all, I have to wonder how in the world this film did not win the Oscar for Foreign Film. It should have been nominated for Best Picture in general, and has proved to be far superior to this past year's front-runners, like The Departed and Babel.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth tells the story of a young girl named Ofelia who is thrust into two frightening worlds when she and her mother go to live with Ofelia's monstrous step-father: a fantasy world set mainly in the labyrinth of a mysterious faun, and also the even more horrifying world of her new father and his men, in which battles constantly rage and no life truly means anything.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is a phenomenal film on every level. Del Toro presents the two worlds in such contrasting ways that the story is always interesting, yet is often very upsetting. The movie is filled to the brim with small motifs, brilliantly diverse characters, and an entertaining storyline. The finale, though rather sad, is extremely meaningful and almost poetic.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is also great across the board. Ofelia's character is so believable, and her step-father is played so cruelly that I stopped even thinking of them as actors. The supporting cast is also flawless.<br/><br/>The last aspect of the film that I found truly amazing was the overall visual presentation. The art direction was enchanting, the visual effects were startling, and the cinematography gave the film a whole new dimension. However, especially noteworthy is the makeup. The two main mystical creatures in the film are the faun, of course, as well as a disturbing-looking humanoid villain. They both look incredibly mystical, and in the case of the latter, disturbing. Overall, this is one of my favorite movies of all time and I wold recommend it to anyone above the age of 14, due to the intense and brutal violence and gory scenes."
"DonFishies","8","2","5","23 May 2007"," A haunting and fantastic experience that needs to be seen to be believed
","There was only one film in the last year that I have regretted not seeing in the theatre when I had a chance: Pan's Labyrinth. Everywhere I looked, there were rave reviews for it, and stupidly, I just never bothered to see it when I could have. After months of kicking myself, I snatched it up on DVD and watched it as soon as I could. And while it was not what I was expecting, I am still in awe days later.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, Pan's Labyrinth takes place in Spain in 1944, and is about two people: the young and innocent Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) and the evil tyrant Capitán Vidal (Sergi López). Ofelia's mother has just married Vidal, and is carrying his child as the film opens. Vidal is the leader of a sect of the Spanish military, who are holding up in the mountains of Spain, and are being consistently attacked by mercenary rebels fighting to end the civil unrest. But a strange insect begins to appear to Ofelia soon after she arrives in her new home, and even sooner does she realize that she may not be who she thinks she is.<br/><br/>That small snippet does not even begin to crack the layered shell that is Pan's Labyrinth. It is just stunningly original in its fantasy, and totally unlike anything I have ever seen. The imagination and uniqueness at work here from writer/director Guillermo del Toro is more powerful than I could have ever imagined it would be.<br/><br/>The very visual film packs in a lot of images to comprehend. The colours used to express the difference between characters like Ofelia and Vidal are brilliant and vibrant in their usage. And the indelible impressions they leave on the characters are only multiplied for the audience. One looks no further than to a bright scene in a bathroom with Ofelia looking at a book. She opens it, and the pages turn blood red. No sooner does this happen than she opens the door and looks into a gloomy room that has all of the brightness of the bathroom before it, but none of its visually appetizing features. Multiple scenes look like this, and whether it is dark, grim and moody (which is what most of the film looks like), or brilliantly well-lit, every image looks dazzling (even at its most graphically violent of times).<br/><br/>Those colours only lead into how horrific and fantastical the film truly is. The horrors of war are never too intense, but they feel as authentic and real as the grimmest and bloodiest of war films. The emotion at play here, especially from the character of Vidal, is just too horrific to bare in some cases, and really play more into the imagination of just how much a tyrant he truly is, as opposed to the tyrant he comes off as. And the fantasy does not make the horror any less scary than it is. The scene with the creature called 'The Pale Man' is of particular relevance here, because when he is sitting still he looks kind of sheepishly fantastical and laughable, but once he begins moving, he becomes one of the most terrifying things ever put on screen.<br/><br/>But that is what this movie is: an emotionally driven work of art that evolves and changes back and forth on a whim. The editing is that precise, and the storyline that well rounded, that such a feat is easily accomplished.<br/><br/>What I did dislike though, is the fact that the movie spends a lot more time focusing on Vidal than it does on Ofelia. I absolutely adored every fantastical moment of Ofelia's journey, but I just enjoyed the moments with Vidal. It becomes a bit tedious and boring in some cases, and in others, becomes a bit too much. Some scenes just go on a tad bit too long, and feel unneeded. Of course, they also made me hyped for the next moment of fantastical beauty, but they offset it a bit too much. I understand the need for the grim reality of the situation these two main characters are in, but I think less focus on Vidal (and even less focus on the throwaway rebels) could have helped liven the fantasy up even more than it already was.<br/><br/>For what the film lacks in pacing, it makes up for in its spectacular make-up. The tricks employed to transform Doug Jones into the Pale Man, and into the titular Pan are just nothing short of miraculous. He may start out as pure fantasy, but as the film goes on, becomes more and more close to reality. These creatures are as real as they come, and their authenticity is unnerving in a lot of cases. Kudos to Jones for the wonderful body language he employed to make these two feel so much more real than they could have been if they were just CGI.<br/><br/>Every performance in the film is grand. Baquero is the picture of innocent, and brings a calm and beautiful resonance to Ofelia. Her pureness is marvellous, and is unmatched by the majority of her counterparts in the United States. López is excellent as the villain, and strikes a particular chord of emotion with every scene he is in. Should the audience hate him, or should they pity him for his stubbornness? He makes every moment he is in memorable, and I can only hope I will see more of him in the future. Every supporting character, especially Maribel Verdú, brings something unique to the table, and even at its most bland moments, helps make Pan's Labyrinth a worthwhile experience.<br/><br/>It is far from perfection, but Pan's Labyrinth is an experience that every fan of cinema should take. Its fantasy, its horror, its genuine human (and creature) emotion is so far above most of its counterparts in the US, that missing it would simply be a terrible waste.<br/><br/>8.5/10."

I loved the little baby plant thing, and when it was burnt it almost made me cry, the screams of pain were heart wrenching. <br/><br/>I can't say I've ever seen a movie that took place in Franco Spain, but for a movie that wasn't really about that, I would say it still gave us a feel for what that time may have been like. It gave historical information in a non-""history channel"" kind of way which allowed the viewer to become more a part of the story enchanting story.<br/><br/>In general child actors annoy me, I however found Ivanna Baquero endearing and I thought she was a perfect guide for our journey through the labyrinth (this may have been solely because she wasn't speaking English). I really felt for the poor child throughout the whole movie, she had the misfortune of being brought in to a cruel world and her only salvation was the world in her mind. I wanted to wrap her up and take her home with me, and let her know everything would be all right. In the end it unfortunately was not all all right, but the journey was certainly entertaining! Ah, the ironic world of movies. <br/><br/>Working at a video store in the middle of hick town many people are wary of renting this particular one because quote ""I don't liake to hafta read ma movays"". I however happen to watch ALL my movies at home, whether in a foreign language or not, with the subtitles on. (That way I make sure I don't miss a thing). This one just also helped me brush up on some of my Spanish! So do not fear the Labrinto! Embrace it! <br/><br/>While reading some other reviews I found that many people did not like this movie because it did not meet their ""expectations"". No, it is not a movie for children, nor is a pure science fiction movie built on fantasy and special effects. I don't believe it was ever intended to be so. I can easily see where children would be frightened by it, and where a LOTR fan would be disappointed if they thought it would be anything like it.

I am not a person who likes fantasy movies, in fact I wasn't even interested in watching this movie until I found out that the entire movie is in Spanish! I mention this because I'm taking Spanish in high school and I'm struggling in that class so I thought it would totally be worth watching to see if I can boost my Spanish, plus I got to rent it for free and watch before it was even released on DVD! That totally got me wanting to see it even more. I loved every thing about the movie, but I bet some of you are wondering why I gave it a 8 instead of a 10. The only reason I gave it an 8 is due to the fact that I thought the gore in the move was a little gut churning.

Music and cinematography matched this very sad moment. Also, the bit when Ophelia (Spelling?) dies and Mercedeus cries over her dead body is emotional. We all liked to think that this girl had gone to be Princess, but sometimes, reality is not that sweet. Sometimes, it can be very sour... Yet that might me not being a optimist. Anyway, for everything good, something bad follows. This movie is not all a fairytale. Some moments are violent and some moments are unpleasant, yet in Snow White, didn't the Queen fall off a rock to her death? In Sleeping Beauty, didn't the Prince slay the evil Dragon/Witch?

"dragonshield","9","2","5","4 May 2007"," Beautiful, magical, fantastic. A fantasy movie for the more mature audience
","To be honest, I wasn't very interested in seeing this movie. The trailer was OK, but it still didn't wake up my interest. But, as so many people had praised this film more then enough and it had a rating of 8.5 at IMDb putting it at the 45th place at the Top 250 Movies of all time -list I just knew I had to see it to know what it's really like. It couldn't be that bad, now could it? Well, all the people buzzing about this film were pretty much right. It is indeed an amazing film. I just don't know where to start. The movie is mixed with history, drama and fantasy, and that pretty much makes it so unique in its own genre, as there aren't really movies like this one. When I first heard about the movie I thought it was a happy family movie for children, but then I heard it's really a film for the more mature audience. I was very surprised how violent the movie actually was and how dramatic a fantasy movie can really be. It can also be compared to thriller -movies as there really is some very exciting parts in it too. It's just really hard to describe it more specifically as I don't want to give away any spoilers.<br/><br/>The story's just brilliant. My interest surely kept on throughout the whole movie, as it just is so exciting. There are actually two plots in this movie, one based on the historical events and the another one based on the fantasy world, and though it may seem that they don't connect together at first, they really do and the way they connect together is just intelligent. Screenplay's also fantastic in its wholeness and it is written by the same man who has directed the movie, Guillermo del Toro. I've seen a couple of his movies before and I must admit that all of them have been very disappointing, but this time the man just totally goes over himself. The movie progresses forward in a very flowing way without any pointless scenes or useless parts. Just fantastic. What comes to role performances this movie doesn't include any phenomenal ones, but everyone does their job flawlessly. There are actually two actors above everyone else which I want to mention. The young actress who plays Ofelia, named Ivana Baquero, who is pretty perfect for the role and a man named Sergi López, who does an excellent job in playing a villain. A perfect villain indeed.<br/><br/>The fantasy world and all things connected to it are very well made and the movie just looks so good. It's no wonder the movie won the Oscars from the categories of Art Direction and Make-Up, the whole art department deserves a huge plus for making something look so good. The world is magical, dark and scary, and also surprising. You simply can not know what's coming around the next corner, you just sit there staring at the screen and wondering how everything just simply look so beautiful. There's not enough compliments to make when it comes to the art. A job amazingly done indeed.<br/><br/>One thing that is also so great in this movie is the cinematography. The whole movie is shot in a beautiful way, both in the real world and the fantasy world. Again, the movie did get its third Oscar from the cinematography and it is no wonder. All the angles, how the camera moves showing you the world and squeezing a little bit more of that excitement for you is just brilliant. A well deserved Academy Award. The music is also a spot on; Though it's not meant to be a beautiful composition or to make you cry, it really does its job. It gives the movie more of that dark edge it needs, making it slightly more magical and giving the movie that extra something. It's used in the right places and it has enough variations, so it's not repetitive or it isn't used in a corny way to dramatize any situations. It just fits like a key to a treasure chest.<br/><br/>Even if you're not a fan of the fantasy, just turn off your ""surreal-alert"" and enjoy a damn good movie. It will amaze you a scene after a scene. Enjoy a beautiful story, a perfect villain, amazing cinematography, fantastic art direction and a great movie. Just watch it and you will see yourself that the people praising this film were actually right. Great."

","I just would like to share this regarding what i think is one of the best movies ever made. That it received 22 minutes of applause at the Cannes Film Festival and 3 academy awards should be an indication. And oh, its in Spanish. Although the movie is often described as a fantasy involving a young girl and the fantasy world she created, to survive the harsh reality...hmmm, isn't that the same reason why we watch movies? to escape?. Whatever our reasons are, for me this movie shook the very foundations of what is real and what is not. She believed that better things are in store for her and believed it strongly and powerfully enough to act on it to the point of losing her divine and royal right on her fantasy world and her mortal life on the ""real world"". Not quite a typical choice for a prepubescent 11-year old girl to make. For us regular mortals though, it simply tells us that there's always something good out there for us and that we should go out and get it. Peace!"

"Cube_TX","9","2","5","21 April 2007"," Outright incredible
","I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie. My family and I had waited a long time to see it and the advertising was somewhat vague. It appeared to be a fantasy for children based on the commercials, but the people I'd spoken to said it was nothing of the kind. Finally, we saw this yesterday and I was outright blown away by the story. Guillermo Del Toro's writing crafted an incredible fantasy world while keeping the movie dark and serious. Ivana Baquero's lead role as Ofelia was also amazing. This girl was able to carry the movie and look strong despite being so much younger than the other characters.<br/><br/>One of the best things about this movie was the way the characters were given personalities without being pushed ahead of Ofelia. I was very impressed with the ""Pale Man"" character. He was legitimately creepy and evil-looking. I can't believe the imagination that was put into this film. Usually such imagination is only in children, and since this story was from the point of view of a child Del Toro did a fantastic job.<br/><br/>Yes, this is a foreign film so you'll have to read subtitles. I actually am able to read and speak Spanish, but read the subtitles anyway. It never distracted from the film. The film seemed to be influenced from many other fantasy stories and films such as Alice in Wonderland, Chronicles of Narnia, Excalibur, and even Beetlejuice. However, the homage to these films was done in such a fantastic way that I felt it was on par, and often even better, than those films.<br/><br/>This is not a film for children, despite the fantasy images, but it also isn't a bloodbath so violent that your young teenagers will be mortified. My 14-year-old also enjoyed it. I highly recommend seeing this in the 2nd run theaters or picking it up on DVD very soon."

","Pan's Labrynth is an absolute masterpiece and one of the best films in years. Foreign films, perhaps because they does not have to conform to market research and demographics like Hollywood does, have consistently produced superbly deep and quietly funny films, and Pan's is no different.<br/><br/>This film also achieves an incredibly difficult feat - it runs two stories parallel at once (one of the labyrinth, the other of the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War). Neither story detracts from the other and both are equally engaging. Within ten minutes of this film the audience is captivated. I watched Pan's with 3 friends of mine - one of whom is not a film fan and has a tendency to switch off - but all 3 were glued to the screen from the word go.<br/><br/>The superb direction allows the film to move at a good pace, and allows the character to develop well. The sense of drama and tension is infused in every scene and every character is believable.<br/><br/>The ambiguity of the film, solidified by its ending, ensures each audience member will take something personal out of the film and its visual semantics are up for debate.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend a film more strongly."

An odd stone that fits in a hole of an ancient statue...<br/><br/>A girl that evades from a cruel life with fairy tales is guided by a fantastic creature to something beyond the expected reality of a cruel grown up world.<br/><br/>In a style very similar to Carlos Saura's Spanish movies (see: http://imdb.com/name/nm0767022/bio ) the author tells us a story that does very little effort to avoid experiencing the historical context of Spain during the ending of their Civil War.<br/><br/>While the winners try to show everybody that their technical and only-one-point-of-view justified their cruel and reactionary war against the Spanish Republic, the loosers are left with nature and a rich human history on their side.<br/><br/>Nature for Europeans is filled with tradition, myths from before any contemporary religion and a profound knowledge of the human condition.<br/><br/>This film is showing all these, and is not trying to take the part of the girl that wants to forget the reality where she was forced to grow up.

","Encouraged to watch this by the intriguing storyline and awards it won I finally got round to it wanting it to be as mesmerising as it was claimed. Well no, but it is a well crafted, fabulously photographed and darkly violent imaginative fantasy film. A previous post criticised it for not being fantasy enough - I got news for him: all films are fantasy because they depict worlds no-one knows and condense and order stories into contrived chunks for mass digestion. Why make fantasy realistic?<br/><br/>Girl wants to and is given the opportunity to become a Princess in Fairyland partly out of childishness but also to escape the horrors of the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War. She has to complete three tasks successfully - something not quite achieved but! Like A Matter Of Life And Death and others, you are shown that this other world could be just an hallucination, even at the very end and even though you need it to be really true by then after all the brutality you've sat through. A brutal opinion of the audience indeed. There are three things shown to good advantage by this film: one is the sadism of the Captain and therefore the sadism of the movie makers in rubbing our noses in such fantasy bestiality, two is the eye-cutting digital cartoonery especially essential for the fantasy sections, and three with the present day message that Franco represented a dark time it actually succeeds into making you believe that the Republicans won the War instead of losing and instilling a ""positive"" note into the proceedings: another fantasy. If you need to see a truly wondrous fantasy film with subtitles watch Jean Cocteau's Belle Et La Bete instead.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it to a point but hated the glorification of routine violence as a worthy artform even though I know that pandering to todays progressive and enlightened audiences could have made it much worse. Does it make us all better people to see a cheek being digitally knifed open or does it take us all down yet another notch? Because of all that not on my welcome back list, but it's interesting and thought-provoking stuff unless you're pretty sure that you can do without it."
"denis888","9","2","5","8 April 2007"," Very tragic, very good
","Some people think mistakenly that Pan's Labyrinth is a children's movie, but this is certainly not the one. The very plot is very cruel, dark, gloomy and not so serene. The story takes place in 1944, in General Franco's fascist Spain, where small, but active partisan's detachments still continue their struggle. The main heroine, little girl named Ophelia, comes with her pregnant Mom to the idyllic countryside to see her step-father, fascist Captain, a murderous, ruthless villain, with no human feature left. The story then goes in two parallel lines  one is dark, terrible reality of WWII, with its battles, executions, tortures, partisan actions and fierce cruelty on Nazi's side; another is a deep, mystical fairy tale with Pan, faeries, horrible eyeless monster, magic chalk and a brave girl Ophelia who really wants to help her Mom and her yet unborn son. At times, the film becomes so intensely cruel, so bloody and so mercilessly real that it's hard to watch and not be shocked with how terrible any war can be. And the fairy part is also very dark, frightening and spooky, it is not a sweet bedtime moralist story, nay, it is far too real, too. The never-ending succession of deaths of several main heroes leaves a heavy trace on your heart and the very ending, with its honey-golden hues of color, its openly Christian moral and its sweeter tones is probably the only light spot in the whole deeply tragic and very convincing story. The film is a big winner on the side of Mr. Del Toro as a director, writer and main originator, and the Captain's part, played by Mr. Lopez, is truly a genius of bright, persuading performance of sheer brilliance and great talent. Not a film for kids, but still, this is a must for those whop seem to forget how bad Nazism is and how abominable any war may be."
"kosmasp","8","2","5","2 April 2007"," Fairytale for Grown Ups
","Much has been said/written about the underlying tones in this picture. The fascist regime on the one hand, the dream(?) world on the other hand. Del Toro leaves it up to you, so everyone can decide what they make of it ...<br/><br/>That also can be said about the fantasy world. Does it really exist or is it all in the imagination of Ofelia? I only watched the movie once, so I'm not quite sure what to make of it ... but my first guess would be that it all was a dream or an escape reality Ofelia had. I'm sure some psychologist would/could use that to analyse me ... ;o) But that doesn't matter after all, you have a really good fairy tale for adults here. Some might find it a little bit too offensive or too bloody. One thing is for sure, it's not for children.<br/><br/>A few minor things bothered me, while I was watching the movie. Nothing of importance, but here are two examples ... When Ofelia escaped from the monster that had his eyes in his palms, she left a piece of chalk behind ... Now why didn't the ""monster"" use this to come into the real world? (a logical explanation would be, my believe that it's all a dream) ... or why did the faun forgive Ofelia, that she did eat at the table? Just because she is a child? Two of the ""fairys"" were killed because of that (although in the end they seem to be back again ... if that's them) ... That also could be explained, if it was all a dream ...<br/><br/>Anyway, I might have thought too much about it. It still is a good picture, with some explicit scenes of violence!"
"commandercool88","9","2","5","30 March 2007"," Exhilarating Brilliance
","'Pan's Labyrinth' wasn't going to wait. And I wasn't going to let a silly 'sold out' marquee interrupt my date with del Toro. So with a ticket to 'Alpha Dog', and a front row seat in a packed theater, I sat down to enjoy 2 hours of magical film-making. 'Labyrinth' is, without a doubt, one of the most magical pieces of film-making I've ever had the pleasure of seeing, with a rich and compelling story to be told. It crosses into the realm of fantasy and back, and rarely misses a beat. This is a rare fairytale for adults, one that wraps its spellbinding magic around you and takes you on an unforgettable journey. A journey well-worth taking, and one that shouldn't be missed.<br/><br/>The year is 1944, the setting is war-torn Spain. A young girl and her pregnant mother travel north to a rural setting where the mother will be together with her new husband, a cruel Captain whose orders are to squash a guerrilla army looming in the surrounding woods. The girl, Ofelia, imagines a wondrous world filled with magical creatures to help her cope with the death and danger she must face in the real world. She dreams of becoming a princess, and the three tasks she must complete for this prophecy to be fulfilled. She'll meet fairies, a faun, a giant toad, and a terrifying monster with an appetite for little boys and girls. But the dream can't last forever, as Ofelia along with many others must come to terms with the changing world around them.<br/><br/>Spanish director del Toro has a style all of his own. It's dark, it's haunting, it's mesmerizing. There's little left to the imagination in 'Pan's Labyrinth', as del Toro's alternate reality is so richly satisfying and so surreal, it couldn't have been dreamed up any better. It is, quite simply, an Odyssey for a new generation. And yes, a fairytale for adults. For within its pixie dust and woodlen creatures, 'Labyrinth' is also an unflinching and grim portrayal of war and oppression. It's disturbing, and at times even difficult to watch. A political movie told through the eyes of a young girl. Those two elements collide with such force that you may even be looking for your breathe during the film's more intense sequences. The depth to which this film is able to reach is remarkable and rare by today's standards, it's something that is genuinely touching and heartbreaking at the same time. I only wish we had gotten to know the fantasy world more intimately, for every moment spent with it and its visually stunning characters was a moment to be remembered.<br/><br/>'Pan's Labyrinth' is headed by twelve-year-old Ivana Baquero, a very talented young girl who has the role of a lifetime. Her character, Ofelia, is one of the few aspects in del Toro's film whose innocence hasn't been lost, and whose imagination is still rich with fantasy and wonder. The situation she's been placed in is heartbreaking, but her means of coping is admirable. Maribel Verdu, who also stars in the great 'Y Tu Mama Tambien', plays Mercedes, the housekeeper who comes to form a close bond with Ofelia. Her performance is equally fantastic, as is Sergi Lopez, the foul Captain. His threatening persona powers the film, and his ruthless character is shocking. Doug Jones gives a noteworthy performance, both as Pan and the Pale Man. Jones has given birth to many characters in films, including 'Hellboy' (another del Toro film), 'Lady in the Water', and the upcoming 'Fantastic Four' and 'Hellboy' sequels. Together the entire cast comes together to form an exceptional and diverse ensemble.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, 'Pan's Labyrinth' is the most magical film of the year, but also simply one of the year's best. It excels on all levels, thanks to the direction and script from Guillermo del Toro. The experience is one that will ultimately enrich you, and might make you believe in a more magical existence. But if anything, 'Labyrinth' stands as a testament to film-making, and how visual storytelling can be used to tell a powerful message that's worth being told, and that all should listen to. It's astonishing. I challenge you to dip yourself into its dark magic, and revel in its tale of innocence and sacrifice."
"sidmclean","9","2","5","25 March 2007"," A haunting, melancholy fable
","As flawless a fusion of fantasy and reality as any in recent times, Guillermo del Toro's labour of love grabs the audience's attention from the start and doesn't release it until long after the film is over.<br/><br/>In the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, the young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) comes with her pregnant mother to live with her new stepfather (Sergi Lopez), a sadistic captain in Franco's army, which scours the woods around her fresh home to kill and torture republican rebels.<br/><br/>Terrified and appalled by this new world around her, Ofelia retreats into her books and a fantasy world filled with mysterious insects, magic portals, terrifying apparitions and a gruff faun, who tells her she must complete three tasks if she is to reclaim her place as a princess in a faraway land.<br/><br/>Visually beguiling, entrancing in narrative and heartbreaking in its themes, this is very much a fairy tale of the old school, and is definitely not one for kids  although it certainly has powerful messages for audiences about the way children are affected by the adult world around them. As horrible though Ofelia's fantasy world sometimes is, it is dwarfed by the drab reality of the outside world, and it's perhaps that which lends to one to think of it as an Alcie in Wonderland for modern times.<br/><br/>Part fantasy, part history and part horror, the filmmakers have made this film with passion and it shows - from del Toro's rich visuals to the convincing and memorable performances. <br/><br/>The film has its perfect counterpart in the score, with haunting and memorable melodies, a breath of danger and a pervading sadness. Like Pan's Labyrinth, it will remain in your mind and heart when the theatre has long since faded into distant memory."

","I have probably seen this film a month ago, and even today, I couldn't believe that I've seen this movie, at the same day than the Oscars. And even to that, It was quite a coincidence that this picture was at the same time, nominated in the category for best foreign film. And the damn thing didn't won, every instant and frame of this movie deserved the Oscar for best foreign picture. Guillaurmo Del Toro deserve the little golden man, and was robbed of it.<br/><br/>Oh well, if you don't have the money to buy the people, who gives out the Oscars, well you don't have much a statuette to begin with, in having it used as a door-stop. And when you got too much Oscars, well you got a decent coat rack, just right there; but I wouldn't think every actor in H'Wood would have competent welding skills. <br/><br/>How can I begin, with this surrealistic and imaginary masterpiece ? It's treatment of the fantastic genre is not like what I've seen before in any picture, and it would be more scarce in Hollywood for that matter, even. Del Toro's masterful film, who is unrelated to Benicio Del Toro by the way, is an ode to Scandinavian and European mythology, in discussing Pan, and every monster contained. The settings are breathtakingly amazing, and what's better, the feeling of Spain is at most of a feeling of Fascist Italy, in the major setting of World War II. It is so much of a take on the fairy tale genre, that it delves into the human psyche. And mostly , it's this kind of fairy- taledness that blends in with horror and thus quite uniquely. Well not that much uniquely, you can also look at The Company of Wolves, by Neil Jordan, made in the 80's.<br/><br/>You cannot find much of a hybrid genre that fairy-tale and horror, as well as Pan's Labyrinth. Terry Gilliam's The Brothers Grimm also works in the same flavor, which in the script mixes in the original authors of the children's books, into the horrors of their own creations. And it's also a perfect blend of horror and comedy, that comes with a keen sens of timing. <br/><br/>The form and the aesthetic of this movie, is more than just simply gorgeous; it is keen, submersive, and aptly done, giving the sense that there was a Spanish Edgar Poe taking the helm of it. And you can really understand why, that the director of photography won the Oscar for Best Photography. The storytelling is simply very unique, which mixes the most abject of cruelty of man against man like a Dario Argento psycho-slasher flick, into the universe of make-believe. After seeing it, it may seem to you that it is very paradoxes, but that is part of the whole intention of Del Toro. <br/><br/>In this paradox, he wants to give the sens of a psycho-slasher attacking the world of fairy-tale, quite explicitly as this one. <br/><br/>When you come to think it ? What would happen if you made a movie that was a fairy tale, and it would've been made by Sam Peckinpah. You would probably think of an action film, mixing with the characters of D&D."

","First of all, I was never really a fan of Guillermo Del Toro, aware of his fanboy film pedigree - though I thought Blade 2 was exquisitely shot (never heard, never saw, never previewed much of Hellboy)... yet it is nice to see his effusive unflinching surrealistic touch in this fairy tale that juxtapouses both the magical, the gritty and the cruel.<br/><br/>For some reason the ending reminded me of The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe (though it is a VERY different ending), and as director Alfonso Cuaron (CHILDREN OF MEN) would state, this may also very well be a sister film to both his latest, and that of Alejandro Inarittu's BABEL, not because they are made by Spanish directors - but they ultimately reflect the theme of human weakness and limitation, and a striving for freedom and understanding.<br/><br/>No comprendo español, bien pero, none of that matters, because the themes of these 3 films transcend language barriers, and like BABEL and CHILDREN OF MEN, I won't hesitate recommending EL LABYRINTO DEL FAUNO to anyone."

The music is slow and sad, perfect for the movie.

"nycritic","10","2","5","6 March 2007"," Guillermo del Toro's Dark Fantasy
","A stunning story drenched in symbolism (that may get somewhat lost in translation for anyone unfamiliar with Spain and/or Spanish culture), this is a gorgeous, lush dark fable that deftly intertwines myth and reality, illusion and bleakness, despair and hope, horror and ecstasy in such an intricate fashion it becomes virtually impossible to distinguish when one story begins and when one end. That in itself is a feat, because so many times the disparity of two different worlds, or two time periods, or two opposing story lines that dovetail at a singular event somewhere within the fabric can present roughness in its seams and look shabby -- almost sloppy. It's the delicate line that Peter Jackson traversed in his epic translation of J. R. R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"", to make a story detailed yet fluid, and it's one that Guillermo del Toro walks with tremendous ease -- he practically flits through his stories with the ease of the fairies that he devotes so much time to. And what a story this is: one that deserves to be seen over and over again, one which owes a bit to Victor Erice's EL ESPIRITU DE LA COLMENA, another bit to Stephen King's novel ""Rose Madder"", yet another bit to THE WIZARD OF OZ. This is true lyricism in the deepest sense of the word, delicate yet unbreakable in its faith, haunting, hallucinating, and lovely like the blooming flower at the end."

Most of the movie is not violent, and you can pretty much tell when the ugly parts are coming.<br/><br/>I wondered how a movie could be both violent and a sweet fantasy, and how the light and dark moments would come together. But they do.<br/><br/>You can understand how a good mother might be willing to suspend disbelief in order to become involved with a man who turns out to be a total brute so that she can escape the hand-to-mouth existence that she and her daughter had been living since her husband's death.<br/><br/>You can understand the girl's desire to escape her mother's decline and her stepfather's brutishness. Is she really the long-lost princess of an underground world? Are the fairies real? What is real? I was never quite certain.<br/><br/>Onc criticism I would levy is that it seemed that the movie was making a good guy/bad guy, two-sided war out of what was a very complicated, many-sided war full of treachery on the right and the left.

","Writer director Guillermo Del Toro is the most accomplished fantasist in contemporary cinema, a master creator of images, atmosphere and mood who uses his visionary's gifts to do what others can not: make imaginary worlds seem more real than reality itself. With this film, Del Toro has made his most accomplished film to date, a work set in the two parallel worlds, the cold , brutal one of Spain in 1944 and an equally disturbing alternative universe that a serious 10-year old girl named Ofelia stumbles upon behind an old mill. This dark and disturbing fairy tale for adults has been thought out to the ninth degree and resonates with the irresistible inevitability of a timeless myth. With Mirabel Verdu, Sergi Lopes, Ivana Baquiero and Doug Jones. In Spanish with Enlgish subtitles."
"kyrat","8","2","5","20 February 2007"," Open to interpretation - which makes it even better.
","I was very impressed by this film and how many different ways it can be read/experienced. It is indefinable even by genre or plot (is it a war film, coming of age, fantasy, etc.) I made the mistake (as many) by thinking this was just a dark fantasy/fairy tale. I actually mistook the title to be a reference to Pandora's Box (not the god Pan) - since the preview I saw showed a young girl opening a box and some kind of dark spirits coming out. While watching the film I couldn't help but also reference other stories. Ofelia/Ophelia (of Shakespeare's Hamlet), driven mad by politics and deaths. Ofelia's Alice in Wonderland-like dress & frock and how she descends into the alternate world. The faun was portrayed ambiguously at first and the cloven-hooved animal asking for a sacrifice conjured up Christianity's portrayals of Satan.<br/><br/>One's background/beliefs in mythology, religion and the time they grow up in can very easily influence how you perceive this film.<br/><br/>I've read nearly 200 comments on IMDb and everyone has different interpretations/experiences. The fantasy world can be read as real or imagined. (though I thought the scene where the captain sees her talking in the maze kind of ruined the ambiguity.) The ending can be read in different ways.<br/><br/>Even people's comparisons to other films/directors varies across the board (Takashi Miike, Ridley Scott, Miyzaki, Gilliam, Henson, Neil Jordan, Tim Burton, Etc.). People have mention the film is comparable to other films""Spirited Away"", ""Life is Beautiful"" ""Company of Wolves"" ""Alice in Wonderland"" etc.<br/><br/>I personally saw a parallel to another film showing the horrors of war & its aftermath ""A Very Long Engagement"". I thought the combination of imagination and belief vs. bitter reality of warfare was similar. As with ""AVLEngagment"", I thought the war scenes in this film were both stylized enough to be interesting to watch and bloody enough to be realistic. I dislike gore, I dislike GRATUITOUS violence, but I would have been disappointed if it had been too sanitized and unrealistic. This was not some horror flick where some people watch gratuitous bloodshed for FUN. Yes I had to cringe & look away, but I hope that scenes of torture and killing *would* make me do so.<br/><br/>This brings me to the social commentary on today's world - where our country is heading towards fascism (with the removal of our civil rights) and those who dare to question and refuse to blindly obey are condemned as traitors ""giving aid to terrorists"". I thought the speech by the doctor about not being able to blindly ""obey"" as the single best moment in the film. This was not just a film about fascism then, it's a film about fascism today - so take heed.<br/><br/>Despite the warnings -- people can be selfish and refuse to listen and will pluck at those grapes thinking no one can see them or that it can't hurt to take a small step down that road....<br/><br/>All in all a stunningly gorgeous film - the red of the food at the table of temptations, the eyeless creature itself -- not too much CGI (which too me can ruin a film). The acting was superb by all and I thought the main characters were fleshed out fairly well. (I particularly liked the Captain's obsession with time -- for me that scene of him annoyed at the late arrival of the cars & obsession with his watch - conjured thoughts of Italy under Mussolini where (supposedly) the trains always ran on time). <br/><br/>I would highly recommend it to all adults (it is Rated R after all).<br/><br/>p.s. I was hoping for more commentary about the symbolism in the film -- what is the eyeless creature she unleashed? why did she pick another lock than the one the fairies pointed to? is the mandrake root in milk & blood something from folklore? (The mandrake root reminded me of a Czech film ""Otesanek"" where this childless couple adopt a root that becomes their baby)."
"pf9","9","2","5","18 February 2007"," A Kafka of the Silver Screen
","Guided by his unmatched imagination, and masterfully using the German language as his tool, the thirty-two year old Franz Kafka has written ""Metamorphosis"", one of the deepest and most absorbing tales of world literature, devoted to a description of the artist's position in bourgeois society. Guided by a seemingly no less spectacular imagination, and a thorough mastery of modern cinematographic techniques, the forty-two year old Mexican director Guillermo del Toro has given us a magnificent, rich and multi-layered movie about the horrors of the Spanish Civil war.<br/><br/>Exposed to these horrors without any protection, a young girl tries to cope, by creating a parallel fiction-world of her own, in which she has a degree of control over the magical happenings. Like in all fairy tales, she is subjected to difficult ""tests"", while during the civil war the Spanish nation as a whole endures difficult ""trials"". The director cuts back and forth seamlessly between these two worlds, and while the spectator is under the impression of watching two stories unfold, one ""real"", the other fictional, they are more or less the same story, and in this very original manner, Mr. del Toro, with supreme artistry, paints a picture that, more fully than one would have thought possible, captures the finest nuances of human suffering.<br/><br/>In spite of the horrors they depict, the special effects during the fantasy sequences are of a rare artistry and conjure up images of Francisco de Goya's masterpiece ""Saturn Devouring One of His Children"", and somewhat surprisingly of the great American photographer Joel-Peter Witkin's ""Feast of Fools.""<br/><br/>At a deeper level, this movie manages to add a new insight into the fundamental and by now well-explored topic of the relationship between reality and fiction. In ""El Laberinto del Fauno"" reality and fiction are not each other's reflections, or extensions, but rather together they give an understanding that neither history nor art by itself could come close to conveying."
"pnarco","10","2","5","18 February 2007"," Often hard to watch but ultimately very rewarding and powerful
","This movie is pretty brilliant, I would say that it is a great movie, including a quite excellent performance by the male lead (villain) who the producers cautioned the director would not be able to deliver the role. Boy were they wrong. He deserves an award for his performance. Much of it was pretty brutal and rather hard to sit there and watch but I was very glad to have seen this. I was really glad that the filmmakers had the good taste to cut away at some points and didn't show on screen some things that happened in the story.<br/><br/>It concerns a gruesome battle going on between fascist forces in Spain and resistance forces circa 1940's I think, and in the midst of this is a little girl who gets involved in a rich fantasy world of magic and monsters. It is a rather intense, emotionally powerful, enchanting and violent movie. A dark fantasy.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is about many things and works on many different levels, but for me it seemed to be showing that in brutal, desperate times as in the story, some people will follow orders without question so that they can sort of save their own hides for a time, while others will do the compassionate, right things for others around them, even if it means giving up their own life and die with their moral boots on. And it suggest that maybe there is a higher system of things that is testing us to see what side of that line we will fall on and who we really are under such circumstances. A brilliant movie."
"Global_Marketing_Pros","10","2","5","17 February 2007"," Struggle of Life and Liberty and Love of Both
","This movie is very excellent in different cinematic forms. The plot itself is well mirrored in how the struggle of a man's life is patron to the struggle of life of his country. The young girl as a growing child has unknown future with her destiny, in some cases as with the ideology of most young children they wish to become princess and princes. <br/><br/>As a charming passionate romance to be played with this plot like the accompany of a well strung instrument the adopted wife is also set in a life struggle with giving birth. Somewhat with how government accepts the life of new administration and new principles. Difficult changes but never-the-less giving birth. <br/><br/>What is human life but a struggle against hunger, what is liberty but a struggle against poor discipline against laws in society. Hence the use of food and medical supplies as a necessity of both the revolution and under the stern discipline of El Capitan is equally symbolic as both of their ability to have a military discipline to obtain and use. One side as the rebels and the other as the government authority. <br/><br/>The child who could become princess is earnest in conducting a quest or a journey. Where she needs to obey orders as if she were in the military of a magic kingdom. As most children she is not observant to details such as the stone she found on the road when coming to the mill which looks like a puzzle piece. But in fact it is the ""Eye"" of a past totem, which is a sign of the Gods from her magic kingdom. She is fortunate to have a fairy guide her who looks out for her welfare, although she may not fully understand the stone totem or stone inscriptions. Just must be careful, very careful. Using chalky residue can open many doors some good some evil just as with the golden key found from the experience with the magic toad. Why she trusts the cloven messenger or the box that the golden key opens is truly a leap of faith. As a child's innocence leads her this must also have lead her to the correct door on the left as when she exhumed the knife with her income hand by its blade. <br/><br/>The rest is of little more than thrills from not heading the warnings to not eat or drink, for this would be torture in real life. But as the fascist warrior of her stepfather may symbolize a real terror tale of torture does exist. But this is another story not for the ears of an innocent child who seeks to become a Princess. The Peekaboo monster only guards the secret doors based on the trustworthiness, honesty, and good will that those who seek treasure may income pass. <br/><br/>This brings a climax to the magic of both the medicine root and trustworthy nature of any guardian. Guardians of children and citizens alike. To draw blood a life giving force what are the consequences. A few drops for a medicinal root to bring birth of the new child or a few lives to preserve the body of government. Guardians hold dear to them the essence of their existence. Thus the contradicting duality of sacrifice to preserve. This contradiction brings to life the essence of climax between being a good guardian and evil. Thus, the evil parent kills the child who would be Princess. <br/><br/>Only in the land of make believe can she be protected as the Princess by the King and Queen and fairy and cloven spiritual guide."

Especially from young Ivana Baquero, as Ofelia, and from Sergi Lopez, as Captain Vidal. The story is engaging, rich and imaginative.

"John_Q_Citizen","Null","2","5","14 February 2007"," A Beautiful, Grotesque, and Thrilling Film From Guillermo Del Toro
","(This Review Contains No Spoilers) Ofelia and her mother, Carmen, are moving into the middle of a war-ravages Spain. Carmen, recently married to a sadistic Captain Vidal, is mistreated by her husband and worries for her daughter. Ofelia soon finds a magical world full of horrifyingly beautiful creatures to escape her reality. Here, though, she has control over her destiny. She meets Pan the Faun, played by Doug Jones, who charges her to undertake a journey throughout this weird, beautiful world. She meets many a strange creature, including the Pale Man (also played by Jones). Meanwhile, Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez) tortures prisoners and continually mistreats Carmen.<br/><br/>When this was premiered at Cannes, it received a much-deserved twenty-two minutes of applause. This film has been universally praised as Guillermo Del Toro's masterpiece, and rightfully so. It's eerie, violent, captivating, and thrilling. It's an adult fairytale with some real scares to be had--not just from the wonderfully disturbing creatures in Ofelia's world, but from the horribly sadistic Captain Vidal. A more menacing on-screen villain you will not find easily.<br/><br/>The performances in the film are wonderful, particularly from Sergi Lopez who radiates so much menace that it is truly frightening at times. Ivana Baquero, playing Ofelia, performs perfectly in her role. Ofelia is scared, yet brave at times. She has a destiny that she can control in her magical world. Ariadna Gil who plays Carmen gives the role a perfect amount of fright and gullibility, amplifying the menace from Lopez. Doug Jones makes me wonder how incredibly difficult it must've been to make this--communicating in a language you do not know, making sure that you know your opposite acting partner's lines, and being placed in a costume with no eye cut-outs. That sounds like so much fun. But, he makes it work. Wonderfully.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is mystical and tear-inducing at times. It adds so much to the atmosphere of the movie that it's not even funny. The cinematography is beautiful and dark and perfect for a fantasy-movie. Much like Lord of the Rings, it utilizes big camera moves in small, personal stages, yet not overdoing it.<br/><br/>Lastly, but not least, would be Guillermo Del Toro. A more visually twisted and creative man you might not find. Thank God that cab driver found him and returned his notebook. Otherwise, there might be no Pan's Labrynth.<br/><br/>The violence in the film is graphic and the creatures are scary. It is amazingly memorable and I suggest you not take your young ones to see this--it's for grown-ups. Still, it's very much worth it.<br/><br/>Normally I would assign a score but you can't score this movie. No score would do it justice."
"VincentBauer","10","2","5","12 February 2007"," A dark fantasy tale...
","Writer/Director Guillermo Del Toro is one of the many Mexican directors that have a great sense of story telling in a movie. Pan's Labyrinth is one of the few films these days that have originality.<br/><br/>The story takes place in post-Spanish-war-Spain is about a girl named Ofelia whose passion is the world of fantasy. She lives, breathes and eats it. She goes with her mother to live with her Stepfather the vicious Captain Vidal who will kill anyone who questions him and his will. She has no choice to live with him as her mother is carrying his child. Vidal also despises Ofelia's fairy tales as they have no point and are unintelligent. Ofelia's only other friend in the place is the housemaid Mercedes who is a spy for the guerrillas. Ofelia is dragged one night to a labyrinth which is inhabited by a faun named Pan. He tells her that she is a princess and to gain her throne she must accomplish three tasks before the full moon.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Vidal continues to try and hunt down the guerrillas and as his madness grows we see just how much of a monster he can be. It becomes clear that Ofelia's only escape is through her fantasy world and her tasks. To try and regrow a tree by putting stones in a toads mouth. To get an object from the realm of the pale man who eats children, and another that I must not spoil.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is an amazing fairy tale that is not like Del Toro, yet this one shows how much creativity and vision in his movies that he has. Some may argue that the ending is too tragic, while others would say it's happy. I like to say it's both as Pan's Labyrinth makes you think what is real and what isn't.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth 10/10"
"PortugalOle7","10","2","5","12 February 2007"," One of the best of 06'; truly magical!
","I had not heard much about this film before going to see it. Word of mouth was it was fascinating and it was hailed as one of the top films of 2006. I can say that not only is it one of the best, but probably the best.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of a young girl named Ofelia, who goes to live with her pregnant mother in the countryside home of a Spanish Captain, who her mother has recently married. The Captain is a cruel man who wants little to do with Ofelia and her mother, but directs more attention to the unborn child. Going on around them is the fascist rebellion of the 1940s. To cope with her morbid surroundings Ofelia let's her love for fantasy tales and active imagination take her on a journey. In the garden of the home, is a labyrinth which provides Ofelia with the basis for her magical world.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro has created a fairytale that is more graphic and darker than normal, hence the R rating. It does show that you can tell a tale of fantasy that doesn't necessarily pertain to children, which is different from the norm being that the main character is an adolescent. The balance between the two worlds is perfectly achieved by del Toro. The special effects are excellent and so is the beautiful cinematography. Ivana Baquero who plays little Ofelia is also a joy.<br/><br/>This film is a delight for those who have maybe lost faith in the magic of movies."

However, from what I saw the girl that played Ofelia was excellent. I want to see this movie again and it is on my DVD wish list for must owns. If you are a little skeptical about it, still give it a chance. Oh and also, it is not for children, there is a lot of violence, if you brought your kid they may cry. Do not bring your kid."

Our imaginations can take us to special places and today as the years pass parents are taking away the imagination of children. They want them to face reality at a young age, and I believe that's cruel. We should never loose our imagination because as the movie tells us its a cruel world and imagination makes it a little sweet so life doesn't taste too bitter.<br/><br/>The music was on of the things I liked about the movie, but what the director of photography also did an excellent job, and lets not forget Ivana Baquero. She did an amazing performance and not only by her but by everyone. Congratulations to Guillermo del Toro and his crew."

","I just saw this movie this afternoon. Me and my husband were 2 of the 4 people in the whole theater. I guess it's been out longer than I thought...I also was surprised by this movie, I went in only having seen one preview for it on TV awhile back and remember it looked pretty good. I wasn't aware it was in Spanish, but that's cool. Many great movies are NOT spoken in English. The City of Lost Children is one that comes to mind. Anyway, this movie was probably one of the saddest movies that I have ever seen, I almost cried 4-5 different times. I was of the impression it was more on the fantasy side. A great film none the less. Terribly sad, but NOT every movie made is upbeat. (Just think of the band The Cure, sadness can be wonderful). :D"

","Pan's Labrynith is a wonderful movie, it definitely gives the viewer another look at fairy tales. I believe the previews for this movie said ""Where Fairy Tales believe in themselves"" that phrase alone gives this movie justice. And although I did watch it through my fingers I would see this movie again and for those who are planning on seeing this movie I suggest watching it in Spanish with subtitles. This helps give the movie it's whole effect. Taking a friend along wouldn't hurt, you'll definitely want someone to talk with afterwards. All in all this movie is unlike any other, it is original. Lastly, I don't think young children should watch this movie due to horrific scenes and creepy creatures but perhaps this movies nature is in the eye of the beholder."
"mikewilson83","8","2","5","5 February 2007"," Mostly Fantastic, with a few small downfalls.
","OK, I went to see Pan's Labarynth the other night, and I must say that I was extremely impressed for the most part. I went there expecting to see a film with a few bleak references to the Spanish Civil War (at the start and end) but for the most part the young girl enters a fantasy world and stays there. What I did end up seeing I found was much more interesting.<br/><br/>Pan's Labarynth is 60% a war film, and as I am someone who HATES war films (with the exception of Apocalypse Now, Full Metal Jacket and 3 Kings) from Saving Private Ryan to Platoon they're all exactly the same to me! However, this was different. The characters are so engaging and the plot so thick you can't help but be hooked on every moment. It is also not some pretentious director/script writer showing off how much he knows about a certain war and over complicating it with references that only someone with a history degree would get. It is kept simple, down to a few characters and tells of the events of 1 small part of a revolution.<br/><br/>The fantasy element of this film was also much more engaging than I expected. Unlike Labarynth, Mirror Mask etc. here the girl is forced to undergo these tasks and meet these creatures alongside her real everyday life, and we see the effects that it has on her everyday life and how she grows as a character through this, this also adds a much more human element to this film.<br/><br/>I can see why some people may find the characters a little 1 dimensional (everyone seems to be either pure good or evil) but I couldn't help but fall in love with each and every 1 of them. The character design is spot on, especially the Faun (who I only found out from reading the synopsis on the internet is Pan, there is actually no reference to him being called Pan in the film whatsoever) he appears to be a good guy, however has a slightly sinister look about him that you just don't know whether to trust.<br/><br/>The violence is also spot on, for a lot of this film it may as well have been a kids film, but you get so engrossed in the fantasy of it all that you could be a child watching in awe, and suddenly there is a hard hitting scene of brutal violence to remind you of the reality of this situation (particularly the captain repeatedly bottling a man's face in, and Mercedes slicing the captain's cheek open from the mouth!)<br/><br/>Now for it's downfalls; I didn't think that the girl's challenges were challenging enough. The toad, from what I could see, was absolutely no threat to her. Had she not have eaten the grape in the cave, the creature would have lay dormant posing no threat to her. As there was no real challenge to these tasks they were over with quite quickly, and therefore, so was another fantasy scene, and her final challenge didn't even take part in a fantasy scene. (I know anything more would have lengthened the running time, but this was a film I could watch all day).<br/><br/>Secondly, I don't think the captain really got his comeuppance. Let's not forget that this was an extremely evil man who made people live in fear of him and tortured many innocent people to death! I couldn't wait for his final scene throughout the film, expecting a long drawn out horrible painful death, only to see him just get shot in the head! Once! Which was the only other part I didn't think really cut it.<br/><br/>Overall I would say that this film is about escapism. A young girl lives day to day in the chaos of war, evil, suffering and misery with only her books to help her dream of something better. She finally gets the chance to live a better life and it's not in our world because you cannot trust our world. I find this beautiful!"

"jp_011205","9","2","5","1 February 2007"," Film-making at Its Best
","Of all the films released in 2006, none is more intriguing than Guillermo del Toro's 'Pan's Labyrinth'. Illustrating a refined tale wrapped in drama, filled with fantasy, & sprinkled with just a hint of horror, it proves to be film-making at its best.<br/><br/>Set in the year 1944 during postwar regression in Spain, 'Pan's Labyrinth' centers around a young girl named Ofelia. In order to escape her daunting and misery-filled everyday life, she creates a fictitious world containing diverse creatures and total wonderment. It's in this place she must follow the path she herself paves that will free her from the troubles of the real world.<br/><br/>It's not very often we see a film such as 'Pan's Labyrinth'. It combines the innocence of 'Alice in Wonderland' with the essence of 'Donnie Darko'. The end result is a fairytale simple enough for children to grasp, yet riveting enough for adults to thoroughly enjoy. Not once during it did I come to find myself weary or uninterested. The story told here tickles the mind with its genuinely captivating aura almost to the point of mesmerism.<br/><br/>Although the fantastic imagery and guidance from del Toro aid in its greatness, the biggest disappointment 'Pan's Labyrinth' bears is one it shares with many of this years other films. Once again the acting comes up short. Most notably with Maribel Verdu who plays Mercedes, the woman who tries to shelter and protect Ofelia. It's obvious she's trying her hardest, but unfortunately she just isn't able to deliver a sincere and overall convincing performance. However, this setback barely, if at all, takes away appeal from this stunning film.<br/><br/>I must warn parents though, this isn't a film I would recommend taking the kids to see. Yes, it is indeed a fairytale, but it's not suited for children. It is after all rated R for a reason, that being for violence and a bit of language. I do though highly recommend it to any adult looking for an original and worthwhile film. So go ahead and enter Pan's Labyrinth. You'll be glad you did."

"deacon_blues-1","9","2","5","28 January 2007"," Should be nominated for a BP Oscar!
","This film is exquisitely conceived and executed. I went to it fearing disappointment because of all the superlatives I'd heard applied to it beforehand, but it knocked me over! Visually and as great storytelling, del Toro has really done it! What a wonderful adventure on so many levels, full of charm, horror, deep sadness, tragedy, and abundant life! The Captain is both hatefully evil and fascinating at once. The little girl is heartrending in her courage, imagination, discernment of character, and persistence in doing what her heart knows is right, regardless of what Pan or her stepfather tells her. Surely, if ""Life is beautiful"" can take an American academy award nomination for best picture, this film is equally deserving, both for its craftsmanship and its gift of hope and courage in the face of the general brutality of the human condition, rather than merely being recognized in the ""foreign"" category. I won't burden you at length with my frustrations over the academy's tendencies lately (that is, its snobbishly unfair backlash that has besotted it ever since the 3 years it was forced to ""endure"" the onslaught of Peter Jackson and his unfashionably epic Tolkien films!) but this is just another symptom of what's wrong with the academy lately. Very few really deserving films actually get recognized anymore, unless they have a strong left-wing, morally ambiguous or iconoclastic bias. Alas!"

","This movie is chocked full of the things that make a great story! You've got symbolism, heroism, war, fantasy, grit, honor, escapism, survival, life, and death. The acting is superb! Like all great actors, the stars of Pan's Labyrinth allow you to go on the journey without having to critique bad performances. Not since our introduction to the genius of Dakota Fanning, has another young actor delivered such a performance. Fans of the Harry Potter books will be refreshed by the depiction of such a visual story however, Pan's Labyrinth is even further from a children's fantasy than the Potter series. The dark and gritty reality of the adults world is contrasted by the fantasy world of the young. This movie is a study of life's balances and contrasts. It is a masterful representation of the mind's battle between fantasy and reality!"
"Polaris_DiB","7","2","5","24 January 2007"," Great story with some minor poor decisions.
","Warning: this review is a discussion fraught with spoilers. Please don't read it if you don't want key elements of the plot given away to you.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro has brought us another story along the archetypal ""lonely bookworm uses fantasy to escape horrors of reality"" arch, but has brought it to a stunning new level. Within is the typical orphaned life, evil stepmother (stepfather...), and classic fantasy images such as fauns and fairies, but set in fascist Spain, it is also an extreme example of the power of hope within horrendous evil.<br/><br/>It's a beautiful and stunning movie for the most part. The characters are mostly engaging and I love the detail in the character animation. Some of the violence is very harrowing, especially in a movie about a subject most people associate with children's entertainment, and the movie is rather effective in many ways at taking one's breath away.<br/><br/>I have a couple problems with it, though, mostly as it pertains to some of the decisions made by the characters. First of all...<br/><br/>1) When in a fantasy/fairytale situation where someone tells you not to eat the food... don't eat the food. As in, when a creepy faceless monster guy is sitting at the table and you haven't seen the food prepared, DON'T EAT THE FOOD. There was really no reason for her to either. Del Toro could have had the same action sequence when she opens the wrong door instead, and that would have put greater impact with her decision at the end to disobey anyway. What would have made a much stronger impact, I think, would be if she opened the wrong door, retrieved that knife, the monster awoke, she barely escapes, and the the Faun gets upset with her because she didn't listen to the fairies, making her decision at the end to protect her brother an even more important thing. Instead, for really no reason shown within the film at all, she has to eat the food. NO REASON. She's familiar with fairy tales, she should know better. I know it's her imagination we're dealing with here, but she should still know better.<br/><br/>2) When in a violent situation where you've just stabbed someone evil and need to escape, kill him! She already showed her lack of hesitation in hurting him, she had complete control over the situation, and she needed to get rid of him in order to have more time to escape before being found out. Instead she gives some weak warning about the little girl and nearly gets captured anyway. Stupid stupid stupid. And no, she did NOT know his warning to kill the little girl if anything happened, so she couldn't act upon that knowledge.<br/><br/>3) Why is the little girl's mother attracted to this guy in the first place? That was never answered satisfactorily to me.<br/><br/>Other than those (some may call them) nitpicks, this movie was great. I for one wouldn't mind owning it when it comes out on DVD, and I'd still recommend people go to see it.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"
"cutter23","9","2","5","24 January 2007"," Is it real?
","Seldom will you find a movie that can authentically run the gamut of emotions, and do so in a believable way. Set in Spain during World War II the movie begins with a young Ofelia and her pregnant mother making their way to rural Spain to live with Ofelia's new stepfather, a brutal army captain and Nazi sympathizer. Ofelia, an avid fantasy and fiction reader and enthusiast, is drawn to an ancient stone labyrinth behind her new home, a military fort established in an old wood mill. Believing herself to be the lost princess of an underground kingdom she sets off on a three part quest to verify her origins by the next full moon, guided by a large faun and three small faeries.<br/><br/>The only complaint that I can really argue is my personal disdain for reading a movie. I personally cannot stand subtitles. I believe that the guerrilla rebels in the film, commoners fighting the Captain from their hillside hideaways, could have had more character development. But their purpose is limited, and only made to contrast the authoritarian brutality of the Captain. That being said, this movie is wonderful. Seldom can you find a movie that will allow the viewer to so strongly empathize with a character, but it is absolutely unavoidable for the viewer not to feel the world through Ofelia. The acting on all fronts is so superb in this adult fairy tale that in the end we are left wondering, was it real, or was it not"

I also didn't find a good way to connect with any of the characters.<br/><br/>I normally love fantasy and science fiction movies, but this one just didn't do it for me. It felt like a cross between The Muppet Show and Hellraiser. I'd rather see Kermit the Frog any day."

I'd say that takes up about 12 minutes of the whole movie, which is really unsatisfying if that's what you've come to see.<br/><br/>For what it is though, it's a decent movie. Over the top violent but that seems to be the whole point of a girl trying to escape it all.<br/><br/>There were a couple ""WHY DID (or DIDN'T) YOU DO THAT!?"" moments while watching.

Do not make any assumptions about what you're going to see based on your experience of past fantasy films.<br/><br/>It's also extremely bleak. If you'd like to watch a similar story that's less like being repeatedly struck in the face by a hammer, I'd suggest watching ""MirrorMask"" on DVD instead.<br/><br/>Great creature effects, though (barring the fake-looking CGI fairies).

","This film didn't necessarily surpass my expectations, but it's what kept me on my seat in the theaters. To call it completely weird would be an understatement - but I'm glad it was more unique than other films. The story simply showcases the vivid imagination of children in a very hostile background (Spain post-WWII). Every scene was spectacular, and the reason why this film got the reviews it did was because it was unorthodox in storytelling.<br/><br/>I can't give away the story and describe it in detail because this film is best watched than explained.

"Galldora","9","2","5","29 December 2006"," What makes this a good movie?
","This is one of the most commonly asked questions we find ourselves posed to answer and defend. The simplest answer I can provide is based in an abstract concept which is if I'm already thinking about seeing it again before the movie has even reached the end credits. That was definitely the case with Pan's Labyrinth. This film breaks the mold in the way that we are given a taste of the supernatural in conjunction with the harsh reality of how brutal human beings can be. The movie is just as much reality as it is fantasy, and that fantasy aspect is just as cold as the reality of it; which seems to have caused both love of the film as well as criticisms. I would implore anyone to go into this film with an openness to being left without any warm fuzzy feelings because they will not be found here. This film demands a lot of its viewers but mostly it asks them to leave behind thinking that the supernatural and fantastical depicted in a film has to be overflowing with computer generated effects, lathered in a rich coating of Hollywood sheer and shine to make a worthwhile film. The storytelling is enthralling to a degree that many otherwise entertaining films lose underneath their slick veneer. The characters are enchanting without losing the real sense of the human element. It's been less than twenty-four hours since I saw the film for the first time, and I'm having a hard time thinking about much else. I found it transcendent and encapsulating. For anyone resistant to seeing it due to the subtitles, I can say honestly by the midpoint of the film, the language no longer seemed something I didn't understand; and the voice of the Faun (Pan) is so mesmerizing that it would have lost something dubbed in English. Is it brutal? Yes. Is it disturbing? Yes. Is it a fairy tale? Absolutely; A true fairy tale in every respect. It certainly is not for everyone, but I truly think many people that are unsure of seeing it would find that they really love it. In summation then; if you are looking for the next Hollywood blockbuster with a skyrocketed budget loaded with breath taking special effects; skip this one. However, if you want a disturbing little trip down the rabbit hole of those things on the fringes of reality, go see this film."

","Well, I didn't give it a score of 10, after all, I need to build-in some reserve for a yet better film... I went to see this film together with my wife and youngest son of 18. We were all, including my thumb-twitching gaming video-freak son, extremely impressed by this movie. For myself, it's the best ""Spanish"" film I've ever seen (and that includes ""Volver""). Any one considering seeing this ""fantasy"" story with young children should firmly and forever ban such thought from her/his mind: the fantasy portion acts to augment, to provide ""volume"" to the sheer horror, the fairy-tale serves to further develop the story of the actual, hyper-realistic, and unspeakably brutal real-life events the adult actors in this drama are consciously experiencing. A reviewer on this forum has written that Spain was, in 1944, at war. It was -technically- not. The civil war had ended back in 1939, Spain had been ""liberated"" in it's entirety, and the army was only kept mopping-up ""communist and anarchist"" resistance in the mountains... In fact, the result of the Franco's liberation is clear for all to see in this film, which portrays the mentality of the Franco regime's ""liberators"" as realistically as any I've read in a number of serious historical works, Franco biographies and novels treating the subject. Absolutely chilling, this civil war and the first decade thereafter, brutal terror, murder, hunger. The fact that this young girl would -superficially- appear to belong to the elite (sorry that car was a Rolls-Royce and not an Hispano-Suiza, as would have been far more correct in Spain) did not take away the incredibly uncomfortable situation she was in: her father dead, and her mother involved with this all too believable Falangist type (in fact so typical for the nineteen-thirties in Europe). The ""spirit of the age"", the Fascism, the shadow of the war, all these things a young girl cannot comprehend other than in terms of a fantasy story hinting of how this -good- kid might, somehow, avert the overpowering forces of doom, of disaster which she experiences and senses all around her. And she fails, too. The only ""happy ending"" that could possible be construed is that, in physically dying, she rejoins her dead father and mother... This film joins Spanish history and literature in unveiling the dark side of Spain, the side not associated with fiestas, allegría and tapas. Wonderful, great film. But I'm not a poet, and that dark side is all too overwhelming, sad and worrying. Sergi Lopez has, once again, demonstrated that he is the greatest living ""French"" actor (he's very active in French cinema),and the fact that he is Spanish is so very, very ironic..."

","Like most people who had heard the rumours about how good this film was and had seen the trailer I anticipated an extremely good film. However I had my doubts about the story, and whether it would prove to be too complex or confusing but also whether Del Toro would be able to sow fantasy and reality together enough for me to believe it. Based on some of the reviews I have read on here there are a few doubters, but personally and speaking as a fan of magical realism, fantasy, myth, and faerie story I can say that my fears were unfounded and my senses were mesmerised. This film is what cinema is all about because it brings to life a very well written script before your eyes and will leave you thinking and feeling the film for a great deal of time after it is finished. The effects shots in particular are incredible with an array of monsters and shadowy sets that leave the viewer breathless before even a word is uttered. I have not until this point considered watching many of the films of Del Toro, but following this I feel compelled to look at his career with closer scrutiny."
"saturnalia33","9","2","5","11 December 2006"," A gem of a movie
","Pan's Labyrinth seems like quite a left-field film for director Guillermo del Toro, who is responsible for such recent Hollywood popcorn as Hellboy and Blade II. However, it's not the first time he has used the Spanish Civil War as a backdrop for this style of film. His 2001 movie The Devil's Backbone was another drama/fantasy/horror set in 1939 Spain when General Franco's right-wing Nationalists are poised to defeat the left-wing Republican forces.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth takes place in 1944 after Franco's victory and a young girl is travelling with her mother and adoptive father, who is the captain of the guard, to a rural area in northern Spain in order to wipe out the lingering Republican forces.<br/><br/>The young girl is Ofelia and is being brought unwillingly with her pregnant mother by order of her adoptive father, the tyrannical Captain Vidal whom she refuses to recognise as her adoptive guardian. She has brought with her a bundle of books which are all fairy tales and it seems this is a world that she often travels to in order to escape the harsh environment in which she has found herself growing up in.<br/><br/>While Captain Vidal sets about eliminating the bandits that live out in the woodlands surrounding the base, Ofelia is contacted by a fairy who brings her to a nearby labyrinth where she is told by a faun named Pan that she is the lost princess who's soul has finally reappeared in Ofelia's body and that she must succeed in 3 tasks to prove her true worth and be reunited with her father, the King, who has been waiting for her return.<br/><br/>The film makes fantastic use of two main plot lines. One of which concerns Ofelia and her three tasks and that of Captain Vidal and the bandits, each of which overlap with other subplots and are beautifully woven together to make a fantastic storyline both contextually and visually. The acting is sound from everyone concerned and the CGI creatures that exist are realistically portrayed and fit in perfectly with the story being told, adding extra depth and edge to the mystical world in which Ofelia finds herself.<br/><br/>Pan's Labryinth is a gem of a movie and one the best movies of 2006. Go and see it."

","Spain, 1944. Carmen, just married with the francoist Captain Vidal, moves with her daughter Ophelia to her new husband's house. Unable to adapt to her new life and to that new world, the child discovers the existence of a mysterious labyrinth. Its guardian, the faun Pan, reveals to her she's the missing princess of an enchanted kingdom. To return there and to leave her mortal condition, the unprepared young girl will have to brave and pass 3 dangerous tasks.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is Guillermo del Toro's 6th movie, and it has many things in common with The Devil's Blackbone. It's the result of a year of work, 4 months of shooting and 6 of post-production, and the director himself called it his most complete film. In this movie, all atrocities committed by the Francoist Captain and by his men proceed in parallel with the little girl's fairy imagination. Ophelia is surrounded by hate, war and uncertainty so she uses the only weapon she has to fight everything: her imagination. She goes through a lot of amazing things and beautiful experiences that make her feel stronger and important in the world. But also through difficult moments full of fear, where she has to resist temptation, because she may lose her innocence and will never be able to dream again, to imagine.<br/><br/>Once again, the main theme is the negativity of reality, and an escapism made thanks to fantasy. But this opposition between real world and the fantasy world is not the same already present in Burton or in Alice's Wonderland. Del Toro, in fact, does not show a world composed of odd castaways who are more human than normal people, and not even a silly, nutty imaginary reality, where nonsense rules. His aim is to offer a precise vision and interpretation of fascism and, generally, of all dictatorships and their logic, seen as a form of degeneration of childhood, a death or heart, of innocence, of imagination. That's why the real monster in the movie is not the Faun or the magic insect, but the captain Vidal. Sergi Lopez is great in interpreting a controlling man, he has been able to draw a character, and indirectly a regime, dominated by coldness, cruelty and arrogance. The 12 years old Ivana Vaquero gives an impressive performance, one of the best ones from a child actor, also the rest of the cast works very well. The make-up is remarkable as are the effects, though they're far from the ones we're used to seeing in many recent American flicks. Very solid and mature, Pan's Labyrinth is definitely one of the best films of the year, an excellent piece of film-making.

Not only is the scene breathtaking visually, but raised the tension, until my heart was literally beating through my chest. Pan's Labyrinth is dark, magical and mysterious and leaves you wanting to see more and more, unfortunately, you don't ever see much of the mythical world that the faun tries to bring Ofelia (who according to the faun is a princess from the underworld) back to, which is a shame, as so much could have been done aesthetically! Not only do the magical creatures such as the faun, the fairies and the of course the forever disturbing Paleman interest me, but also the brutality of Ofelia's new step-father, who is shockingly violent throughout the film, only making it even more deep and interesting.

","I think my main complaint upon this movie is the hype versus the actual package. I watched previews and explored a website that promised a beautifully surreal fantasy world which one young girl would escape her horrid reality to find. I was thoroughly disappointed when rather than living up to this promise at all, the film turned out to be a two-hour drudge through a sad, sadistic world full of horrific and extreme violence that just frankly could have been toned down to much greater effect in my opinion. <br/><br/>I'm not going to go into great detail on why I did or did not like this movie. I've said enough in summary that it simply was too great a ratio of horrible violence and sadness to the previously expected wondrous fantasy. <br/><br/>What I will say for the prospective viewer is this: This film is NOT for the weak hearted or weak stomached. If you made it through ""The Hills Have Eyes"" (which I did not...) then you may be alright. If you enjoy that kind of movie, you may really love this one. But for those seeking a beautiful fantasy world coupled with a touching story along the lines of ""Mirrormask"" or the classic ""The Labyrinth"", look elsewhere as this movie will likely leaving you sadly wanting and possibly even a touch sad inside. That's how it left me... Wishing that humanity was not so much more entertained by the horrible truth than by the beauty of imagination.

I really liked the contrast between the real events and Ofelia's (Ivana Vaquero) chimera world containing some strange - seemingly brutal - characters, and the real world containing the authentic brutality of Capt. Vidal (Sergi Lopez). As mystifying as it as disturbing, this movie gives one a sense of what it was like to live then. No doubt the near phantasmagoria of the girl's imaginary world is nothing compared to the torture that Capt. Vidal inflicts on prisoners.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one that I really recommend. Guillermo Del Toro (of ""Cronos"" and ""Mimic"" fame) scored another good one here. I can't do justice to it by trying to describe it; you have to see it. It certainly deserved its Oscar win."
"fedaykin666","5","3","10","6 February 2007"," Magically overrated
","I sometimes curse myself for buying into all the hype and seeing a film that I feel may have potential after all. Indeed, Fauno has a lot of potential, but is executed in a rather dull hollywoodish fashion.<br/><br/>The backbone of the film is the theme of escapism: Ofelia constructs around her a world that would keep her safe, or at least away from the real violent war-world around her. It is a fascinating psychological phenomenon. Yet, sadly, it seems the scriptwriter has chosen to neglect the inner world of the characters to focus on the fairy tale full of special effects and magic so admired by younger audiences.<br/><br/>The consequence is that characters seem, to quote an earlier comment, like ""theatrical cartoons"". The villain of the story is nothing more than the blunt, simplistic and thoroughly violent Amon Goeth from Schindler's List who has somehow found his way into the labyrinth (perhaps brought there by the faun, though I would opt for the ""unimaginative scriptwriter"" theory). The villain is bad, the hero is good - this is about as psychoanalytical as del Toro gets.<br/><br/>Other characters are completely left in the background, such as the mother and Mercedes, who perform clearly secondary roles. This would be excusable, would there be more focus on the feelings and contemplations of Ofelia. Yet she is innocent indeed, so much so that how she feels about the whole situation is rarely expressed, explicitly or subtly. It is of course obvious that the state of affairs has a negative impact on her, which is why she gets immersed in fairy tales, but I feel a more detailed insight into her thoughts and the reasons for her ""escape"" would have been in order. It is the WHY of her obsession with fairy tales that is important, not the HOW.<br/><br/>What Fauno offers us instead is adventures and wondrous creatures. Mixed in are episodes of the real world which is black-and-white, and occasionally very (even absurdly) violent, perhaps to lure more adult viewers. The real world does not clarify the WHY, because very few scenes are present that would expose the viewer to the relationship between mother and daughter, stepdaughter and stepfather, daughter and the memory of the dead father. The bits of dialogue that seem to bring us closer to the characters are short, followed by some more fauns and fairies. What, you may ask, happened to the girl who seemed to miss her real father so much? She got lost not in the labyrinth, but in the attic of del Toro's mind, who decided that it would be sufficient to throw in a few sporadic references to the father and then to forget he ever existed.<br/><br/>The only part of the film I really liked was the ending. Not because Ofelia and her stepfather died, but because it was a truly beautiful transition from real into fantasy - a requiem for Ofelia and for what this film could have been."

Pan's Labyrinth takes the child's point of view of a tough situation with the same care and attention that it does for the adults'.<br/><br/>The movie's world is visually stunning, and a clever reflection of the mental state of the characters and the situation. The visual effects are also quite amazing, but I think the live action is actually more effective and engaging than the computer generated effects."

","I heard good reviews of Pan's Labyrinth, so I took my girlfriend to a matinée at the local theater. We were pretty intrigued at first, but then shocked when the undeveloped and inexplicably evil villain starts to commit acts of brutal savagery which were shown down the the last splatter of blood. I have no problem with violent films and graphic scenes, but they seemed simply disgusting in this film. I understand that the director was trying to go for a ""grownup fantasy"" but I felt like I was watching a children's story that had been made into a ""grownup"" one simply by adding gruesome killing and torture scenes. Implied violence would have been way better in this film. I simply have no idea why a fantasy film would have to show every little detail, and deprive the viewer of the ability to interpret. Fantasy is supposed to paint a picture of a world where I as the viewer can imagine getting lost in for days. This movie didn't leave any room for interpretation, and I find myself completely uninterested in the world it showed."
"Ziya90","10","3","11","7 August 2010"," I don't believe the people who criticize this movie without any rational reason!
","In the forum of the movie, there is considerable amount of threads that say very hard things about the movie, in user reviews section, most of the reviews which appreciate the movie have been found not useful and again there are a considerable amount of people who think that it is very overrated. However, why? The direction is so subtle and flawless, the cinematography is great like The Pianist meets Tim Burton movies, the story is very engaging, interesting, the creatures are so creative (like some other Del Toro movies, for example, the creature whose eyes are above his hands), the content is brilliant, it blends realistic war dramas with fairy tales (fantasy cinema), technically it looks perfect, it has some real shocking moments and a great final waits for us! It is not my personal opinion exactly, all these things are obvious (I don't want to say fact, because it would be too definite) Then why those people hate and say very bad things about it? Do they have a reasonable, acceptable reason? It seems they have not, but the question is I don't know why they do that? Just trolling? I don't say that I am one hundred percent objective, but the movie delivers on cinematography, direction, content, messages and technically. Then, what is the problem or problems of the movie? Because of this incomprehensible hate, those people say ridiculous things like the leading actress was ugly or the movie is a propaganda. Well, this will be personal, but the girl was beautiful and so likable (I wished to enter the screen and help the girl!) and the movie was not a propaganda, instead it was a criticism of fascism !!! Pan's Labyrinth is the movie that turned Del Toro into a master director and it seems that he will never reach that success again, because it was that great, he made one of the best movies of all time! And personally, it is in my top 25 (of all time) The world that Ofelia is gotten within is so interesting and the most important appealing and it is much better than Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland (sorry Burton) Pan's Labyrinth's fantasy world is not so colorful, not as colorful as Tim Burton's movies, but not as a flaw. The first violent attempt was real shocking, it is seriously disturbing, but since it does not serve our entertainment (it serves the criticism), it is positively effective. The movie is also enjoyable, even if not throughout, for example the toad scene was amusing. As for the messages of the movie, to neglect in wife, baby discrimination (hate for female babies), fascism etc. etc. How many movies put all these things together and even perfectly? None !!! The knife scene, the most shocking violent moment of the movie and recalled me of course Joker, was one of the unforgettable moments of the movie (and may be in the cinema history!) And the following scene in front of the mirror was also a subtle, impressive directing success! And in the final, there is a moment which extremely thoughtful and open to discuss. A note: it couldn't have been implied better. The movie ends in a not cliché way (you are my man Del Toro!) This is an original, uncommon ending, not a cliché and audience-driven one that generally blockbusters use."

","Guillermo del Toro returns with another historical based fantasy epic building upon similar territory explored in Hellboy. More on that soon.<br/><br/>The set-up follows young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) as she travels with her pregnant Mother to meet up with Carmen's new stepfather, the nasty 'Capitan' (Sergi Lopez). It's 1944 and the war is coming to a close. Spain's fascist government is in power and it's the Capitan's role to clear up the last remnants of the resistance from the mountains. He soon proves he's more than up for the job.<br/><br/>Ofelia on the other hand, instantly dislikes him and for good reason. But there's much more going on here as she soon discovers. <br/><br/>I would imagine that if a standard film was to be made about fascist Spain at the close of World War II, it wouldn't attract as much attention as it does now after del Toro has thrown his fantasy elements into the mix. Don't be misled by the fantasy. It might suggest a light tread, but this ain't no kid flick. It's violent, cruel, tense, shocking, bewildering and times touching, but at no point does del Toro let you rest. The suspense and tension is wound as tightly as one of del Toro's clocks. (More on that soon too.) <br/><br/>As always, he's interested in story first. That's why his other effects heavy films (Hellboy, Blade II, Mimic, & Cronos) are so successful. There are also design similarities between this film and the others, including similar prop devices. It's almost certain that we haven't seen the last of these del Toro signature items.<br/><br/>Doug Jones, a del Toro regular, returns not once but twice, but it is the wistful innocence of our heroine Ofelia, who captures the heart. I had an emotional investment in her and the other characters, in spite of myself. This is a powerful and engaging film with one of the most vicious screen villains we've witnessed in some time. You'll be screaming for his demise.<br/><br/>After shooting the Hellboy sequel this year, del Toro hopes to make 3993, another historical Spanish film with supernatural overtones, this time set in the Civil War. It's clear he hasn't rid of all of his demons just yet. (review written in 2006)."

","When I was in Hollywood on a college trip I heard about this foreign (Spanish language) film and was interested in seeing it. Now, seeing it, this film from Mexican director Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy, Blade II) is a fantastically inventive journey. Basically it is 1944, World War II, and young fairytale enthusiast Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is moving with her pregnant mother Carmen Vidal (Ariadna Gil) to live with her new stepfather, the ruthless and Spanish army Captain Vidal (a terrific Sergi Lopez). Not long after arriving, she is taken by a fairy to an old faun, Pan (Doug Jones) in the centre of the labyrinth. He tells her that she is a princess, because she is her soul was once part of the labyrinth. He tells her that she must complete three tasks to prove her royalty, and if she fails, she will never be a real a princess, or see her real king father. These include getting a key from inside a giant frog, getting a knife from the room of a creature that wears its eyes on its hands, and eventually, giving her ""innocent"" blood to the labyrinth, instead of her baby brother. Also starring Maribel Verdú as Mercedes and Alex Angulo as Doctor. The special effects are extraordinary, the violence is eye-catching, and the story is very interesting. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography and Best Makeup, and it was nominated for Best Music for Javier Navarrete, Best Writing, Original Screenplay and Best Foreign Language Film of the Year, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film not in the English Language, Best Costume Design and Best Make Up & Hair, and it was nominated for Best Special Visual Effects, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Original Screenplay and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film. Outstanding!"
"Rickting","5","2","6","29 November 2014"," Watch without listening to the hype
","Pan's Labyrinth, Guillermo del Toro's universally adored dark fairy tale for grown ups, follows the step daughter of a nasty army officer who escapes into a mysterious fantasy world. This is very audacious as it's combining a fantasy world populated with dream like creatures with a brutal real world where war and violence reign supreme. This is a bold movie, and maybe that's why people raved about it since it works partially. For me, it just didn't click. It's a very mixed bag and while not an enjoyable film it has some strong qualities that belong in a better movie. The acting, even from the child lead, is very strong and the film has one of the nastiest villains of the 21st century. It's an interesting idea and there are occasions where a mysterious power shakes itself to life. The death of Ofelia at the end is pretty shocking and some bits, such as when she first enters the labyrinth, are well done. The acting makes the movie, and it's difficult not to admire such a bold hybrid of 2 very different genres.<br/><br/>I don't get the hype about the visuals of the movie. The cinematography is very routine and bland. The dark lighting adds nothing to the movie. Del Toro's direction is average at best. The real world scenes are OK but nothing special. The fantasy part of the film feels half hearted and is very unimaginative. The tasks Ofelia has to complete are woefully unimaginative. It's just a war movie with a faun, a labyrinth, some fairies and a load of other creatures but it doesn't fulfil the promise of the premise as there's an uneven balance. Del Toro is clearly in love with his premise, and the way that he mixes the 2 elements and tries so hard to create contrast by throwing in a lot of brutal and pointless violence is very off putting. PL feels somewhat pretentious as a result and in general is just a bit boring. A weird, dark fantasy movie which isn't as bold or smart as it thinks it is and lacks true punch, although I'll give it a second viewing in future.<br/><br/>5/10"
"bowmanblue","9","2","6","14 October 2014"," A classic fantasy film (in some people's opinion)
","Personally, I loved 'Pan's Labyrinth,' so much so I recommended it to my friend (who's also well into fantasy films). His verdict: it was a war film. To be fair... he had a point. It's set in the dying days of World War II in fascist Spain where the ruling powers are hunting down any rebels who still believe in democracy. Amidst all this is a young girl whose mother has married the Captain of the fascist troops. And, having moved to his home/woodland base, starts to meet all sorts of weird and wonderful visitors.<br/><br/>Yes, it has the 'feel' of a war movie. You have the uniforms, the period in time and the soldiers fighting it out. However, if you can't see the 'fantasy' elements then you're obviously as blind as my friend!<br/><br/>When it comes, it comes. I will admit to the fact that most of the film is very 'period,' but when the fantasy elements appear on screen, they're really pretty spectacular. The sets and magical characters have been brilliantly designed and create a great counterbalance to the more mundane setting of 'real life.' <br/><br/>Also, I should mention that – in case you didn't know – the film is Spanish, so you'll have to put up with the subtitles. But, if you're okay with that and generally like fantasy epics (with more than a healthy dose of good old-fashioned fairy tales) then you should love this. It really is a classic. Enjoy it before it gets remake by Hollywood (please no!)."
"Degree7","4","2","6","18 July 2012"," A film of little to no substance.
","Critics and audiences would be eager to tell you that Guillermo Del Toro's Fantasy/War drama ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is one of the best modern fairy tales since (Insert Tim Burton flick here). But make sure to ignore these claims, for they would be based on lies. Further examination reveals that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is in fact as inartistic and intellectually spurious as they come. This film was made by a Grad A PHONY, and here's why.<br/><br/>Fantasy scenes are annoyingly superfluous, having little to no connection to the war happening around her (which is, of course, presented in completely black and white terms with the honourable reds fighting off the despicable fascists). We are expected to believe that Ophelia created this world around her to escape from the harsh reality of war, but in the end it is clear that the ambiguity is simply a redundant 'open ending' to the story that leaves the filmmakers thinking they were oh so smart to allow the audience to see it one way or the other. The attempt to weave together two threads of graphic violence and childlike fairytale comes across as amateurish. Why does one want to watch something that is presented as a fairy tale (it doesn't matter that it's a dark one, so was Alice in Wonderland) when it feels like a mere afterthought to the human drama that is unfolding? The film's attempt to mesh these together by including horror elements in the fairy tale parts is cheap popcorn schlock. A predictable monster with a wobbly walk, a giant toad (creative), and a tree root. Big whoop.<br/><br/>I found Del Toro's attempts to blend fantasy and reality to be quite ham fisted and lazy. There was practically a total of three fantastical things in this movie, and none of them were that creative or imaginative, except for the baby eating demon with hands for eyes. But even that was just a ridiculous premise and essentially served no other purpose other than to look strange. All of the 'tasks' that Ofelia goes through in no way challenge her character or reveal any insight into the conflict of the film. There are no riddles, no real challenges, just basically follow some simple directions and everything just happens magically and for no discernible reason. Not to mention the connection between the 'real' world and the fantasy land is annoyingly superfluous, and at worst, entirely pointless.<br/><br/>The moral of the film should have been that the fear of the imagination/fairytale is far less reprehensible than the evil of man. Unfortunately, the battlefield scenes and Captain Vidal are completely one note. One half on the battlefield, one half in fantasy land, neither truly working. Both sides of this film are half baked. He should have concentrated on one aspect. If there is one thing Guillermo really revels in, it is the graphic violence that sadistically blunts any point the film could have made, from the over-the-top demolition of a man's face with a wine bottle, the execution of a child, to the melodramatic way everyone hangs in the air for 2 seconds after having their brains blown out before dropping dead.<br/><br/>The film paints its depiction of evil in broad strokes of black and white, particularly with the one dimensional character of Captain Vidal. Of course, the honourable Republicans are completely valiant and noble. It is laughably one-sided. There is really no point of connection between the two universes, as they share little poetic relationship between one another. Del Toro should either have made a war drama, or a child's fantasy. The result at his poor attempt to combine the two was basically him trying to have his cake and eat it too.<br/><br/>Eventually, the gratuitous gore and paper thin characterizations just made the film a chore to sit through. I'd rather watch Spirit of the Beehive than sit through PL again. <br/><br/>If this film wasn't in Spanish, we wouldn't think it was so artsy."

","One thing I feared, before watching the film and it became true. I felt, that this picture had more style than substance, as the in my opinion widely over-appreciated ""Hellboy"". The worlds characterized in this film are not really different, the point of the story is how you behave in a certain unreal environment. Evil and cowardly as Vidal does, or honorable and brave, as Ofelia. Specially that she allows her to make faults is nice, for I can see her little weaknesses in myself, like when she eats berries, knowing what the consequences are. Unfortunately what stays in the end is question marks, what did del Toro actually wanna say? You live on in the way you died? Glenn Miller just disappeared, is he only remembered for having disappeared? Certainly Not! In the end it is only important what you yourself see in a picture, but I don't see a lot. The cinematography is impressive as is the gore and the, in my opinion, unnecessary violence. Normally I like violence and gore in movies, but still they have to make sense, they have to be a part of telling the story, like in some good horror movies, where those two have a function. But why must Vidal repeatedly act as slaughterer? That is, as absurd as that may seems, regarding who the director is, totally lame."

","I put this in my player with more than a hint of hesitation. My other half had added it to my online rentals list without my knowledge, and when it came, I thought it was some kind of childish fairy tale film. I couldn't have been more wrong. This film has jumped straight into my favourite movies of all time, and in fact I can't wait to see it again to see what bits I might have missed this time round.<br/><br/>The characters are believable through and through, all the actors doing a commendable job of bringing the world to life. The story, whilst following a familiar fairy tale template, has a dark twist. Think Tim Burton, and then pile on a little more dark.<br/><br/>Two ""worlds"" exist in the story - one is the real world of young Ofelia, whose mother takes her to the mountains to live with her husband, a nasty Nazi type army captain, fighting a war against the rebels. The other is the fantasy world, in which she must undertake 3 trials to see if she is the long-lost princess of the underworld. As is traditional fairy tale fare, the real world certainly does not reflect the idea that Ofelia may be royalty, and she faces many hardships in her life.<br/><br/>The fantasy sequences (which are never confirmed to be real or imagined through the film) carry the bulk of the atmosphere, seeped in weirdness as they are. Some real imagination has gone into the creatures that are encountered, with excellent makeup coupled with excellent sfx topping it all off.<br/><br/>A must-see for everyone (except nervous people and young kids - it has a 15 rating in the UK, and deserves it). I just can't see why anyone would not be moved by this film."

But she learns that the world is instead full of evil from the adult world and she can't run from it.<br/><br/>It is just like I view the world; children are the most adorable, innocent, beautiful and pure, and their love is unsurpassable and they are free from judgment or prejudice. But why can't we keep all that as we grow up too?? Why must we create a world with so much hate and evil. Love is the language of the heart, the kids know that and most of us can just barely sense it. So, this little cute girl, played by Ivana Baquero, tries to change all the bad stuff around her so she can have her family with a mother and a brother, but... it doesn't turn out that well at all.

The biggest scene that shows the events are actually happening is: how does Ophilia escape the locked room to try and rescue her brother. When the bandits and Mercedes come back to save her the room is still locked. Also, when Vidal is chasing her in the labyrinth the hedges move for her and make him find another way around.

Perhaps fantasy has a natural advantage in enrapturing its audience- but truly, this is why I watch movies. The progress of CGI and animation has been striking, but often it has become an impediment in the actual story-telling process. It is one of the great hallmarks of this film that the CGI enhances the story, making it even more compelling. The acting is solid, not great.

"naun","6","2","6","25 February 2007"," A dissenting view
","By interweaving the brutal reality of fascist Spain with a child's fantasy world, the filmmakers evidently hoped to say something deep about evil. Undoubtedly the juxtaposition of the two worlds is done with considerable guile, both in the transitions and in the visual echoes between them. The problem is that the film begins with a portrayal of evil, in its realistic scenes, that is so trite that the fantasy sequences have nothing of substance to elaborate upon, and end up being merely sentimental. Del Toro appears to equate evil with mere sadism, taking computer-enhanced violence as a shortcut to presumed moral insight. The characters who populate the tale – the despicable captain, the heroic resistance fighters, the compassionate doctor – are the flimsiest of stock figures. This weekend I saw Louis Malle's Au Revoir les Enfants, where evil is a mysterious force that indelibly marks the rites of youth. That film attains a kind of terrible moral sobriety that is not to be found here. Watching the new film's all too consciously grandiloquent ending, I wasn't sure that it amounted to much more than Spielberg meets Tim Burton."

","I expected this movie to be dark but I had no idea when I sat down that I would be witnessing one of the most brutal scenes in movie history. One individual in this film gets beaten with a beer bottle without mercy and without editing. In fact, the guy on the receiving end of this brutal attack gets beaten until his head gets snapped back and ends up ultimately dangling somewhere between his shoulder blades. Aside from the brutal nature of this film it is a definite must see. The bad guys get what is coming to them and the ultimate sacrifice leads to a realm not of this Earth. Sit back and let Ophelia walk into your room and read you a story."
"grncab97","10","2","6","16 February 2007"," Best movie I've seen in years
","This movie moved me so much. It is a complex tale of fantasy, a child's belief in magic, Franco's Nationalist army's brutal ways and the primal fear of losing your parents. Just so well done, I can't recommend this movie enough. The only drawback is the brutal violence that I had to shut my eyes for, thus missing some of the dialogue since I don't know Spanish and had to rely on the sub-titles. The costume and make-up of the fantasy characters also add so much to the story. I can easily see this movie being turned into an assignment at college looking for the parallels between Ophelia's actions and those of the Republicans. The acting also is wonderful by all including the secondary character Mercedes. This brings up the directors's clever way in highlighting women's power in a Fascist world be it cultural or political by they fact that they are overlooked. I don't want to over-analyze this movie, it was very deep but at the same time very entertaining and you can take it to whatever depth you like and still enjoy it."

","I saw this film on the weekend at a cinema in Toronto. While the special effects were quite remarkable (although we have become accustomed to this type of cgi, i.e. LOTR, Narnia, Eragon etc) I felt the film suffered due its rather thin storytelling. Some characters seemed over developed, i.e Mercedes and the Doctor, where others seemed crucially underdeveloped, the underground kingdom, the faun, and even the girl.<br/><br/>I mean the obvious hook for this film was the fantastic fantasy-world the girl created for herself-- and you certainly get this impression by the trailers that you see for the film, but how much of this fantasy world did we actually get to explore??? aside from the recurring faun and fairies, there's only 2 real scenes where you really get into the ""surrealness"" of this fantasy world, the scene with the frog, and the scene with the ""pale-man"" which seemed amazingly short! Couldn't she have stayed in that underworld just a little bit longer??? and i know people are going to flame this and say that it was just a representation of a child's fantasy, and the real story was about Fascist Spain-- but thats not how the film is advertised!!! I mean the link for the trailer on the official website is an amazing picture of the ""pale-man"", and one would think that there would be a great showdown of sorts at the end of the film with this nemesis, but there was nothing!<br/><br/>My criticism here is that i felt del Toro tried to cram two films into one here, and was successful in some aspects but not in others. He could have established that Capitan Vida was a jerk right after he killed the farmers, but he seemed to drag that point-- in my opinion the story of Mercedes her brother and the doctor was rather unnecessary, and dragged on...all this ""dragging"" left little time for the audience to experience the wonders that this Labyrinth had to offer-- i mean its a Labyrinth and no one even got lost in it! not once!

","I kinda feel like saying ROTFL to all the literal minded viewers on this thread who try to ""interpret"" what this movie is about. Yeah, ok, one can make a myriad attempts at analysis of the themes of good and evil obvious on the surface but that is a miserable response to the wondrous visual universe created by del Toro. I've seen it about five times in the past couple of years, both on TV and Netflix, and I'm totally mesmerised still every time. The young girl is superb, the fable elements inventive, the cinematography just stunning but above all the mood and atmosphere del Toro creates is seamless, weaving the wars both the adults and the child are in the middle of into a fantastic immersive experience. And that's the crux of my ""review"", analyse this and that by all means but try the immersive approach and let yourself be swept away by the mood of the cinematic narrative. Just like Mulholland Drive, it is the immersion in the mood that pays dividends in terms of viewing satisfaction. Cinema, the multi modal medium that Kurosawa has spoken about at length, is uniquely placed as a medium of immersive story telling. Try it and let go of your cliched approaches to film. You may surprise yourself. Bravo Senior del Toro."
"quiqueperezsoler","9","1","2","8 February 2020"," Beautiful story hidden underneath a grotesque setting
","MILD MILD SPOILERS .... ( I might mention some spoilery things but only for those who, like me, want to know what kind of things to expect from the movie without being spoiled of it all)<br/><br/>When this movie first came out I wasn't into the horror genre as I am now. When I didn't ignore it I simply though of it as ""oh look, another horror movie with a first-innocent-but-then-crazy-type of little girl (Exorcist style)"". Never have I been more wrong to misjudge a director's vision.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro's movie has that subtle portrayal of a fairy tale hidden underneath the harsh and turmoiling times of war. As a spaniard I felt the over romanticization of the two sides of the Spanish Civil War was not accurate to the impact both sides had to the overall outcome of the war and is exaggerated to have a more nazi-vs-allies sort of setting to the story. Like in every war, both sides are not exempt from carrying out criminal and outrageous acts against humanity. The Nationals may have done some aweful things but the republicans are not as innocent as depicted. I'm not trying to choose sides here but rather express that things are not always black and white but shades of grey.<br/><br/>But for the sake of the story we will assume this is a StarWars-Empire-vs-Rebels sort of setting and we will look pass the historic accuracy to engage with the real true story being told. Del Toro managed to create such a captivating fairy tale that connects with a lot of character design, grotesque aesthetic and fairy tale-tropes-inspired choices that make it unique and very nostalgic to those who have read classic fairytale books inspired by Hans Christian Andersen and the Grimm brothers.<br/><br/>The ending is amazing, leaving the audience wondering if whether all that happened to the girl was real or not (although if you want to know you can as the director answered it in an interview.....). All in all, this movie made me realise how wrong I was to prejudge a movie on the first instance instead of giving it a try and seeing where it lead to. And besides the historic accuracy part of the movie, it is a well-rounded deeply-felt movie that filled me with inspiration and wonder. A highly recommended movie if you can see pass the grotesque and at times horrorific aspects of it (like the skin creature blegh, although I think that was meant to be that way)"

"andrewburgereviews","10","1","2","29 October 2019"," A fairy tale for grown-ups
","Guilermo del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth"" juggles between two opposing worlds--the early Francoist period of 1944 Spain and a straight-forward but perfectly executed fairy tale world. Both of them intertwine often, yet no inhabitants from the two different realms ever meet each other. The only one interacting with both is Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), an 11-year-old girl--she takes the realization, morality choices and suffering alone. This said, calling this a fairy tale for grown-ups is technically correct, even if it barely scratches the surface.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around the aforementioned 11-year-old girl, Ofelia, arriving at a military outpost engaged in wiping out Resistance fighters. She is joined by her mother, Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to meet her step-father. Carmen is pregnant with his child. The man in question is the captain of the outpost, Vidal (Sergi LÃ³pez). His performance and his personality easily earns him a comparison with Ralph Fiennes' Amon Goeth. But unlike Goeth, Vidal seems to have more principles (yet he kills with about the same amount of remorse). While he is often cold, especially in the scenes in which he shaves himself in the mirror, so bloodthirsty he might as well just cut himself to spare the tedium, one of the few times he opens up is during a dinner he organized with other officials. He claims to take satisfaction in cleaning out the Resistance--which is viewed as menial work. Yet he views it as a well-deserved cleansing for Spain and for his unborn son whom he wants to come out in a ""clean"" country. Meanwhile, Ofelia finds out she is the reincarnation of a princess belonging to the Underworld and envoys have been sent to put her to the test in order for her to be able to return home.<br/><br/>Envoys like the faun--a broken, spastic tree-like humanoid whose purpose is to serve Ofelia--the princess. His name is not Pan, in fact, no character named Pan exists in the movie. So, the rest of the movie revolves around Ofelia--a pure, innocent girl--juggling her birthing mother, her otherworldly heritage and, of course, Vidal. From an elitist point-of-view, Vidal is a true patriot. Whenever he is on the screen, his villainous presence is immediate. He is harsh with his men, but he respects them. As they once engaged in a gunfight he encouraged them to move forward and to welcome death because death in battle is the only noble way to go. But that did not mean he stood aside. He was always front-and-center. You could almost admire him, something which does not come about Goeth.<br/><br/>The fact that the film takes place during a period with heavy political content it would be tempting, perhaps even required for Del Toro to try and make the movie's fantasy elements as some sort of metaphors or visual and theatrical euphemisms regarding its real counterpart. But he does not do that. Despite the occasional deadly threats that realm involves, it is usually clean because the line between good and evil is clearly drawn. In that aspect, one might consider evil at its most powerful and present form when it is hidden, working from the shadows. Whatever the considerations, this is a rare masterpiece in that is great without aiming at too many complex emotions--instead it takes the ever-present feelings of love and hatred and augments them. The lines are clearly drawn everywhere, the choices are well-defined, but all that, accompanied by one of the best-conceived supernatural beings in cinema, give this movie an undeniable power.<br/><br/>Del Toro's imagining of the fantasy world is great not because is over-the-top (which is not) but because its monsters seem crafted with some sort of meaning, they don't impress by looking like hyperbolic shoved-in shockers, but rather by displaying a sort of primitive human anatomy. The infamous pale man, for instance, despite its obvious loose white skin and eyes where one should not have eyes, is somehow in its own disturbing way... familiar. This is not to show that Del Toro is not a visual director. One of this movie's greatest achievements is its cinematography and design--not to mention the soundtrack. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" feels like it was made with love and patience, Guillermo del Toro's own surrogate child.<br/><br/>Except perhaps the Disney classics, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is the greatest of all fantasy films. Here we have two hours of unwavering flamboyance, poignant and powerful emotions and best of all moments of genuine ugly aesthetics, yet ones that welcome a cathartic release of beauty--some seen, some unseen but both felt."

There is symbolism throughout - whether it was deliberate or not I am not sure, but that is the beauty of imagination: there is no bounds.<br/><br/>You could say this is a more modern Alice In Wonderland when making comparisons. But it doesn't feel like it. A lot of detail with minimal CGI, this film will age effectively.<br/><br/>There aren't any cheap saves or typical big moments with characters. It is refreshing to have a very real, raw story.

Also the structure is altered because there are two lines of history with two protagonists, with their own development, conflict and resolution these stories are joined by several aspects but the strongest reason is an enemy in common Ofelia and Mercedes, who aims to keep the protagonists of their desires."

","Honestly, there is probably not all that much that I can say about this film that hasn't already been said by countless of other film critics that have watched this film. Yeah, it is basically one of those films that literally grabs the attention of all the arty types out there so that they can delve into it and try to dig out its many meanings, and get it absolutely wrong. In fact there was one that I watched that suggested that the intention of the director was a minor thing - seriously, this is getting a little too far.<br/><br/>The story is set in 1944 and apparently the Spanish Civil War is winding down (though I had no idea that it lasted that long - by 1944 I thought that it was well and truly over). So, this lady and her daughter are brought up to this mill in the country because her husband basically wants his child born where he happens to be. Well, he is an officer in the army, and his job is to basically crush what remains of the resistance. To say that he is not a nice guy is basically putting it lightly.<br/><br/>The film dances between the fantasy world that the child, Ofelia, has discovered, and the brutal world of Franco's fascist Spain. The situation is that Ofelia's father is dead, and her mother married this officer, and the undertone (though it is never specifically said) indicates that this officer is responsible for her father's death. Anyway, Ofelia finds this rock on the ground, and places it back into this ancient rock carving, and releases a fairy.<br/><br/>Now, the film is about the interplay between the fairy world that Ofelie experiences and the brutal reality of the fascist regime that has taken over Spain. There has been a suggestion, and the film does hint at this, is that children retreat into fantasy worlds as a way to deal with the real world. The only problem is that this fantasy world is just as brutal as the world in with Ofelia really lives. There as also been suggestions that this world doesn't exist, or at least only exists in Ofelia's minds, yet there are also hints that this might not be the case.<br/><br/>Look, it turns out that this is actually a pretty awesome movie, one that I had been meaning to watch for a while, but have been constantly putting it off. I'm not actually surprised that the director, Giamarmo del Torro, won an Oscar for a later film because you can certainly see that there is a lot in this film to take in. The problem is that when one then watches a commentary afterwards, one sort of loses their perspective of the film. Still, it is pretty awesome, and certainly well worth watching."

I was always engaged and invested in the young Ofelia's story, but I'm not sure both stories (being the war politcals of it all, and Ofelia's journey to return to her homeland) flowed as much as it could have. At the very least, the powerful imagery, and great combination of special & practical effects made it worth it.<br/><br/>6.6/10"

","Pan Labyrinth, directed by Guillermo del Toro was a story set in Spain in the 1940's that displayed two story lines. The first one being a fascist group during the civil war located in the woods to keep out the rebels. The second one being an 11 year old girl by the name of Ofelia, who is trapped in her own fairytale land. Ofelia's mother, Carmen, is a widow who remarries Capitan Vidal, a murdering sadist. Alongside of the Capitan, a woman named Mercedes was his main maid, who proved to be a powerful, resilient woman behind closed doors. These three prominent female characters are what make the film complete the circle.
 Pan's Labyrinth is a film directed by Guillermo del Toro that takes place in the 1940's in Spain. This film is a drama, fantasy, war genre-based film that was published in 2006. This film is about an adventurous, young girl by the name of Ofelia that was sent with her pregnant mother to meet her new step-father, the captain of the Spanish army. During her stay, she comes upon a fairy who has essentially ""chosen"" her and leads her to a garden in the center of the labyrinth. She is acquainted with a faun who tells her that she is from royal descent and in order to reach her kingdom, she must complete 3 tasks. She spends her time throughout the film completing each terrifying task in order to reach the end of her destiny. Within this time, a ghastly chain of events takes place involving the captain, her mother and Mercedes. 
Pan's Labyrinth portrayed an effective fantasy by creating blue filters and bright yellow filters when she would travel off to her fairytale land. The fairies and detailed monsters create an artistic approach, leading the audience to be further intrigued into this fairytale land. However, the drama aspect of this film is not effective. There are some scenes that could have used further details to expand on the present moment. Also, a selected amount of scenes were quickly ran through and not enough time was placed on the drama taking place in that specific scene. The intended audience meant for this film is someone between the ages of 13-18. Although, this is a fairytale and fairy tales are usually meant for a younger audience, the monster-like characters in this film are way too scary for young children. There are also disturbing scenes in this film that involve: amputation, death and brutality that is not advisable for young children. An example of the effectiveness of a fantasy land, is when she goes to the garden to meet with the faun. Everything is detailed and has a mystical feel to the scenes. Compared to the lack of effectiveness on the drama scenes, for example when Mercedes was caught helping the rebels, it was a short-lived scene in my opinion. There could have been more emphasis placed, since this movie was revolved around the Spanish in the civil war. Maribel Verdu was remarkable in her performance. Everything she felt, I felt. On the other hand, ""Ofelia"", Ivana Baquero being one of the main actresses of the movie was an exceptional character. The pace of the film is enhanced with the editing and camera shots. They did a great job with close ups and focusing on weird details. 
 I rate this movie a 7.5 on a scale 1-10. Although, Pan's Labyrinth was a good movie, it was not the best movie I have ever seen. I would also be very careful about bringing your children with you depending on how old they are due to the little amount of graphic scenery in this film. Overall, it was an enjoyable film; however, I would not waste time on watching it again."

","Del Toro's Imaginative Film, El Laberinto del Fauno
 El Laberinto Del Fauno was directed in 2006 by Guillermo del Toro. Filming took place in various parts of Spain. Although the film's language is primarily in Spanish, it is also popularly known for its English title Pan's Labyrinth. Guillermo del Toro is famously known for his other works such as Hellboy, Blade II, and Pacific Rim. He is versatile in his works and takes on imaginative endeavours. Not only is Del Toro a film director, but he has also taken on roles as a screenwriter, producer and novelist. In all of his contributions to the films he's taken part of, his trademark can be noted by creatures with inhuman features, clockworks designs, use of insects and screens with amber hues. The elements of Del Toro's trademarks can be found throughout parts of El Laberinto del Fauno as well. 
The film is a combination of historical war, fantasy and drama. The narrative structure of the film at first, appears to be a circular plot with two storylines. The setting takes place in what appears to be the historical 1940's in Spain. One imagines a war torn countryside and a lot of action. However, one of the story's depth unfolds when a fantasy world arises. A world where fairies, a faun and magical objects or beings exist. At the center of the plots are three major female characters; Ofelia, Carmen and Mercedes. Ofelia is a child played by Ivana Baquero, her perspective leads the film viewers through both the ""real world"" filled with war torn issues and into her eerie, fantastical adventures. During that time Mercedes, who is played by Maribel Verdu grows close to Ofelia, as she also remains resilient during the war torn times. Carmen is Ofelia's pregnant mother, played by Ariadna Gil. In the story it is evident that Ofelia, Carmen and Mercedes are burdened by the expectations held for woman in the 1940's. The male antagonist in the film is Captain Vidal, he is played by Sergi Lopez and is portrayed as strong, callous and sadistic. As the two stories continue, viewers are taken through multiple perspectives like a colorful and magical place, with Ofelia. And then viewers are transitioned to the historical world where propaganda is used to keep civilians ""happy"" or content, while fascist regimes live their lives in riches. This part of the storyline in El Laberinto del Fauno is a great interpretation of historical war and gender roles that occured during that time. Del Toro's use of two ongoing storylines shows the best of both fantasy genre and historical war genre. 
This film is effective in its interpretation and for the brilliant technical aspects. Something that was especially clever is the way that the two stories transitioned through the lighting on the screen. It went from hues of amber, to a more natural light. This element lead the viewer back and forth through the far-fetched fantasy world and the war torn, historical world. The profound characteristics of all the characters also made the film feel genuine. As a viewer, you had the opportunity to empathize with the characters and their struggles. Del Toro was also successful in conveying his trademarks, such as the fixation that Captain Vidal had for his pocket watch. Also, the mythical creatures with striking and almost frightening features. It's important to note that from the beginning scene, where Ofelia appears to be hurt and lying on the floor, it becomes obvious that this is far from being a children's fairytale. Because of this, I do have to admit that this film is better suited for a mature audience. 
Overall I would highly recommend this film, because it is unworldly imaginative. The narrative structure seamlessly guides the viewer through the stories. And it's ingenuity lies within taking the viewer, not only to a different era but also to a different land. This film works for viewers who enjoy historical war films and also for viewers who love the fantasy side of filming. In short, this film has the best of both worlds."

","Pan's Labyrinth (2006), a drama and suspense packed Spanish film directed by Guillermo del Toro that had my eyes glued to the screen throughout the unfolding of the two storylines that take place. Initially this idea may seem to be a concerning as it could cause the film to lose a sense of depth, but reassured the film is full of substance as it seamlessly transitions between war and fairytale till the very end when it all fits together quite nicely. The story follows Ofelia, a 12 year old girl as she begins her new life under her new stepfather the brutal and intense Captain Vidal, who never seemed fond of Ofelia to begin with. Ofelia sets up upon a magical journey where her goal is to complete 3 difficult at times tasks, and Captain Vidal is going to great lengths to maintain his regime and eradicate the Republicans. Guillermo del Toro's film works because he allows us to build an emotional bond with his characters through a fantastic premise. The film possess a good mix of pain and joy, and just the right amount of light humor, such as the working women interacting in the kitchen.<br/><br/>When looking at the editing of the film, my biggest take way was the different colored camera filters used throughout the film, which worked perfectly. Using blue filters during more sad scenes helped us sympathize with characters, while yellow filters put a smile on our faces as they portrayed hope.<br/><br/>This film is an absolute must see, a true masterpiece to say the least. The film is just really well organized, as Guillermo del Toro magically takes two very different stories and almost seems to tell them at the same time without missing a beat as they constantly build off each other, until they become one.

","I don't see very many Mexican movies which I think are great.<br/><br/>Though I would never own Pan's Labyrinth, I do think this is a great one, deserving all the recognition that it got, and I'm very impressed, and even proud that the movie is Mexican.<br/><br/>The story is very simple, yet it embraces several different themes with class, and style.<br/><br/>It is, essentially, a children's story set in Spain during World War ll, and centering around Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a lonely little girl who's mother is carrying the child of a fascist named Captain Vidal.<br/><br/>Vidal could care less about his new wife and stepdaughter, and focuses solely on the child whom, he is certain will be a boy.<br/><br/>Because it is a difficult pregnancy, the mother is forced to stay bedridden, and Ofelia is placed in the care of Mercedes (Maribel Verdu), a caring woman who quietly despises Vidal, and has been secretly plotting against him.<br/><br/>Then, one night, Ofelia follows a fairy into a labyrinth on her stepfather's estate.<br/><br/>There she meets a Fawn (Doug Jones) who tells her she is a Princess, the daughter of a great King in an underground land, and that she must pass three tests if she is to return to her Kingdom, and be reunited with her true family...<br/><br/>Ofelia agrees, but trouble looms on the horizon, as rebels that have gone against the Nazi regime, unite against Vidal, and the three tests (which seem to Ofelia to be simple) could ultimately destroy her.<br/><br/>This movie is enchanting, and strangely soothing.<br/><br/>It's a fairy tale with depth, told from several points of view, and which comes up for air every once in a while to reflect on tyranny of the Nazi regime. Ofelia's mother, who's probably going to die in childbirth. Mercedes, who would like nothing better than to see Vidal dead. And Vidal himself, who's determined that his legacy should live on through his son.<br/><br/>A really, really terrific movie.
A masterpiece, I dare say, by Guillermo del Toro.

","The religious undertones were incredibly strong.
All of Ophelia's choices were moral choices. She screwed up once, but was given a second chance. At the end, she gave her life for her brother, which arguably is the ultimate good. She got to escape a horrible, war ridden world to go home to her father (God) in his kingdom (Heaven). This movie was one of hope, and the purest explanation I've ever seen of Christianity. 
That's why there was a heavy theme on innocence, and the simple brutality of life.<br/><br/>Maybe the director didn't mean that, but that's how I took it. Don't let this review ruin the movie if you don't like or believe in religion. It's ambiguous, I'm just inclined to think of it like that because of my experiences.<br/><br/>It was a great movie, very morbid like life itself, but not without hope. Definitely recommend."

","My Spanish teacher showed this in class, and it was at least more enjoyable than school. That makes it sound like I hated it, but I didn't. There was a lot of talent from multiple people displayed here as well as some good creative vision, but it just wasn't tied together well enough. It felt like somebody made a cake with some high-quality ingredients, but then nobody blended them.<br/><br/>The concept of having Ofelia escape the unfriendly world that she is forced into through a fantasy world is good and interesting. As a kid who was into books, I was always hoping that some fantastic adventure would save me from my own dissatisfaction with reality. It made sense that Ofelia might imagine a fantasy world, if you want to interpret it that way. While I was watching it, I assumed that the fantasy world was real and didn't consider that it might be her imagination until reading it in another person's review. I think the reason I made that assumption was because I expected the two worlds to be connected somehow, but they aren't. This is an area where I got dissatisfied with the story. It's really two separate stories happening at the same time. They don't connect to each other in any meaningful way, but instead just happen side by side. Both of them were interesting and had some good scenes, but they didn't play off of each other enough IMO.<br/><br/>The characters were also pretty good, but dissatisfying. Captain Vidal was quickly and effectively established as an unsavory person, but his unsavory actions felt believable and consistent. I don't think he has any strong beliefs that drive him to act the way he does, but he doesn't seem to feel regret or moral compunction for them either. Mercedes and the band of rebels are touched upon infrequently, and there are some good scenes and drama that arise from their conflict with the military unit stationed nearby. Ofelia doesn't have much development, but it's easy to put yourself in her shoes as she grapples with the challenges that arise in both of the worlds she is involved in. I thought more could have been done with the Faun. He didn't quite fit with the rest of the movie in the way that he hides the truth from Ofelia.<br/><br/>Finally, the theme of courageous disobedience was inconsistent. I agree with the idea that we should not have our convictions shaken by what punishment may come of it, but it was another thing that I didn't even think of as central to the movie until I read it in a review. I don't want to write the movie off, because there were some solid scenes in it along with good writing and production design and acting. But now looking back at it, I'm left thinking ""so what?"" Overall Rating: 7.1/10."

","Honestly I didn't enjoy this movie nearly as much as I thought I would. I think the movie is more so a war drama than a fantasy. I wish the film's name reflected that. Much of the movie was boring and too tragic for me. Even the fantasy scenes can be depressing. I can't say anything good about the film's dominant elements, because this is a genre I simply don't enjoy. It's also long. It's length is about two hours. I thought the scene with the pale man would be longer, as I've been led to believe by others.<br/><br/>I would say the film is well made, and the visuals are quite nice. I wouldn't recommend this film to any lovers of fantasy. I would recommend it if you like war dramas and seeing good guys die."
"bastiantaibo","8","1","2","22 August 2014"," Del Toro's masterpiece
","Many reviewers complain about this movie being too dark, about it being too cruel by exposing a child lead character to a painful reality she can only escape through fantasy. Actually, the cruelty portrayed is absolutely faithful to the historical context the story takes place in and the fantasy side of Ofelia's adventure is both visually and emotionally breathtaking.<br/><br/>The characters are meant to be one dimensional, black and white as some have described it, because this is a fairy tale at heart. Heroes and innocent characters struggling against perverse villains under the most bleak circumstances. Vidal is both a realistic fascist and true fairy tale villain, Ofelia is both a lost princess in distress and a poor kid suffering for her mother's decisions. The duality of the story between fantasy and reality is greatly projected through it's main characters, successfully conveying the horrors of a civil war that tore a country apart and the need for the fantastic quest that Ofelia undergoes to be true so that she's spared from a miserable life.<br/><br/>Certainly this is not a tale meant for little children, though we should know by now that nothing coming from Guillermo Del Toro's imagination will ever be fit for little kids or impressionable minds in general. Is a dark tale, both in it's real and it's fantastic aspect, a darkness that accomplishes it's goal of showing a grim real world and discovering an astonishingly beautiful yet scary fantasy realm."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","2","9 August 2014"," Horror fairy tale
","Pan's Labyrint is one of those film that could only come into existence in the hands of an exceptional director. In this case Guillermo del Toro. The man in question has proved himself to such a degree that nowadays he can do pretty much anything he wants and it will get greenlighted. And such he is free to pursue his passions and provide us with these breathtakingly beautiful, scary and brilliant movies.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is an excellent example. With a quick glance it's nothing more than a fantasy story with a dark art style and some scary parts. But it's much more than that. Most of the film actually takes place in a Spanish forest estate during the horrors of World War Two. The fairy realm we eventually get to visit is certainly scary-looking and creepy, but the real horror in this film comes the corruption and evil of men, not beasts and creatures.<br/><br/>It's also an interesting film because you're never quite sure how much of it is real. Ofelia's (played brilliantly and convincingly by Ivana Baquero) blight under the tyranny of his new stepfather would make the argument that it's all happening in her head rather probable, but the film is more layered than that. It allows you to choose. Perhaps all of it DOES happen in her head and it's just her way of escaping a horrible reality. But it could all be true. But only if you want it to be.<br/><br/>Saying anything more would spoil the film too much and this is one of those movies that needs to be experienced. A lot of its scariness and atmosphere comes from its unpredictability and its surprises. It's a gorgeous, upsetting, uplifting and wonderful film and one of del Toro's best."

"sme_no_densetsu","8","1","2","15 March 2014"," Multi-layered fantasy from Guillermo del Toro
","In the years since ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, fantasy has become a mainstay on movie screens. There have been many attempts to repeat that success, mostly through adaptation of existing works or so-called re-imaginings of familiar stories. Few movies, however, have been as successful as ""Pan's Labyrinth"", an original conception from Mexican director Guillermo del Toro.<br/><br/>The year is 1944 and amid the backdrop of Fascist Spain a young girl lives an existence that flits between fantasy and reality. The plot's two main threads (one fantastic and one realistic) concern the girl's 'quest' to return to her regal father's side and her 'wicked' step-father's attempts to drive a group of rebels from the nearby mountains.<br/><br/>Although del Toro's Oscar-nominated script uses many of the basic elements of fairy tales the story's imaginativeness & depth elevate it to another level. And like the best fairy tales, the story functions both as escapism and parable. Be advised, though, that the movie can be unflinchingly violent at times.<br/><br/>The acting is well handled throughout with a couple of standout performances. First of all, young Ivana Baquero ably carried the picture in the demanding lead role. Maribel Verdú, meanwhile, provided the best supporting performance as a maid who is secretly aiding the nearby rebels.<br/><br/>del Toro's direction is assured but I felt that the special effects could have been a bit more fluid in a few cases. That's a minor point, though. Also worth noting are the film's three Oscar wins - for cinematography, art direction and makeup. All were worthy of recognition, with the makeup being especially impressive.<br/><br/>In the end, this is a fantasy film that succeeds on multiple levels. The story's apparent simplicity is deceptive since it masks layers of deeper meaning. Definitely one of the best films of 2006 and worth a look for anyone, whether a fantasy fan or otherwise."
"harihar90","10","1","2","15 March 2014"," Pan's labyrinth: beautiful , moving, magical
","Pan's labyrinth is a fairytale, set against the backdrop of a civil war and it straddles those two story lines incredibly well. When dealing with such seemingly incompatible themes, it avoids striking any discordant chords, not by making the war part of it palatable, but rather by making the fairytale darker, and this works remarkably well. The movie does not waste even a frame, and feels almost as tight as ""Infernal affairs"".<br/><br/>I loved Del Torro's aesthetic for this fantasy world and especially his creatures. In this day of CGI overuse, it is gratifying to see such a minimalistic world, and this makes the story feel much more personal and, to me at least, the fantasy much more believable. That, along with superb performances from all the cast, especially Ivana Baquero as the lead, has made this film my all time favorite fantasy movie."

While most of the movie takes place during the Civil War in Spain it follows a young girl into the fantasy world of Pan Labyrinth, which isn't the light and loving fantasy world it is dark and twisted but in such an amazing and beautifully done way.

","Most people seem to be accepting the notion that the girl's fantasy world is a form of compensation and/or escape mechanism for/from the brutal world that surrounds her, but there is much more to it! Those familiar with psychoanalysis, and mainly Jung's deep psychology will recognize a plethora of symbols in the film's images, from lingams to mandalas, archetypical characters like the king and the queen and so on. But what has touched me the strongest is the solemnity and depth of the words pronounced by an unseen priest (?) at some moments, about fate and the wisdom and mercy of God. Some of the most basic religious issues are present in the movie (even the forbidden fruit), as is Jung's concept of individualization. Del Toro wanted to make us think about these issues; the movie is not a contraposition of reality vs fantasy, but an insight into the human mind/soul, and that reminds me of a quote from Herzog's Fitzcarraldo: ""life is a succession of illusions (including violence, I say) that won't allow us to perceive the reality of dreams""."
"Holm03-747-351923","8","1","2","3 August 2013"," Intricate & Dark
","Pan's Labyrinth 2006 Intricate and Dark<br/><br/>With a dubious combination of fantasy and war genres, Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth (2006)exceeds expectations with a memorable plot and riveting characters.<br/><br/>Once the movie is underway, one barely notices the film is in Spanish with English subtitles because the plot is interesting, but nonetheless a sorrowful, dark depiction of the brutality of war.<br/><br/>The story begins with narration; Pablo Adán refers to an underground world without lies and pain and a princess who longed to see the world above. When she escapes, the sun blinds her erasing her memories. She became ill and died, but her father vows to wait for her return. (del Toro, 2006) In Spain, after the Spanish Civil War in 1944, rebels continued to fight against Francisco Franco and his vision for the New Spain. A delightful inquisitive young girl, Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), and her mother Carman (Ariadna Gil) move to Navarra in the Spanish countryside to live with her stepfather Captain Vidal (Sergi López), a fascist murderer who married her mother for her ability to bare him a son. Their trip makes Carmen ill, so the caravan of cars stops to allow her mother time to recover. Obviously interested in fairy tales, Ofelia wonders off and meets an animated stick like insect, she asks the figure to identify itself as a fairy. Carmen calls her and they resume their trip, but the fairy follows them. The insect fairy wakes her in the night and after altering its image to match the picture of a fairy in Ofelia's book, bids her to follow it outside to the labyrinth behind the mill. The stone maze is an abyss with what is described as Faun (Doug Jones, voice: Pablo Adán) at the bottom. The character is part man, part goat, and part alien. The audience is not sure if Faun is good or bad by nature, but Ofelia is not surprised or afraid of him. He tells her she is princess Moanna, a royal daughter of the underground. He gives her a book that he promises will reveal the future, and assigns her three tasks to complete before the full moon in order to regain her kingdom. <br/><br/>Carmen is ill and bedridden. Doctor Ferreiro (Álex Angulo) administers medication without success, and Carmen's condition worsens. Meanwhile, the depiction of the repulsive character of Ofelia's stepfather unfolds. Summoned by his troops, Captain Vidal addresses two local men discovered by his soldiers. He brutally murders the son, breaking a bottle on the center of his face, and repeatedly hitting his nose with the jagged glass bottle edges beats the man's face until his is dead. His father's breakdown in protest causes Vidal to shoot the father at point blank range in the head, and then he returns to the son and shoots him in the head. He scolds his soldiers for bothering him. In order to enforce his power he rations food by storing it at the mill to starve the rebels.He gives Mercedes (Maribel Verdú) his housekeeper the key. Ofelia befriends Mercedes, and talks with her about her encounter with the fairy. She also reveals to Mercedes that she realizes she sympathizes with the rebels. Ofelia conveys to Mercedes that her secret is safe.<br/><br/>The two-worlds simultaneously unfold with Mercedes assisting rebel troops and Captain Vidal killing rebels, and Ofelia's nighttime interactions with Faun, the fairies, a gigantic toad and the lair's monster a Pale Man (Doug Jones). The theme of this film relates to the emotional effect of Ofelia's need of fantasy to escape the impossible circumstances of war, the condition of her mother's pregnancy and the control of her stepfather. <br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth's plot is a reminder of the Narnia series with animated characters that require main characters to behave or suffer consequences. The character development follows the unnatural behaviors that internal conflicts of war imposed as expressed in the visual metaphor of the Spanish soldier's costumes evocative of German Nazis. These play out in the setting of the mill in Spain that serves to coincide with the social fascist structure of Francisco Franco in 1944. The unlikely transitions from fantasy to war are expertly acted, with credit given to del Toro for depicting the two masterfully.<br/><br/>The cinematography in the movie is superb. The triad harmony of the fantasy world with the advancing colors of red, yellow,orange, and lavender make the objects appear larger with low angled shots. In the natural world, del Toro uses dark lighting with receding colors that emphasize green and pale blue to depict the depth of the war images and a somber mood. The low-key lighting in the labyrinth emphasized the surrealism of the subconscious to process the setting. <br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth contains very disturbing abstruse scenes with interesting animation and intrigue that draws viewers to continue watching. The combination genres fantasy and war will probably appeal to an esoteric audience, one that appreciates the psychology and impractical combination or film students studying film appreciation."

","Pan's labyrinth has several levels and it depends on what people want themselves to see. It's a sad story to me. The little girl Ofelia lives in a destructive world. Her mom was controlled by her husband, a sadistic army officer; she has no friends, except for a maid who is planning for a final revolution and doesn't have much time care about her; she even has only limited food (remember the two grapes she took in the dungeon). There is no hope for this young little girl. Then she created an imagining world, where she can see magics, can protect herself and can fulfill missions to compensate her broken heart. I'm sure some of the people who watched this movie must have faith that all these magics and happy endings (she finally becomes a princess) the littler girl experienced are true.

","Acclaimed director Guillermo del Toro (""Hellboy"", ""The Devil's Backbone""), creates one of the most exciting and visually stunning adult-themed fables ever. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is one of the cinema's great fantasies--rich with darkness and wonder. It's a fairy tale of such potency and grandeur, that it reconnects the adult imagination to our primal thrill, and horror stories that held us spellbound as children. As gruesome and brutal as it is enchanting and spellbinding--""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a movie intended for adults. It is a harsh, uncompromising film--but equally just as beautiful and moving.""Pan's Labyrinth"" is itself a narrative maze, with multiple stories that branch apart and back together again. This dark fairy tale plays out against the backdrop of Spain in 1944. A monstrous Fascist captain (López) is determined to flush out soldiers of the resistance, as his pregnant wife arrives at his countryside headquarters with her young daughter. The young girl Ofelia (Baquero), escapes the brutality of her new environment by drifting into a fantasy world where she comes across a mysterious faun. The faun tells her that she is a princess from a kingdom in the underground. The faun also tells that her that her father is waiting for her, but she needs to accomplish three challenging and dangerous assignments first. Ofelia's challenges do not arise like arbitrary plot obstacles--they are organic to her (and the movie's) development. She learns not only to follow instructions--and that there are heavy prices to pay for failing to abide by them. But also to trust her own instincts about what is right and wrong. In order to find her true self, she must also find the her inner-strength to break the rules imposed by authority. An individual conscience. What could be a more powerful anti- fascist weapon than that? In a dark, harsh, and violent world, Ofelia lives in her magical world trying to survive her tasks and see her father again. Soon, the line between fantasy and reality begins to blur, and before Ofelia can turn back, she finds herself at the center of the ferocious battle between Good and Evil. Incredibly unique fable that blends fantasy and fearsome violence, ultimately merging the two stories together. Superbly realized--a rare film that invites repeated viewings to fully absorb all that writer- director del Toro has put into it. Oscar winner for Cinematography, Makeup, and Art Direction."

","I found Pans Labyrinth to be a quite enjoyable film. I think had a captivating story line and equally good characters, with the typical heros (the girl and mercedes) and Villains (the captain) fairy tale style format. The film was a basic fairy tale/fantasy style but with a definite more mature element to it as the film contained some fairly gory and scary scenes, for example the pale man and the captains murdering of the rabbit hunter with the bottle. I think that the goal of these more mature film style scenes are possibly to make the film appeal to a wider audience, although this does some what lose the younger audiences as they would no doubt find certain scenes quite disturbing. The film has some very good CGI elements to it also, nothing incredible but still quite good, a good example of this being the faun. in conclusion i found Pans Labyrinth an average film, this may be largely due to personal prefereance as i do not usually watch fantasy films but all in all an all round good easy to watch film. 7/10."

I can see that other who has given a review on this movie has claimed that the gore is very explicit but also very necessary. I just cannot agree on this. That Captain Vidal is evil itself could have been shown in much more subtle ways - and when this is done it is often much more terrifying as it makes your imagination picture what is not shown and the result is, that you picture what you yourself think is the ultimate evil.<br/><br/>I have heard off and actually met people who, when they were children made up a fantasy world or a fantasy friend. The reason for this can be many. It can be a matter of needing someone to confide in, or a matter of feeling lonely. In the case of Ofelia I understood her imaginary world as a result of escapism. She has a very lyrical and poetic mind and desperately needs to avoid or deny reality as it is both very hostile and out of her control and this together makes her create a world that she can interact with and through the tests that she is given she is also able to control it. An example of this is that she is all of a sudden able to do something about her mother's very problematic pregnancy.<br/><br/>Because I wasn't entertained this doesn't mean that this picture isn't great or isn't worth seeing; the theme is important and the acting is splendid.<br/><br/>Regards Simon<br/><br/>Ps.

"btm1","10","3","12","30 September 2009"," Engossing but not for children
","This film is often called a fantasy. Fantasy is correct only in that a part of the film takes place in the imagination (or, delusion) of a girl who is escaping from the horrendous reality of a brutal civil war in which fascists were the victors whose dictator (Franco) ruled Spain long after the end of the German and Italian fascist regimes. It is definitely NOT A FILM FOR CHILDREN. Aside from the fantasy portion being mostly as dark, ugly and dangerous as a horror movie, the lengthier reality portion presented chilling shots of torture and an unfeeling sadistic commanding officer.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, for adults, it is an engrossing, if disturbing film. Although in the film the leftist Republicans have a local victory, defeating the Fascist military unit sent to hunt them down, in real life the war ended with the victory of the right-wing rebel forces (with military support from Nazi Germany), the overthrow of the Republican government, and the founding of a dictatorship led by General Francisco Franco. After the civil war ended in April 1939, all right-wing parties were merged into the single Fascist party of the Franco regime.<br/><br/>I read where there were parallels between the fantasy and the reality portions of the movie. Perhaps the moral is that despite the real death of the heroine (the Republican regime), it was not completely forgotten and eventually its sprouts and blossoms grew again."

","**SPOILER ALERT**<br/><br/>While not a new movie, I think Guillermo del Toro's ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is still worth reviewing five years after it's 2006 release. First and foremost, this film reminds us that fairy tales were never meant for children. Mostly born from local legends and superstitions passed down through oral tradition, ""faerie tales"" were made popular a century later in Paris' belle epoch, and even later through the German romantic period of literature. In American popular culture, it's easy to remember that Ariel doesn't get her prince at the end of The Little Mermaid, she gives her own life rather than bring harm to her prince, who sleeps with his head on his true lover's breast. Again through Disney's prudish filter, Sleeping Beauty doesn't conclude neatly with a wedding; in the original story, her prince knocks up her unconscious body (hello, near necrophilia) and she eventually wakes giving birth to twins, cold and alone in the castle. My point is this-- director Guillermo de Toro doesn't shy away from the earliest components of true faerie tales: brutality, sensuality, terror and horror, moral ambiguity, sacrifice. In fact, he wallows in them, and invites the viewer to revel in a visual orgy of color, dark symbolism, the fantastic and terrible.<br/><br/>If there was any doubt that this movie is not for children, some of the opening sequences will quickly settle the matter. It seems to take place in northern Spain at the end of the Spanish Civil War, in the camp of the fascist regime, whose goal is to route out and exterminate the last of the rebels hiding in the mountains. The Captain of this camp is a sadistic thug who could teach Hannibal Lechter a few things about inspiring terror. He brings his pregnant wife and her precocious daughter from a prior marriage into the camp, as he is rabidly anxious for the arrival of his sun. In one of the first scene, he brutally beats a man to death, and the upclose camera never flinches away. The story centers around the young daughter, Ofelia. Obsessed with fantasy and the idea of happily ever after, but really is it any wonder, as she is growing up in war-torn Spain, her biological father presumably dead, her step-father a monster, and an absent minded mother growing increasingly ill and distracted by the baby she carries in her womb. <br/><br/>It is curious to note that the worse things become in reality, the more fantastic the creatures and tasks presented in Ofelia's other world become. Following the theme of traditional folklore faerie tales, like Persephone she is warned against eating whilst in the under world. Ofelia is not wholly unlike Alice down the rabbit hole; they are both curious, precocious girls thrust into a fantastical world. But there the similarity ends for me. Ofelia is gritty in a way Alice could never be. In one quest Ofelia tries to provide esoteric help for her mother, who writhes sick in childbed with her unborn brother, and in another she enlists the help of faeries to retrieve a stolen token by a great fat toad killing the roots what may be viewed as a world tree (Cabbala). Alice must decide between a potion that makes her small and a cookie that makes her large, Ofelia is offered the entirety of her fantasy world, if like Abraham, she delivers her newborn brother for sacrifice.<br/><br/>I can't recommend this movie strongly enough, but likely it will not be received well by the masses, for the simple reason that it is in Spanish, and subtitled rather than dubbed. So put the kids to bed, turn off the Disney channel, and give this movie a try. If you are anything like me you'll get so swept up in the story you'll forget you're even having to read subtitles. You'll be too busy being horrified, in wonder, heart-sore from the tragedy and hopeful that even in this gritty, uncompromising faerie tale, there might still be some sort of happily ever after."

","A young girl named Ofelia (Baquero) living in Spain in 1944 during the Franco regime is taken by her pregnant mother (Gil) to live with her Fascist Franco loyalist and commander stepfather (López) in a remote part of central Spain. Her life becomes more interesting when upon she encounters a faun (Doug Jones) who tells her she may be more important to the realm of another world. <br/><br/>My Review: <br/><br/>Director Guillermo Del Toro gives his final film of the trilogy that really mixes and mingles fantasy and brute horror to unconventional ways. With 'Cronos' and 'The Devil's Backbone' now in the bag, his focus shifts from Mexican vampires and ghost children in orphanages to mythical fantasy and brutal war time horror. <br/><br/>With the recent success of European directors conjuring up landmark films director Del Toro has come back and delivered a sophisticated piece to his earlier Spanish film, it really is his finest hour. <br/><br/>We get to focus on young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), who is nothing short of well played introverted child who' life is change at the sudden appearance of a faun. Del Toro proves his direction with child actors is yet again undiminished, his continuous efforts to weave great performances through younger generation actors that seem to have refined talent. <br/><br/>We need a baddie, and who is better than that of demented and paranoid dictator/stepfather Vidal (Sergi López). His personality equally matched in his commitment of a neurotic approach to ending the rebellion/resistance, as if he were Darth Vader in 1940's Spain. But being the stepfather of Ofelia suggests that with his current regime he'd rather care about passing on his lineage to an unborn son and half-brother to Ofelia. And you though step- mothers were bad. <br/><br/>Supporting Ofelia and the tyranny of Vidal is maid Mercedes (Maribel Verdú) whom is really known well enough for her impressive number of films in Spain. She supports Ofelia and her mother after a few distraught ordeals, however, never underestimate a lion is sheep's clothing, when given a chance so see what Mercedes can do with a knife. <br/><br/>The stunning taste of fate playing into effect as this seemingly young girl, who was assumed ordinary is now drawn into a bemused revelation of that she is to be a princess of a supernatural world. Del Toro plays with the actual and imaginary aspects of a child in a sense that they become blurred, is this actually real, or is it that her imaginings runaway with her? It's hard to guess, you'd rather not go for the latter even when she arrives at an old mill in cutoff Spanish woodland, clutching a parcel of books filled with fairy tales. <br/><br/>CGI delivers, it definitely delivers with magical sequences and real cringe-maker scenes. An adult tale dealing with the stuff of fantasy that is rooted in children. <br/><br/>Verdict: <br/><br/>You can never be too old for any fairytale. This one deserved the rare score: 10/10."
"gavin6942","10","2","7","7 July 2007"," A Historical Fantasy-Drama With Dark Wonderland Elements
","Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a young girl in 1940s fascist Spain, lives two lives: one in the real world, where her father is dead and her stepfather is an evil army captain, and another where she is a princess in a fairy tale. Worlds collide as she tries to escape one for the other and finds cruelty behind every corner.<br/><br/>I want to go on record as saying as far as ""horror"" films go, this one is not really horror at all and I would classify it as ""fantasy-drama"". But as far as movies in general go, this one was probably the best film of 2006, even beating out Darren Aronofsky's excellent ""The Fountain"". All aspects of a film that can be analyzed were present in top form here.<br/><br/>The acting was simply amazing. The captain was evil incarnate, yet believably human -- these sorts of men did exist and still do. Putting a human face on a devilish beast is no easy task, but it was done in spades here. The main character, Ofelia, was likewise amazing: for being only 11, she out-acted many of the adults in this feature and gave off a look of natural innocence combined with childlike confidence. I cannot recall the last time such a young actor really made that sort of impression on me.<br/><br/>The directing was quite well done with some breathtaking cinematography. In one memorable scene, the captain is looking at a derailed train and the angle shows him against a sky of blue-grey. I felt this really captured the whole mood of the film -- a skyline that said ""there is no hope here"", a permanent twilight. Glorious! <br/><br/>The special effects blew my mind. I detest CGI, but here it seemed to almost blend in with the real world in a seamless way. The insects, faeries, and everything else were just great, and the actress was able to interact with them in such a way as to think she was really looking at them. Just incredible -- I hope more films pay attention to how they accomplished this, because if CGI is not going to to go away, the least they can do is make it look good. (Compare Doug Jones from here -- the faun -- to Doug Jones from ""Hellboy"" -- Abe Sapien -- and you will see what I mean about good and bad CGI.) <br/><br/>For the horror fans: you will love how they did the special effects and makeup for the blood and violence. There is a man who gets his nose bashed in with a rifle butt, and another man who get his mouth slit to his ear. Both, in my opinion, look very realistic. Similar things might appear in horror films, but not often on this level of quality.<br/><br/>Do I need to get into the plot? The fantasy part is great, like ""Silent Hill"" but actually with a sense of continuity to it. (""Silent Hill"" is awful.) The real-world part was also well-done, as we have seen many WWII films, but how many take place in Spain? Not nearly enough. The comparison this film gets most -- and del Toro admits an influence -- is ""The Spirit of the Beehive"". The connection is definitely there, but ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is its own vision and may have even exceeded its predecessor.<br/><br/>Please see this movie. I held off for many months, thinking it could not possibly match the hype. But it does match the hype, and really should be seen. Why are you wasting your time with crud like ""Lady in the Water"" when the best film of 2006 (fantasy or otherwise) is right here?"

(Good call on the Rating ""R"") One couple even got up and left after the first gory scene and never returned.<br/><br/>Overall, the story line was great, but it's not the same caliber movie as Lord of the Rings as some reviews have stated!!

The screenplay was somewhat dull for me, like if it was not exactly finished. The characters are way too dumb to be real and the mistakes they make does not fit on their own personality. Taking for granted the Doctor that says to the rebels that it is impossible to win against the captain and some time later he sign his own death sentence offending the captain in front of his men. The lighting is good, but the film is too cold for the movie. The outdoor scenes are very plain due to the lack of color saturation. I believe the Pan was a very colorful character but one cannot see this due to the overall coldness of the shooting. The movie is not bad either, but in my opinion it has serious flaws and if this was a typical Hollywood production instead of a cult movie the criticism would be unforgiving."

The movie feels disingenuous throughout. It presents a fantasy world which is never more than an excuse, and which lacks any real mythology. And it presents a reality that is more of a caricature than a fairy tale.<br/><br/>By the end of the labyrinth, it was evident that there was no labyrinth. The very direct purpose is to bluntly sell the a simplistic political narrative under the guise of a child's vision.<br/><br/>The biggest problem for me was that the fairytale aspects of the movie seem tacked on, and most ""fantasy"" scenes don't seem to have any reason to them. This fantastical world is never developed or explored upon. Particularly, the whole Banquet hand-eyed monster (which seem's directly from silent hill), as awesome as it looks, appears to be present solely for shock value. Which is a constant that extends through a lot of the more gruesome moments of the story.<br/><br/>It seems that there is an intent to be art-house, but beneath that initial impression, Violence is gratuitous and juvenile, characters are laughably one-sided and ridiculous (good are good, bad are bad, and cautious are traitors).<br/><br/>So yeah, to me it was extremely disappointing, Seems like most of the ratings respond more to the effectiveness of it's shock value. While the simplistic fable of a political message is ignored.
However, on my analysis this movie not nearly as profound as it hopes to be."

"dfle3","10","2","8","10 January 2010"," A wonderful fairytale for adults...
","Set in Spain, during World War II (I saw the version with English subtitles), this story concerns the family of a Spanish officer, Captain Vidal (Sergi López). Captain Vidal has had his wife Carmen (Ariadna Gil) move to a region of Spain where he has to combat rebels. Carmen also brings her daughter, Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), from a previous relationship. At their new home, domestic and military duties play out.<br/><br/>Even though this movie is a fantastic fairytale, I don't think it is suitable for pre-teens, as it does have some gory violence.<br/><br/>The English translation of the film's title is more specific than the Spanish title I think. ""Pan"" is the name of a human/animal hybrid type god in Greek mythology (a satyr, I think...or analogous to that). The Spanish title for this film, I believe, merely refers to the kind creature that Pan is, not a specific creature.<br/><br/>Anyway, little girl Ofelia encounters a satyr/faun near her new home. That (unnamed) satyr gives her three tasks to accomplish some objective which is not told to her. To someone unfamiliar with the specifics of the myths represented, I have to say I was unsure whether the creature was good or evil. There are some fantastic looking scenes for these elements of the story in any case.<br/><br/>The melding of the everyday and fairytale imagery works wonderfully well in this movie. You could say that you can interpret the movie as working on two levels...a world where myth and reality co-exist, or a world where we experience the mental life of the child, Ofelia.<br/><br/>To that extent, the ending is ambiguous...it works well however one interprets the status of this myth/reality we have experienced. If it was all Ofelia's inner mental life, then one can view it as something of a consolation for her.<br/><br/>Highly recommended. You may also enjoy the movie ""Let the right one in"". Another story for adults. An American remake is being filmed...see the original, please!"
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","10","2","8","27 December 2009"," Not for me, but I'm not going to deny that it is excellent
","Many aren't going to believe the following; I have never been into faerie tales. I questioned the logic, the concept of pure evil, etc., from when I first heard them. And honestly, when I initially came into contact with Del Toro's work(with Mimic, possibly nearly ten years ago by now), I did not care for it. It's pretty clear to anyone who's seen any of the flicks by him that he is big on fantasy. And you know what? I didn't love this, but I can be objective enough to see that it is a brilliant piece, and that is largely because of him. He injects such ample amounts of imagination and creativity(and unlike Hellboy 2, he focuses properly, and doesn't put an excess of beings up on the screen, so *everything* otherworldly in this has an impact). This feels like one of the classic stories, and I really mean that, not the Disney-fied, sanitized version, no, the original, from when they were written down and further back. If you don't already know, let me make it clear to you; this is *not* for children. It is an adult film(stop snickering), with themes and visuals not for young minds and eyes. This is disgusting, creepy, grotesque and unpleasant. It is not for everyone. The editing and cinematography, in general, the look of this, is just *gorgeous*. Every acting performance is spot-on. I am thoroughly impressed by the 11-year-old Baquero. To be that talented at that age is always noteworthy. Doug Jones is *the* man you want to put in heavy make-up, and he yet again proves his outstanding dedication. The effects and live-action elements meld rather well. There is a lot of graphic, bloody violence and disturbing content, as well as, apparently, a little strong language(meanwhile, I don't speak Spanish well enough to tell, so...) in this. The DVD holds a brief intro by Guillermo, where he says that this came close to killing him. From the Trivia, he clearly put a ton of effort into this, and it truly paid off. Whether or not you like this or any other movie of his, in my book, he deserves respect. I recommend this to any fan of the genre. 10/10"

I have seen many films-this was the most horrific as far as violence goes ( too much violence is Not a good thing) not for some one with a weak stomach. see if it you want a headache by the end of the show or maybe rent it, with the option to turn it off 2/3 of the way through"

","The Hellboy movies and Blade II all carry the unmistakable Guillermo del Toro visual stamp, but Pan's Labyrinth seems to be the flick that most reflect his deep, dark soul. I've been obsessed with this movie since first viewing it on a battery operated DVD player in the midst of a power failure blackout, which turned out to be the perfect environs for this disturbing anti-fantasy classic. The DVD commentary clarifies a bit as to whether the little girl playing the lead is really piercing the fabric of myth, or if she's just living out an escapist fantasy to escape from her epically grim reality - but much is still left open to the viewer's interpretation.<br/><br/>Despite the subtitles (rough on those of us with the attention span of a gnat on meth), this movie sucked me in like no other I can recall in recent memory. It's astounding and thought provoking - and, oh yeah, a couple of scenes are scary as all getout! That creepy critter that holds its eyeballs in its hands freaked me out so much, I shouted out loud the first time he went all del Toro!"
"Acolin_f","10","2","9","30 August 2009"," 3 Oscars is only half the story.
","Guillermo del Toro's foreign film won 3 Oscars for 2006, for Best Achievement in Art Direction, Best Achievement in Cinematography and Best Achievement in Makeup. That is only half the story.<br/><br/>Look at the nominations and you can see why this is an outstanding film and one of the best movies of last year. Pan's Labyrinth was nominated for Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures/Original Score, Best Foreign Language Film of the Year and Best Writing/Original Screenplay (great story by Guillermo del Toro).<br/><br/>Del Toro has indeed created something very special - part war movie, part fantasy, that everyone should see. This is a very 'visual' film that does not rely overly on dialogue. I wish I had seen it in the movie theater. I had none of the why questions. It is much better than the closet tale of Narnia, more compelling and easier easy to watch than Lord of the Rings 2, and yet as political as Schindler's List.<br/><br/>Although the young girl's fantasy world juxtaposes her harsh real world, it is not mere escapism. The movie is too shocking for most kids, and some adults. It is not gory, but it is realistically violent. If you liked V for Vendetta and History of Violence, you will like this movie.<br/><br/>Like V, the real world dilemma of the plot is simple: good versus shocking evil. Face-to-face fascism in a glance. Submission of good and kind souls. The evil that men do. The young girl and her mother are trapped by circumstances. While the promise of the fantasy world is appropriately extraordinary, the fantasy challenges (tests) Pan's heroine faces are more realistic that the outlandish ones in Lord of the Rings. In Rings, each challenge is supposedly impossible to overcome, yet its group of heroes easily wins and not with special gifts that aid them in overcoming their adversary. Besides, the computer generated graphic images (CGI) fills the screen endlessly with fake backgrounds. In Pan's, the heroine succeeds because of her innate goodness, and yet makes tragic mistakes.<br/><br/>Pan's graphics intrude into the stark reality of WWII. In the beginning, CGI offer a glimmer of magic, hope and possibility, which we and the young heroine spy. The tension of the real world drama adds to the movie as the girl moves back and forth between the real world and fantasy land. The tragedy of the real world, and the failings in the fantasy, add suspense, moving the story along and keeping it interesting. In Narnia, there is no interaction between real and fantasy world, the heroes somehow easily conquer and win their fantastic destinies, all in gorgeous and endless CGI packed landscapes.<br/><br/>I normally can't watch the audio commentary; it is so full of meaningless crap. Yet the one for this film was as interesting as the one for Young Frankenstein. If you are an avid movie lover, as am I, I found de Toro's references to other movies and techniques fascinating.<br/><br/>I've seen a few good movies recently. I also like the wonderful Judi Dench and Cate Blanchette (always good) in Notes on A Scandal, Sharon Stone's incredible and Justin Timberlake's surprisingly good performance in the disturbing Alpha Dog and the fantastic Helen Mirren in The Queen (see the bizarre The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover (1989) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097108/)."

Mr. Del Toro made such an original and stunning movie. This powerful metaphor about the eternal battle between good and evil warms our hearts and freezes our blood in the same time.

","This is a strange movie. In some regards, it is very well made -- acting, direction, editing are very well done. But I hope you don't see this movie for these reasons -- because the story is sick, sick, sick.<br/><br/>The violence of the war portion of the movie is over-the-top. There is so much disgusting unnecessary violence that it merits its own description: sicko-bleedo. As other critical reviews here have said, the war story has no redeeming qualities, no characters that I would want to meet and talk with. Likewise the fantasy story is without value, only a pastiche of fantasy elements that never come into a living, breathing life.<br/><br/>What is more troubling to me is the very high rating and awards this twisted movie has gotten. I am concerned about what is happening to the taste of American moviegoers. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It has perfected my growing concerns -- I no longer trust the IMDb rating system to guide me.<br/><br/>This movie is without soul; or rather, perhaps it has a soul, dark, noxious, cold. A slouching beast. What Yeats says applies here: ""the ceremony of innocence is drowned""; the child is unable to live alive in either world. Better to read his poem."
"daleth5941","5","2","9","11 February 2007"," Trailers were TOTALLY misleading!
","I found this movie totally misleading by the trailers which I saw. The trailers indicated a movie with high visual effects based on mythical beings in a mythical world. Maybe 10% of this movie is about the mythical beings and the rest is really about a young girl's experience during the Franco-American War.<br/><br/>It is not a mythical Science-Fiction type of movie.<br/><br/>However, it is good if you want to view a high amount of violence based on a tyrannical Captain and his troops.<br/><br/>This is DEFINITELY NOT a feel-good movie. Instead, it was moderately depressing with a sad ending."
"delenca","6","2","9","3 January 2007"," A disappointment
","I was all prepared to love this movie. I loved ""La Cite des Enfants Perdus"" (City of Lost Children) and have no problem with dark fairy tales. Given all the hype surrounding Pan's Labyrinth, I was therefore excited about this movie. In the end, I have to say that the only thing about this movie that is excellent is the cinematography and music. Beautiful velvia, dark, high contrast and moody shadows fall across the screen surrounded by a haunting, plaintive lullaby. However, beneath this superficial gloss we find a disorganized, messy movie, full of loose ends, gratuitous gore, and simplistic characterization. Could the Captain be any more evil? How over-the-top does the Captain have to act before he evokes laughter rather than -the intended- fear, contempt? How much more blatantly obvious did Mercedes before the captain acted on it? Just what point is achieved is showing the Captain mash a peasant's face in - and later, - sow his own lip? Gore in movies like ""Saving Private Ryan"" had a point - here they seem gratuitous. How much more saintly could the rebels be? And what of the obvious set up for a sequel - the captain's baby in the rebels' hands - could it be any less subtle? Finally, and most importantly, can the aftermath of the horrendous Spanish Civil War really be simplified to such black and white characters?<br/><br/>Let's call this movie for what it is - a promising, but flawed, exercise by an up-and-coming director. It is a beautiful picture saddled by overwrought and melodramatic characters that drain the storyline of moral weight. If this is an excellent movie/fairy tale, as we are told by Cannes and critics everywhere, I'll remind you of a fairy tale that _does_ pack some punch - ""The Emperor's New Clothes""."
"Cineanalyst","4","1","3","14 January 2020"," Superficial Spirits
","I gave ""The Shape of Water"" (2017) high marks, but I'm not finding Guillermo del Toro to be a very interesting filmmaker as of yet despite the praise he receives from others. The same reservations I had for his Best Picture Oscar winner, I hold for this, ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" but this earlier picture also lacks the reflexive inversion of a classic film (in that case, ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" (1954) to partially make up for it. I held out hope, too, finally coming to this due to rumors of it sharing similarities with Lewis Carroll's Alice books, for which I've been seeking a bunch of related movies lately. Unfortunately, besides the rabbit-hole-like entries to a fantasy land, the dress and the business with small doors, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" doesn't really have anything to do with Alice's adventures; instead, it's a bland conflation of a generic fairy tale seemingly of del Toro's own design. Girl must solve quests given to her by a faun to become princess. I'm not counting it among the Alice films I've been collecting.<br/><br/>So, what does ""Pan's Labyrinth"" offer us, then? As in the rest of his oeuvre, the visuals and CGI impress, although they're darkly lit. But, the characterizations and storytelling is exceedingly simplistic. In the home-video commentary, del Toro valorizes the perspective of a child, which seems to be something he's unfortunately internalized. Consequently, there's no complexity, no nuance to his world. The baddies are bad and the goodies are good. The faun and ferries are supposedly a bit more ambiguous, but not by much. As in ""The Shape of Water,"" there are nurturing mother figures, good spies, and Sergi López plays the same role here that Michael Shannon occupies in the later production, to play dastardly and even to be physically mutilated. In this one, even the fairytale magic and the historical drama hardly interact, although they're both juvenile visions lacking intricacy. The opposite of a labyrinth.<br/><br/>The framework on display here is too facile even for superhero fare, which is why his ""Hellboy"" movies suffered, too. Even there, he began to ground their narratives in other movies, by connection to Universal's classic monster movies, which may be one of the more obvious methods to enrich a picture, but it may be all that can be hoped for with a filmmaker of this limited of a vision. ""The Shape of Water"" may be the pinnacle of that, and I don't see where he can improve from there without altering this formula For Pan's Labyrinth, set directly after the Spanish Civil War, a conspicuous filmic precedent is ""The Spirit of the Beehive"" (1973), which is also about a child looking to fantasy to cope with the horrors of reality (in that case, through the classic ""Frankenstein"" (1931) film). ""Beehive"" is vastly more sophisticated than ""Labyrinth,"" as well as visually richer. It engages intellectually by its oblique stance to its subject and earns its emotional appeals to the spectator by such depth. By contrast, this movie is simple, superficial and spiritless."
"david_rudy_lee","10","1","3","24 August 2019"," Beautiful Dark Fairy Tale
","This film was one that I heard about it, but it took me until after I graduated from college to actually see. I had seen a couple of writer/director Guillermo del Toro films previous, so I had an idea what I was expecting coming in. After that first viewing, I was literall blown away if I'm honest. This is now my third time seeing this, with the previous two times in the theater, which is an experience. The synopsis is in the Falangist Spain of 1944, the bookish young stepdaughter of a sadistic army officer escapes into an eerie, but captivating fantasy world.<br/><br/>We begin with a girl, she has blood coming out of her nose and it is going in reverse. She is Ivana Baquero. We then get voice over as the same girl is fleeing from an underground city. We learn that she was princess there and fled to Earth, but then passed away. Her father the king is staying alive until her soul comes back.<br/><br/>It then shift to Ofelia (Baquero) in the back of a car with her mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil). She is pregnant and married to captain Vidal (Sergi López). We learn that Spain just ended a civil war and the fascist regime won. He's having her come to the castle that is their base of operations as they hunt the remaining rebels. He believes that his son should be born where his father is.<br/><br/>Ofelia loves fairy tales. On their journey to the castle, her mother becomes ill and needs to get out for air. While this is happening, Ofelia finds a stone of an eye. Nearby she finds a statue that it is missing from and puts it back. From the statue's mouth comes an insect. Ofelia thinks it is a fairy and tells her mother so.<br/><br/>They're met by Vidal, who is annoyed they're 15 minutes late. He pressures Carmen to get into a wheelchair, stating that she shouldn't be putting any unneeded stress on herself. Ofelia walks away from the vehicles, chasing after the insect she saw earlier.. It leads her to a gate of a stone structure. The woman that runs the household operations of the base is Mercedes (Maribel Verdú). She tells Ofelia that this is an old structure and to not go into it.<br/><br/>Mother and daughter share a room, knowing that this new place might spook Ofelia. A doctor visits Carmen, Dr. Ferreiro (Álex Angulo). He gives her some medicine to help her sleep. In the night, Ofelia is visited by the insect again. At first she doesn't see it and it scares her. She shows a picture to it and it changes into an actual fairy. It has her follow it to the labyrinth. In the center, she goes down stairs to find a creature known as a Fauno (Doug Jones). I'm assuming he is actually Pan and that a fauno is like a Satyr in Greek mythoogy. He tells her that she is a princess of a magical kingdom. The full moon is coming so if she wants to go back, she needs to complete three tasks. A book is given to her that will tell her what to do. Is what Ofelia is seeing real or just her way of coping with the things she's going through?<br/><br/>This is now my third time seeing this and I've definitely lucked out. My last two viewings have been in the theater on 35mm film. It is quite the experience. The first thing I have to say about the film is that del Toro can make some beautiful films. The castle is such an old and amazing setting. It is isolated and there are rebels around it. This is in stark contrast with the mythical places that Ofelia goes to that look so real. The creatures he creates are so interesting and I just want to learn more about them. I also love the allegory about what she is doing as she copes with the new environment that she is in. Her imagination definitely runs away with her, but things that she does are actually happening in the world around her as well. It definitely bends belief and understanding.<br/><br/>I also love the story of Vidal striving for greatness and trying to live up to his father, who was a much more honorable man than him. I get the idea that his father was hard on him and that he never really did live up what the lofty goals. I almost get the idea that is why he is such an evil character, that he is going to be great no matter what.<br/><br/>This is also interesting in tackling the ideas of the Spanish Civil War. It didn't click with me until this last viewing that it was during World War II. I knew that Spain kind of sided with Germany and Italy, but it makes sense. Their country was in turmoil so they really couldn't participate. It is also powerful that Mercedes and Dr. Ferreiro are putting their lives on the line, when though we know how evil the man they're living with is. There is a tough scene to watch where Vidal actually tortures a soldier to get information.<br/><br/>Now I do have to say, for a film that runs almost 2 hours, it doesn't feel like it. I never get bored. It gives us the back-story, introduces us to the characters and then just goes on its way. There are such magical things that Ofelia sees and even though you know that it's probably not real, she thinks it is. I like thought hat the things she is doing actually have real world implications. The ending is sad, but I think it is fitting for the type of film we are getting here of a dark fairy tale.<br/><br/>The acting is something that really helps it as well. Baquero is really good for being a child actress. I feel myself wanting to protect her and wishing she would stop doing these things that hurt her mother. She is bringing unwanted attention on herself and ultimately those around her. She did a really good job. López is also really good. He is such a villain that you want him to lose. I think if you can get a reaction out of me, you are doing something right and that is exactly what he did. Verdú, Gil and Angulo are all really solid as well. It is interesting that Verdú is kind of the third main character, which I love the duality that she has with Vidal. He underestimates her in a misogynistic way and that storyline plays out very well. Shout out to Jones who is such a great body actor as the Fauno and Pale Man. The rest of the cast rounded out the film for what is needed as well.<br/><br/>Something I needed to cover here is the effects. There are some really good practical effects here, but the surprising thing is the CGI. It's is quite amazing that his film is from 2006 and it goes CGI, but it looks so real. From the insects to things that we see in the fantasy world even to what happens with Vidal's face. They all so real and it does show that if you know what you're doing and have the movie, you can really use CGI to your advantage. The film is also shot beautifully.<br/><br/>The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack. For the most part it fits for the scenes for what is needed. They went more orchestral which actually helps with bringing the feeling of this being a dark fairy tale. I also wanted to comment that there is almost a 'theme song'. It turns out that it is from Mercedes and it is a nursery rhyme. She doesn't remember the words, but hums the tune. I like it though as it is both comforting and haunting.<br/><br/>Now with that said, this is an amazing film. I like that del Toro can suck me in with a dark fairy that is showing the effects of what the Spanish Civil War and this young girl's plight. It definitely is a modern one and I really like the allegories we are seeing. The pacing of this really helps to keep it interesting as it never gets boring in it's two hour running time. The acting really helps as well as it is good across the board. The effects are something else that even though it uses a lot of CGI, it doesn't bother me as it looks amazing. Soundtrack for the film definitely fits for what is needed and I love the tune that is hummed for sure. I will warn you, this film is from Mexico and Spain, so I had to watch it with subtitles on. If that's an issue, avoid this. If not though, if you've never seen this film I highly recommend it for horror and non-horror fans alike."
"ninjachewit","10","1","3","13 November 2018"," A modern masterpiece of fantasy
","This movie is the best ""New Weird"" piece of fiction I have ever experienced. If it was written in novel form, it would be a true fantasy fiction classic. The world itself is imbedded in the dark atmosphere of the Spanish Civil War. Yet it emphasizes the values of family, not in its traditional senses, but through the lens of fantasy, the magic and unpredictability of family is strengthened with imagery. The only thing or cure that can transcend the physical separation and ideological differences with each other is the common need for love (emphasized by the mandrake). When the mandrake is thrown in the fire, it is the abandonment of love, and that is emphasized through fantasy as life itself. So when one willingly gives their life up for a stranger through this shared sense of love, it forms such a connection that transcends both ideology and war itself. That is what Del Toro's masterpiece portrays in its vivid and highly imaginative world of fantasy. A truly gripping film, and an evocative masterpiece that transcends any further description."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","3","16 April 2017"," Interesting mix of fantasy and war/politics
","""El laberinto del fauno"" is a Mexican/Spanish/American movie from 2006, so this one had its 10th anniversary last year. It is all in the Spanish language, so you will find no Hollywood actors in the cast here. Even with the Hellboy duology in his body of work, this is probably still the most known work by writer and director Guillermo del Toro, unless you count his writing credit for the Hobbit movie. Anyway, this one we have here runs for slightly under two hours including credits and it is a mix of fantasy movie and politics movie. It is set in Spain in the year 1944, so times were tumultuous, even if there is no real focus on the current global or European political climate from that time outside Spain. But that is perfectly fine. There are probably a 100 well-known films (from abroad) out there about the consequences and direct effects of World War II in Germany and probably another 1,000 that are not so well-known, so it is perfectly fine for once to have one that focuses on another country that we virtually know nothing about from films what the situation was like.<br/><br/>This is the story of a little girl whose mother is pregnant again and her father is dead. Her mother is seeing a violent general who keeps killing everybody that gets in his way, especially those with a different political opinion than him. There is one quote where he says basically that the political enemy lost the Civil War and therefore they have no right to think they are equal and he proves that on several occasions throughout the movie. He is definitely one of the most inhumane characters of the film year 2006. In addition, the girl loses grip to reality when she repeatedly enters a world of fantasy where she meets a faun (the one in the title), who tells her she is a princess and that in order to leave the human world and return to her royal form, she needs to complete three challenging tasks. I will not go into detail about these any further. Lets just say that the visual side of this fantasy world is probably the main reason this movie did so well at the Academy Awards winning three while scoring more nominations. Maybe a bit surprisingly, it lost Best Foreign Language Feature, but honestly I think the Academy got it right there as this one here is not on par with ""The Lives of Others"". But I still can see where the praise is coming from, even if I think it is a bit on the overrated side. I enjoyed the watch and I think the film works in most areas, some of them even pretty great. The only reason I do not give this one a higher rating is because it did not really leave an emotional impact on me. Nonetheless, it is an extremely strong achievement how del Toro managed to succeed with a successful combination of two genres here that are certainly among the most difficult to combine for a quality product. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is not my new favorite from the director as I still prefer Hellboy (2, I think), but I give it a thumbs-up nonetheless. Recommended."

We also watch how difficult was the situation in those times and of course the war between the two sides.<br/><br/>I liked this movie very much because of the plot which I found exceptional and of course because of the direction which had been made by Guillermo del Toro and for one more time was simply outstanding. I also liked the interpretation of the young Ivana Baquero who played as Ofelia and she was really good at it. I have to mention one more interpretation which I believe was really good and that is Sergi López who played as Vidal.<br/><br/>Finally I have to say that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" was a nice surprise for me because when I saw the trailer and read the storyline I was a little bit cautious about it.

","I was totally captivated by this film, it is a truly remarkable piece of work, an i believe it is the best film made this side of the century.<br/><br/>Stories in films have devolved to the point that they rely on cheap plot twists and overly simple stories that treat the audience like idiots, there are expectations like Christopher Nolan. This film though presented a story so simple but yet had so many layers both physically and emotionally, to say anymore would be to spoil it.<br/><br/>The human characters in it were well rounded, sympathetic and you felt like you had a real bond with them, especially the main character which is possibly the greatest child acting ever. The 'monsters' in the film like all of Dell Toros work feel very real and plausible and they made this film exceptional. They were surreal, sinister, charming, terrifying and intriguing and it only added to the emotional heft of the film. The rapport between the actor and the monsters as well was quite astounding.<br/><br/>The actual world that this was set in with its multiple layers and intricacies was enchanting. Del Toro succeeded in creating a mythical world feel both massive and yet tangible at the same time, added to the desolate woods and cabin it was set in and you gt a brilliant juxtaposition between the mythical land of pan and the real world.<br/><br/>This was a film that left me in a state of euphoria, I had a massive smile on my face for the entire film(except for some quiet creepy sequences and moments when i felt genuine sorrow or dread for the characters). It is the kind of film that tells you that cinema hasn't died just yet, that it hasn't burned down as a result of the corpulent rubbish thrown at the screen by Michel Bay et al. Thank you Guillermo del Toro for making one of the best films I have ever seen."
"Matthew_Riley","8","1","3","20 November 2014"," Intricate, beautiful and sinister
","Pan's Labyrinth is the definition of mystical realism; you'll expect the two completely different story-lines to clash, but Ofelia's magical world and the divided Spain during its civil war are blended perfectly. Guillermo del Toro's intricate mind shows its full capacity through this creative, yet surprisingly dark story about the contrast of the adult and child mind in twentieth century war- torn Spain. Ofelia's innocence will be tested as she meets a faun in a labyrinth who will request the completion of three challenges; if these challenges are completed she will achieve immortality and be reunited with her family in a mystical haven. Whilst in the real world she will encounter dehumanisation, repression and the harshness of the physical world. <br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth's morals may seem slightly generic but the polarization of the innocent child and the relationship-driven, slightly psychotic adult is perfectly executed. Ofelia reads fairy tales and lets her imagination run wild despite her naysaying peers who are too focused on the serious things in life. It can be interpreted in multiple ways due to how sophisticated it is. A favourite of mine is the question of is there much difference between the two lands? With evil on both sides, comparisons between Ofelia's stepfather and ""The Pale Man"" and even Ofelia succumbing to one of the seven deadly sins, greed, which is shown during the second task.<br/><br/>The character design is incredible, especially ""The Pale Man"". With simplistic, yet beautiful, CGI used throughout the film, Pan's Labyrinth is a joy to watch. Emotionally, it provides a little bit of everything, it can be tense, sinister, warming and even sad; this compliments the unpredictability of its plot immensely. Its ending is faultless in the way that it can be the typical ""happily ever after"" fairy tale ending, or end of quite a sad note; This is purely dependant on your frame of mind. In fact, the only negative I found with Pan's Labyrinth is that I wanted more of focus on the Faun and the Labyrinth; I was actually quite disappointed with the lack of emphasis on it. The fact that it excelled in character design makes me wonder why there were not more mystical characters present in the film which I felt was needed. <br/><br/>Overall, Pan's Labyrinth is a fascinating film which is well worth a watch. The positives outweigh the negatives wholly and the only negatives I found were entirely personal. I strongly suggest for you to read up on the analysis of the film after watching it to discover its hidden metaphors and meanings as they make the film all the better."

","This review contains spoilers!<br/><br/>This movie is more than it meets the eye. The details that are not noticeable at first make this movie a true masterpiece. First there is Ofelia, a small girl who's father is killed (was a tailor - group of people fond of fairy tales). I am guessing that her connection to her father were those stories (she asks Mercedes - a person she felt connected to the most, to tell her a fairy tale).<br/><br/>She clings to her stories, reading them, and slowly but surely her illness gets stronger (schizophrenia). Everything she imagines in her head has logical explanations.<br/><br/>Lets start with the Pale Man (quest no.2). He is actually representing Captain Vidal (same sitting at the head of the table with fire behind him). He represents evil. Why does he puts his eyes in? Its a connection to her start (putting the eye in the figure when the ""fairy"" popped out of the mouth)<br/><br/>The faun is nothing more but a creature that emerges as a result of labyrinth, woods, and a whole lot of carved fauns into banisters. <br/><br/>Fairy - she read books about fairies just when she traveled. Why the key in quest 2 ? Well in her real world key is something important. Key is medicine and most importantly food. And she didn't eat for almost a day prior to quest 2. <br/><br/>One thing i read about this movie that i agree is that color coding exists. Blue is usually representing reality (dark blue). Red/Golden colors imaginary world. The colors melt into one another as does Ofelia's mind with reality and imaginary.<br/><br/>She has been lied in her world, by the faun, by the fairies. (The keyhole). Two ""dead"" fairies from the pale man are later alive in the final scene - meaning it was all a fake. Even in her own mind. <br/><br/>Two things i don't get - why even in her own mind where she created a better place did she felt the need to lie to herself, and second why does the faun reverse age ? And might those 2 be connected... Gotta love this movie !"
"aminsuwedi","9","1","3","8 October 2014"," The realm of multiple dualities.
","I've been watching films that have received the Academy-Awards since 2000 focusing mainly on the films that receive Best Picture, Direction and Cinematography. When I came to the year 2007 - knowing that Pan's Labyrinth won 3 Oscars including Best Cinematography - I did dismiss it at first being a fantasy story, which isn't quite my interest. But then I came around to watching it wanting to focus mostly on the visuals and coloring - which were amazing - but then the story unfolded and I then realized that the film wasn't only a visual masterpiece but also a realm of multiple dualities. One might question why I say so, but to a explain this I would have to name a few scenes which might act as spoilers, so be warned. At first, we see the dualities in the visuals. Yes this might be seen in many films, but the way the color tones are used in the progression of the film is amazing. At first we are introduced to our two characters; the mother and her daughter and the scene is shot with warm, bright colors showing us the beautiful side of the story, but as we continue towards the film the colors change to more cooler tones with lots of contrast; indicating that the plot is getting more darker and darker as we go. But then towards the end as the girl is killed and seemingly returns to her father in the 'fantasy world' we are taken back to the warmer tones which signifies happiness and relief from the otherwise cold, harsh and dark 'real world'. The second duality we see is between the two worlds. The 'real' and 'fantasy', the 'material' and the 'magical'. The plot tears us apart as what to believe in and leaves us with multiple questions. Which world is real? Does magic exist? Did her mother know through out? Was the chalk really used to create doors? To keep up with this duality the movie never answers our questions and the only way we're connected between the two worlds is through the girl who doesn't satisfy as the proof to the co-existence of these worlds; one because her age allows her to believe in fantasy and magic; two because her mind is full of fairy tales from the books she reads. The third duality is seen from the conflict between the captain (and his people) and the rebels. Here we see the duality in ideologies and also the duality in life style. The captain lives in a rich countryside house, while the rebels live on the cold mountains. The captain who at first is stronger than the rebels becomes the weak at the end. We see the duality of Mercedes; from her life were she works for the Captain but her true allegiance is with the rebels, her heart which is warm to Ofelia and her brother but then turns out to be cold when she slices the mouth of the captain. We also see the duality of fear and courage from the Doctor and Mercedes again; at first afraid of the captain but later tired of his actions decide to stand up for their belief and defy him. Last but not the least we see the duality between love and dominance; love seen through Ofelia and her mother and dominance through the Captain and his son."
"nicole-t311","8","1","3","30 May 2014"," Pan's Labyrinth: Typical Fantasy Genre
","Pan's Labyrinth is a typical fantasy film because the element of imagination brought forth was extremely unique and the plot was one of a kind. The film follows little girl, Ofelia, who travels with her expecting mother to live with her mother's new spouse in a rustic area up North in Spain, 1944, after Franco's victory. Ofelia has to perform three tasks in order to not become a mortal and again be with her family from another realm. Pan's Labyrinth kept me quite entertained and excited to see what was going to happen next. For example, Ofelia noticed the fairy in the woods, while driving to the Captains house; simply because the land she once lived in had been waiting for her to bring her back home to her father, who in Ofelia's human reality passed away. Many portals had been set up in the human world to allow her to cross back to her original family.<br/><br/>The continuity editing of this film did not allow for any distractions for smooth transactions from scene to scene. Also, eye- line match allowed for the viewer to see what Ofelia was from her point of view, which made the film feel more realistic, as if you were actually in the scene. The continuous sound of the fairies allowed for Ofelia and the viewer to know when they were in near proximities. Ofelia's lullaby that she asked Mercedes to sing played throughout the film. Mercedes admits to not remembering the words so she hums it to Ofelia, and after that it is calming when heard, for instance when Ofelia dies by the hands of the Captain and makes the ultimate sacrifice with her own blood rather than her innocent baby brother's blood. Hard light was used in the Captain's home, which gave the effect that he was the bad guy in this film and in the scenes with the Faun. Soft light was utilized for the outdoor scenes, in the bedrooms and the middle realms where Ofelia had to perform some of her tasks. The perspective shots used in this film are zoom shots and shallow focus, especially in the scene with the Pale Man. Many camera positions are used in this film: bird's eye view, high angle, eye-level angle, and point of view shot. The majority of the camera distances were medium long shot and medium close-up; this effect allows the viewer to be right there with all the action and mystery of the film. Crane shot was used during the first scene, panning is used throughout, and steadicam shot is utilized for the action scenes in the woods. The representation of the Spanish Civil War was a social context that was present in this film. Ofelia's mother married Captain Vidal and they had just moved into his house because the Captain wanted his son to be born in his presence. The film, also, was a foreign film, spoken in Spanish. The meaning of the film, Pan's Labyrinth, is that there may be more than meets the eye; what you see on the surface is not even close to what lies beneath. If we can allow ourselves to have an open mind, the world we see so clearly has so many hidden treasures, portals, secrets, lies, and wonders. There are many realms we have been to, not just this human life, and when we open our minds to see, feel, and hear, we will know the truth is far more than we will ever know. This film was very enjoyable because the fantasy and imagination displayed does not allow for the viewer to know what is going to happen next. The plot, purpose, and adventure are unlike any I have ever seen. I would recommend Pan's Labyrinth to all audiences who can understand, preferably over the age of 13. I rate this film 8 out of 10."

","The cover of this movie state the dubious words: ""from the director of Blade II and Hellboy"" and ""Best film of the year - Stephen King"". When someone asks me about my favourite movies, I tend to mention these words as well when ""promoting"" this flick. I actually just read a review on this movie which said that people tend to overrate it because they are pleasantly surprised. It is not strange that people are pleasantly surprised considering the text on the cover, but that does not diminish the fact that this is a great movie.<br/><br/>It is the story of the Spanish Ofelia, whose mother ""is sick with child"". They move to the mountains in the North of Spain, where the new husband of the mother, ""capitán"" Vidal, is brutally hunting down communist guerrillas or partisans. Confronted with the awful realities of post-civil war Spain, Ofelia flees in a grim fantasy world inspired by her fairy-tale books.<br/><br/>I am one of those presumed idiots who rates this a 10/10, for the following reasons. The underlying story portrays the influence of the cruel circumstances of war and the feeling of abandonment and change on a child's psyche, where the imagination functions as both a repellent and processor of reality. The music is complementing this story, with an eerie and dramatic variation to the recognizable theme. The parts where fantasy does not play a role are strong as well, with an oppressive atmosphere and some intense scenes of violence that make it very clear why one would like to flee reality. The fact that it is all in original Spanish, with it's raw and harsh sounds, contributes to the overall feeling of this movie.<br/><br/>The only bad thing about this movie is the part near the end, where Ofelia looks at her shoes. It made me think of Pinocchio."

","It's 1944 in fascist Spain. Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is going up to the mountains with her mother to live with her stepfather. Her father was a simple tailor who died during the civil war. Her mother married the cruel vicious Captain. She's pregnant with his son and he cares more about him than her. He is hunting the revolutionary hold outs hiding in the mountains. Ofelia finds odd looking ruins and sees a fantasy world in them. Meanwhile Mercedes (Maribel Verdú) is working at the house while helping the revolutionaries in the woods.<br/><br/>This movie sets Guillermo del Toro up as a cinematic visionary. It is visually imaginative and unique. The acting is mostly well done headed by the always compelling Maribel Verdú. Ivana Baquero has the innocent look that is so essential.

"abhijeet-4","8","1","3","10 August 2013"," The one who writes a fairy tale can change thousand lives, The one who make a movie on it can change millions of lives. But the one who tell a fairy tale is truly an Angel.
","Pan's Labyrinth (2006) Directed by Guillermo del Toro, It seems like he himself has a strong belief in Fairy tales, and the same belief he expresses as a filmmaker on the screen. But in a way others also can not ignore the existence of fairy tales. 3 Oscar winner Pan's Labyrinth is considered one of the highest rated films in the world because of it's illusionary realism. <br/><br/>The Film is based on 1944 fascist Spain, plotted between the struggle of Spanish Army facing the guerrilla attacks by the revolutionaries and a young girl who is fascinated with the the twist and turns of the fairy tales and finally she witness it in reality. The story gradually develops carrying the plot of fairy tale and reality. From narrative, to performance and from performance to the visual effects everything is as convincing as daily life reality. <br/><br/>Like Albert Einstein said ""If you want your children to be intelligent tell them fairy tales, If you want them to be more intelligent tell them more fairy tales. <br/><br/>Do we ever think what is life made of ? This is a question most of us don't have answer or may be we all have various opinions about it. But if one has been a student of literature, History and Science can understand it in a convincing manner. That everything has appeared from the imagination, Imagination is womb which gives the birth to the future. All the scientific Invention we see in modern life, It was mentioned long before in a piece of literature. Firstly some body like ""Jules Verne"" Imagined it, and one of those who believed in it turned it into reality. In summarize way our growth is limited to our imagination and our expansion could be as infinite as our imagination. <br/><br/>The Universe is considered infinite, and so is the imagination and may be one of the universal truth is that whatever we can imagine exist. If we imagine evil, evil exist, if we imagine angels, Angels exist too. But there is another aspect to it, ""Belief"" Belief is nourishment of the imagination, the more we believe in what we imagine, more effortlessly and soonly it manifest. The world we live in now is the result of our conscious thinking and belief. And we are on the edge of time when our thinking and belief is limited to scientific theories. In the concretized version of the modern world it's rare to witness magic & Miracles. And it seems like an uncommon phenomenon, and these days people rarely believe in it except the children and some psychics. But it still exist, Yesterday I was reading a news on India TODAY which mentioned ""How a woman who was about to be raped by a pervert, saved miraculously when a cobra snake appeared out of no where on the sight. People may call it just a co-incidence and deny the magic of it, But you believe or not it is still a miracle. And All of us have witness similar moments once or more than once in our life times. <br/><br/>Most of us perceive life in two aspects Negative and Positive, No body wants to experience the negative while everybody wants to grab the positive. In reality negative or evil or demonic experience are the skeleton view of positive and Angelic and harmonious experiences. We all must take a journey through the time with belief in our heart to witness the miraculous. All the fairy tales explains it well and proves it well. because the realm of fairy tales is timeless and endless, It begins by saying ""Once upon a time..."" and ends by saying ""Happily ever after..."" or similar sentences. So that it should be always relevant and for everyone. <br/><br/>While watching Pan's Labyrinth, I experienced extreme positivity and developed a belief in the miraculous. I think we are going through a time when Adults need to read and listen more fairy tales than the children. It can heal and cure the toxicity of human life more than the scientific medicines.<br/><br/>If any child reading this Article, I request you to tell your Parents, Uncles or elders a fairy tell before they go to sleep. <br/><br/>The one who writes a fairy tale can change thousands of lives, And the one who make a movie on it can change millions of lives. But the one who tell a fairy tale is truly an Angel. So, tell somebody a fairly tale today. <br/><br/>And now I will go for the dinner by mentioning the following lines from Pan's Labyrinth <br/><br/>""And it is said that the Princess returned to her father's kingdom. That she reigned there with justice and a kind heart for centuries. she was loved by her people. And she left behind small traces of her time on Earth, visible only to those who know where to look."" <br/><br/>Good Night & Sweet Dreams."

","Had the director polished the movie a little more, it would have been just magnificent. <br/><br/>There are little sillinesses like a woman familiar to war not knowing she must drop to the floor when shots are flying around her, and a man surviving an attack even after the enemies have wasted (!) bullets shooting at all already fallen men.<br/><br/>But what I mean is Del Toro could have at least linked both stories together. There is the story of real stomach-turning war, and the story of fantastic adventure. I was expecting to see when the fantasy story would finally intervene in the reality chaos, when the girl finally had her childhood imagination validated, and turned the line of events for better. But none of that ever came, which is sad. In the end, it all turns out to be mere childish shows on her head, invisible friends. She was indeed smart enough to poison the bad guy's drink, and rescue her brother, but again none of that changes anything in the sequence of events. Nothing she did made any difference. In fact, her character, and her fantasies, are completely redundant. And that is disappointing."

","The two classic tales from Greek myth of Pan and the Labyrinth are intertwined in the beautiful world created by Guillermo Del Toro. The daughter's fantasy world has run over into her real world, clouding her judgment. The colors and music have paired greatly with the acting to keep the viewer on edge and engaged throughout the film. You can feel the small girl's confusion and her fear when ""the baby"" under her bed has been damaged. Provided, the back story isn't overtly stated, the viewer can still understand the overall goal of the young girl as she attempts to complete her 3 tasks at hand in order to return to her rightful place by her father's side. The alternate world this child seeks is vivid and lively; whereas her real world drama is bleak and grim. Guillermo Del Toro does a great job of helping the audience lose themselves in a beautiful alternate reality if only for a short time."
"nightwolf517","9","1","3","7 July 2011"," My thoughts on ""Pan's Labyrinth""
","""Pan's Labyrinth"" by Guillermo del Toro, is the story of Ofelia, a young girl who is moving with her pregnant mother to her new stepfather's house. The tale unfolds when young Ofelia sees a very strange creature on her journey to her new home which looked like a fairy. Ofelia then becomes part of a fairytale journey and learns of her ""past life"" as a runaway, amnesia stricken princess of a kingdom far away. In order to return to her real world, she must prove herself to be the true princess and complete three tasks with the guidance of Fauno, a faun. The story has a somewhat melancholy ending that leaves the viewer satisfied, but does not bring the happy ending that many long for. <br/><br/>The director of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" does an absolutely fabulous job creating the plot of the movie. He begins by putting the main character into a world in which she seems not to belong to, and gives her a way to resolve this issue (complete the three tasks to return to your real world). How the director created this evil and ruthless Stepdad for Ofelia is remarkable. The viewer gets a chill every time he enters a scene. The way that he creates each challenge for Ofelia is both terrifying and suspenseful. The monster of the second task still appears in some of my nightmares! It is truly a mystery, drama, and fantasy film.<br/><br/>By far the most enjoyable aspect of this film was the incorporation of the faun, and the tasks. I have never been so interested in a character of a movie like I was with Fauno the faun. The very second that he came onto the screen, and in each scene of the movie he was in, I was glued to the screen. Scary, gentle, mysterious, caring, interesting, and treacherous are some of the words that come to mind when I think of this character. The way the director makes Ofelia not trust the faun in the middle of the film, and second guess this idea of another world creates a perfect lead into the ending of the film where Fauno asks Ofelia to complete a horrifying third task in order to return to her rightful throne.<br/><br/>This is a must see movie. I would give it 9.9 out of 10 and would recommend it to everyone who likes an entertaining movie. Because of the rather gruesome violence that occurs in this movie, children under 18 and those who do not like to be scared in a movie should shy away from viewing this. Enjoy!"

","Although this film appears to be marketed as a children's film I can confirm there are some grim scenes I personally would not recommend for a Childs viewing, despite this it is a very well made film containing all of the generic conventions of a fairy tale with a modern twist and the fact it is in Spanish (containing subtitles) allows viewers to see a different take on the world of fairy tales rather than that of Disney. The story is very interesting and draws you in from the offset however at the start there is a brief flashback scene where Ofelia is shown and that for me spoiled the ending as it creates a inevitability that I as a viewer was expecting from the offset. There are many familiar aspects involved in Pan's Labyrinth, such as when she enters a tree it is very similar to Alice in Wonderland, although the stories are dissimilar. My personal favourite aspect of this film is the two contrasts between reality- the Spanish civil war and fantasy- the tasks Ofeila has to complete, this creates two simultaneous stories interlinking and coming together at different points. The fact that one of the themes of the story is fairy tales is revealed to the audience before the story actually plays out by Ofelia reading children's fairy tales and adults denial and scepticism, reminding the audience of their own childhood and there childish naivety and this creates a contrast between Ofeila as a character as she is childish and naive believing in fairies yet having this air of experience and loss about her making her very much a two dimensional character. I would recommend this film."
"cchase","10","1","3","4 December 2008"," Truly, A ""Fairy Tale For Adults...""
","Anyone looking at the poster art, reading the subject line of this review and not taking it seriously, needs to have their head examined. Although it is basically the story of a little girl, THIS IS NOT A CHILDREN'S TALE. Go rent THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA and let them watch that for the billionth time. At least that won't leave any permanent psychological damage.<br/><br/>Now, having said that, PAN'S LABYRINTH is not a film that the grown-up set should miss. We all remember as children, how the true world of fairy tales was a place that could be filled with as much menace, danger and even certain death as it was magic, wonder and all the fantasy your imagination could hold. HELLBOY and THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE director Guillermo del Toro takes you back into this world, and reawakens your inner child in ways you never dreamed of.<br/><br/>It is the post-Civil War Spain of 1944, where the uncompromising armies of Franco have claimed victory, and are mercilessly bent on eliminating any forces of resistance. In such a dark time, children are especially helpless subjects to the whims of their adult benefactors, who are capable of dispensing either the most boundless love or the deepest cruelty at will. Caught somewhere in between the two is eleven-year-old Ofelia, (a flawless performance by young Ivana Baquero). With her mother, Carmen (Ariadna Gil), who is ill and with child, she travels to the home of her stepfather, the heartless Captain Vidal (a blood-freezing turn by Sergi Lopez, who is so frighteningly good, he almost makes you forget Ralph Fiennes in SCHINDLER'S LIST).<br/><br/>Ofelia and Carmen are only under the Captain's protection because Carmen is allegedly carrying the Fascist leader's heir. With her mother mostly too ill to care for her and her stepfather alternating between cruelty and dismissiveness, Ofelia finds comfort only in the attentions of Vidal's brow-beaten housekeeper, Mercedes (Maribel Verdu), and in the world of magic and fairy tales she escapes into from the evils of the real adult world.<br/><br/>Sitting behind the Captain's mountain home, Ofelia discovers an beautiful old labyrinth, and soon makes her acquaintance with its sole inhabitant, a Faun (Doug Jones, who played Abe Sapien in HELLBOY). Convinced that she is the descendant of the Princess who fled his magical world ages ago, the Faun sets Ofelia to perform three dangerous tasks, that will prove she is truly the Princess and deserves to return to her place in the kingdom of Fauns and Faeries. <br/><br/>But the intrusion of the bloody savagery of war cannot be evaded for very long, and soon the dangerous, magical fantasy in which Ofelia is enraptured begins to intertwine with the dramatic and profound events taking place in ""the real world"", involving real danger and the deadliest of consequences, until both tales simultaneously reach noble, if tragic conclusions. <br/><br/>I want to rant and rave and rant some more for pages on end about this film, but that wouldn't work here. If you are a lover of all kinds of movies, you owe it to yourself not to miss this one. <br/><br/>With all the remarkable work that del Toro has already done in the genre world, it's pretty safe to say that PAN'S LABYRINTH is not only his greatest achievement, but that he may never do anything that surpasses it. Yes, THAT'S how good this movie is. Go rent it and see it NOW."

","Set in 1940's fascist Spain during the Spanish Civil War, the film's main character is a little girl named Ophelia. Her mother is about to give birth to a baby boy, and she has recently married a sadistic Captain with the Spanish Army, who relocates Ophelia and her mother to the Spanish countryside. Ophelia is a little girl who loves fairy tales, although the adults around her discourage her from reading. Amidst the pain and suffering of the war torn countryside around her, Ophelia is one day summoned by a mythical faun who tells her that she was once a Princess in an underground world, and that in order to return to that world, she must complete three tasks. As she attempts to complete these tasks, she faces insurmountable repression at the hands of her new stepfather as the war arrives at Ophelia's front door.<br/><br/>The film segregates both a war drama and a fantasy story, while keeping them connected at all times. The audience is under constant reminder that not everything in this film may be what they appear to be, and Ophelia finds help from an unlikely source along the way. This is another film with an extremely profound ending that leaves it entirely up to your interpretation; but trust me, it's one you will enjoy debating with yourself about. This is a very dark and moody film, and quite frankly, downright depressing. But it also reminds you of the power of the human spirit in times of hardship, especially considering the spirit is that of a curious little girl named Ophelia. I actually get a strong anime vibe from this film, primarily due to the portrayal of the main character, and how her situation reminds me of various anime films. Also, this is a brutal film; do not make the mistake of thinking that fantasy = happy. It's a ""hard R"" as far as violence goes. A war film with a fantasy aspect may sound bizarre, and it is, but it makes for one of the most memorable experiences you'll have in a long time. I hope this post inspires someone who hasn't seen this film before to go rent it. As long as one person does, I will feel like my job is completed.<br/><br/>Caution: Do NOT read any explanations of the film's ending; it will ruin the experience for you. Think about it for yourself, and refer back to my paragraphs above. Instead, all you need to do is ask yourself the following questions: ""Was it real or not? What are the consequences if it was real? What are the consequences if it was not real?"" <br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is a masterpiece, and the greatest film of 2006.<br/><br/>10/10"

Meanwhile, the Civil War is raging and her stepfather, Captain Vidal is becoming insane.<br/><br/>I'll start my positives (because that's all I have) with the visuals. The computer effects are very good, and work well for the fairies and the little creatures. The make-up is amazing, and the creatures are truly stunning looking creations. The music is lovely and very rich with violin. The movie itself is just about the most compelling thing I've ever seen. It starts off fairly slow, but it quickly picks up after giving the basic plot, and wow! My eyes were glued to the screen for the rest of the movie. The more realistic civil war portions of the film are compelling and sad, and the fantasy portions are awe-inspiring and are actually pretty scary. I've thought about this movie since I've seen it, so it's one that sticks with you.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a sad, fantastical and amazing film that will have you entertained throughout.<br/><br/>My rating: **** out of ****. 120 mins.

","""Pan's Labyrinth"" (Spanish, 2006): It won 3 Academy awards. Sometimes that means something. I think it does this time, but I suspect the film leaves quite a few average audience members scratching their heads and feeling disappointed. The story has two strings  one historical, about the end of WWII in Spain, when those in power are trying to clear out the last of the rebels, and, one increasingly fantastic, about a young girl who stumbles into a world of mystery, threats, and very strange events. Watch the movie from this vantage point right from the outset: It will move back and forth from one set of ""realities"" to the other. Think of one as the ADULT stage for The Struggle, and the other as the CHILD stage for The Struggle. It's political and archetypal. As for the creations, they are pretty interesting, with some wonderfully bizarre, dark, and frightening. THIS IS NOT a children's movie. NO WAY. It's violent and full of visualized nightmares."

","I was totally captivated by this movie - from beginning to end. BUT, after I was done watching, I realized that its a fairly simplistic movie. It has a often-repeated fairy tale laced over a historical vignette. Its not the content, but the form and the interwoven stories that make the movie so captivating. The fairy tale weaves in and out of the bleak reality of Spain's war. It offers a little bit for everyone, fairy tale, blood and gore, underground rebellion. I liked the make-up artistry displayed in the movie. The little girl, who is the chief protagonist, has done a remarkable job. I wonder why the director introduced the concept of ""I know a lullaby but I don't know the words"". Its a pretty decent late lazy afternoon timepass movie."
"asenkron","8","1","3","12 December 2007"," As real as life, as fascinating as fairy tale
","Describing the World War II's Spain condition, El Laberinto del Fauno is a great story for adults, a reality for children. I have never watched a Guillermo Del Toro film and it was the first trial. I have newly learned that he is a Mexican, but if I didn't know that information there would be no doubt for that he is a Spanish. Only one point that I can criticize is that praise of illegal organization's struggle against a legal state. I don't want to talk about it too much because I don't have too much information of Civil War in Spain.<br/><br/>According to the story cruel Capitan vidal gets married to a woman whose husband priorly sews for also Capitan's uniforms. After her husband had died, she has got married to him and while reaching the last stage of pregnancy, he calls for her with her daughter Ofelia. Ofelia lives in dreamworld and now she finds a labyrinth in their new accommodation. Living in this labyrinth, the life continues with the whole cruelty. Capitan Vidal's assistant Mercedes and Dr. Ferreiro help people who fight against Vidal's union. After Vidal learnt this reality, he wants to torture Mercedes like the other people etc.<br/><br/>Synchronization of Ofelia's dreamworld and real life is very impressive. If you ask me a scene that I could never forget is the Mercedes's attack to Vidal's mouth. I have never thought a person's mouth in such a bad condition.<br/><br/>Don't wait a simple fairy tale story for this film. Too much violence that we used to see in Tarantino's actions and fareast films wait for you. Of course the most important point is that intersection of a little girl's dreamworld and painful truths of life."

","Guillermo del Toro (the director of this film) once said ""If you think that this is going to be Harry Potter 5, then you're screwed, because it has nothing to do with that, there are some strong and even harsh things in this film"" and he was right. This film has it share of violence and language.<br/><br/>It's obvious to see that the director did wanted to set this film aside from most other fantasy films such as Narnia or Harry Potter and opted to deal with this harsh reality and sadly he killed the little girl at the end of the film, but she relives in this fantasy world where she is reunited with her family. So the film has a sad and happy ending at the same time, to me this was odd, because after all this thru out the whole movie there should've been a happy ending or at least end with a lighter note. Also I would've like to see more of this fantasy world that was described to us, but never really shown fully, and that it served as an escape from the harsh reality around the girl.<br/><br/>Over all, the production was very good, the story needed a little help, but I would say if you're tired of watching Harry Potter and want something different, I would say you can watch this and maybe you'll enjoy it."

"stalktheground00","8","1","3","1 August 2007"," Very Entertaining but could have had more....
","I went into this movie expecting a lot. I have heard nothing less than amazing reviews of this film. That actually may have been the problem. I was expecting to be blown away, but surprisingly i was not. Don't make the same mistake I did and go into this movie expecting a modern day ""Wizard of Oz"" The production style and cinematography were breathtaking. That alone is worth watching the film. Every scene is shaped and warped to crawl inside your head and stay there until the next morning. If only the storyline of Ofelia was able to live up to the imagery of the film. In my opinion the storyline for Mercedes, the mother, the Captain, the doctor, and Ofelia was more entertaining and suspenseful than the storyline of Ofelia and the Labyrinth. It caught my attention and kept me engaged throughout the film.<br/><br/>The story of (Princess) Ofleia returning to her kingdom is a fairy tale and this is important to keep in mind. As much as I kept trying to bring myself into this fairy tale, I couldn't. (Dont' get me wrong, I love of good fiction story.) The fairy tale aspect was just too cut and dry. She finds a key, opens a door, finds another key, opens another door, and the movie ends. It seemed to me that there needed to be more. If it wasn't for the incredible visual imagery and the drama of Mercedes, the doctor, Ofelia, and the mother, this movie could have been quite a flop.<br/><br/>Definitely a movie worth seeing. It was very enjoyable."
"fruitbat319","9","1","3","5 June 2007"," twisted and beautiful
","So I've met a lot of people who have complained that this movie utilizes clichés, like it's raining whenever something bad is going to happen. And I really can't stand this because first and foremost, this movie is essentially a fairy tale, and fairy tales use devices like this. It's also definitely not a children's movie at all. The R rating should be a clue.<br/><br/>I loved this movie. The effects were amazing, and luckily, used in moderation. They were also some of the most imaginative I've seen in a long time. It was at once incredibly beautiful and incredibly terrifying. I saw this in theaters and spent a good deal hiding in my boyfriend's jacket. If any movie can capture the wonder as well as the darkness of childhood, it's this one. It does not shy away from the fact that children are not all silliness and smiles--Ofelia is from the start a deeply tragic child, telling her unborn brother the saddest of fairy tales. I guess that was sort of one of the other themes of the movie--that children are just as affected, if not more so, by their surroundings than adults are, even though many adults don't realize it. Ofelia's mother, for example, is always telling Ofelia to smile, to tell happy stories, even though it is quite clear that Ofelia doesn't have much to be happy about.<br/><br/>My only issue was the villainous nature of Captain Vidal, who seemed almost cartoonish in his brutality. But, then again, I suppose that goes with the fairy-tale quality of the film. (Interestingly, it's a wicked stepfather instead of a stepmother)In this tale, he is a fascist bloated with victory after the Spanish Civil War, and so the movie takes a slightly political turn as well.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this movie for the weak of heart, or for those looking for something life-affirming and cheery. But if you're looking to have your breath taken away, see it."
"dwpollar","8","1","3","5 June 2007"," Excellent dark storytelling...
","1st watched 6/3/2007 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Guillermo del Toro): Excellent dark storytelling from Director Guillermo del Toro in this much heralded fantasy film from Mexico. There are really two stories in this film. The first concerns fighting in the Spanish civil war between the established government and rebels. The second involves a little girl and her mother who's expecting and arriving to live with their new father and husband. He happens to be a ruthless & prideful General for the government who will do anything to stop the uprising of the rebels and to have a son and heir to his throne, apparently. The girl finds a labyrinth on the grounds and starts encountering different fantasy characters as she explores it. The movie is a combination of the harsh reality of the situation and the endearing fantasies of a little girl who's trapped in a reality that's almost too hard to bear. This is definitely not a children's movie because of the intense emotions depicted and the things that happen to the character's throughout. This is a very hard movie to get through but it is a great bit of storytelling and worth it to work thru it if you can."
"DerSenffarbeneRitter","9","1","3","29 May 2007"," Great contrast between gruesome reality and fantasy
","I was very enthusiastic to see this movie since I always liked movies, where the real world and a fantasy world interact with each other. Of course many movies have problems dealing with this difficult task to show the real world as it is and at the same time to tell a fantasy story that fits in. This movie manages this in a great way. It shows us the brutality of the war, how power is abused by sadistic officers and how it affects innocent people. Especially the main protagonist Ophelia suffers of the brutality of her stepfather and therefore creates a fantasy-world of her own to escape into. This world is presented to us in great and sometimes very abstract visuals, while the real world is like it is in times of war. It's serious, emotionless, brutal and some scenes show quite gruesome violence. Both worlds mix up so well that you sometimes ask yourself, what's real and what's not. <br/><br/>This movie does a really great job in presenting the stark contrast between Ophelias fairytale-world and the harsh reality and the ending is, in my opinion, just great. The only reason I'm giving ""just"" 7/10 is that there are a bit too few of the great fantasy scenes. I liked them so much, that I was a little disappointed by the fact, that there are so few of them. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, watch that movie. It will be worth your time."
"hjsunrise","8","1","3","24 May 2007"," A great story
","I have just seen this movie and it was heart breaking, but thoughtful.<br/><br/>I can tell you that you are never ready for what the story tells or portrays. Great story telling, something that does not exist in many of todays movies. The characters are fleshed out so well that you are swept in by not only the fantasy but also the realities of war- especially the Spanish civil war. That conflict was one of the worst wars in the 20th century - I would even say it transcends the 2nd world war that followed it. It is well worth watching; definitely not for children to see. The subtitles are a little distracting but you will understand exactly what the characters say and mean. Sometimes the actions only are enough to mean volumes."
"judywalker2","7","1","3","16 May 2007"," Interesting
","I thought this film from a technical perspective was very well done. But I have to say that the adult characters were much more interesting than watching the antics of Ofelia (especially in her Alice in Wonderland dress). Her story was all too familiar and I knew exactly what was going to happen before it happen. It was the same for the adult characters and its too bad that the fantasy that Ofelia had didn't incorporate more of what was happening around her. The only connection appeared to be with her mother and that's ashame. Also the task that the faun had her do seemed to say nothing about her situation or the situation of those around her. It also would have been nice to know more about the Captain and his relationship to his father and why a son was so important to him. All in all a good technical film with story flaws. 7/10"
"nslabach","Null","1","3","11 May 2007"," Easily one of the best 10 fantasy films of all time.
","Given the deliberately slow pace, the political/historical setting, the graphic violence, the infrequent fantasy sequences, and the very dark setting and subject matters at hand, this may be one the best fantasy pieces in recent history. The very end of this film set off such emotions in me, that I barely remembered I had, yet have experienced as a result of a film so beautiful. However, I did experience them, during this film, which absolutely beautiful. Set in 1944, post civil war Spain, a young girl is relocating to the country side, with her mother, to live with her mother's recent husband, a Captain in Franco's Army. Upon moving to his lavish mansion, with it's many servants (some of whom are in league with the still waning rebels, who are still engaging in combat with the fascist in the local country side), she discovers a fantasy realm richer than her or anyone's imagination. This realm interconnects with her own personal and familial life so exactly that it appears one and the same. With its many intersection between the real and the imagined, and the constant interblending between the two, the last act of the film leaves you to ponder both tragedy and victory as the events unfold, and bleeding through of both into one magical emotional experience (What I mean to say is that I cried...... a lot.). This movie is one part Schindler's List, one part Lord of the Rings, one part Beautiful Creatures, one part Brazil, and one part Devil's Backbone. Guillermo Del Toro has directed a wonderful fairytale, which is certainly not for children, except for adults who are children at heart. Highly recommended for all who love dark fantasy.<br/><br/>P.S. (This is the screenplay that Neil Gaiman wished he wrote)."
"gallateea","9","1","3","11 May 2007"," A charmed performance
","It is not for the skeptical, bored, action-movie lovers to watch ""El Laberinto del Fauno"". Yet I believe they should see it as well. It stands for all that time in our childhood when we felt there is something out there more than practical concerns, when everything was not centered around little things and we were ready to try what, as adults, we are no longer prepared to face.<br/><br/>It could be said the actors, the scenery and the plot revolve around magic, a fairy tale touched by darkness and violence in the middle of unrelenting harshness. Keep your mind open when you see it, because if you start with the common prejudices that plague a grown person you will miss much of its meaning.<br/><br/>To conclude, if you have the opportunity to watch this film do not miss it; it will be a time well spent, and perhaps will stir some forgotten memories of your own."

","Oh, wow! I liked ""Pan's Labyrinth"" a great deal.<br/><br/>Not having read any reviews I somehow got it into my head, probably because the lead character is a young girl, that ""Pan's Labyrinth"" was a film for children. It is most definitely not a film for children. It is a very dark, violent and brutal fantasy set in 1944 during the immediate aftermath of the Spanish civil war.<br/><br/>A young girl moves with her heavily pregnant Mother to be with her adoptive Father, a captain in the Spanish army (a supremely cold and ruthless Sergi Lopez), who is occupied leading the fight against anti-Franco/Fascist resistance. Here she discovers a fantasy world of fauns, fairies and doorways into other worlds. That is all you are going to get from me with regard to the plot. Nothing else, Jack.<br/><br/>Go and see ""Pan's Labyrinth"". It exceeded my expectations. It is a truly beautiful and melancholic piece of work and it works on all sorts of levels.<br/><br/>Please beware, though. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is (eeek!) a subtitled movie. Do not let this upset you. You can do it. You can read and watch pictures at the same time. Be big. Don't be like the teenage couple who left 10 minutes into the film when I saw it just before Christmas.

You were lost in the world that the story created, and for someone who mostly hates subtitles, the creativity just submerged you in the movie's experience. The story line, although sometimes familiar, was amazingly original and it was quite interesting to watch something that you've never seen before. The one thing that was quite amazing about the film, was that although it was nightmarish, you did find warmth throughout the film.

Then ,when I saw the movie ,I wasn't what I was expecting ,but I liked a lot . This is definitely NOT a movie for children . It was very dark ,and it have brief ,but graphic violence .But it wasn't a horror movie either . And talking about the fantasy parts ... I guess that the trailers could make you think in lots of CGI ,monsters or fantastic landscapes . There is some elements of fantasy ,and yes ,there are monsters and fairies ,but those elements aren't the most important thing in the story . The story is a parallel between a fairy tale ( in the old style ,with creepy monsters and strange situations ,not on like the Walt Disney movies ) and the cruelty of the war and how a girl finds her hope of the bleak reality inside a fantasy world . That world is dark too ,but at least gives her a hope for a better future . I think that is out of place discuss if the fantasy parts are real or not . The direction of Guillermo del Toro give it an ambiguous tone ,where the decision to accept if the fantasy world is real or not depends of the viewer . Even that ,both realities in the movie are wonderfully made : while the reality of the war is sober and dramatic ,the fantasy world have a unique and sometimes grotesque imagination ,something like not many filmmakers have . And the emotions in the movie are intense and powerful .

","Let's say it directly. The photo here is absolutely splendid. The rest of the movie is not on the same level.<br/><br/>It's about post civil war Spain. The fascist captain is as square as you could ever imagine and the young heroine as divine as anything you've seen. Surely this works out in a fantasy, but what's the amazing thing about these kind of make-believes? It's once again a severely uncomplicated story about goodness winning over evil, together with some gore. But what's the point? This kind of filmic romanticism has failed in power and although it's clever done here, the subject isn't. This kind of darkness isn't interesting anymore."
"Andy-296","8","1","3","31 March 2007"," Great film, but not a masterpiece
","1944. Spain has just come out of the civil war, and the fascist Franco regime is in power. A small group of republican fighters, though, hold on to a small territory in the remote forested mountains of northern Spain. There, a girl named Ofelia, fascinated with fairy tales, arrives with her sick mother to meet her stepfather, a brutal captain of the regime keen on exterminating the remnant republicans. Living with the military in an old mill, at night Ofelia meets a fairy who takes her to an old Faun, which urges her to complete three treacherous tasks. The movie, thus, occurs both in ""reality"" and in fantasy. I like Del Toro's previous Hellboy. Pan's Labyrynth is also a great movie, but I think it was just a bit overrated. The movie is well made, the atmosphere and special effects are great, the plot holds your attention, the performances are great. So why I'm a bit hesitant to endorse this movie as a masterpiece? I'm not totally sure, but the movie may be too ""arty"" for its own good, the film is just a bit too neat, straining for significance while trying to attract both terror film fans and art movie buffs, while probably pleasing neither completely. And in light of history, what does the republicans victory means at the end (unless Del Toro just wanted to please the crowds?)"

She's a huge talent, and you should bear her in your mind the next years. The story is different but not that illogical I thought before. Unfortunately there are by some scenes or other a few mistakes like: Why doesn't kill Mercedes the Capitan? Maybe 'cause he's important for the ending ;-) And I was really commiserate about the monster, which is eating children, just had this... maybe 3 minutes. The first two secrets where in my opinion uninspired and acted like: Okay we need two secrets, let's take a toad, a golden key... But the third secret was instead so much the better. Generally the ending was really really great and I was totally impressed. I'm really curious about Del Toros next movies, I like him."

","Whether it be Alice going down the rabbit hole or, in Pan's Labyrinth, little Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) descending a labyrinth in an imaginative flight from Franco fascists in 1994 Northern Spain, the escape of a girl into a fantasy world cries for allegorical interpretation. In the case of Pan's Labyrinth, no interpretation is difficult because the visuals are so strikingly Beauty and the Beast-ish (original version) that the oppression of good and the expression of love are self-evident.<br/><br/>Capitan Vidal (The excellent Sergi Lopez) embodies Franco, Mussolini, Hitler, and Stalin as the indomitable tyrant who hunts rebels like annoying flies. When the real worlds of fascism and imagination collide, there is a price for both sides to pay. The gift of the film is to make us wonder how this could have happened and how we could avoid it again."

","First off I have to say it was an excellent movie. It was not at all what I expected however, and I was a LITTLE disappointed, but not enough to disappoint.<br/><br/>Pans Labyrinth is a very dark movie. More to the point I found it depressing, which I think was the point. Ophelias (the little girl) world was a very dark, hopeless place. Which at first kind of contrasts the fantasy world she encounters. However that proves to be just as dark in a different way.<br/><br/>It is also a very violent movie. This didn't turn me off, in fact one scene left me ""smiling from ear to ear"" (people who saw it know what i mean :) ) But for a fantasy movie it is most certainly NOT for kids. Torture and murder are just sort of par for the course.<br/><br/>The reason i found it a little disappointing is that from the trailers I had imagined far more of the movie would take place in the fantasy world. In reality it is a fairly small percentage. The parts there are are fantastic. I just wish we could have explored the creative fantasy realm a lot deeper, and dwelled in the violent depressing world far less.<br/><br/>Overall though WELL worth seeing."
"crowgeyb","8","1","3","29 January 2007"," Geat, yes, but not what I thought
","This movie blows you away. However based on my initial thought this movie was little disappointing. If you go to this movie thinking it is an ""adult fairy tale"" then you will be mistaken. I would say about 35% of the movie is fantasy and 65% war. Don't get me wrong I still really loved this movie and would recommend it to anyone. But me being a fantasy buff and a lover of a great fairy tale, I was left longing for more of the fairytale world. Another small insert is this movie was rated 'R' and for good reason. There was much cringing and gore, some parts reminded me of those from ""Saw"". Besides this, there is no R-rated material, and I almost believe the gore could of been left out. Once seeing the trailer for this movie I did a lot of research and came across the scene of the girl and what is know as ""pale man"". I was expecting a little more from this scene, I feel it was a major part to the fantasy part of the story and I just wasn't absorbed into it. I wish they would of done a little more with it. Besides these small comments, I would see this movie in a heart beat. It makes you leave the movie theater thinking about what happened? Was it a happy ending or not? There was closure, but I believe it was ended to make you think more deeply about it all. The acting was great, the little girl was excellent, and the actor of the faun and pale man did great. The score was out of this world, and makes you hum it the rest of the night. The cinematography was terrific, so beautiful. See this movie, but know adult fairytale is a bit of a stretch."
"mesakid","Null","1","3","29 January 2007"," an amazing achievement
","I finally got to see this film yesterday. I won't repeat what others have already said but I would like to add a few points I haven't seen expressed First, in the emotional impact of watching this film I didn't notice how well all of the components fit together. For me this was one of the greatest collaborations I have seen in film in achieving the overall vision The writing, the acting, the cinematography, the sound, the music, the set design, and the editing were all major achievements in their own rights It was overall a beautiful work of art although not easy to sit through at times The acting was unbelievable but not showy. Mr Lopes deserves a lot of credit for playing such an unrelenting villain with such unselfishness and skill. The actresses playing the mother and daughter were both wonderful But for me the most memorable was Maribel Verdu who played the housekeeper Her face and her communication with her face and not just her words were unbelievable. She looked like someone from that era who was experiencing a tragedy and whose expression was caught by a photojournalist. It was refreshing to see a film where I didn't know any of the actors in advance and I could focus on the characters It was like watching a quality production of Shakespeare. Unlike some American films this film was unrelenting in presenting its story It doesn't hint at perils to the characters and then pull back in the clutch, the events that could happen do happen, even though it may be painful to watch. And yet the final effect is one of hope, not despair. This is the kind of film that anyone who loves movies should go out of their way to see, it will have a permanent place in your movie memories."
"sykt992000","8","1","3","28 January 2007"," It was a good movie but somewhat overrated (possible spoilers)
","I've heard of rave reviews before I went to see it and sort of know the theme of the movie. I also cautioned myself against high expectations before viewing it and it actually worked: I enjoyed more with somewhat less expectation.<br/><br/>First of all, I am absolutely a lover for fantasy movies and also appreciated the fact that the director tried to blend reality together with fantasy. I also liked the presentation of the fairy world as a darker, somewhat evil haven for the little girl. The storyline is decent. Color and camera work are good though nothing particularly spectacular.<br/><br/>However, this movie has quite a few clichÃ©d moments and kept reminding me of some other movies. Basically, I always knew what was coming and nothing really surprised me. I also found the fantasy part bear some resemblance to the animated movie "" spirited away"".<br/><br/>Another part I didn't find satisfying is the acting, or say the portrayal of certain characters. The captain for one is a bit too one dimensional. They actually don't have to repeatedly show the killing or torturing to prove the cruelty of the captain. I got the message the first time he shot one man. Sometimes, indirect portrayal would carry a more chilling effect. Ofelia's acting is somewhat lacking too. I know she's supposed to be a quiet, reserved girl in desperate need to escape. However, her acting is sort of bland. No matter what she heard, saw or realized, her expression never changed much and sometime came off as not caring about much at all. Even when her mom died, she never looked heart-broken. I don't wanna to be so picky about a child actor, but she actually has a very heavy role in the movie and I felt the plain acting took some power away from movie.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a good movie and I enjoyed it. But I felt the directing and acting could have kicked up a few more notches."
"crimson-king-1","7","1","3","28 January 2007"," Potential for Greatness
","This movie, while clearly very good, suffers a few faults. Too much time time is spent in Civil-War era Spain, and not enough in the magical world that may or may not be in Ofelia's head. Though not a fault, this movie is brutally violent. This movie seems like a good one for kids, until you see some of the shocking brutality committed by Captain Vidal, scenes with some very violent torture sequences, especially one where he smashes in a man's face with a bottle, and then shoots a man standing next to him. The scenes with violence are extremely well done, and take all the small details into account. Particularly two scenes accentuate this, one where Captain Vidal has his cheek cut open and sows it up by hand. Afterwards, he takes a drink, and it leaks through the newly-created hole in his cheek. Also, at the end, when Captain Vidal is shot right below the right eye, his eye rolls back, while the other eye stays focused. This movie should win several Oscars for the technical prowess displayed, but some of the plot should have been changed, which would have made this movie great."
"freaky_dave","9","1","3","28 January 2007"," An incredible film
","One of the best movies that I've seen all year. It has wonderful artistic scenery, excellent acting, and for a fairy tale like story mixing with the reality of the Spanish Civil War, it works wonderfully.<br/><br/>The story involves a little girl who goes with her pregnant mother to live with her new father. Unknown to both of them, the new father is Captain Vidal(Sergi Lopez), a ruthless man in charge of destroying the rebellion which surrounds them in the forest. The first scenes involving him are all that is needed to show what evil lurks inside him, but we eventually see more as the movie goes on.<br/><br/>Ofelia(Ivana Baquero), is the young girl now living a life she is not happy with. She seems to create another world for herself where she is looked at as a princess who must complete three tasks in order to join the Faun(Doug Jones) who gives her these tasks in order to live this happier existence. We, as the viewers, find ourselves wondering if maybe the fairy tale is real. Near the end we will see the truth, but I am not about to divulge that secret.<br/><br/>As Ofelia lives in this other world, which could be true or not, we learn more about the other story. That story involves the rebels in the surrounding forest, a maid named Mercedes (Maribel Verdu), and Captain Vidal. There are secrets involving some of the characters, but as I stated above, I will not give any of them away.<br/><br/>Overall, this is probably one of the best movies I've seen all year. The director Guillermo del Toro, is wonderful with his cast and all his art designs. The Pale man (Doug Jones again) is definitely one of the scariest creations ever made. The acting is excellent, and the pacing fantastic. The only slight I had with the movie was some of the over the top violence, but other than that, this movie is incredible."

","I was disappointed with El Laberinto del Fauno. I was expecting a different film from all of the reviews I had read, including the many Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>I actually left about an hour into the film because I was so disgusted by the unnecessary violence, and I just couldn't handle the graphic murders. A man being beaten in the face with a bottle until he was dead is not something that any human needs to see. In Canada it was rated as 14A, and should have been rated R.<br/><br/>This film's trailers and reviews exposed it as a whimsical adult fairy tale, although it contained more death than a James Bond movie.<br/><br/>Though I though the movie was Nightmare worthy, Ivana Baquero was very believable and did a fantastic job in playing Ofelia."

","I had high hopes for this movie because of my interest in mythology and fantasy. Perhaps for that reason I was bound to be disappointed. I liked the acting by the little girl, and all of the female members of the cast, and the special effects worked well, though by modern standards they weren't that remarkable. For me, the film fell flat in the story, which was unoriginal, and unsatisfying. I was also put off by the repetitive and gratuitous-seeming violence. (The film had some of the most unconvincing gunfire I've seen since I was a kid, and the Spanish soldiers might has well have been made of tin.) There were a great many places where visual details, and camera work could have helped take us more into the story-environment (there was some good work here too, but not enough for me) but fundamentally, if you're doing a story about a girl who is escaping violence through the exploration of the nether world, she should stay in that world long enough for her (and the audience) to forget the violence for a while."
"meeza","9","1","3","27 January 2007"," Pantastical!
","Director Guillermo Del Toro's numinous, mesmerizing ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is the foreign film feast of the year. Take a trip to this fantasyland where dreams can come true! I know! Shameless Disney plug! Anyway, enter to my ""Pun's Labyrinth"" so I can guide you to the mastery of ""Pan's Labyrinth"". Child actress Ivana Baquero stars as Ofelia, the daughter of an ailing pregnant mother named Carmen. Ofelia's mom is married to Capitan Vidal, a malicious, ruthless Spanish leader who might be the supreme villain of the year in film. Ofelia is miserable in her existence until she inadvertently comes to the path of a magical labyrinth inhabited by a Pan. Mr. Panman leads her into a mystical journey that is filled with majesty and oddity that makes it the proper escape for the troubled child. Pan informs Ofelia that she was a princess that has been resurrected in her life-form. Pan also provides Ofelia the unearthly goods to cure her mother. However, Ofelia still has to persevere her cruel real world of being controlled by Captain Vidal. Let's just say that Captain Vidal's vicious demeanor makes Saddam Hussein look like_________ (sorry to keep you ""hanging"" with the Saddam reference , remember you are in ""Meeza's Pun Labyrinth"") Mother Teresa. I think Captain Vidal's daily liquid nutrition is primarily comprised of Captain Morgan juices. He massacres innocent peasants, assassinates his own Spaniards, beats his wife, and abuses children. That is the harsh ""verdad"" on Vidal. Mercedes is Vidal's primary housekeeper which grows an affectionate bond with Ofelia. In the Labyrinth, Ofelia encounters supernatural experiences that have profound impacts in her natural existence. The ghoulish Labyrinth character that is a must-see of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is the Paleman! He has the ""white stuff""! He is creepy, whimsical, and visualize this: his eyeballs are on the palms of his hands. And by no means, don't mess with his fruit!!!!!!! You will see why when you un-vegetate yourself to see the film. The acting of ""Pan's Labyrinth"" was nothing short of spectacular! Baquero was endearing as Ofelia. Adriana Gil's work was not ailing as mother Carmen. Maribel Verdu of ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" was convincing enough to demonstrate that she was caring enough to be ""la mama tambien"" of Ofelia. Sergi Lopez was captivating in his work as the devilish Captain Vidal. Doug Jones was dually ""doug""-on great as Pan & The Pale Man. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" cinematic labrytory was also embodied with excellence: Guillermo Navarro's cinematography, Jose Quetglas' makeup, Eugenio Caballero's art direction, and Javier Navarrete's musical score was phenomenal. However, it was Writer-Director Guillermo Del Toro's vision that was the catalyst of the brilliant success of ""Pan's Labyrinth"". This Del Toro is a visionary genius, and that is no bull about Del Toro! Make ""Pan's Labyrinth"" your next stop in your cinematic journey! ***** Excellent"

This is one of the finest movies I've seen that brought me a full range of emotions: smiles, horror, fear, wonder, and incredible sadness.

","The movie had a diverse range of emotions and action. There was brutality and fierceness, but also love and innocence. There was a serious world of war and death, but also a world of magic and hope. One of the magical scenes reminded me of Silent Hill, but this is not a pure horror movie.<br/><br/>Sound effects are very blatant. The creature creak loudly as if they were extremely inflexible. The movie is somewhat violent, but this is not an action movie. The gunshots are unrealistic. The bullets leave small holes and often no blood.<br/><br/>Worth seeing for a serious and sad, but abstract view of the world from a young girls eyes."

I do feel that I missed some of the symbolism; although I enjoyed the experience immensely. This film most likely will become an underground psychedelic classic, along with heavy drug consumption, it could be a totally different experience. It reminds me of a Dark Crystal for modern times. I am waiting for the opportunity to add it to my movie library."

Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about this film is how honestly it captures the essence of the childhood imagination. It does well to remind all of us what it was like when we dreamed that we were the rulers of our own magical lands. In terms in the violence, I honestly expected it to be a lot worse. Most of the violent sequences happen off camera and we only see the aftermaths. Don't let the violence discourage you, when it does occur its quick, and the movie has so much more to offer. Without a doubt, the best film I have seen this year!"

","enters this dark tale of one little girl's desire to flee from the harsh realm that she is thrust into. The tone is eerie and the colors of the film reflect the tremulous nature of Ofelia's surroundings. Ofelia had lost her father, her mother re-marries the sadistic Captain, and she is taken from the city where the threat of attack looms like the grisly environment that envelopes their encampment. Where the forest should be full of life and color, drab tones and mythical creatures creep amongst the shadows. What little girl would not want to find a way to escape such a place.<br/><br/>Ofelia's imagination and the creation of her own fairy tale are derived from the very sad and dark place that she has been brought up to know. As her mother's condition worsens and the evil in the ""real world"" escalates the fantasies that are intertwined with the story become haunting. The world of fantasy is a place that Ofelia alone must encounter and may be her only salvation.<br/><br/>The acting is exceptional, across the board. I cannot say that one performance stuck out over another, it was as if they put all personal emotion into their performances that they embodied the characters. The visuals, special effects, and the subtle score amplify the tension and beauty that this film has to offer. The story itself left me thinking long after I left the theater and the overall project is very impressive.<br/><br/>It is a grim tale and not a light hearted movie that is easy to digest all at once. I do definitely recommend the film and applaud Mr. Del Toro's efforts"
"dobbsart","9","1","3","19 January 2007"," beautiful but highly disturbing
","I wish I had been more prepared for the nature of this film before seeing it. The U.S. marketing scheme really plays up a fantasy/fairy tale angle, and completely downplays the absolute sadism and lingering brutal violence that is really the heart and soul of this movie. Del Toro may in fact be a marvelously talented director, but his vision of the world is simply too disturbing and upsetting for me to take. There is very little that qualifies this film as fantasy; rather, it is a (brilliantly and beautifully rendered) reflection of the very real nihilism and hopelessness that has infiltrated much contemporary art, particularly cinema. The performances are deeply troubling in their simplicity and subtlety. I would not take any child to see this (not implying that that was Del Toro's intent). Fear and violence invade every frame from start to finish. However, it is a testament to the skill of Del Toro that its images and vision will not soon leave my mind."
"AaronSWalker","7","1","3","19 January 2007"," Never a dull moment
","The beauty of this film, other than the magnificent make-up and art design, is it's linear stories. Each of them could be told separately and be just as entertaining, but the way we are pulled back and forth from reality and Ofelia's dream world only enriches the story that much more. The film is two hours long, but it seems to go by much faster since you are always involved in the action. At times this film reminded me of an epic anime of sorts, like something from Hayao Miyazaki, a master of fusing beauty and destruction, love and hate. When I first heard of the level of ""R ratedness"" in this film, I was expecting gratuitous blood slinging, but that just wasn't the case. The gore (which isn't too terrible when compared to many films out there) is appropriate, and only adds to the power of the film. It's gonna be hard for Guillermo del Toro to top this one."

","Guillermo Del Toro has never been a director who has overly impressed me. However, I think Pan's Labryinth could well be his career defining film - his masterpiece! From what I have read, it seems that this is a film closest to his heart, and he deserves considerable praise for bringing it to the big screen in such spectacular fashion.<br/><br/>There is not one actor in this film who gives a bad performance, and special mention must go to young Ivana Baquero, who in a difficult role gives a brilliant performance.<br/><br/>This film is not however a children's film, nor is it a fairy tale in the classical sense of the term. It is a brutal look at the revolutionary Spain during the rule of Franco, mixed with a beautiful fairytale. It could be suggested that this film is somewhat misleading, in that most advertisement of it gives the impression of a magical world, but what is good about this film, is it's very real and believable feel.<br/><br/>The film contains many awesome creatures some scary some not, but what is perhaps most interesting is the fact that it is the human characters who are perhaps most scary. In particular Captain Vidal, played perfectly by Sergei Lopez. He is far scarier than the white man of the magical world. Firstly, because he is real, and secondly because he is not far from being a madman, and yet so calm with it. There is something about silent simmering anger that is so scary!<br/><br/>Also, the film looks beautiful, the Labyrinth itself looks fantastic, as does the underworld, and all the creatures are designed perfectly, but in a way that they could well be evil or good.<br/><br/>This film will not be for everyone, and some may even be put off by the subtitles, though I beg you not to let this get in the way. This film is not for children, it is brutal, and there are some horrific scenes. As the trailer suggests, it is a fairy tale for adults. 8/10"

","1944 Spain is normally not thought of as a backdrop for a Fairy Tale but then again Pan's Labyrinth is not your normal Fairy Tale. The setting is that of post war Spain as small packets of Fascist still try to maintain order throughout the countryside. In steps Ofelia a young girl who loves fantasy and dreams of being in another world, that apparently she may have been from.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is in the vain of one of Guillermo del Toro's other films The Devil's Backbone where in it we have a war setting with a ghost story here we have the war setting set to a sort of Brothers Grimm tale. However do not be surprised as the war story at times overshadows the fantasy enough to raise the question, does this fantasy world really exist or is this a product of Ofelia's mind.<br/><br/>Saying that I will say that the story is very dark,gritty and hard in it's portrayal of the post war goings on and when it does get to the fantasy elements they are very well done as well. Sequences with Pan as well as the dinner table scene with The Pale Man are very well shot and at times eerie. I only wish the fantasy elements were focused on for longer periods of time as though I thought the regular goings on were interesting I really didn't want it to overtake the fantasy elements as it does in some cases.<br/><br/>As a whole though this is a very solid movie and I definitely see what the hype is all about. Though I would have liked to have seen a further focus on the fantasy than the war it still is a very striking and well shot movie that is every bit deserving of the praise it has been receiving. In the end not all fantasy, not all war drama but a very different viewing experience that you have to at least see once.<br/><br/>Score: 8/10 Very Good. I teeter between 7 and 8 on this but the overall production values and story out-way some of the shortcomings that I have for the film. A truly unique movie experience that should be seen by all. Del Toro has once again proved to me he is a true pioneer and hero for genre movie fans everywhere."

","Pan's Labyrinth makes fairy tales amazing again, creating a world of fear, joy, and anticipation. Set during World War II, this film embraces the darkest most villainous spirit of man-kind and unleashes it with a cruelty that chills to the bone, and just when the chill pulls at the very fiber of your being the warmth and kindness of unconditional love breath life on the screen with you endearing young girl. As in most Fairy tales, she is innocent, pure and dangerously naive. Surrounded by treacherous, unrelenting viciousness the young child of a widowed, expectant mother who has recently remarried finds her sanctuary within a world filled with Fairies, bright, playful, and most intent on luring her to her destiny. This film is magnificent, and as most fairy tales is far darker than the one most of us grew up to. The performances are all wonderful, however are somewhat lost in the magnificent world created in live action and breathtaking animation. Not for the faint of heart to be sure, non the less a spectacular piece of film making and one that should be celebrated not just for its visuals but for the messages it ever so gently to allows to flitter through the story."

","While I thought the story would be more akin to Alice in Wonderland in terms of its magical content, it was not. The movie was more or less divided evenly between magic and reality. Like all subtitled movies, you think it's a pain to read at first, but by the end of the movie you are so entrenched in the movie to even remember you are reading them. The Spanish was quite elegantly spoken as well, not compared to the ""Spanish"" I hear spoken in Miami. The ending didn't disappoint, but it felt like there was something missing at the end nonetheless. It was very well executed and it was the best filmed movie I have ever seen. The interesting part was how the girl's fiction blended in with reality; and how in the end she went to her fairytale land, despite being killed. Excellent movie."

It turned out to be a good fairy tale, yet I think it's made for adults.<br/><br/>People like us are like Mercedes, we are grown up and have experienced part of life, we are somewhat certain that there is no fairy tale in real life.

I saw a magic chalk that could open a door to heaven. I saw a princess had a full experience of being a human. It's a masterpiece.<br/><br/>It's worth to mention that there is much unexpected violence in the movie. Yet when Mecerdes hit the capital the audience started to applaud.

"chooken","Null","1","3","12 January 2007"," Pan's Labyrinth
","1944, rural Spain. Such is the backdrop for Guillermo del Toro's Labyrinthian effort, a dark and twisted fantasy set beside a dark and twisted reality.<br/><br/>Both fantasy and reality tell the story of Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a pre-teen sent to live on an army base with her pregnant mother (Ariadna Gil) and new stepfather (Sergo López), the latter a brutal and unhinged army captain with a penchant for torture and impulsive murder.<br/><br/>Obsessed with fairy tales, Ofelia creates fantasy in her own mind until the day she comes across a faun (Doug Jones) in a dilapidated stone maze on the base grounds.<br/><br/>Though it may sound like earlier fantasy incarnations such as Wizard of Oz or the similarly titled Labyrinth, this is not a movie for children. The majority of the film focuses on conflict: between the army and the rebels, between the main characters (including Maribel Verdú's stunning performance as sympathetic maid Mercedes), between fantasy and reality. The violence is unflinching, visceral to the point of disturbing, and the dark, overcast tones are almost as unsettling.<br/><br/>Then there's the fantasy. The creatures are fantastical, certainly, but carry with them the sort of darkness one should always associate with the grimmest of fairy tales. Disney this ain't, more a reflection of a mind so consumed and surrounded by atrocity.<br/><br/>But even though the frames are painted with the darkest brush, it's not all doom and gloom. In Ofelia, a sense of innocence is found. Reality is not black and white, rather a state of mind consumed by adulthood.<br/><br/>And if you don't like the symbolic stuff, there's some pretty cool monsters."
"Reptileboy66","9","1","3","11 January 2007"," An actual Fairy Tale
","First and foremost, I would like to state the following: a fairy tale does not necessarily need to be of magics and wizards, or fairies for that matter. Fairy tales happen all the time whether fiction or non-fiction. What I mean is that everyone's life is a fairy tale all on its own. You are telling the tale in your perspective on what happens with your life and those around you. That's what fascinates me of fairy tales the most. The beauty and the horror behind life herself.<br/><br/>Now on with the movie. I caught this movie right away. It is definitely worth to watch again and again. Movies barely put me in that situation anymore, and I am glad El Laberinto Del Fauno (Pan's Labyrinth) does that for me. Guillermo Del Toro is personally my favorite director by far and he is up there with Tim Burton (a fairy tale legend believe it or not) and Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>El Laberinto Del Fauno is one of a kind fairy tale and it stays true to its nature. The fantasy parts of the film are amazing and beautiful, but at the same time the non-fantasy scenes such as the drama and the war can also be put into the fairy tale category. Why? Because of the type of characters and events that are taking place all at once. The horror element of the film not only lies in the amazing and creepy Hombre Palido (Pale Man), but it also lies in the horror of the war and the horrific violence that takes place throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Clearly a fairy tale is a twisted tale of love and romance, drama and magic, horror and suffering. Pan's Labyrinth is a unique and a very inspiring kind of tale. Now I feel like writing my own unique fairy tale and I am a writer myself. All in all Pan's Labyrinth does something that most other films have not done in 2006. It puts you in situations most movies don't: care about some characters, like Ofelia for example, and hate others, like el Capitan Vidal.<br/><br/>All in all, without saying much, El Laberinto Del Fauno is definitely worth the watch and it is definitely a movie that I will never forget. Thank you Guillermo Del Toro for this amazing film and hope to see more amazing films from you soon."
"jed_williamson","8","1","3","7 January 2007"," Fabulous adult faery tale
","I've just been to see this film tonight. I was a little hesitant at first as i'm not a big fan of fantasy. However, I am a sucker for historical setting and this has one of the most compelling backdrops in history - the Spanish Civil War (or in this case, the aftermath). I was curious to see how it would all pan out (pardon the pun). <br/><br/>It is the story of a young girl who is moved to the country with her pregnant mother to be closer to her stepfather, Capitan Vidal. He has his own motives for this. She enters a fantasy world, is given tasks by a faun and is aided by some fairies, all with the goal of returning to an underworld kingdom, of which, she is a princess. At the same time, her stepfather is charged with fighting a band of rebels; something he does ruthlessly. This is an aspect of the film I didn't expect. There is a lot of violence considering the seemingly gentle nature of the girls quest. This may seem incongruous, however, even the world she inhabits is filled with horror and grotesque imagery. It feels a little unusual at first but it works and you are eager to see the next stage of each story. This perhaps could be considered as a weakness as both stories are equally compelling and it is a wrench being pulled from one to the other. (although, personally, i would prefer more of the Historical drama.)<br/><br/>The character of the Capitan is played fabulously by Sergi Lopez. He brings a lot of menace to the role and is totally believable as a fascist. He struts like a peacock, is pompous and cruel and his use of violence is shocking. <br/><br/>Ivana Baquero is excellent as Ofelia and Maribel Verdu is also excellent as the resilient Mercedes. <br/><br/>Overall, a clever idea brought to fruition by a talented cast and director. I would recommend it highly, although some may find some scenes a bit gruesome."

Instead, its a much more subtle affair, and it strikes a good balance between the various elements. Its visuals are like a reminiscence of the movie itself, mystical and intriguing. Its well executed, in all departments. And I have to point out the outstanding music. In general, Pan's Labyrint feels like something new.

When I saw the eyes on the table, I wondered, Why doesn't she just pick them up and throw them away and then feast without worrying about him. <br/><br/>3) How daft is she? I mean she was told 93249349347342 times not to eat anything yet she did.<br/><br/>4) Near the end, when she is shot then you know the scene where she sees her mother as queen and the king, for a second it shows her back to reality and she seemed to of moved a bit. Is this another clue that this was all just her imagination? That her vision of the queen and king were just her final figments of her imagination coming together?

"MrGeorgeKaplan","8","1","3","4 January 2007"," Definitely not another remake... or is it?
","While the cinema is full of familiar stories and studios won't make a film unless the book has sold a gazillion copies, going to see a Spanish fairytale movie is quite a refreshing change. <br/><br/>Of course fairy tales are the oldest stories of the lot, and they are actually jam-packed with clichés, but what people seem to forget is that they can be incredibly dark too. Thankfully the makers of Pan's Labyrinth have not forgotten this. Within the labyrinth are woodlice the size of my fist and a fairy disguised as praying mantis; even in the real world post Spanish Civil War setting there is a fair bit of gore and wince-making surgery. So this is very much a fairytale for adults and as adults we will have seen the themes (your basic good versus evil) a million times. But it is so refreshing to see this retrodden material handled like this, although there is a slight whiff of the awful Jim Henson Labyrinth; this version is lots darker as well as being more uplifting. <br/><br/>The acting was also pretty stunning; Sergi Lopez is a stunningly proud and evil Fascist captain while the lowly and invisible Mercedes, played by Maribel Verdu is easily his equal as an actor and in terms of her quietly powerful portrayal of the housekeeper. The only slight disappointment, and it is only a slight disappointment, is the performance of Ivana Baquero as Ofelia, the heroine. In any other film she would have been fine, but this film is so strong on so many levels that her slightly lacking performance does stand out more than it would in a less perfect film.<br/><br/>I don't really like fantasy  Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter left me cold - but this form of fantasy and the way it mixes insidiously with the real life experiences of the small girl is intriguing and beguiling. And you can bet there isn't going to be a prequel or a Pan's Labyrinth II, because this was a film made by filmmakers not moneymakers."
"loco_73","Null","1","3","4 January 2007"," A fantasy feast!
","I went to see this movie without knowing much about it, and not expecting anything special. Boy was I wrong! I had heard that it was getting good reviews and had won some international awards, but that did not prepare me for what I eventually ended up seeing.<br/><br/>First let me make one thing clear, THIS IS NOT A MOVIE FOR CHILDREN! Do not be fooled by the poster or the title, or the fact that this is a fantasy movie. This is a fantasy movie unlike I have seen in many years. It is dark, brooding, violent, disturbing, sad, touching and heartbreaking. Indeed a fantasy film for mature audiences, with none of the Disney-type cute creatures or funny sidekicks! Guillermo del Toro is quickly solidifying his reputation as an outstanding director, and one of the most original around for sure! Together with Alejandro Gonzales Inaritu and Alfonso Cuaron (and even Robert Rodriguez he is actually Mexican-American born in the US) and of course Pedro Almodovar he gives such a high and well deserved profile for the cinematic talent coming out of Latin America! For years these and other directors were a kind of hidden treasures but now with the phenomenal success of their movies, they have joined the ranks of the great directors of this world. This bodes well I think for international cinema, as Latin America is hardly the only region to produce excellent directors, amazing actors and very very good movies. These days the most original and unique movies are usually independent and in many cases outside Hollywood.<br/><br/>""Pan's Labyrinth/El Laberinto del Fauno"" is one of those rare movies that manages to thrill, move, and leave an indelible impression upon its audience. The directing, acting and special effects are of the highest quality. The movie is visually stunning and contains some imagery that I won't soon forget.<br/><br/>The movie leaves one a lot to think about and ponder. The best I could compare this movie with is the magical realism of Jorge Luis Borges or Gabriel Garcia Marquez some of the premier writers to come out Latin America.<br/><br/>I can't think of a better movie to see this season. Go, take a look and enjoy!"
"paulsoegianto","8","1","3","3 January 2007"," what a film
","I've never seen a film like this before. This film is totally different. It is one of the most complicated film I've ever seen. Guillermo del Toro is awesome. He made the film. They are 2 plots in the film. One is the fantasy and the other is the sadistic drama. Somehow del Toro managed to blend both of them into one film without any interruption. When I saw the movie, I thought this would be a nice fairy tale kind of Narnia thing. So I was not prepared at all to see this masterpiece. I was shocked for sure. The sadistic act was so real, I was frozen by that. Maribel Verdu played as a very strong woman. People sympathized her, how she struggle in that war situation. Ivana Baguero was amazing. Her innocence brought us into a confusion if it was all her imagination or it was all real. Sergi Lopez, I hated you so much for all sadistic acts. Well I only hated the role he played. Doug Jones is great. His pan man was crazy confusing character. Until the end of the movie I still didn't know what was his motive or if he was even real. For all crazy movie fans, you have to see this movie. Dark, fairy tale, craziness of the world, this movie has them all."

","I had no idea what I was letting my-self in for when I watched Pan's Labryinth but to be honest I bet neither will anybody else when they check this film out. This film has Del Toro's masterpiece written all over it and truly is one of his finest if not best films to date. The story is set in Spain's war torn past and has a focus of a 12 year old girl named Ofelia who seems to live in a dream world of her own which probably seems to be the best thing for as her reality is far from perfect with her mother forced to travel whilst being pregnant to meet her new husband and Ofelia's step-father the brutal and cold Captin Vidal who as we get to see is far, far from the perfect role model for any child. As the events unfold you are taken into a surreal world with extraordinary creatures and you begin to wonder what is real and what not. Del Toro has done such a marvellous job of luring you into this little girls world and taking you to a place where the lines of fantasy and reality become blurred . There are great performance's all round especially to the girl who played Ofelia and Sergi Lopez the cold hearted , evil Captin Vidal . Pans Labrinyth is truly a wonderful film to have watched, experienced, and felt my only complaint was that it left us too soon as your taking into this captivating world which tells us a very in your face fairy tale without the 'cuteness' which I feel is not suitable for children but on the hand tells us that indeed the Power of innocence is something evil should fear. <br/><br/>Pan's Labrinyth - 9 out 10 <br/><br/>EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED."

","I went to the pictures last night for the obligatory annual viewing of 'It's A Wonderful Life', but it was sold out so I went to see 'Pan's Labyrinth'; a film I wouldn't have gone near if it hadn't have been the only remotely interesting film showing at the cinema. I know this sounds weird coming from someone who was intending to watch 'It's A Wonderful Life' for the umpteenth time, but I thought that 'Pan's Labyrinth' looked a bit sappy from the trailers. All the stuff about 'innocence' in the reviews I'd read really put me off as well. Having now actually seen it, I am now reminded of the importance of keeping an open mind: the film was superb.<br/><br/>What struck me in particular was the brilliant female characters in the movie who serve to bring about the downfall of the appalling Capitan Vidal. Ofelia and Mercedes (an older version of Ofelia) are two of the strongest female characters I've seen in cinema in a long time. The film, while it explores many themes, is ultimately about the courage and strength of women, in my opinion. <br/><br/>Thank you, Guillermo Del Toro, for recognising and paying tribute to female courage, strength and imagination. How many women all over the world must have risked their lives for what they believe in? We are too often depicted as submissive victims or background players. Again, Guillermo, thank you!"

","I just saw this film and although I'm not used to subtitles, I could follow the plot and dialog easily enough. It just takes a bit of getting used to. I'd have preferred it if the film had been dubbed into English, but that's a personal bias. This is a powerful film, very compelling, and very well-done. I can see why it won some awards! The characters are believable and you come to care about them (even the brutally sadistic Captain is not simply one-dimensional) and even the fantasy element woven throughout the realistically-presented war story is weirdly fitting. However, this film is shockingly and graphically violent, almost to a sickening degree. And the fate of the young heroine, Ofelia, is so heart-stopping sad... so freaking sad; I don't know if I'd want to see it a second time.

I've been recommending this film to people and they have been put off when I mention it has subtitles in it but please don't let that put you off! Its a fantastic horror fantasy film, and I watched it on a digital projector so the image was gorgeous ! the plot goes as follows In a post-Civil War northern Spain in 1944, a 12-year-old girl, Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), moves with her heavily-pregnant mother and stepfather into a new home in the countryside. Her stepfather, Captain Vidal (Sergi López) has been posted to this remote area to rid it of rebels. Disliked by the sadistic Vidal, Ofelia, who revels in ancient stories and fairy tales, discovers an immense and ancient labyrinth guarded by a Faun (Doug Jones). He tells her she is the long-lost daughter of the king of a magical land, and to regain entry to her kingdom she must carry out three tasks. So Ofelia enters a strange and no less dangerous world of fairies and extraordinary creatures such as the terrifying Pale Man (Doug Jones).<br/><br/>spoilers the violence is brutal in this film and one scene in particular where a man has his face smashed in with a bottle had me gagging.

"skymovies","9","1","3","25 November 2006"," A grimly glorious fairytale with a dual personality
","Intoxicating, impressive and imaginative, Guillermo Del Toro's wartime fantasy has few detractors and rightly so. But the two halves of his story do not fit together as satisfyingly as one might hope. Like a collaboration between Ken Loach and Clive Barker, it's a cinematic non sequitur in which the sober and frequently vicious reality of Spain's fascist past is placed beside, but not reflected in, the dark looking-glass of the titular otherworld.<br/><br/>Bridging the divide, young Ivana Baquero is disarmingly natural as Ofelia, treading carefully around her stepfather Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez; the most despicable screen villain of the year) while throwing herself fearlessly into the tasks assigned to her by the bolshy and vaguely untrustworthy faun Pan.<br/><br/>By definition, fantasy requires no explanation. But Del Toro takes tangible elements from one world into the other (such as the healing mandrake root) while hinting that Pan and his fellow mythic beasts exist only in Ofelia's mind. Title cards saying ""Meanwhile..."" would not look out of place between scenes detailing the grim conflict between Vidal's fascists and the forest-dwelling rebels and Ofelia's plunges into the otherworld.<br/><br/>Incohesiveness aside, Pan's Labyrinth marks Del Toro as a true visionary who bends to neither convention nor compromise. Those prepared for nastiness are in for an audacious and visually glorious Gothic treat."

","I must say i don't like Del Toro. I found The Devils Backbone to be simplistic and obvious. Blade 2 was simply the sequel to a movie which wasn't that good anyways. Hellboy was OK, not good, not bad... just OK. But the movie i saw this evening...<br/><br/>Del Toro manages to portray various feelings in what seems to be a fairy tale. Its complexity lies on its apparent simplicity, Ophelia representing the good natured heart of innocence and Captain Vidal the corruption of the time. Visually its outstanding, Notice the scene involving that deadly white creature or the first encounter with the fairy when Ophelia is on her bed. Del Toro shows off his astonishing skills as a director as he manages to overwhelm us, make us smile and most crucially entertain us. The ending was simply heart-breaking and the scenes involving the fictional world, were as nerve-shattering as astonishing.<br/><br/>The movie not only benefits of Del Toro's wonderful script but also of some compelling performances. The actress playing Ophelia, was simply perfect, spot on. Maribel Verdu is convincing as the troubled servant and well... Sergi Lopez gets the show stealer role as the evil Captain Vidal which he portrays successfully.<br/><br/>Ladies and Gentlemen, Almodovar has a serious rival for the Oscars. Personally I really find it hard to choose this movie or Volver as a winner, as they are both original and superb in their own way.<br/><br/>I must also underline the feeling of melancholy or maybe nostalgia which i got after seeing this movie, as i realized it was a fairy tale, and maybe this is what is really great about this movie... lots of directors try to complicate things. Del Toro manages to overwhelm us by simply telling us a fairy tale, the most beautiful fairy tale this critic has heard in a long time."
"thomvic","10","2","10","9 October 2010"," Beautiful and imaginative.........
","Pan's Labyrinth is a fairytale like no other. It is essentially gripped in reality and submerged in the real world with a sense of horror that brings you back into the real world we live in.<br/><br/>What I loved about this story is that you are sort of expecting a typical ending that has most of these sort of fairy tales ending but you get something different (which I won't say here).<br/><br/>Our main heroine is Ofelia, a young girl who has moved with her pregnant mother who has married an officer who is hunting out Spanish guirellas during a war. She is a lover of fairy tales and its novels. Disliking her wicked stepfather who is a cruel man blinded by his mission of blood and pride, she encounters a labryinth in which she meets a Faun who says she is the reincarnation of a princess called Moanna. She is given three tasks by the faun to ensure her loyalty and spirit is true so she will be able to return to the world her father - the King - has longly awaited for her to return to.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure what to expect when I watched this. I imagined some sort of escapism for this girl as I read the back of the DVD and saw it was set during a war. And I wasn't entirely wrong but at the same time, it is almost a sense of hope for this girl to escape a world that is torn apart by the cruelty of life and the people that inhabit it.<br/><br/>The visual effects are superb, and you can't help but be drawn into this world of wonders. I was a bit shocked by the graphic violence in this, so you do wonder which audience this film is going at. But I think it is interesting that a film which seems to have very mature adult themes can incorporate so much magic and wonder at the same time. It really is something to behold.<br/><br/>All the performances are fine, in particular from Ivana Baqureo as Ofelia. You really feel for her and the supporting characer of Mecedes really makes you root for her and the whole guerilla group fighting for justice.<br/><br/>It's an unusual but highly imaginative story that manages to capture your interest in this dark world mixed with the human spirit to fight for what is right. Highly recommended."

","If I was to say ""This is about a young girl who has a vivid imagination in a Spanish civil war era and the whole film is in Spanish"" you would say that you don't want to see it. Thankfully I can Say that it is much,much deeper than that.<br/><br/>The acting is brilliant Ivana Baquero is great as the lead Ofelia and bring a very inquisitive character to the story and someone who accepts their life and is quite an inspiration to us all. Sergi Lopez plays CapitainVidal Ofelia's stepfather and a cold hearted man who is using Ofelia's mum (To have a son) as a way of coping with his pain and he brings a hating, yet somehow a sympathetic, character. Finally Doug James is (the only American actor on the set and also he speaks no Spanish at all!) Pan/Pale Man. He terrifies you with by acting 2 horrible looking, sounding and moving creatures.<br/><br/>Basically Pan's Labyrinth is about a young girl who is drawn into this magical and maniacal world where dark and terrifying creatures roam. She meets a Faun called Pan who challenges her with 3 tasks to complete and in return he will tell her a secret about who she really is (Clichéd I know). Her struggle also lies in helping her mother through a painful birth whilst her stepfather attacks a group of communists.<br/><br/>This film is not for children in fact I could think of a few adults who would turn their faces from the screen. The violence is extreme (and 18/X rated if I say so myself) and the whole feel of the film is graphically disturbing I might add. At points the film makes you feel sick, especially when Ofelia is trudging through Cockroach infested slime to reach a gigantic Toad which flicks it's disgusting slimy tongue at her, or when Pale Man (A man with his eyes on his hands instead of his face) chases her. It's moments like that which make this film something a lot different than Alice In Wonderland or a War film for that matter.<br/><br/>If you want to see this film but think not because of it being in Spanish and subtitled in English watch it anyway because I guarantee that this film will be nowhere near as good in English and that's why director Guillermo Del Toro denied requests for Hollywood producers to make it with him.<br/><br/>Go see it because it is a fantastically brutal, dark, moving and disturbing fantasy film.

","Guillermo Del Toro had definitely made this film a unique deal! Pan's Labyrinth has to be one of the newest treat of our times. Though admittedly the actors and actresses didn't compellingly excel much with their roles, the story was nevertheless full of substance and depth. I believe that the acting wasn't terrible, it fairly fit the storyline. And they excelled well in special effects, cinematography and art, which balances well the structure of the story as a whole. The uniqueness of the story has also something to do why it is undeniably captivating. We were used to children fantasy stories filled with immense fictitious characters, places and most of all happy endings. Though in history some of these historical children fantasy tales had depressing portions of the story, the cliché is that it ended happily ever after. However this film is an exception. I can't even believe that everything about the story where pulled out of Guillermo Del Toro's imaginative mind. To tell story in the end was saddening. I didn't end happily well, as what majority of us would expect. This isn't really a new treat for most films. But for this filmin this area of genre it is brilliantly portrayed. The depth of the words, the poetic structure of the narration got me enthralled, and I would say this is undoubtedly a magnificent film. It's dark, magical, sad but eerily captivating."

Ofelia and her pregnant mother went to live with the ruthless Spanish general. At his place, Ofelia learns of her true destiny.<br/><br/>The acting is very, very good.

The real surprise for me was the end. I was so horrified that the stepfather would treat Ophelia as an adult and be so cruel to her, even to the ultimate act of violence. Even though her 'ending' seems to fulfill her destiny, my husband and I discussed for a long time whether or not we had seen her redemption or just the murder of a child. Did she fulfill the prophecy, or was that her own version of heaven? Did she go on at all, or was the kingdom her last fantasy?

","""Pan's Labyrimth"" is an exceptionally good film in many ways...but I am apprehensive to recommend it without first providing a warning. The film is brutally violent...more than most any film I've seen. The violence is so realistic and awful that I cannot imagine it wouldn't be a chore for many viewers to watch it to the finish. After all, who wants to see close-ups of a guy getting his face smashed in, another guy sewing his face back together or someone being tortured? You're in for that and MUCH more if you see this strange yet strangely violent story set in post Civil War Spain.<br/><br/>The film is set in the early 1940s...a few years after the Civil War has ended officially. However, pockets of resistance still remain and an incredibly sadistic and brutal Captain is out to root out this resistance even if it means murder and torture. Through the course of the film, he torments most everyone around him and you see much of it through the eyes of his new step-daughter, Ofelia.<br/><br/>As for Ofelia, she is a child who either sees magical beings or is insane...and you aren't exactly sure which during the film. She sees a magic faun and fairies and they seem very real to her. The faun gives her tasks to do and she sometimes does them wrong...supposedly because she had a strongly oppositional streak within her. Or, she simply could have been insane...and you never really are sure which.<br/><br/>So what did I like? Well, the scenes with the faun and other magical creatures were incredible--quite beautiful and amazing to watch. On the other, the story, despite its unusual and interesting aspects, is grim and awful. I much prefer the writer/director's other films such as ""Crimson Peak"" or ""The Devil's Backbone"". Both seemed less nihilistic and grim. It is finely crafted....just not all that pleasant to watch."

","WAIT FOR THE English EDITION. I find it a cowardly move on the part of the director to debut a foreign language film in the United States for these two reasons: (1) This keeps it from competing directly against (big) ""American"" films (for an Oscar), you see, foreign language films get to compete in the ""junior varsity"" league. (2) I saw the movie 2 1/2 times in the theater, attempted to watch such a visually stunning movie, and was distracted by subtitles. The first time I GOT UP AND WALKED OUT, because NOWHERE was it said in the promotions, that the movie would be in Spanish. I am sure millions were duped in just this way, to go see the movie, in such a lazy release. OOooh I know the director, he a wanted it to be a justa lika heya envisioned ita to be. Get real, the movie would have been a potential blockbuster, if they had just dubbed it. Oops I forgot, refer to reason #1.<br/><br/>Despite these prideful, disrespectful, and cowardly choices on the part of the Director, and distributor, it is still an ""okay"" movie. A dark theme, disturbing monsters, and real life monsters, should dissuade parents from letting children watch. The ONE good thing I will say about the film is that it did not (?) pander and try to get a PG-13 rating. In my opinion, dumbing it down for vastly wider audience.<br/><br/>All this can be summed up like this... Did you watch ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" at the theater in mandarin Chinese with subtitles? I DID, twice. When the English DVD version was released, it was as if it was a whole NEW AND MUCH BETTER movie. Get it?<br/><br/>So rent this if you must, but WAIT and see how much better the movie will be once it is dubbed into English!"

","Pan's Labyrinth is overall a very beautiful and imaginative movie to watch. The elements of fairytales, magic, war, and tragedy are all tied together well. The film is set in Spain during the Spanish Civil war. The plot of the film escalated very quickly, it helped keep me interested. Ophelia's visions of bugs turning into fairies, a large toad regurgitating it's whole stomach, creepy monsters eating fairies, and finally her ascending to the underworld to be with her parents fulfilled the fairytale and magic elements. These ideas of fairytales were some like I have never imagined. The mother passing away while giving birth to her son was a very tragic moment. Also, the captain torturing and killing the rebels showed how brutal of a man he was. I feel like the movie was a little too harsh with all the torture, blood, and death in these scenes. Before I watched this movie, I watched the trailer. It very well summarized the happy parts of the movie. However, when I finished the movie, I was creeped out by all the blood, large bugs, and creepy monsters with eyes on his hands. Overall the movie ended on a good note. Even though, Ophelia passed away after being shot she ended up as a princess in another world with her mother and father."

","At first glance I thought that this was a movie for children or general audience. While watching, I quickly realized how much violence the movie contained, along with gruesome scenes. I went back and checked the rating and turned out it's rated R. I am mentioning the rating confusion that I faced because I found this movie very unusual. I couldn't fit it to a category. From my point of view, the combination of fantasy and history/drama seemed incoherent. Also, I didn't find the fantasy part really captivating, it was rather dark.
Overall, it was worth watching to a certain extent but definitely not a great one!"
"strassermarlies","3","1","4","3 June 2018"," Disturbing
","Oh boy, how I hate this movie! I have heard so many good things about it, then the high rating on Imdb. I guess who thinks this movie is ""magical"" and ""great"" also thinks Game of Thrones is the best thing ever. 
There is not much magic, but there is torture and violence that makes you want to vomit. I was disturbed and disgusted. Let me tell you, I have seen many horror movies with lots of blood and violence, so it takes a lot to make me feel like this. 
I give it 3 stars, because the cinematography wasn't bad, the lullaby played at the end was beautiful. The whole atmosphere had something special. I can see why people are somehow captivated by this very dark tale. But that doesn't mean that the movie deserves the high praise. 
I honestly thought the charcters were pretty cliche. The weak woman who marries a general because she needs financial support for her and her daughter. The general was a spanish Hitler. Then the rebels and the housemade who helped them. I didn't think there was something new or intriguing about the war story. They dragged it out too much. The whole story about the princess and the labyrinth had more potential, I was looking forward to that. I give this movie credit for creating the creepiest monster I have ever seen on televison. 
Unfortunately I cannot give more than 3 stars for this torture porn movie that disguises itself as a thought provoking fantasy tale for adults."

"Cjalln1","9","1","4","31 July 2015"," Mysterious, dark and labyrinthine
","""Pan's Labyrinth"" could easily be mistaken for a children's story, if it wasn't for the dark undertones which permeate throughout. Up until Captain Vidal's first brutal act of violence, the film feels like a morose kids' film, similar to (for example) ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"". This sense of innocence and wonder formulates a unique atmosphere and a narrative which is strung parallel between a grotesque folklore fairy tale and the gritty real events of 1940s Spain.<br/><br/>The Spanish dialogue doesn't hinder the pace of the storytelling - in fact the foreign language increases the fairy-tale feeling within the film. The atmospheric orchestral score contributes to the ominousness, emphasising the darkness of both worlds. Although Ofelia's tasks are terrifying and mysterious, monsters are exposed too amongst the background of war-torn Spain; the oppressive Captain is a hellish stepfather with his power complex and unhealthy fixation on honour and death. The stark storyline is mirrored in the cold blue and yellow tones of the scenes.<br/><br/>Disbelief has to be suspended for the mythical creatures and otherworldly realms, although there is the subtle possibility that the fantasy world is a figment of the imagination. In this, del Toro descends a little into the cliché of a magical world open only to imaginative youngsters; yet this conclusion is left open to interpretation, as are the various fables and bedside stories mentioned symbolically throughout.<br/><br/>""Pan's Labyrinth"" is hard-hitting. No part of it is easy watching, from the violence of the Civil War to the fortuitous gore and the heart-in-mouth suspense of many ""other-world"" scenes (notably the lair of the horrifying Pale Man). Don't make the mistake of writing it off as a children's film, for it achieves that rare balance of creating a gripping dark story with a measure of innocence added by the perspective of a child - it is also far too scary for youngsters! However, the heavy themes don't weight it down, thanks to astounding acting from the actress who plays Ofelia and the comparatively ""escapist"" mystery of the magical fairy realm."
"FatMan-QaTFM","Null","1","4","25 August 2011"," Brutally violent, but an excellent film
","At the risk of being spoilerish, let me say that this movie did not play out as billed. It looked like there would be a lot more fantasy and a lot less of the ""real life"" stuff. Although this wasn't the case, I did still enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>Sergi López has to be one of the greatest villains I've ever seen. He was so brutally evil that I loved to watch what he would do next. Obsession is a beautiful thing when played out properly.<br/><br/>The fantasy portions of the film were not as nice as I expected. They were very gritty and a bit scary. The melding of stories and myths bothered me just a little bit, but I think I can get over it.<br/><br/>I don't know too much to say without giving a lot of the movie away. The fantasy and real life were well crafted and played out right to the end perfectly. An excellent movie that deserves a watch if you can stomach the violence."
"OneRingToRuleThemAll13","9","1","4","25 June 2011"," Beautiful and captivating cinema!!
","Let me start by saying this is NOT your average fairy tail. It is darker and more sadistic than Narnia or all other fantasy films I've ever seen. Take THAT, James Cameron.<br/><br/>The film takes place in Spain, and follows the journey of Ofelia, a young girl fascinated by fantasy and magic, who goes with her mother to live with her stepfather (Captain Vidal) to a sort of military camp, where she finds her way into a labyrinth that sits nearby, finding her way into a world of both fantasy and darkness, where she learns she is a princess named Moanna must complete 3 tasks in order to go into her father's realm and reign with him.<br/><br/>The film also (in contrast to Ofelia's magical world of beauty and wonder), follows Ofelia's merciless stepfather, who is the top authoritarian figure in the camp and is absolutely disturbing to watch as he tortures and kills people throughout the film . This is probably where you will see more blood, since he is an extremely brutal figure. The movie (although may seem kid-like at first to some people) is NOT for kids. People 16+ can probably handle it, though. Nevertheless, you can never be TOO careful. After all, it IS a fairy tale for adults.<br/><br/>The acting is great, especially from Sergi López and Ivana Baquero, who DEFINITELY deserve an award for this. Both of their characters are believable and Ivana is charming as Ofelia. The rest of the cast does an also amazing job, particularly the one who plays Mercedes.<br/><br/>The special effects and make-up here are truly MAGICAL! I mean, the titular faun looks great and also may terrify some people, since the make-up is done so well he looks absolutely grotesque.<br/><br/>The music is also perfect for this film, with some of the most breathtaking music in theater history Although, this movie is not perfect nor for everyone. As I have mentioned, the film is not for squeamish people when it comes to violence. There is tons of blood throughout, although this is not one of those movies that showers you with blood. The director understands that the violence is necessary to set the film's tone, and so it is present.<br/><br/>The other gripe I have with the film is the pacing. There are times (especially if you're a fantasy fan), where you wish you were seeing Ofelia's story unfold, but you are left with many lengthy scenes focusing on the hateful Captain Vidal. Although his character is important to the atmosphere of the film, enough is enough! <br/><br/>Well, here it is. My review of Pan's Labyrinth (or as it was originally named by Guillermo del Toro, who is Mexican and therefore made the movie in Spanish: El laberinto del fauno). If you like fantasy stuff like me, and can get past the gory moments and pacing issues, well you may very well love this great fantasy epic. This one is truly one of the most unique experiences in cinema. Bravo, Del Toro, BRAVO!! You are guaranteed at least ONE Oscar with this one!"

","Pan's Labyrinth, the winner of three Academy Awards including Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Makeup, is set in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War. In 1944, widowed Carmen moves with her young daughter Ofelia into the house of her new husband, a cruel fascist captain named Vidal. Finding her new life hard to bear, Ofelia seeks refuge in a mysterious labyrinth and encounters Pan (a faun), the half-man, half-goat creature of mythology, who tells her she is actually a long-lost princess of a magical kingdom beneath the earth. However, in order to make her way back and be reunited with her true family, she must accomplish three tasks Guillermo del Toro, Director of Pan's Labyrinth, says, ""I've always preferred genres to be mixed. For me, Pan's Labyrinth is therefore a drama rooted in a context of war, with mythological elements grafted on."" Hardly can we find a political drama in the guise of a fairy tale. It is simply an original and subtle mixture of fantasy, horror, history and drama. The main themes of the movie are as follows.<br/><br/>1. Cruel reality VS Magical world The real world is much scarier than the underground fairy kingdom. The real ""monster"" in the film is Captain Vidal, who cold-bloodedly murders two innocent peasants. Comparatively speaking, Pan (the only Ancient Greek god who have tasted death and is able to ""panic"" others), the Pale Man (whose eyes are on its hands), the giant toad (symbolizing lust) and eerie fairies are less fierce.<br/><br/>2. Dictatorship VS Free will Fascism is an authoritarian regime favoring complete obedience to authority, while republicans are in pursuit of freedom. Meanwhile, Ofelia exercises her free will and makes several decisions on her own in the movie.<br/><br/>Capitán Vidal: You could have obeyed me! Doctor: (his last words) But captain, to obey - just like that - for obedience's sake... without questioning That's something only people like you do.<br/><br/>3. Reality VS Imagination The brilliant ending is like an ink-blot test. Whether the ending is a tragedy or not depends on your own interpretation. Audiences are advised to pay attention to the magic chalk, the mandrake root, the narrator, the story books, Ofelia's reaction while meeting Pan, the moving walls in the labyrinth, the fairies transforming themselves from praying mantises, etc. A detailed discussion can be found in the following website. Indeed, the director believes the fairies in the movie are real, but he also agrees with those believing those monsters are just imagined by the desperate girl who is eager to escape from the traumatizing reality. Two interpretations also make sense, which makes the ending an unforgettable one.<br/><br/>As there are some violent scenes in the movie, parents are advised not to see the movie with their children and they should bear in mind that it is much different from Harry Potter. As an adult dreamer, I was fascinated by the two-edged ending, symbolic images, astonishing visuals and mesmerizing music. The lullaby hummed throughout the film adds melancholy to this darkly disturbing, but deeply affecting mixture of different genres."

"pontifikator","8","1","4","1 April 2011"," An interesting movie of the magical realism genre
","This is an interesting movie. I believe it is of the magical realism genre: the director (Guillermo del Toro) has, in my opinion, left wiggle room for two views. <br/><br/>In this film, Ivana Baquero plays Ofelia, the daughter of Carmen (played by Ariadna Gil). Carmen is recently widowed and has been wed by the influential Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez) at the depth of the Spanish Civil War. Carmen is pregnant with Vidal's son (he knows it's his male heir and will brook no dispute).<br/><br/>Vidal is a heartless murderer, stamping out the revolutionaries to keep Spain safe for Franco and the Catholic church, and much of what del Toro puts in the film is a denunciation of both. Del Toro is excellent in his drawing of Vidal's character - we see Vidal in his dressing room and on the battlefield, compelled to heroics by his father's heroic death in battle. Vidal is a monster: sadistic and heartless. He is reality in the Spanish civil war.<br/><br/>Ofelia spends time reading fairy tales and believing them to be true. Her mother chides her gently; Vidal takes her to task more strenuously. Del Toro shows us Ofelia's fantasy land, and we are left with enough vagueness that some can say her fantasies are real and some can say her fantasies are her escape from the hell of the war. And given the monster in her life, who can fault her for her escapism?<br/><br/>If the fantasy is correct, Ofelia is the daughter of the king and queen of the underworld, and she strayed above ground for too long and lost her memory. She needs only to find her way back to assume her rightful position as heir to the crown. She finds a faun in an old maze who proposes to test her to see if she really is the princess, and she accepts the challenge. In the fantasies she faces monsters and monstrosities, sometimes failing, sometimes succeeding. If her fantasy is reality, she passes the ultimate test and goes to her mother the queen and her father the king of the underworld, takes the throne and lives happily ever after, beloved by all her subjects.<br/><br/>We are, however, given an alternate universe. A heartbreaking world where the monster is her mother's husband, where life has no value, and where no one can pass the ultimate test. If this story is reality, she fails and does not live happily ever after.<br/><br/>You choose which version to believe is true, and then you can think about what your choice says about you. Pay attention to all the details, fairy tales, rules, and books. There is a rich story in this movie, and your attention is well-rewarded."
"demonv3","7","1","4","25 March 2011"," Interesting to say the least.
","The movie did not meet my expectations, although, when asked whether or not I would recommend this movie, I would have to give it the thumbs up. What makes this movie stand out is how unique it is from most movies, it challenges the normal formulas used in todays movies, conveying 'imagination', imagination being the key theme throughout the movie, the creativity from start to end is what makes the movie so great. The protagonist and the power of the mind, both used simultaneously to defuse the violence and events in which she is situated between. Looking on the negative side of things, I personally struggled to build a connection to the main character, her journeys were intriguing and at times suspenseful but the wellbeing of the characters was not something I was concerned with at all. Overall great movie, with the climax of the movie sending a powerful message."
"darylcostello","9","1","4","22 February 2011"," Fantasy & Reality perfectly bound as one
","I was apprehensive and you could say 'not bothered' about watching Pan's Labyrinth, I think it was down to 2 reasons, 1) When I am recommended things, especially when the recommender is obviously passionate about spreading the word of the film, I often get worried about watching it in case I don't like it 2) The cover of the film and the artwork on the sleeve put me off, it looked very magical and fantasy and dark, not traits I desire in a film usually However, on watching the film the 'Dark, fantasy' element of the film is just one of its many faces.<br/><br/>The film manages, within the first 5 minutes, to create a tension inside you that instantly puts you on edge, you know something beyond the normality of the initial military scenes will happen, but you just don't know when, why or how. As the film continues it becomes even more difficult to see how the quite serious & fact based military story, will intertwine with the magical fantasy story that you know is about to happen, but it does, and it does so very well.<br/><br/>The nerves and fear I felt throughout the first half an hour, were all targeted towards the darker underworld but the film amazingly manages to shift your fear towards the 'normal' world in the story, mirroring, I think, the shift in Ofelia's emotions towards the new world she has encountered. You begin to not fear the underworld, but embrace what it is about and your hatred towards Vidal intensifies.<br/><br/>From about 45 minutes onwards I was gripped, had settled into the film nicely and could really enjoy the special effects, the clever linking of the story lines characters and how they all work together It was a clever backdrop to stage a fantasy film, giving it reality and mortality to balance the fantasy element of the film and for someone like me who isn't a big fantasy film fan, that was essential.<br/><br/>The acting was brilliant, effects were amazing and subtle, the story line was good, but I don't necessarily think it was a film about an intense story, the story was more a basis for delivery of a very imaginative fantasy world.<br/><br/>My only downside was the ending, I think it either should have left it without explanation, or explained the transition back to the underworld as a princess a little better. Was that her real mum and dad? I think it was but not sure if they were consciously the same people (although we never met her dad) in the real world, or if in fact, like her, they didn't know who they really were either"

","For anyone who is on the borderline for whether or not they should watch this film, I strongly recommend seeing it. <br/><br/>At first when knowing it's a foreign film, my thoughts were ""oh no, this isn't going to be good is it"" but all this changed when watching this movie. It is obvious that this film is not a low budget (hence the intense amount of effects/animation used) but is really a masterpiece of the modern world of film. Now This may be from the variety of shots used, such as the simplistic close up and mid shots but overall what makes this film so great is the amount of imagery and connotations embedded within the film. Such as the tree which could symbolise and show a close relation to Alice in wonderland, which would show innocence and purity. <br/><br/>Overall to all who have their doubts about this film, watch it with a clear mind before judging it because this film is just mind blowing.<br/><br/>Chris"
"LiamJamesFeltham","7","1","4","27 September 2010"," great movie, chilling yet magical
","I originally saw Pans Labrynth in around probably 2007 when i was around 13/14 and being entirely honest it did freak me out... in a good way. I have recently watched Pans Labyrynth in its entirety, paying full attention to the significance of each scene. Watching it through again was very beneficial as i find watching this film just once does not make it clear enough, on first viewing i found the storyline slightly daunting as well as being a bit too much too take on. I can now see the effective mix of fantasy/horror/action-war film, which in some parts presented beautiful imagery and stunning shots of the forest stained in a golden sun, yet the darkness, eerie settings and chilling non-diegetic sounds. Pans Labrynth was released in the Uk of 24th November 2006, and won multiple awards for art direction, makeup and cinematography. I would describe the film as a coming-of-age fantasy horror film, it contains the elements that most interest me, horror & fantasy, but at the same time coming-of-age movies are a huge favourite for me. I believe coming of age movies like Pans Lab apply to teenagers my age, from 10-16, however the film still applies to a broader audience - with powerful and shocking depictions of civil war in spain in 1944, set against one girls (Ofelia) personal war against her adolescence and the harsh truths of reality but the ugly side of fantasy, for example the disgusting depiction of the frog hiding under a fig tree in the shape of many things, devils horns, fallopian tubes, the fauns head - all being generally negative. Even though Pans Labyrnth is a fantasy movie the general public can connect to its story of the concept of how life generally sucks sometimes and fantasy can prove to be better than reality but still has its ugly side. The film contains some controversial scenes, including a innocents mans face being beaten to a pulp by a bottle and graphic scenes of execution and mutilation. Gory scenes, including Vidal the antagonist sewing up his mouth.. as well as disturbing horror sequences such as a child-eating, pale, saggy creature with no eyes & sharp talon hands devouring fairies and chasing Ofelia, the protagonist we can connect too. I wouldn't advise children below the age of 10 to watch this film with enthusiasm. Each scene is well crafted and the amount of violence is logical as each character is crucial to the plot and each character rarely lives through the entire movie. But the actions of each character are understandable. The film is brutal and incredibly deep yet beautifully put together, flowing from one hellish task to the next other-worldly battle that the heroine Ofelia must face while we witness her coming of age as well as the type of person she really is, a lonely girl, escaping this world in her books. Subtitles shouldn't even be an excuse to not see this movie as by the end i found i myself had forgotten about the subtitles and even picked up on a little Spanish throughout the film. I recommend this movie to any soul interested in other-worldly fantasy adventures, brutally yet beautifully shot in a backdrop of vice, an enchanting coming-of-age story."

","Dark, sensitive and melancholic movie. About an age, a war and a country, about values and game, dreams and escapes. Lesson about the rules of existence, beyond the masks, words and lies.Travel in the heart of memory,on the carpet of the time of contemplation. It is not a fairy-tale but only the magic may create the limits of real discoveries. The powerful taste of childhood, with fantastic friends, the smell of Christmas Eve, the toys and the dialogs with theirs, all are parts of this film. The history and the myth. The fight as dream. The freedom as a chuck door, the death as sign of victory after a long combat. Same Manichean vision about Civil War, same recipes of good and bad. In fact, a world, old, ugly, boring. And the science of Ofelia to give a subtle sense to the ash of days."

","Are you the kind of moviegoer who just doesn't cotton to subtitled films? If you're like me, you have enough trouble following the spoken words and the images on the screen without also having to wrestle with text. For me, it's especially tough when the movie depends strongly on dialog for its success. So for the most part, I avoid subtitled movies. I'll watch 'em, but it darn well better be an awesome film.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is an awesome film, and I mean that it's both awe-inspiring and excellent. The movie is full of lush imagery that at times cascades gently over the viewer, lulling them into acquiescence, and other times jarring him into reality. It's simultaneously beautiful, arresting, dreamy, and terrifying.<br/><br/>The story centers on young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a bookish sort who's been uprooted by her mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to live with her new stepfather Capitan Vidal (Sergi Lopez) in a remote military stronghold in Spain during World War II. The Franco government has just assumed control, and Vidal's troops are there to fight rebels stationed in the woods, all while rationing food to the needy villagers around them.<br/><br/>As if this situation weren't unnerving enough, Ofelia's mother is very late in her pregnancy (by the Capitan, of course), and the pregnancy isn't proceeding smoothly; in an ominous sign, the caravan ferrying Ofelia and Carmen to the castle has to stop when Carmen becomes ill.<br/><br/>On top of dealing with these very real problems, Ofelia finds herself drawn to a huge labyrinth located in the garden of the vast estate. The housekeeper, Mercedes, warns the imaginative Ofelia not to enter the labyrinth, because its myriad turns would be very dangerous indeed for her young charge.<br/><br/>In the middle of her first night in the castle, Ofelia awakes and finds herself drawn to a pit near the labyrinth. Descending its narrow stone stairs, she finds Pan (Faun in Spanish), a servant of the Lord of the Underworld. Pan tells Ofelia that she is actually the Princess of the Underworld, and that she must perform three tasks so that she can leave her human body and return to be by the side of her father.<br/><br/>To describe these three tasks would be to give away a bit too much, but suffice to say that they aren't as simple as saying one's prayers or sneaking a loaf of bread away from the kitchen. But Ofelia does choose to complete them; she decides that given the evil of her malignant, torturing stepfather (a despot in training during the Fascist regime), she would rather follow her limitless imagination.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a parallel storyline involves the rebels, who have a source inside the castle: Mercedes. Vidal is determined to root all of the rebels out of the woods and exterminate them all, and they are equally determined to overthrow him and return freedom to the masses. As well, Carmen's pregnancy becomes even more difficult, and it is only a matter of time before the three threads come to a head.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most striking of the many visual desserts in the movie is that of the Pale Man, one of the demons that Ofelia must encounter during her travails. The scene is a banquet table with a lush array of foods and drinks. At one end sits a creature. The creature is tall, but humanoid in shape. It has long arms and arrow-sharp fingers with nails resembling talons. It is hairless and virtually skinless as well, and it has no eyes. Its mouth is a gaping maw, bereft of lips; a cold, stark, ugly beast that immediately fills one with horror and dread. On the table before the creature are two eyeballs; when the Pale Man is aroused, it grasps the eyeballs with its gnarled hands and slaps them into the palms, then holds the arms at head's height in order to see its prey.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro's film is highly imaginative, almost decadent in its lushness, evocative in both beauty and ugliness, in Ofelia's innocence, Carmen's and Mercedes' love, and Vidal's demonic cruelty. Vidal is a terrible sight, a by-the-book murderous fiend who will stop at nothing to completely eradicate everyone who opposes him, including the weak and the infirm. Lopez's performance is gut-wrenching, despicable, and sincere. The precocious Baquero, as Ofelia, is a perfect foil to the haunting Vidal, combining her natural, wide-eyed naivete and curiosity with resolve, intelligence, and self-sufficiency.<br/><br/>This original film is Mexico's 2007 entry as Best Film in a Foreign Language for the Academy Awards, and it really should win. Had it been in English, I have no doubt it would have been considered for Best Picture. It really is that good; don't let your aversion to subtitles prevent you from seeing this one."

As it turns out this is one of the most magical, and brutal movies i have ever seen. The plot keeps you on the edge of your seat. The scenery and setting of the movie helps add to the brilliance of it.<br/><br/>The acting here is strong from start to finish, and there is a haunting similarity between this movie and Alice in Wonderland..just with a sick and twisted turn of course. This is just a wonderful movie start to finish and it doesn't disappoint. If you are a fan of Legend you will be a fan of this movie. It has that same haunting dream-like feel to it.<br/><br/>A Must see!"
"vindana","9","1","4","7 November 2008"," A fantasy that breaks your heart?
","Fairy tales have their roots in very old, very deep human fears. Guillermo Del Toro mercilessly teases out those fears in his ambitious, glorious and harrowing adult fairy tale Pan's Labyrinth. It is rich, both in metaphorical terms and in literal ones. Del Toro's imagery is so vivid and concrete that it's likely to change the color of your sleep. The movie's meanings emerge from its visuals instead of being driven by them. Del Toro has mastered the delicate, difficult feat of using pure sensation to make us think. Pan's Labyrinth is a film of breathtaking emotional, thematic and visual depth. It brilliantly melds the disparate realms of fairy tale and brutal 20th century history into a most affecting film. While Pan's Labyrinth has many fairy tale elements, don't think for one moment that it is a movie for kids. It's a magical, frightening and heartbreaking movie for adults who want to take the journey deep into the reality that outgrows fantasy. Writer/director Guillermo Del Toro fills the movie with themes of growing up, facing the ugliness around you, making decisions about what you stand for and will to do for right and justice. Also, he brilliantly mixes the two stories, showing the audience how these very adult themes and situations are playing out on a child's level. Ofelia the affectionate protagonist is a fatherless Spanish girl whose mother marries a captain in General Isimo Francisco Franco's army, around 1944. When Ofelia and her pregnant mothers' car stops on the journey to the mountain camp where Capt. Vidal is leading a campaign against rebels, the girl slips away. She follows an odd insect on the way to the outpost. Ofelia discovers an ancient pagan idol, awakening what seems to be a fairy. At the outpost itself the fairy leads the girl to a maze that stands behind the main building. This labyrinth, we're told, predates Christianity. And deep in its heart lives a satyr who tells Ofelia that she's the lost princess of the fairy realm, and gives her three tasks to accomplish before she can return home. The insect/fairy from the forest returns to Ofelia while her mother is sleeping. The girl follows the tiny creature to an ancient labyrinth. She descends a spiral of stone steps and meets the Faun. From hence forward, Ofelia lives in two worlds. Both of them contain monsters. Unlike many conventional Hollywood filmmakers, Del Toro doesn't underestimate an audience's ability to witness the reality of war and the avenue it provides to the most brutal of men. This is the start of something both magical and deadly serious. The coldness of Ofelia's stepfather is revealed the instant she greets him at the camp. His cruelty deepens as the story moves forward. Ofelia doesn't see the worst of the captain's wickedness, but she knows he and the camp are symptoms of a world gone mad. Being a little girl, though, she has few options. Little Ofelia is called upon to do brave things and make tough choices. Del Toro's genius in casting can be reflected with the actor Sergi Lopez, who brought an evil charm and frightening reality to Captain Vidal, while Del Toros' writing has given his character enough flesh to be recognized as a human being. Vidal isn't being the prototype villain here just to fill the story like most current Hollywood movies. He isn't being evil for the sake of being evil. He is idealistic about his cause and a true believer in his action. Which he thinks is right regardless of the contradictory view of the audience. He is a foster child of a fascist system, a heartless monster whose blind obedience to an inhumane ideology which, allows him to indulge many of his worst impulses to the maximum. Ivana Baquero delivers a stunning performance as young girl facing horrible realities of a cruel environment but with full of optimism that she is meant for a different better life. According to her it's not wishful thinking. While watching Baquero's age defying performance, it's almost unbelievable the capacity of a child her age to generate such power and realism into a character that basically carries a whole movie. Ophelia is as much of a believer like her evil counterpart. Her beliefs are deeply rooted into fairies and she follows the satyr sans his creepy outlook. The fact that she makes mistakes, as everyone does, makes her all the more appealing. But unlike Vidal, she isn't a conformist even as a child. She isn't blindly obedient to the satyr and at the end doing exact opposite of what she is told, shows the path for her salvation. This dear child earns movie watchers' love and admiration. Ivana Baquero endows Ofelia with the vulnerability, intelligence and spunk the character needs. She's wonderfully effective and the camera embraces her. Comparing to Del Toro's previous work, Pan's Labyrinth can be viewed as a sequel to ""The Devils Backbone"", which happened to be his best outing on previous efforts. His storyline returns to Spanish civil war. The action takes place in a cruelly regimented and socially isolated world. In The Devil's Backbone Del Toro wove his ghost story very tightly into the Spanish civil war setting where in Pan's Labyrinth the fairy tale echoes and reflects the happenings going on during the same period with experiences related to Captain Vidal. The stories aren't separate and in fact they're totally complementary. Pan's Labyrinth is another rare movie experience that works equally well on intellectual and emotional levels. It is a movie that will challenge the view in some ways and will reinforce your own beliefs in other ways. This film drives the viewer to rethink his/her own perspective of a happy ending. At the end it can't be said, Pan's Labyrinth is without hope of goodwill for the humans involved in the story. But with the skill of Del Toro, it is shown that their journey to at least a partial victory is possible but not without sacrifice."
"rodduncan-1","10","1","4","26 August 2008"," What more can be asked of a work of art?
","Easy enough to say that this movie is about a young girl and her pregnant mother, caught up in the Spanish Civil War. Easy to say that the girl escapes from time to time into a living fairytale. Much harder to tell where the fairytale begins and ends and to divine the relationship between it and the real world  or indeed to decide whether fauns and fairies and giant toads aren't in fact more real that the brutal world of her stepfather, the fascist captain who is trying to eradicate the last communist fighters from the wooded mountains.<br/><br/>People tell the girl she is too old to be reading books of fairy stories, but they in turn are following narratives of their own imaginations. Even the captain, who dwells on the story of his father's military heroism and is obsessed with the fantasy of having a son of his own and then dying in battle.<br/><br/>The motif of the labyrinth is everywhere, physically as a stone maze on the edge of the forest, visually in the elegant cinematography where long tracking shots take you on unexpected journeys, sometimes back to where you started, and metaphorically in the film's many narratives, some of which reach their goals while others come to a dead end.<br/><br/>The violence of the war and the sadism of the captain make parts of this film hard to watch. Somehow it avoided an 18 rating, but I had to look away from the screen once or twice. Perhaps it was the proximity of an innocent girl that made the dehumanising violence depicted in the film so disturbing.<br/><br/>But for all that, this is a film I will have to see again, perhaps many times. The themes and images are so subtly layered that they dwell long after the credits have rolled. They leave questions in the mind and might even change the way you see the world. What more can be asked of any work of art?"

","I have no words to express my feeling after seeing this movie.Screenplay,acting,direction,dialogs,camera work everything is in top notch.Certainly a fairy tales for adults.I've seen lots of fantasy movie but nothing comes near this one.Characterization was fantastic--Sergi Lopez will always be remembered for his acting as Captain Vidal.Captain Vidal will go down in cinema history as one of the most cruel character and the pale man will be remembered as one of the most cumbersome creature to appear in movies.The faun was lovable even though it didn't look beautiful.Be it Mercedes or the doctor every character left a deep impression in this movie.<br/><br/>Some scenes are really wonderful.I always love to define a scene or two as my favorite in my comments but I really cant separate a good scene in this particular movie since all the scenes are magical.

"neil-476","9","1","4","13 July 2007"," Excellent, but not for children
","My wife and I have been married for getting on for 28 years. I've always been a movie fan and, in broad terms, she hasn't. I've always tended towards fantasy in my tastes, while she is very rooted in the real world. This tends to make joint movie watching something of a painful experience - on the rare occasions when I can persuade her to watch something with a fantasy element, I spend most of the film fending off variations on ""Who's that?"" ""Why is he doing that?"" ""Where did they go?"" and so on.<br/><br/>I've wanted to watch Pan's Labyrinth for some time. I put it in the DVD player at about 11pm, expecting my other half to watch for about 10 minutes and then go off to bed (11pm is already late by her body clock).<br/><br/>She was still there at the 10 minute mark. She winced and looked away at some of the violence (she's very squeamish), but said absolutely nothing throughout the film. At the end, she said ""What a beautiful film,"" and I almost sighed with relief, for that is exactly what I felt. Yes, it's violent: the violence reflects the reality of the time and place. The fantasy and real life exactly balance each other and, for her, the film was totally rooted in real life, which is why she related to it so strongly.<br/><br/>No other comments to make about the film itself - they have all been made by others.<br/><br/>I've just been reading the negative comments here with interest. I have no quarrel with anyone whose tastes differ from mine, and much of one's appreciation (or not) is down to a matter of personal taste. The only criticism which holds any water, I think, concerns violence. But here in the UK this film is a certificate 15 and, if the fact that a fantasy film is certified for 15 year olds doesn't give you a hint that it might have some disturbing content, well....<br/><br/>It is NOT a kid's film, and anyone showing it to a child is pretty irresponsible."
"MartianOctocretr5","9","1","4","8 July 2007"," Poignant story, beautifully told
","This is an outstanding film. Two polar opposite, yet intertwined stories are told, one a depiction of violent and harsh realities, the other a child's fantasy world fairy tale. Be forewarned: in spite of the fantasy elements, this movie deals with violent themes and images which would be disturbing for children.<br/><br/>The story is set in 1944, in the early days of Franco's Fascist regime in Spain, when forces loyal to the dictator were suppressing insurgencies. Captain Vidal is a brutally efficient soldier who ""exterminates"" the regime's ""vermin"" enemies, with no more passion or purpose than an exterminator eradicating insects. Sergi Lopez is frightening and imposing as the Captain (never called by his name, only by his military rank), who cannot even comprehend the idea of dissenting opinion or an act of disobedience, let alone tolerate it. Even his single obsession, producing a son, is a soldier's duty and nothing more.<br/><br/>Ivana Baquero, as his step daughter Ofelia, is truly sympathetic and marvelous as the child whose fantasy world stories become an escape from the nightmarish existence of living with this heartless monster. Her fantasy world indeed has monsters of its own, but there is a beauty and truth in the Underworld of her mind's creation, which is almost believable to the audience as a real place unto itself. For Ofelia's sake, one would hope that it is. The Faun is a well balanced and complex creature, whose intentions remain ambiguous at first as to whether he is sincere or not. Maribel Verduz's is equally effective as Mercedes, a house servant who becomes a surprisingly pivotal figure. <br/><br/>The flow of the two stories parallel one another magnificently, leading to a powerful and touching outcome. The movie boasts many spiritual metaphors, all utilized artistically and poignantly. Well scripted, well acted, and keenly directed. This is superior storytelling."
"Mancic2000","9","1","4","6 July 2007"," A good person won't be judged by earthly standards
","I like this film as it is almost spiritual in some sense, notably when it nears the ending.<br/><br/>The message to me seems to be that in the eye of an innocent and harmless child, even there is war, tortures, hatred in and between everyone, a suffering mother, an indifferent step-father and every sort of evil, flaw, crime and temptation imaginable, she is still able to see beauty in the world, still stick to her child-like conscience and sixth-sense (in her ability to distinguish the good people from the bad). And ultimately a ""good"" person is not going to be judged by earthly standards, but will be rewarded in an unearthly way. The film is surreal, creative and beautiful. Recommended!"

","film especially for fantasy-fans; story has two themes, switches between these two themes: bad brutal commander fights against revolter (Spain 1944) and little girl (stepdaughter of the commander) gets involved in a fantasy-adventure. The special effects are remarkably good, but the story is not really clever or ingenious, nevertheless it is told in an exciting way. The music/ the sound effects amplify the moody atmosphere, this atmosphere dominates the film. All in all the quality of the film is good, but it has some scenes which are quite brutal, if you ask me: there is no need for this brutality (f.e.: a doctor saws off a leg, the commander almost kills a man by punching a bottle in his face over and over again."
"Brian B-2","8","1","4","5 March 2007"," Not up to the Hype, but worth seeing
","I went into this movie with high expectations, based on reviews, rather than word of mouth.<br/><br/>The visuals, and the fable plot, were worth seeing. The message, though obvious, was deftly presented, and I was moved to tears.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the gory political polemic that predominated was overdone, and even more obvious. I was bored by it long before the movie ended. As a result, the film seemed long and drawn out. It would have been improved by more focus on the fable/fantasy aspects, or tighter editing.<br/><br/>The acting was superb, even those in the small roles were believable. I never felt I was watching a performance - they each inhabited their roles."
"charchuk","9","1","4","21 February 2007"," Extraordinarily imaginative
","Highly whimsical and imaginative fable, with an intriguing concept and compelling story. Though it's more of a character drama than a pure fantasy, it manages to blend elements of both while still remaining interesting. Even though I was slightly disappointed that there wasn't more fantasy to it (mainly because the parts that were fantastical were so fantastic), I became so involved in the story that it really didn't matter. I found the parallels between the real word and the fantasy world very subtle, but effective nonetheless. And, though I had to read subtitles, I became fully immersed in both stories, and felt like neither lagged or paled in comparison to the other. Just a very well-told fairy tale.<br/><br/>Technically, it's one of the most extraordinary films I've seen. Great cinematography, beautiful music, and terrific makeup effects. The creature designs are so imaginative and carried out so well that they are, by far, the highlight among highlights. I found all the acting pretty good, too, and the little girl didn't annoy me like so many other child actors. I found Mercedes and the Captain to be the stand-outs, though, as they made me feel for or hate their characters. All of this is capped off by a terrific screenplay. So, really, just an outstanding film."
"itspatagain","9","1","4","21 February 2007"," You'll never forget this one
","I love fantasy, love magic, but abhor violence. This movie has plenty of everything. I don't think anyone prone to keeping their eyes closed during violent scenes will get their money's worth from this one even though the violence is a necessary part of the movie. In saying all of that, I will tell you that this is a movie you won't soon - or ever - get out of your mind. A warning: don't drink too much liquid before or during the movie because you won't want to be leaving the film for even a second to attend to needs that should then arise. You will leave the theater never knowing whether what you saw was what actually happened or was the result of something entirely made up in the little girl's mind. Ivana Baquero who plays Ofelia is outstanding - as are the rest of the cast. If this one doesn't win an award, then there is no justice."

I did think that the movie was very beautiful and the acting was amazing, especially by the young girl. Overall I enjoyed the movie immensely even though it wasn't what I expected.

","""El Laberinto del Fauno"" (2006) was written and directed by Guillermo del Toro.

Ivana Baquero plays Ofelia, the gentle, quiet, step-daughter of a Fascist army captain. Sergi López portrays Capitán Vidal as the ideal Fascist officer. He is brave, cruel, gives blind obedience to his superiors, and expects blind obedience from his subordinates. <br/><br/>Ofelia and her mother are virtual captives of the captain in an isolated military outpost. In 1944, partisans in the mountains were still opposing Franco's forces, and it's the captain's job to wipe them out by any means at his disposal. This includes the torture of prisoners to make them reveal the person inside the military compound who is aiding the guerrillas. (We don't see the actual torture, but we see the physical results that follow it, and those scenes are gruesome.)<br/><br/>Faced with this horror, Ofelia is drawn into another world, which is also not a paradise. It's a dangerous environment, into which she must venture to help her mother and to achieve her destiny as a magical princess.<br/><br/>The cast of the movie is outstanding. Both Baquero and López are excellent. Álex Angulo is wonderful as Dr. Ferreiro, who must weigh the ethics of his profession against the demands placed upon him by Captain Vidal.<br/><br/>The performance by Maribel Verdú as Mercedes, the captain's housekeeper, is extraordinary. It's wonderful to see a glamorous young movie star transform herself into a working-class servant, who is beneath the notice of her employer.<br/><br/>This is a hard and demanding film. The grimness of the situation is present in all the scenes, with hardly any happiness or hope to offset it. Nonetheless, it's an important film, and definitely worth seeking out and watching."

It does not state the obvious, it has a simple, believable, realistic story line and does not leave the after taste of 'we're hoping it'll get big on a cheesy take on the realities of life and people will pity the characters and say how horrible it is while going on with their lives'. It's simply a story mingled with a poor girl's imagination to help escape realities. You can draw your own conclusions, you're own representations. The movie makers do not spell it out, read it out and e-mail their own conclusions to you. People, it will not hurt you to actually THINK after watching a movie once in a while. I will not say you should watch it because of a 'compelling heart breaking storyline', nor will I tell you to watch because of enthralling fantastical ideas.

The war officially ended on 1 April 1939, but persecution of political opponents continued for years. An estimated 200,000 political prisoners probably died of starvation, overwork or execution. The Fascist regime ruled Spain until Franco died on 20 November 1975.<br/><br/>El Laberinto del Fauno (Pan's Labyrinth) is a fascinating but surprisingly black fairy tale set in 1944, when Franco's army was energetically eradicating pockets of resistance to the Fascist government.

The surrounding forest hides a cadre of resistance fighters and their encounters with the army are brutal and unsuitable for children.<br/><br/>The mother's pregnancy is difficult, the surroundings are frigid and the Captain is cruel.

Foreign language dubbing is horrid, and should be the quota for people who don't speak the common language. Most people the all over the world who have struggled to learn English will not be able to fully experience this picture as it was intended. Although this is a great movie, it's not good enough to make anybody learn Spanish; I'm not sure why investors or a studio would fund something that will only appeal to a fraction of the Spanish speaking population.

","I was very surprised to see this movie getting so many good reviews and nominations after I saw a sneak preview last night. While I consider myself open minded, especially to fantasy content, I thought this movie was pretty funny. Funny in the sense of having the urge to laugh without being able to stop it. While I really liked the ""real"" part of the story I totally disliked the ""fantasy"" part of it. I convinced myself at first, that this was the only way for the girl to escape from the horrible and cruel reality but then it was too strange on the other hand to be just that. The real-world storyline would have made a great movie, exciting and full of statements about the human condition, but the other part was ridiculous. The cinematography wasn't bad in every single scene for itself, but put together it was a little bit overdone. Too many panning shots and repetitions in the camera movements. I really liked the sadistic fascist stepfather character, because it was not a pure monster but a character you could believe in. I have to admit, that the characters were all very well written and the actors underlined this by a very good performance but this horrible story! I can't get over it. I really had to laugh out loudly when I saw the child-eating monster with eyes in his hand. And the fact that the girl had to eat the grapes, leading to just another violent episode, was just unnecessary. And that is exactly the point. This ""fairy-tale"" was completely ruined by violence and gross scenes. There the fantasy should have been a contrast to the violent reality, which was crass but realistic and believable. Instead it was topped by the fantasy world. And this is exactly why I came to the conclusion that this wasn't just a little girls attempt to flee reality. (besides the complete lack of rational behavior or logic in some of the characters actions). All in all it was a combination of good actors, bad story and overdone cinematography that leads me to only one advice: DON'T PAY TO SEE THIS MOVIE!"

"BA_Harrison","8","1","5","15 June 2018"," The best film about a labyrinth since Labyrinth.
","Spain, 1944, five years after the Spanish Civil War: a young girl, Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), travels to the countryside with her pregnant mother, Carmen (Ariadna Gil), to meet her new stepfather, Captain Vidal (Sergi López), a staunch Falangist who has been assigned to hunt down the band of rebels still holding out in the forests. While exploring the land surrounding her new home, Ofelia discovers a strange labyrinth where she meets a faun, who tells her that she is the reincarnation of a princess, and that she must perform three tasks in order to return to her magical realm.<br/><br/>Has the girl retreated into a world of make-believe influenced by her storybooks? Or is the faun very real and telling the truth? Either way, director Guillermo Del Toro's movie is utterly compelling viewing, expertly blending the cruelty of war with its supernatural elements. With imagination to spare, brought to life by an array of incredible special effects (both animatronic and digital), and excellent performances from all involved, Pan's Labyrinth is an unforgettable journey into dark fantasy, where the supernatural horrors faced by Ofelia as she performs her tasks are more than matched by the unspeakable acts perpetrated by the sadistic Captain Vidal (his cruelty making the film unsuitable for the kiddies, despite the fairytale plot).<br/><br/>Unforgettable scenes include the brutal killing of a hunter and his son, an encounter with a giant toad, Ofelia pursued by a freaky child-eating creature with eyes in its hands, and the haunting ending, which is either happy or sad, depending on your point of view."

","Pan's Labyrinth is such a well made fantasy film. It follows the story of Ofelia. Ofelia and her pregnant mother move into a big house with Captain Vidal, a sadistic man in the Spanish Army. <br/><br/>The story is original and gripping. The characters are well written, you will be rooting for the good guys and hating the bad guys.<br/><br/>But the best part within the film is the monsters, especially the Faun. Very little CGI was used to create the monsters with the film. They are created using masks and body suits and the detail that went into them is just fantastic! They are both creepy and cool at the same time.<br/><br/>Overall, I highly recommend the film."

This movie was incredible in every way. The ""fantasy"" parts really were just a sideshow to the true horror that was going on in the Spanish civil war.<br/><br/>It was sad, it was touching, it was horrible, it was engrossing, there was hate, cruelty, and revenge.<br/><br/>The character of Mercedes played by Maribel Verdú was my favorite. A tough and brave woman in every way, yet kind as well.<br/><br/>My main point is, don't think this is just one of those kiddy fantasy movies.

"mari_del_mar","9","1","5","5 March 2009"," I HATE movies that portray suffering. This one is the exception
","Despite the fact that this movie is a terrible load of suffering and brutality, it manages to put through a message of hope: Even in the face of the worst injustices and literally murderous of circumstances, there is a last refuge inside every person. A place that nobody can violate... not even by killing you.<br/><br/>The original Spanish version is worth very much... do not see a dubbed version if only to get the emotional acting that comes through the voices.<br/><br/>This actually constitutes (in my humble opinion) the only argument in favor of escaping reality that has merit.<br/><br/>The special effects are great.<br/><br/>Do not take your children!!!"

","I was expecting a Felliniesque romp. It was not. This movie is completely different. It is about war, cruelty and brutality, delicately merged with the weird and supernatural. It flits back and forth, gradually merging the two more deeply so you can't tell them apart.<br/><br/>I thought it might be a Euro Charles Bronson revenge flick because the villains were so villainous. It made me hate the military and war with a white hot passion. I was wrong every time I tried to predict the plot with the usual movie formulas. I had to walk away several times during the movie because I could not handle the cruelty. It depicts pain in ways very easy to relate to, and very hard to watch dispassionately.<br/><br/>The movie is in Spanish, a rich, rolling Spanish that exudes passion. It has an almost operatic feel to it. Much of the movie is filmed in the dark with fires and candlelight.<br/><br/>The film early on sets the stage that everyone is at risk. So the threats to the young heroine are terrifying and completely believable. The suspense is real.<br/><br/>The actor who plays the faun is riveting. You can't take your eyes off him and your ears hang on his every syllable. He is both kindly and terrifying at the same time.<br/><br/>The special effects are unusually good, especially the way stick insects gradually become fairies and back. The way they do it is much like the way you can see figures in the embers of a fire. At first you wonder if your OWN imagination is playing tricks on you.<br/><br/>The ending was very different than the orgy of special effects I expected, but on reflection, it reflected perfect cosmic justice."

","The English title of this movie is mistranslated. It is The Labyrinth of the Faun, a faun from the Kingdom of the Fairies being one of the central characters. The Greek God Pan has no part in the tale.<br/><br/>The most important feature of the story is not the fairy-tale labyrinth that the girl finds enters in the grounds of her new stepfather's house. It is the labyrinth of reality, truth, and ethics that we all find ourselves in, a problem that can be made particularly clear for everybody involved on all sides of the Spanish Civil War.<br/><br/>This labyrinth is the life-long theme of the works of Jorge Luis Borges, and an essential theme of Mercea Eliade.<br/><br/>For some, the labyrinth is impossible to navigate. For others, it turns out that the path through is simply straight ahead. It can turn out in other ways, too. When you come to an exit from the labyrinth, it can turn out that you have failed more utterly than if you simply remained lost inside, depending on how you have chosen your turnings. The exit from the labyrinth of life coincides with your death, but there are many ways in which one can choose to die, some where you achieve freedom, and some where you are far more thoroughly imprisoned than mere walls can achieve. Which version you find yourself in says more about you and your fears than about the structure of the labyrinth itself, which changes according to the way you think. Again, this can be made particularly clear in the context of a nasty, brutal war.<br/><br/>Other tales in which the labyrinth has this kind of meaning, and which refer to the ideas of Borges and Eliade, are The Name of the Rose, by Umberto Eco; and House of Leaves, by Mark Z. Danielewski. The same labyrinth without the physical metaphor appears in Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (""Well, then, I _will_ go to Hell."") and the movie Dingaka, which Jamie Uys directed well before his big hits, The Gods Must Be Crazy I & II."

","(my first comment on this site, please excuse if it's not that perfect)<br/><br/>this is a horror-fairy-tale for adult people and really NOT FOR CHILDREN. If you like movies like ""Lady in the Water"" (from M. Night Shayalaman; better than expected) and ""Devil's Backbone"" (same director like ""Pan's""; but even better) you will like this one. It is set in Spain 1944 (WW2/civil-war; like Devil's Backbone) and has a lot of mystical atmosphere, you're following the imaginary fantasy-world of a little girl in the brutal war-time. In fact there are some brutal scenes in it and they're gory, but there are not very voyeuristic. I think, the movies made from Guillermo del Torro are much better than from M.

"KUAlum26","8","1","5","22 August 2008"," Maybe not the best movie you'll ever see,but unique enough to be hard to forget
","Set in the waning years of WWII and amidst the long,bloody and somewhat confusing conflict of Civil WAr Spain,Pan's Labryth is a blending of dark,Gothic,serio-religious(think C.S.Lewis or the like)fantasy with the grim historic reality of the region. THe central character,a shy,bookish girl named Ofelia(Ivana Baquero)uncovers a maze and sub-world of fairies and woodland creatures,who cross into her world presenting solutions as well as to problems with her fragmented family: her widowed,pregnant and sick mother(Ariadna Gil),her vile and sadistic stepfather(Sergi Lopez,awesome here!),who happens to be a military commander for the FAscists,the well-intentioned head maid-servant(Maribel Verdu)and the rural farm estate where they are quartered and just also happens to be in the middle of a battle hot zone between rebels and Fascists.<br/><br/>Director,writer and co-producer Guillermo del Toro,more known for his brilliantly crafted Comic book/fantasy/SciFi work(Hellboy and this summer's Hellboy 2 come to mind),is able to craft a bright,unique and largely enthralling story. While I cannot give this a higher mark than I have,due mostly in part to the fact that this film is over-ambitious by that and a half(mostly by amping the emotional conflicts and making the foreshadowing more like overshadowing) and seems to leave gaps in its story(how could Ofelia's mother be so oblivious to her new husband's cruelty? what exactly was the nature of her mother's illness? Also,leaving too much detail and information about the newly created world of the movie vague and without definition). I'll confess that movies entirely done in native language and subtitles also doesn't exactly make an easy digest for me,but as such this movie was still quite watchable.<br/><br/>This film,if memory serves,got A LOT of good pres when it was first released,and managed to come away with its fair share of awards. I managed to miss this completely from the original run,mostly because it stayed mostly in the domain of ""artsy"" movie houses and away from the mainstream theaters of smaller,non-metropolitan areas(and Topeka,KS fits that description quite well)for much of its first release. I'd always meant to see this,and having finally done so,I'm glad I did. A beautifully-made movie that is able to make its heart and originality work,albeit not flawlessly."

","This was a wonderful movie, with a deep and powerful plot, wonderful acting, and a rich and many-layered vision. My heart was warmed, my skin crawled, my heart raced, and I frankly clapped my hands at one point and literally sat forward and whispered ""no!"" at another. I enjoyed it immensely.<br/><br/>I must say, though, that the lack of English dubbing in any version available on the market was a disappointment. Yes, yes, yes; I realize that the purists out there are denigrating me as we speak, and that Del Toro's insistence on his native language alone was some matter of Spanish pride.<br/><br/>However, there are those of us, like myself, who see well enough to enjoy the movie, but not enough to keep up with subtitles. For us, it is quite frustrating to be confined to reading through a movie and missing pieces of scene, dividing attention and missing pieces of dialogue, or having the movie read by someone else.<br/><br/>Just a thought."

","Pan's Labyrinth was visually stunning, the story was engaging, the directing was fantastic, as were the location of the scenes. The only reason I'm giving this a nine instead of a ten is because the ending leaves so much more to be desired.<br/><br/>As an audience, we get to escape into a surreal magical reality alongside a warring and dark reality and we (the audience) go through all these ""tests"" and are finally waiting for something extraordinary to happen in the end, and it doesn't. Not having that magical thing happen was a let down: I wanted more. Having more would have allowed me to give this film a ten.<br/><br/>Anyways, this isn't a film for small children and while the grisly violence and gore is nowhere near the shade of some of the other horror films, for the mainstream audience, it deserves the warning.<br/><br/>Overall, this was just a very good film.

"bobsgrock","9","1","5","2 July 2008"," An incredible mix of multiple genres.
","Guillermo del Toro's fantastic film, Pan's Labyrinth, is part fantasy, part war story. And I don't think anyone else could have mixed the two together so well. The visual images are just stunning in every way. The mix of CGI and puppets make for the fantasy world to seem just as realistic as the real world. The acting is top-notch, especially by the little girl, Ivana Baquero, and the brutal, evil military captain, played by Sergi Lopez. The strongest part, though, is del Toro's storytelling ability as he flawlessly takes us between parallel worlds until they collide together in unspeakable terms. Be warned, this is not for children or anyone squeamish to violence in any way. There are multiple scenes of graphic violent behavior, yet it all is completely necessary to show how evil the real world can actually be. The ending may disappoint some viewers, but after pondering it for awhile, I found it to be the right choice, as well as truly beautiful and moving. This is truly a tour de force movie, mixing multiple genres into its blend and bringing out something truly magnificent. Undoubtedly one of the best films of this decade, and maybe the best foreign film since City of God."

","I failed to see this film at the cinema and regret that as having just seen it on DVD I was amazed by the quality of the production and the haunting beauty of the alternate reality Ofelia creates, or is drawn into. The ending is both wonderful and poignant, well done to all for sticking with the ideas within the story, and for blending the real and mystical worlds so completely. The imagery and ideas swept me along and I was intrigued by the darkness of the alternate world. Each performance was carefully played with an inherent bleakness that summed up living through a war. This period of history is often overlooked in Europe as the wider war with fascism in Germany and Italy holds prominence. The civil war's confusion echoes the confusion Ofelia is feeling and the adults reactions are very well thought out. A true fairytale for adults."
"Antagonisten","8","1","5","27 January 2008"," Sad but enjoyable
","It's been a while since this movie came out on DVD. At first i wanted to see it in the theater, but it just never happened. And then i wanted to catch it as soon as it came out on DVD. That didn't happen either. But now, finally, i saw it.<br/><br/>I can start by saying that i'm somewhat of a fan of Guillermo del Toro. Of course most of the movies i've seen from him have been either horror or action. But there has always been a distinct sense of style that i have appreciated about his work. Here he really takes that style to the next level. The first thing i noticed about this movie was the overall visual style. It looks simply gorgeous, be it in the fantasy world or the regular world.<br/><br/>I was a bit skeptical of this movies theme at first. The whole idea of mixing fantasy and reality is something that i feel rarely works. My skepticism was mostly proved wrong by this movie. Mostly the mix between fantasy and reality works very well, and it's well integrated to the point where you are sometimes wondering what is real and what is not. Still del Toro manages to keep the ""real"" elements of the movie stark and convincing, which is not an easy task.<br/><br/>I guess what surprised me the most here was how sad and tragic this movie was. I expected something fairy-tale like, but what i got was a mostly sad and at times very violent story about something tragically real. I actually felt sad after watching the movie, it was a lingering feeling that i don't have very often. I was also surprised at how graphic the movie was, it really is a movie only for grown-ups. And probably not for all grown-ups either.<br/><br/>To try and summarize this. Did i like the movie? Yes, i did. There is a lot to like here. There are strong emotions, beautiful visuals, magnificent acting, a gripping story and a good mixture between fantasy and reality. I found it to be somewhat overly graphic at times, and almost depressing in how bleak it was. But i still enjoyed it very much. I recommend it. 8/10."

"Robert_duder","8","1","5","4 June 2007"," Slightly over rated but decently directed epic
","I fully expected to be one of Pan's fans that jumped on the 'greatest fantasy of the year' band wagon so when I finally got around to seeing the critically acclaimed Pan's Labyrinth I must admit I felt a little let down. I am not saying that the film isn't stunning with it's special effects and it's brilliant, dark, gritty story but I was just taken aback by the content. First of all it is hard to call this film a fantasy and even consider it on the same level as Lord Of The Rings, or Chronicles of Narnia because the actual fantasy content is barely a blip in the film. There might be perhaps 1/4 of the film that features this magical land she journeys to. Now that 1/4 truly has some brilliant, almost disturbing and magical effects that are spell binding and the outside world content is so dark and violent. I honestly believed Pan's Labyrinth was a child's movie when it was originally released and it's the FURTHEST thing from it. Pan's Labyrinth is an adult film through and through and deserves an R-Rating with some brutally violent death scenes. Still the film moved a little slowly for my liking and just didn't capture me the way I had hoped. I want to love it, I still want to see it again to see if I can find some more appreciation for it because it IS so beautiful but I have to stick with my first impressions and it just wasn't perfect. But there is so much to love about it and it's still an absolute must see.<br/><br/>First and foremost the young star Ivana Baquero who plays Ofelia is absolutely brilliant. She deserves every award she was nominated for. Her breath taking and emotional performance holds this film together and makes it all the more better for having her there. Bravo to the young actress!! Equally impressive is the performance by Sergi López who plays the despicably evil Capitán Vidal who is like an in house dictator who kills indiscriminately to protect what he believes to be right. While he never hurts Ofelia directly his behavior is one that will sour you on him. López is just brilliant as this villain that by the time he meets his just end it's almost a relief to the viewer as much as it is to the people in the film. Maribel Verdú is very good as the house servant who is working to help the rebels including her brother. She is like a surrogate savior to the rebels, her brother, and to Ofelia following her mother's death. Doug Jones won't be remembered by his real face. Jones has been portraying some of the greatest monsters, beasts, and general weird looking creatures for many years. He still haunts me as The Gentlmen from Buffy The Vampire Slayer. He turns in a terrific performance as the pale beast or Pan presumably (although never established.) Who is the pale beast?? That is I think one of the most interesting questions from the film.<br/><br/>Does Pan's Labyrinth have some amazing moments?? Absolutely!! I won't soon forget the creature at the dinner table who chases Ofelia with the eyes in his hands. I won't soon forget the moment Capitán Vidal beats an innocent man's head in (literally) and drops him to die. The direction by Guillermo del Toro is truly inspirational with the dark gray overtone of the film and contrasting it to the brilliance of the other world, and the deep bright red of Ofelia's blood. I make no sincere negative comments about this film except to say that as good as it was it just didn't quite hit the right chords to be perfection and I so wanted it to be perfection. I wanted this to be one of my favorite films. Still I would see it again and I would recommend it to any adult that loves a good strong story. The subtitles are done perfectly and I wouldn't have had it any other way. Make your own judgment about Pan's Labyrinth because either way you won't want to miss out on it. 8.5/10"
"paulgburrows-1","7","1","5","20 February 2007"," Very good fantasy, but questionable politics.
","I like fantasies and this is definitely a very good one - I enjoyed it and was really concerned about Orfilia and the baby notwithstanding the real-world intrusions that grated, in part because they were un-necessary. The ability of everyone to run around an armed camp after dark was unrealistic as was the Captain's ability to carry on after being stabbed in the back, in the chest and having his face sliced open. The worst aspect was del Toro's romantic left-wing stance. The guerrillas in the film were all freedom loving romantic heroes when in fact, by that point in the Spanish Civil War, the Republicans were co-opted by the Soviet Union and the freedom fighters would have been the same type of vicious thugs that comprised the Franco military. However, the point is taken about questioning authority, purpose objectives etc. Maybe both sides should have."

","The story is set in 1944 in Spain after General Franco's forces have taken over the country following the Spanish civil war. Captain Vidal (Sergi López) is a brutal, sadistic commander of a garrison of soldiers that has commandeered an old estate in the mountains of northern Spain that serves as a headquarters to fight rebel guerrillas and as a supply depot for local villagers to get rationed food. Vidal has sent for his pregnant new wife Carmen (Ariadna Gil) to join him against her doctor's advice because Vidal believes he should be present went the child is born and is determined it will be a boy. Carmen had been a widow and has a 12 year old daughter Ofelia (Ivana Baquero). Ofelia is a bookish girl who loves reading and making up fantasy stories. Upon her arrival she discovers a stone and instinct draws her to an ancient stone monument in the forest and she replaces the stone to where it once belonged. This sets the stage of the world of the labyrinth that she will become an integral part of to preserve it's existence. This film is receiving rave reviews from critics and film goers world wide and has been nominated for six Academy Awards in Art Direction, Cinematography, Make Up, Original Score, Original Screenplay and Best Foreign Languge Film. This is the odds-on favorite as best foreign film and could also win an Oscar for art direction and make up. Guillermo de Toro wrote the screenplay from his own story and directs this dark, gloomy blend of fantasy and reality that is also extremely violent. The story is imaginative but fairly weak and full of holes, flaws and inconsistencies. Vidal is so perpetually scary and one dimensionally sinister and sadistic with not even a false or pretentious good side to give the character the element of unknown surprise that would make for superb movie villain. Although Carmen is a central character because of her importance to the story, she is almost incidental. Mercedes (Maribel Verdú) is the housekeeper in charge of the estate staff and has a brother who is one of the rebel guerrillas. Verdú probably provides the best acting in this cast. Álex Angulo is Dr. Ferreiro, Carmen's doctor who is also sympathetic with the rebels in a good supporting role. Doug Jones in makeup and costume plays the dual role of Pan the satyr who dwells in the ancient labyrinth that has three tasks for Ofelia to perform and of the Pale Man, one of the creepiest creatures to haunt a silver screen in some time. Pablo Adan provides the theatrical commanding voice of Pan in one of the great voice-overs of film since James Earl Jones' interpretation of Darth Vader. Del Toro has woven a Tim Burtoneque film here but this would work better as a fantasy film with less violence. I felt the film unraveled at the end and I didn't buy it's ending. I would like to see more from director del Toro but maybe less Brothers Grimm and Lewis Carroll in influence. If you want to do a war film do a war film. If you want to do a fantasy film do a fantasy film. Some images in this film are overstressed as if to say pay attention because this is going to play a key role later on. Okay, okay I get it. Get on with it. Because of gratuitous, disturbing graphic violence I would not recommend this to anyone. I don't see the cinematic achievement that warrants the praise this film is getting. It has a lot going for it but it's not a great film. I would give this 7.5 out of 10."

It's more of a story about people in the Spanish civil war and it wanders of from the storyline several times.<br/><br/>This is clearly not a movie for children, or even teens, so i fail to see which group of people it aims for. It's much too bloody for young people, sometimes even for adults.

"Michael Kenmore","5","1","5","20 January 2007"," Guillermo del Toro unleashes a pathologically sadistic fantasy horror film
","** Minor spoiler ahead, but nothing crucial **<br/><br/>Having seen the elaborately edited and designed movie trailer as well as the impressive article on del Toro's creatively imagined sketchbook in Premiere magazine, I came in with a neutral expectation.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is a supremely well-made feature in production design and make-up, among other essential integrients contributing to the standard cinema experience. However, the level of grisly violence -- the cinematic dwelling on the blood and mutilation -- is so off-putting as to be revolting. That leaves a bad taste in my mouth after the movie concludes. That's what del Toro and producers (among them Alfonso Cauron of Y Tu Mama Tambien & Harry Potter 3 fame) wanted in achieving the purpose of pushing the buttons on the audience's reaction, which I find rather disingenuous.<br/><br/>Not that Pan's Labyrinth is a feel-bad movie, because it's a very imaginative story reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz. I don't even like schmaltzy Hollywood-esquire contrivances and happy endings in this decade of everyday vapidness, apathy and cynicism, at least in the Americas.<br/><br/>I've never seen a del Toro picture except for the fact I found ""Chronos"" so laboriously tedious in pacing I hit the stop button on the VCR and returned the rental unfinished & unrewounded. I saw clip bits of Mimic on expanded pay cable TV, which was pretty lame.<br/><br/>I don't discount the fact that Guillermo del Toro is an immensely talented filmmaker, but his fascinated lingering on the prolonged scenes of grisly violence and gore is unbelievably repelling - to say the least. The Fascist villain's mutilated face is particularly too gruesome, even in spite of the acknowledgment he ""deserves"" such painful wound for his evil acts as depicted before the villain suffers the assault.<br/><br/>For this reason alone, one star is deducted for unnecessarily gruesome scenes of violence that tries to instill the seldomly utilized psychological terror which did not achieve a desired effect. Instead, this inspire only revulsion with ""ill-in-the-stomach"" horror, as so many typical slasher horror movies usually are.<br/><br/>One exception would be the ""Feast Monster"" sequence which is actually terrifying to watch under the right circumstance in the dark room or screening during the strange (windy, rainy or stormy) weather late one night. This particular sequence is the nightmare of vivid imagination that would scare unsuspecting young children to the extent they never forget the background story of this monster's penchant for flesh as well as the hideous appearance of the monster. Del Toro and FX team are to be commended for achieving a notable film which tend to inspire terror in some unsuspecting viewers.<br/><br/>However, as I said before, the gore effect left me slightly repulsed (knowing the efficiency of the behind-the-scene FX) so, unfortunately, despite the film's incredible achievement in ""cinema-bizarre"" fantasy film-making comparable to Terry Gilliam's strange Brazil & 12 Mondays and Jean-Pierre Jeunet & Marc Caro's one-two punch black humor extravaganza Delicatessen and The City of Lost Children, it left me disappointed that I cannot recommend the film to friends and family members without strenuously warning them of the violent content that would be too disturbing for them to endure.<br/><br/>Word of mouth for Pan's Labyrinth may be favorable for the aesthetically genuine cinematic fantasy experience, but the focus on gore FX is a major turn-off so whether the film will do well at the box office is a question mark (the fact that it's a subtitled film in a wide release notwithstanding).<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro is a technically and creatively good filmmaker, but he needs to lay off the herb in such self-indulgence by showing off the creatively-constructed yet very gross blood 'n' guts FX effects that left some patrons in the audience reeling in utter disgust.<br/><br/>It is my contention that if the grisly gore effect is MINIMAL yet effective without absurd prolonged lingering on the crimson blood pulps and open-gap mutilated wounds -- or at least subliminally staged to achieve the genuine effect of cinematic psychological terror like Robert Wise's The Haunting, the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Changeling and Halloween without resorting to the old trick of gore FX to gross out the audience as maximally as possible -- Pan's Labyrinth would be a much more effective fantasy-horror film with the reprehensible evil deeds depicted in vivid details but certainly not so much as to cause the desensitized perception of the passively viewing audience.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is a good film of artistic and technical merit, but a failure in generating compassion for any character -- even the young female Alice-type protagonist because of the Mexican producers' penchant for the imposition of moral relativism that strip this film of anything remotely compassionate.<br/><br/>""Innocence has a power evil cannot imagine,"" indeed. But emotionally vacuous thanks to del Toro's self-indulgence in desensitizing gore FX effects.<br/><br/>Señor del Toro, try for the PG rating for Deadman the Movie Adaptation for a change. Enough about grisly violence, you enjoy it too much.<br/><br/>** 1/2 out of four stars"

","I just want to send this out as a warning to all those who find the sight of blood nauseating, this story has quite a bit of blood! It is a DARK fairytale! The artistry is great but if u cringe @ gore like myself, prepare to cover your face w/ a sweater often. Might be a good idea to go with a friend who's already seen it so they can warn you of upcoming gore. Though people have probably already figured this out from the R rating, parents DO NOT BRING YOUNG CHILDREN. Most likely they won't understand it and you'll have them in your bed for a week.

"KnightsofNi11","9","1","6","3 August 2010"," Beautiful film that is not what it appears to be
","Pan's Labyrinth is a Spanish film from artistic visionary director Guillermo del Toro (Hellboy, The Devil's Backbone). It tells the story of a young girl named Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) who has moved to the country with her pregnant mother to live with her ruthless stepfather, General Vidal (Sergi López). It is set in Fascist Spain in 1944 and General Vidal is fighting against a group of rebels hiding out in the forest surround his headquarters. It is a brutal setting for anyone, especially young Ofelia. In order to cope, Ofelia finds escape in her fairy tales. It becomes a reality when she meets the Faun, who tells her that she is the reincarnation of a princess who died many years ago. He assigns her tasks to complete before the full moon so that she can be free of her human form and become the princess of her magical fairy-tale land once again. Ofelia sets out to accomplish her tasks, and all the while the world around her descends into chaos.<br/><br/>In one word, Pan's Labyrinth is beautiful. In so many words, Pan's Labyrinth is a visceral artistic experience that articulates a beautiful parallel between the real world and fairy tales. The term fairy tales is used loosely here. Pan's Labyrinth is not about the happy and frolicking fairy tales that this day and age are used to. One element of sheer genius behind this film is that it returns to the original idea of fairy tales, and explores the dark and gritty roots of them, which the general population is no longer familiar with. This movie is very dark and has plenty of unsettling moments that are not limited to the real world events. The movie is far from black and white and will make you think. Nothing is spelled out for you and that is where it excels. Its artistic and emotional merit makes it something just excellent.<br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro is a fantastic visionary and the visual aesthetic of Pan's Labyrinth is a very subtle beauty. The film does not flaunt its artistic ability, keeping it at a believable level. In fact, there are more scenes taking place in the real world than the fairy tale world. Ofelia is the only character who knows and believes in the magic of the world around her, leaving the other characters to deal with her in a variety of ways. Some feel sympathy for her, such as Mercedes (Maribel Verdú) one of the workers at the mill. Ofelia's stepfather on the other hand wants nothing to do with her and only cares about the son he is waiting for his wife to give birth to. All of this character relationship unexpectedly plays a much larger role in the story and leads to a heart wrenching conclusion.<br/><br/>This review is actually from my second viewing of Pan's Labyrinth. The first time I saw the film I honestly did not like it. I expected there to be more fairy tale than real world, and I was left feeling cheated. However, after a closer look at the deep and dark tone of this immaculate film, I have realized that it is a film executed in such a subtle yet effective way that it is absolutely brilliant. The visuals work in their own unconventional way to build this gripping story of fear and love. Pan's Labyrinth is a must see."
"sefirosukuraodo","10","1","6","1 April 2010"," The Best Adult Fantasy Film Carries The Irony of a Child Lead
","This movie can't be classified as an 'adult' fantasy per se, but more of a mature fantasy film for the family to enjoy, so long as there is parental guidance. The movie is a brilliant take on depicting how a young girl, on the brink of childhood and becoming a young lady, escapes her mundane, and at times depressing, life into the world of the immaterial and, more importantly, a role of self-importance in the grander scheme of things. The film unfolds from a strong fantasy opening and fades into a dark realism as Ofelia grows and learns that the most horrifying monsters are not in her imagination, but in the world around her as her hideously deranged step-father takes her and her mother on a paranoid downward spiral as they all await the arrival of a baby. Javier Navarrete's musical score is lush and never once out of place. The buildup of his masterpiece becomes an audible poem that vibrantly completes the climax and finale of the film. A must have for those who cherish coming-of-age and provocative films."

"paul2001sw-1","8","1","6","27 January 2009"," Simplistic but powerful
","Guillermo del Toro's film, 'Pan's Labyrinth', is a magic realist movie, in which a young girl, living amid bloody and persistent rebellion following the official end of the Spanish Civil War, takes refuge in a fantasy world. The film has a moral viewpoint that plainly divides the world into good and evil, and as with most stories based on fantasy, there's a certain arbitrariness to some of the plot. But it also has an epic feel, and a certain poetic grandeur, and manages to pull off its mixture of realism and make-believe without descending into silliness. There are other films that better capture the ambiguity of internal conflict; but this is still a movie of originality and power."
"ShootingShark","6","1","6","20 December 2007"," Charming, Tragic, Beautifully-Made Fable Of Lonely Spanish Girl's Escapist Fantasies
","Ofelia is a young girl sent to live at her stepfather's outpost in the Spanish countryside in 1944. She finds a labyrinth in the woods, where a strange creature tells her she is a princess who must complete three tasks to inherit her kingdom. Is this fantasy real, or merely an escape from the loneliness and isolation of her circumstances ?<br/><br/>The best word to describe this movie is simply beautiful. The story (which my synopsis does not begin to cover) is lovingly crafted, the performances are rich and sincere, the art design and photography are gorgeous and the melancholy atmosphere of wonderment and heartbreak is rich and deeply moving. I didn't enjoy it perhaps as much as I could, purely because the tragedy is relentless and the Capitán Vidal character (brilliantly played with squinting severity by López) is so repulsive and misanthropic. But this of course is the whole point of the story; Ofelia escapes the world into her imagination and we gladly escape with her, even if she is merely losing her mind. There are very few fantasy films with adult sensibilities (Drop Dead Fred, Nightbreed, Heavenly Creatures) and this one blends its mixture of revolutionary drama and fairy-tale fable with effortless ease. Eleven-year-old Baquero is sensational as Ofelia, timeless and haunted, never overplaying the moment, and we wince at every cruel injustice she suffers. Verdú is great as the housekeeper and Jones (a regular in Del Toro's movies) is amazing as both Fauno and the ultra-creepy Hombre Palido / Pale Man. Guillermo Navarro's photography is superb throughout - crucially he shoots the whole film the same way, choosing not to delineate the fantastic scenes until the very end and thereby seamlessly integrating Ofelia's story into the whole. Gifted Mexican director Del Toro's horror films (Cronos, Mimic, Hellboy) are well respected, but with this movie - a sort-of sequel to his earlier El Espinazo Del Diablo / The Devil's Backbone - he shifts gear into a much more unique and multi-layered film, more reminiscent of European art-house cinema than escapist entertainment, and was deservedly praised for his efforts. Shot entirely in Spain, and a triple Oscar-winner (very unusual for a foreign language film) for Art Direction, Photography and Makeup. Please note that the English title of this movie - Pan's Labyrinth - is something of a misnomer, since the Fauno character is specifically not the pipe-playing, lecherous Greek God of shepherds called Pan, albeit having some similarities. Anyway, don't miss this evocative and richly-textured picture."

","This movie was definitely better than most. It was quite entertaining. It has some cool special effects, esp. the fawn. Even though it is like a fairy tale, it is rated R for a reason: not for kids. This is a very violent and bloody movie. The scene with the captain beating a man to death in the head was one of the most gruesome scenes in film history. It was worse than what they show in your average slasher flick. Ofelia travels to live with an evil Captain with her pregnant mother who has married the captain. She finds a fairy who leads her through a labyrinth to a mysterious fawn. He tells her she is a princess who must complete three dangerous tasks in order to find immortality. While this is going on, we learn her mother is very ill plus rebels are fighting the soldiers and 2 people in the Captain's household are part of the rebellion. Ofelia also disobeys the fawn and gets into some trouble of her own.<br/><br/>The whole film just has a creepy feel to it; plus it has some very violent scenes. It was just very original. Also the subtitles take nothing away from the film.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: If you like gory movies, this is for you. Reading the subtitles is not bad. Check it out."
"jaddison383","10","1","6","7 August 2007"," A Fairy Tale of a Different Kind...
","Fairy tales can come in many diverse forms. We have what Disney has given us, the old stories themselves, Shakespearean plays are even largely inspired by fairy tales. This film, however, is a fairy tale entirely of it's own kind.<br/><br/>In the last stretch of the Spanish civil war, there are some last remaining insurgents fighting the new regime, and to destroy these groups there have been military posts set up in the countryside. It is into this world that young Ofelia is forced into when her mother marries the Captain of one such post- She is carrying his child. But in this dark and dreary place, something sinister is brewing. With war raging around her and her mother's health declining, Ofelia must escape the world around her... and recede into a world of her own.<br/><br/>The film is astounding; It is unlike anything I've ever seen. The only thing it could have done any better would have been a bit more character development, but that is overshadowed by the overall effect of this stunning story. The performances are all wonderful, with Ivana Baquero playing Ofelia perfectly. Sergi Lopez does a fantastic job as the Captain as well, slowly developing his character into someone you truly loathe. The film was really stolen, though, by Maribel Verdu as Ofelia's friend Mercedes. Ms. Verdu was robbed of a Best Supporting Actress nomination.<br/><br/>The real star of the show is what's on the screen: Director Guillermo Del Torro has created a fantasy land that is a feast for our eyes. The set design here is incredible- If there is an Oscar for that, this film should have won it. The set design is only complimented by the beautiful cinematography, which both never distracts from the plot and is also one of the best parts of the film, all at the same time. And it is all helped by some of the best music written for film in a long time by Javier Narrate. The soundtrack is gorgeous!<br/><br/>It is true Pan's Labyrinth is unlike any fairy tale you've ever heard of; it is most definitely not for children. However, it is a tale that you'll never forget. Sit down and revel in a fairy tale of a different kind... 9/10 stars!!! <br/><br/>Jay Addison"
"testiram","Null","1","6","26 May 2007"," Deprivation as the core of menstrual symbolism
","What exactly do the events inside the labyrinth, or underground, mean? It's very simple, you only need to perform a simple operation of addition, that is to sum up 1 + 1. First, the frog beneath the tree. The frog, we learn, is DEPRIVING the tree of its nutrition, DEPRIVING it of its vital fluids, so to speak, and thus hindering its growth. What Ofelia does is destroying the frog and eliminating the state of deprivation. Second, the banquet hall with the creature, the Pale Man. He, seemingly, has been depriving human beings of their nutrition for a long time, by gathering food on his table and not letting anyone touch it. He, actually, is DEPRIVATION itself, personified, or, better maybe, monsterified. He thrives on deprivation. And again, what Ofelia does is, if not destroying him, at least tricking him and thus de-personifying him, making him a monster with a flaw, which is as much as eliminating him, for there can nothing much be left of him if his act of depriving others is not total. And third, Ofelia doesn't let the otherwise benevolent faun (Pan) hurt her newly-born brother, that is, she doesn't let the brother be DEPRIVED of even one single drop of blood. Instead, she gets deprived of her own blood, and with it her own life. One should note only that not merely a life, but her GIRLHOOD life. <br/><br/>So, what does this sum up to? It sums up to a very obvious (but not at all clumsy!) SYMBOLISM OF MENSTRUATION. Ofelia grows into a woman, a very self-conscious and world-understanding woman (just the kind Mercedes is; note that Mercedes is the only one who ever mentions the labyrinth and seems to know that there lives a faun a little girl needs to meet ...), the one who realizes that ONLY WOMEN ARE ALLOWED TO BE DEPRIVED (of their menstrual blood) in order to grow up, to understand themselves and the world around, and that deprivation of any other living being leads only to disaster, just like the tree had been deprived by the frog and the children by the Pale Man. And the Captain - the male - of his vital fluids by his father! <br/><br/>The movie shows how wrong it is if a male gets deprived. He simply can't bare the notion that anything of or on him would disappear. This is exactly the notion the Captain's father leaves over to his son - the notion of year, month, day, hour, minute and second of his DISAPPEARANCE, of his deprivation of life. That's why the Captain panics, and all he is now able to understand about what is going on around him is disappearing of others and REMAINING OF HIMSELF, himself now and here, and himself projected onto his son. All he sees in the present, as well as in the past and in the future, is himself. He exists as a particle of a genetic lineage, and this genetic lineage - his father and his son - is essentially identified as his own self. The brutality of the Captain is thus the brutality of a self-centered male ego who cannot understand the gaps life needs to embrace in order to continue, in other words, the brutality of a male fearing his own disappearance and invalidation.<br/><br/>The magic, on the other side, is by no means lacking in Pan's Labyritnh. The labyrinth is always present, never is there a moment that would leave you grumpily wonder why there is not more of the labyrinth. It sure isn't Disneyland with all the characters and stories and adventures neatly packed in an instant-food-like arrangement. It lingers in your mind, creeping deeper and deeper into your unconscious darkness. And their is one genuinely magical, touching moment, very short, but so effective that pierces your heart. The moment when Pan returns.<br/><br/>10 (excellent)"

","My family saw a ""making of"" type show on TV for this film and decided it look fantastic. The kind of movies we love to go to....filled with fantasy and creatures similar to those in Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and Narnia. These movies are all, in a way about the war between good and evil. We didn't look into it any further, we went. The plot is absolutely war driven and there is a clear ""good and evil"" aspect to it but the graphic nature surprised me. My children (9 and 12) are somewhat desensitized as they have seen many ""R"" rated movies with vampires and gore and the like but I was alarmed by this movie mostly because I was expecting it to be heavier on the fantasy side, like fighting some unseen force or mystical beast. The violence in this movie is done by real people to real people. It is not held to the imagination and there is no panning away at the last minute. My children left the movie ultimately liking it. My husband and I also liked the movie. There is no doubt of the beautiful simplicity in the message regarding the loss of innocence... but parents be warned, its rated R for a reason."

","El Laberinto del Fauno is one of those films that was on the road to brilliance, but got lost somewhere along the way. The fact that it did not fulfill its potential makes it a frustrating experience, which unfortunately detracts from it's overall beauty. Masterfully shot and directed, it's the story of a young girl caught in the madness of 1940's fascist Spain, who retreats into a colourful fantasy world, which eventually proves to be either her demise or salvation, depending on how you look at it.<br/><br/>There are several scenes of particularly impressive creative vision, however they fail to add up to a cohesive whole. The fantasy world isn't explored in enough depth, but the scenes of it that do exist are breathtaking. The war-based scenes though are often heavy-handed and are not connected well enough to the fantasy scenes. Furthermore, while the characters are all beautifully developed and acted, the plot tends to meander and fails to engage to a satisfying degree.<br/><br/>With some editing or a script rewrite, this could have been a veritable classic. Sadly though, in its present state, it just leaves us wondering what a marvelous film it could have been with a little more effort."

This film is an absolute phenomenon, it's one of those films where you are sitting on the edge of your chair because you feel really involved and feel empathy for the characters. In a cross between Alice in Wonderland and Labyrinth, a young girl, Ofelia,has to succeed in a series of quests to save her mother and brother from death. What made this film astonishing were all the different ways the director has used mise-en-scene to create his dark and twisted fantasy world. The costumes are awesomely amazing and although extravagantly fantastic give the characters a sense of realism. The Faun's costume is especially effective because it made me feel scared of the character when he first appeared and that Ofelia absolutely shouldn't trust his words. The final showdown between these characters leave you wondering whether you have just watched her dream or her reality."

","This film has to be the best one i have seen in a long time; the use of phenomenal special effects, along with believable characters, help to create a masterpiece that kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire film! Pan's Labyrinth is not set out in the usual film narrative; the use of non-linear narrative enables us to see Ofelia laying and bleeding in the shadowed, gloomy labyrinth before the film has fully started-informing us that the character is doomed from a very early stage. Only at the end of the film do we come to realise that Ofelia was shot by her stepfather, Vidal. Before Ofelia's killing, she is talking to the faun when Vidal finds her-only when the camera establishes the scene from his point of view, it appears as if Ofelia is talking to thin air. I can't help but wonder if the director wanted his audience to think that the labyrinth is all in Ofelia's imagination, or only she can see the creatures because she is the long, lost princess who was found by the fairies and the faun.<br/><br/>When we are first introduced to the faun, the close up allows us to fully appreciate the detail and workmanship that has gone into him-aside from this, i felt that i was wanting to connect with the character but the use of the somewhat spooky non-diegetic sounds made me suspicious of him...even now i am unsure if i should deem him trustworthy. <br/><br/>In conclusion, the closing scene of the film, (when Ofelia is reunited with her mother and father as a princess), is definitely an open narrative in my opinion and i anticipate the sequel to this film should one be in the making. (Which i think it should!)."

As the story develops the child goes deeper and deeper into her imagination creating a devilish faun that dictates her quest, until these tasks become a serious problem as she is getting in trouble, a costly mistake she will find later on in the plot. A lucky escape from a convincing, baby consuming monster foreshadows a grim ending in store. And as the story continues the family drift apart until they are strangers to each other.

We wonder at every fantastical thing that young Ofelia encounters on her quest to return back to where she's been told she belongs, because even those that seem to be trying to help her have an air of danger that we've been trained to sanitize from anything a child might encounter. You never really know if Ofelia is more threatened by the alien and unfamiliar dangers of the night that are brought to her by the questionable satyr, or the all-too-human and familiar dangerous of the day and her  war-torn country. <br/><br/>Creature and set design is a definite strength of del Toro. Unlike in Hellboy, where the striking visuals were wasted on a story that wasn't worthy of them, Pan's Labyrinth provides a strong fabric to support the beautiful creatures and sets that move the plot forward. There are entire stories hinted at by the lair of the Pale Man and the ancient labyrinth with its faun-shaped entrance. So much imagination and creativity went into this movie, that it would be worth seeing for those things alone.<br/><br/>There's a lot about Pan's Labyrinth that I haven't gone into, because it's best to watch it with as little knowledge about it as possible, as I did. Rest assured that it's a very good movie, and you'll be filled with nothing but admiration for Guillermo del Toro by the end. I can't wait to see it again."
"daberaz","8","1","7","1 April 2010"," Dark, violent and sad (fantasy?) tale, that is not flawless but the ending will leave you thinking for at least a while...
","Pan's Labyrinth is a movie, that starts out like Alice in Wonderland. But during the war. And with the scenes happening in the real world, too. Including the sadistic captain, stepfather to plot's main character - Ofelia. The movie can be described by many words, but there are a few that definitely fit to it perfectly. It's not a masterpiece. I don't think so, there were flaws in the screenplay, in the direction, too, but here one might argue. It has lots of strange, weird scenes as fantasy is involved. It's dark and shockingly and brutally violent. It's getting more and more complex as the plot goes on, adding new subplots and leading, finally, to a great finale.<br/><br/>The ending is something that changes a grade for this movie from 6 for making, meaning sets, makeup, special effects, pictures, acting which is all flawless to solid 8, for a great, beautiful and extremely sad, symbolical tale with lots of lessons to learn and things to think about after the watch.<br/><br/>It's one of those movies, that you know how they say, you'll either love it or hate it? well, maybe not that extreme here, I would say, but its one of those movies that you won't just stand by it not moved by it at all. The ending completes the story, adding it a much better, more complex outlook creating a dark, violent and sad tale that will leave you thinking for at least a while."
"kangarooz-1","8","1","7","14 January 2010"," ultra-violence
","I thought the film was superior on many levels - the depictions of fantasy, myth, the seldom told true story of Spain's all too recent dark past, the acting, the editing, the script, etc. etc. etc. What saddened and disturbed me was the graphic depiction of violence.<br/><br/>While the sadistic cruelty was undeniably accurate as to what occurs during the playgrounds for psychopaths that we generally refer to as wars - and thus not gratuitous - I wonder if the presumed anti-cruelty message is not diminished, due to the inevitable desensitization to violence, which also undeniably occurs when Filmer's see such obscenity depicted not only in trash horror exploitation films such as Saw, but in works of art such as El Laberinto del Fauno as well."

","Laberinto del Faun. Through a children's fairy tale the director has expressed feelings which were worried by children of war. Up to the end it is not clear, the world which is developed before us a fantasy or a reality? The reason of the child leaves from brutal events of war, creating the world which gives hope and belief what war and a pain are not eternal, each second of a film? The small image which all tightens the spectator so by the film end you forget more deeply that you sit at a cinema, a film completely withdraws the spectator the world. It is the best work Guillermo Del Toro and one of my favorite films. Certainly a film not children's, but in each adult it awakes for a long time forgotten for an everyday life of knowledge of the main human values. Allows to look at the world eyes of children."
"mdanutz-1","10","1","7","8 July 2008"," beautiful sadness
","It's difficult to find beautiful movies nowadays; except for rare moments. This is one of them. Beauty and sadness altogether. It's all here: atmosphere, sound, images, hope, tears, inescapable faith and above all (as the tag line says), innocence and its power over evil. One viewing of this movie is not enough. The real material takes form only on repeated viewings. Unfortunately, there is no compromise along: it shows the horror at its finest and the innocence at its purest, it shows the fact that they both coexist in different forms in different worlds, it shows the resolution that is implacable. This is not a children bedtime fantasy fable. The sole purpose of a movie should be to resonate with your purest feelings at the deepest level. This one brutally force you to look inside yourself and search for your lost innocence despite the fact that it shows no mercy acknowledging that it is impossible to regain it. This is not a movie, after all. It is a universe on its own. Should we choose to enter it, there is no turning back. It will haunt us for the remaining years of our lives."

","Pan's Labyrinth (2006) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>I finally got around to watching Guillermo del Toro's fantasy flick, which I've been wanting to watch since I first heard about it. I guess I'll start off by saying that this film is what The Lord of the Rings trilogy should have been since this movie here features more heart, balls and story than a single frame of the Jackson films have. With that out of the way, this film here manages to be very beautiful, poetic and smart without losing any of its story or visual quality. The movie is quite eerie from start to finish and the fantasy world created by del Toro is very haunting yet captivating at the same time. The visual look is something truly beautiful and must come from a brilliant mind (not to mention twisted). What I liked most is that you never knew where the film was going to take it and the director wasn't scared to take you places that you wouldn't expect. I certainly didn't see the ending coming and I can't think of too many director's that would have the balls to end the film in this way. Ivana Baquero is terrific as the young girl and Sergi Lopez makes for a great villain. The one problem I had with the film is that I thought it dragged on a tad bit too long but I think I'll enjoy the movie more on a second viewing when I can just go with the picture and I'm not trying to figure everything out."
"The_Void","8","1","7","29 January 2008"," A fantastic piece of cinema!
","Even though he's not always great, all of Guillermo Del Toro's films to date have at least been interesting; cult flicks Cronos and The Devil's Backbone were brilliantly inventive, while his commercial output; films such as Blade II, Mimic and Hellboy were also noteworthy. Pan's Labyrinth has been released to almost universal praise, and that isn't surprising as although I won't heap quite as much praise on it as some have; it's a visually dazzling and overall satisfying piece, and certainly Del Toro's best film to date. Pan's Labyrinth is set in fascist Spain during the Second World War and focuses on a young girl named Ofelia. She travels with her mother to stay with her stepfather; the sadistic Captain Vidal. It's not long before she is lead into the woods by a flying stick insect and meets a Faun who tells her that she is, in fact, not a mortal human and is actually the son of the king of the underworld. However, in order to take her place at father's side and become a princess, she must first face and complete three gruesome tasks...<br/><br/>A lot of the film revolves around the implications of a rebellion against the evil Captain at the centre of the story, and this actually bodes surprisingly well with the fantasy element - which works as an 'escape' from the Second World War. Obviously the best thing about this movie is and was always going to be the visuals. The film is a visual feast; naturally there's plenty of imagination and invention courtesy of Del Toro and this helps to give the film a real 'fairy tale' feel. The fact that the film stars an eleven year old girl means that the film has a sort of 'kids flick' feel to it, although this is brilliantly offset by plenty of sadistic violence from the antagonist, as well as some fairly graphic fantasy violence (a monster with eyes in it's palms biting the heads off fairies, for example). This may make the film seem like it lacks focus - but clearly Pan's Labyrinth is a fairy tale for adults. The film is bolstered by a host of excellent performances from the largely Spanish cast. Ivana Baquero is the standout at the centre of the movie - she puts in an amazingly mature performance for a girl of eleven. Doug Jones is also great opposite her as the mysterious Faun. It all boils down to a satisfying and somewhat surprising conclusion and on the whole Pan's Labyrinth is an amazing cinematic achievement."
"MichaelMargetis","9","1","7","19 November 2007"," Visually Stunning and Emotionally Charged. One of the Best Foreign Films I've Ever Seen
","One of the most-hyped foreign features this year was Guillermo Del Toro's 'Pan's Labrynith'. Set in the late 1800s in the middle of the Spanish Civil War, the story follows a young distraught girl by the name of Ofeilia. After the untimely death of her father and pregnancy of her mother, Ofelia goes with her mother to live with The Captain, an indescribably cruel, cold and calculating Captain of the Spanish army. Because of stress related to the move and her mother's pregnancy, Ofelia creates a fantasy world in her mind which has her believe to be an immortal princess separated from her real father at birth who lives in the secret underground world which houses a large variety of immortal fairy tale creatures. The most prominent of these creatures is Faun, a tall wide-eyed monster, who looks like the illegitimate love child of a tree and one of the aliens from the movie 'Signs'. Faun gives her difficult three tasks to complete, in order for her to be accepted into the supernatural underground realm she was supposedly spawned from. During the course of the movie Ophelia must complete these tasks and survive her harsh reality with her sadistic abusive step-father, the Captain.<br/><br/>I was expecting a lot of out 'Pan's Labrynith' due to all of the positive feedback I heard from both critics and my friends alike, and I was completely satisfied. I can't stress how rare it is these days to find an 'original' movie, and it doesn't get any more original than Guillermo Del Toro's 'Pan's Labrynith'. Sure, there have been fairy-tales and fables before, but none as dark and painfully realistic as this one, while at the same time being so sweet and sentimental. The story is familiar to other fairy tale movies, but it's virtually impossible to predict the twists and turns the film takes. Guillermo Del Toro was awarded an Academy Award Nomination for his phenomenal screenplay, and for good reason -- the story moves quickly and the dialogue is always believable unlike most screenplays belonging to films of the same genre. 'Pan's' screenplay is excellent, but the direction is even better. Del Toro's direction is simply put, masterful, and I find it hard to believe he was snubbed for a Best Director Oscar nod this year.<br/><br/>One of the less noticeable aspects of this film is the acting, which is not to say it's not good, in fact it's quite impressive. Ivana Baquero gives a powerful and spot-on performance as Ofelia, that deserves more recognition than it is getting. She is the lead of the film, and it's hard for a 13-year-old girl to carry an entire movie, but she pulls it off and very effectively if I may add. Sergi Lopez is perfectly evil in his part as the Captain, and everyone else is solid especially Y Tu Mama Tambien's Maribel Verdu, who is spectacular as the Captains head maid, Mercedes. The only real shortcoming of this film is everything it leaves unsolved in the end. Don't get me wrong, I loved what I saw, but I wanted more. There were some holes in the story, and not everything was made clear. This really bothered me, but not enough to dismiss the film as one of the most enjoyable movie-going experiences I had all year. Visually, 'Pan's Labrynith' is perhaps the most magnificent motion picture of the year and it deserves Oscars in some of it's technical categories like makeup and art direction (set design).<br/><br/>In conclusion, I highly recommend this heart-wrenching and thrilling fairy tale, but not for kids. At first, I thought this was a kids movie, but believe me, IT'S NOT. If you love your young ones, do not take them to see this movie! Not only is it ""terrifying"", but it contains some unbelievably graphic violence, most of which involves what the notorious ""Captain"" does to people who displease him. As far as fairy tales go though, it sure as hell is better than 'The Chronicles of Narnia'. Grade: A-"
"cowboysmoo-1","10","1","7","1 September 2007"," Beautiful movie for children and adults!
","Del Toro has created an intricate masterpiece for children and adults.<br/><br/>His use of colors and shapes is outstanding and creates such a juxtaposition of imagery. The trinity there in the outside world and the fantasy world, the use of keys and symbols in both, the style of dress and tone of the scene/music in both. Exquisite!!!! When the mother and stepfather both condemn the child for her use of magic as nonsense, I cried too.<br/><br/>Powerful setting of military life, home life, and fantasy life, another trinity, is amazingly intricate and interwoven and believable.

"rggcandy","5","1","7","31 March 2007"," Too many style clashes.
","A very well done film. Beautiful to watch, creepy, interesting, exciting, a very decent piece of work. But. What is it? Let me rephrase that question. Who was this film made for? The older adult audience or the younger child audience? I ask this because this film is both which doesn't really work does it. How can you have a family film with swearing, violence and people slicing other people's faces? Also how can you have an adult film which is clearly a family film about a child in a fantasy adventure. Is it a family film or an adult film? It's neither and that really spoils the film.<br/><br/>Also You've really got two different films going on here which really isn't needed and doesn't do this film any favours. You've got the fantasy film with the girl and also this war film with the adults. Both plots run parallel and sometimes meet. Fair enough but is that really needed? Do you need the war for the fantasy or the fantasy for the war? Now you see what I mean by style clashes. Why do you have both adult and child films locked into one? It doesn't work. You don't need the background setting at all for the fantasy part of the film. It could have been set anywhere at anytime and still worked. You also don't need the fantasy for the war. It may be a small complaint but to me it just ruins what could have been a good film. Pity really."

And I could've handled that, except that this movie was so gory, I honestly couldn't watch quite a few parts of the movie. Granted, I'm a little more sensitive to gore than other people, but it was bad in this movie. I literally had to cover my eyes during some parts of the movie.

","Guillermo del Toro's fantasy spin on fascist Spain during 1944 was met with great critical acclaim. winning 3 Oscars, and nominated for 58 other awards.<br/><br/>This 2006 fantasy film opened the worlds eyes to the mind of a young girl, and makes the viewer question their own. the young girl (Ofelia) is engulfed in a world of fairy-tales all captivated by the amount and genres of books that she reads. she embarks on a journey with her mother to live with her new step-dad who is the captain of the Spanish army. as the film starts, we (the audience) instantly notice that Ofelia's mother is heavily pregnant. It later on becomes apparent that the stepfather is a very evil man, content on having a son born to lead Spain's army, and does not care about Ofelia's mother and especially not Ofelia herself.<br/><br/>I feel that the demographic for the film is teenagers of around 16-20. although I feel that this film can be enjoyed by anyone over the age of 16, as some scenes (notably the ""pale-man"" sequence may be disturbing for a younger audience) <br/><br/>The sound in the film is very good, in particular the sound effects, when Ofelia is crawling through a boggy tree, the sound effects we are presented with are tub-thumping. <br/><br/>the mise-en-scene throughout the film are mainly the characters and the house that Ofelia lives in. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I believe that Pan's Labyrinth is an extremely good film, that can be enjoyed by all. I gave this film an 8 out of 10, I feel that although I found it very enjoyable, i felt the end was slightly predictable as it did not run in chronological order so the audience never had many surprises throughout the film, this does not make the film bad in anyway, it just doesn't make it a 10.

","Pan's Labyrinth is a very good film and is worth watching. Directed by Guillermo Del Toro it is a truly magical film bringing the fantasy world to life. I think that this film is more for the older viewers who like fairy tales than children because the story is very violent and hard to understand. <br/><br/>I feel that having to read the subtitles because the film is in Spanish means that you are more concentrated on the film and it sets the scene more in the Spanish civil war but you don't realise your reading them. Pan's Labyrinth shows the reality of the Spanish civil war. By the end of the film you are left felling sad for Ophelia because of her struggle with her mum and dad and being forced to grow up in the middle on the war being forced to do errands for a mystical Faun. I would recommend this film to a friend because it is a magical film about fantasy adventure showing the struggle of Ophelia and what she faces. The film isn't all good though because i think the story gets a bit too complicated and it is mostly fantasy rather than focusing on the civil war. <br/><br/>7/10"

","Pan's Labyrinth (El Laberinto Del Fauno) is a Spanish Language film from Mexican born writer and director Guillermo del Toro, known for Hellboy, The Devil's Backbone and Mimic. We are told the story of a young girl named Ofelia who has been relocated to the Spanish Mountains with her ""heavily pregnant"" mother to live with her dictator-like stepfather, General Vidal. The film is set in post-civil war Fascist Spain in 1944 and General Vidal is attempting to root out Spanish Maquis guerrillas. <br/><br/>This harsh setting already shows us as the audience the harsh reality Ofelia has been unwillingly thrown into as she loses her innocence. To perhaps keep her sanity in check, she finds solace in her books of fairy tales. Her reality and fantasy worlds collide with a sudden blow. Fantasy becomes reality when Ofelia meets the Faun, who tells her that she is actually a princess from the Underground Realm, who died many years ago. In typical fairytale fashion, he assigns her three tasks to complete before the full moon so that she can become the princess of her magical fairy-tale land again. Ofelia starts a quest of sorts to complete these tasks, while around the young girl her life is thrown further into mayhem Pan's Labyrinth is a gruesome, thought provoking film that throws the fantasy film rulebook out the window. The base elements from a fantasy film are there: a hero (Ofelia), a villain (General Vidal), an older setting (1944) and of course the staple ingredient, magic. But the recipe is mixed with gore and harsh reality to make a mixture that rarely concocts anything worth watching. One dash of ingenuity behind the film is that it still retains the original theme of a fairy tale, and burrows into the forgotten roots of them, which a majority of people are no longer familiar with. For example, in Cinderella, in the Brother Grimm's version, the stepsisters try to trick the prince by cutting off parts of their feet in order to get the slipper to fit. The prince is forewarned by two pigeons that peck out the stepsisters' eyes, thus sealing their fate as blind beggars for the rest of their lives. The aesthetics of Pan's Labyrinth have a very smart beauty. The film doesn't show off with computer generated imagery at every corner but also utilises make up and animatronics to create a captivating otherworldly story its artistic ability, keeping it at a believable level. This review is from my first viewing of Pan's Labyrinth. I expected it to have a higher ration of fairy tale to real world in fairy tale's favour and I felt as if I had missed something along the way. On the other hand, I realise that this film is almost as if it is Ofelia's life and nightly dreams which gives the film a certain individuality that isn't seen very often. I believe that Pan's Labyrinth is an excellent film but it isn't suitable for family viewing."
"honorhorror","9","1","9","15 June 2010"," Father-absent series: Pan's Labyrinth
","When the good doctor asked him why he was so sure his unborn baby was a boy, he simply said ""Don't mess with me."" He deliberately instructed the doctor to save the baby if the childbirth goes into trouble. He regularly gains strength and faith from a cracked watch left by his father, who broke the watch to acknowledge the child his time of death. Upon defeated, his final wish is the same of his father's, but was answered by ""He(the baby boy) won't even know your name"" and a bullet in the face. It was a demise the audiences felt he deserved much earlier because he's a perfect Nazi, spreading inhuman evil with his dreading presence. He likes to sense with you, but prefers more striking demonstrations which advertise his insane ego. Ladies and gentlemen, you've seen evil fathers, but you haven't seen something so implying as a father, even he's practically only a stepfather.<br/><br/>This review intends to explore how the ""absence of father"" can affect stories, human minds and essentially, our souls. Please also refer to other reviews in ""Father-absent series"".<br/><br/>If the ways of our fathers were wrong, do we have a way to know it and for some chances to defy it? I tend to doubt that. C.S.Lewis said in his book The Problem of Pain that humans as we are today are not quite the same species the creator made in the first place because somehow we chose to fall from original grace. Dealing with terms of spiritual world, true definition of purity and innocence and co-existence of heaven's way and human's way, Pan's labyrinth is quite a special movie. When this movie was spreading to Asia back in 2007, the public was shocked by the sheer aesthetic value as well as a very poignant, equally brutal and fairy feeling attached to this unique experience. However, the critics, professors and young graduates alike also fell into a debate as what on earth was the director Del Toro wanted to tell us. I respect all the theories that can make their own senses, which I have no intention to dive into today. What I feel compelled to find out is the movie's implications on a higher level.<br/><br/>Despite the movie's offer of high production values especially those great nature views, the visuals are all wrapped by a haunting loneliness, helplessness and confusion. Ofelia's father died in the bombing, her mother was forced to marry a monster for surviving. The only real father she got was in the children's book. Despite all the goodwill from this fantasy-inspired, heavenly-crowned God-like father, his runner/servant-angel was a ""Pan"", who talks in riddles and assign Ofelia with dangerous missions to return to heaven's heritage. Even the most warm-hearted woman around couldn't get a grasp of what's really happening to Ofelia, not to mention those self-crowned, tyrannical men. It's never this clear a message, ""there are no men anymore in this world but male monsters in men's shape"". Translated into my real world, am I really so different from Captain Vidal? For the record, I don't kill people like having breakfast, and I don't torture people like enjoying butter on a toast. No, I've killed no one with my hands, but I've killed in my mind. Why? Because I am a male human. I loved to allow my anger to rape my sadness, awkwardness and goodwill to apologize and rebuild relationships. It's been years for me, decades for my father, thousands of years for talented Oriental men looking for a perfect flag to devote our blood to and worship our egos in. More importantly, I, like Captain Vidal himself, enjoyed the temporary alliance of my ancestors' honor and my own pride, thus also the power and justification to reign over weaker, more obedient groups. That's the lawful way to grow your pride and ego, and to carry on one's family line especially in traditional Oriental families. Ironically, as a Christian now, I still feel the need to grow in this way sometimes, and often felt beaten by womanizers and smarter people who I tend to look down upon. Luckily, now I know it's a dead road, a highway to the hell.<br/><br/>Captain Vidal's army was triumphed over by brave guerrillas, but his way of killing wasn't. Of the worldly terms, Ofelia doesn't have to save his baby brother from anyone because no one intends to kill him. Of worldly terms, Ofelia died a foolish death, a death so fatefully descends upon her just like the male monster Vidal always have wanted. Pan's final task for Ofelia was far less difficult in physical terms, but intrinsically more difficult for a species that already betrayed its creator. I tend to believe it's not Ofelia's love for her little brother that bought her a ticket to heaven. I believe it's Ofelia's decision to let the heavenly father's way to carry on her rather than the world's way, as illustrated by all the explosions in the backdrop.<br/><br/>In the end, one side is the haunting escalation of violence. The survivors only have the chance to sob upon the dead, after all the bullets hit their destinations, after all the people killed the ones they wanted to kill. On the other side, Ofelia reclaimed princess and reunion with her family. It's only a movie of course, so I don't see the necessity to go into debates as ""which side is essentially the reality"".But for real,is there a heaven? do we believers reunion in heaven? I think it's a question better asked when one's got experience, wealth, health, reasons, intelligence all striped down to zero. It's a question better asked when one has a Bible in his hand which one can turn to Gospel of John chapter 14 verse 2 to 3. It's also a question better asked when one's willing to let our heavenly father's spirit, his way and truth running inside one's soul."

He tells her she is a princess and if she looked on her shoulder there would be the mark for the underworld. He then gives her a book and says to open it when she is alone. Then she must complete three tasks by when the moon is full. Meanwhile, the captain catches a farmer and kills him brutally. The movie continues on with Ofelia filling her three tasks."
"MBunge","5","1","10","7 October 2010"," Perhaps too successful at what it's trying to do
","Pan's Labyrinth is too successful at what it tries to be. With this film Del Toro reimagines the Spanish Civil War as a fairy tale for adults, but he does it so well that it's hard for an adult audience to fully appreciate it.<br/><br/>The story, like most good fairy tales, focuses on both good and evil. The good is Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), a young girl caught up in the messy days after the end of the Spanish Civil War. He father is dead and her mother (Ariadna Gil) has remarried to an officer in Franco's army. Now pregnant with the Captain's child, she and Ofelia travel to his military post, where he is leading the effort against a local guerrilla band in the surrounding hills. The evil of the story is the Captain (Sergi Lopez), representing the regimented, strict and unemotional nature of the fascist regime.<br/><br/>Upon arriving at her new ""home"", Ofelia is lead by a fairy into an ancient maze. There she encounters a faun, a gigantic, mostly wooden goat man who tells Ofelia that she is a princess of a magical kingdom who must perform three tasks to shed her mortal existence and rejoin the spirit realm. Those tasks, which include killing a giant toad and retrieving an item from a monster's lair, are interwoven with the struggle between the Captain and the rebels. Yet, that struggle is as much myth as Ofelia's encounter with a murderous creature who puts his eyeballs in his palms.<br/><br/>The real world events of the film aren't based in any sort of social or personal realism. They could just as easily have been a ""Once upon a time"" story about a cruel overlord and the courageous villagers who eventually destroy him. Like most fairy tales, evil is built up to be this overpowering forcebut then it is defeated, not because of clever planning or even acts of nobility or bravery. Evil is defeated through fairly base trickery and just because good is supposed to defeat evil.<br/><br/>And like most fairy tales, the strongest and most compelling character is the bad guy. Ofelia is a lovely child who cares for her mother and her unborn brother, but there's not much depth or complexity to her. When she succeeds or fails, it's not because of some aspect of her character. It's just because it fits the story. But like the evil witch in Snow White, it is the Captain who is the most compelling figure of the story. He's a sadist who delights in tormenting prisoners, yet he's also a brave warrior on the battlefield. He does love Ofelia's mother, yet would gladly sacrifice her to save his unborn son to carry on his name. He deals out death casually, yet is haunted by his father's end and contemplates suicide. The Captain is supposed to be the real monster of the tale, yet at the end he's the most fully realized, most truly human character in the story.<br/><br/>Del Toro is to be lauded for how well he recreates the classic fairy tale sensibility. Those stories we tell to children are shot through with cruelty and horror and suffering. They're also only weakly tethered to the world of logic and cause and effect, things happen in fairy tales that defy explanation and we accept them without question. But while that works with Ofelia's mystical journey, you may find yourself wanting more or feeling there's something missing in the struggle with the Captain. There is a whole sense of unreality to both story lines and moments when the ""real"" world doesn't make sense as real. Which is, I'm sure, what Del Toro was trying to dobut the ""real"" world is never real enough to provide enough contrast with Ofelia's fantasy world.<br/><br/>The end of Pan's Labyrinth also aspires to be as dark and heartbreaking as many fairy tales. But after embracing unreality so thoroughly, the sharp turn back to normality is too much. You're asked to accept or consider something so out of touch with everything that comes before, that the emotions appealed to can't respond quickly enough. By the time you realize just how sad you should be, the movie's over.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is visually stunning and true to the essence of all good fairy tales, but the mix of fantasy and reality may be too muddy for both kids and grown ups."

","Great story, acting and special effects.<br/><br/>Only two problems.<br/><br/>1. Its a story about children's fairy tales and contains graphic war violence. Definitely not for children. For adults that like fairy tales, I guess.<br/><br/>2. The second issue is the political message. Gratuitous violence (murder and torture) is perpetrated by the fascist military in the film. The good guys are the communist rebels. Looking at the history of Spain in 1944, each side was equally violent. The film does not portray a balanced view and has the communist side winning, which was not the case.<br/><br/>The Franco regime was authoritarian, locked up, killed and exiled thousands of political prisoners. The other side was just as barbaric however, but lost. Spain was neutral, favouring Germany in the 2nd World War, ostracised by the UN in 1945, allied with the US against communism in 1953, experienced an economic boom in 1959 and became a democratic and constitution monarchy in 1975 (Franco's death after anointing the King). In the end the Franco regime fizzled out, but was not overthrown.<br/><br/>The film is an attempt to adjust Spain's history to say that the Fascist regime was the only side to commit human rights atrocities.<br/><br/>The DVD should contain a warning label: ""This film contains material that is Revisionist Left Wing Propaganda"""

"HarrisB1234","3","0","11","9 December 2019"," Evil Murder Fairytale
","Pan's Labyrinth is dark, gruesome, and was definitely not the kind of fairytale I was expecting. This movie setting was in Spain in 1944 under the Nazi held Europe and is an eye opener to how meaningless it was to take someone's life in this time period. The captain was a very heartless man and when they captured the two innocent farmer's and murdered them just because he wanted to was very distributing. His character was easy to distinguish early in the film that he was an evil man and became even more obvious when he shot men that were dead multiple times. I wouldn't recommend a child to watch this film due to some scenes that would be terrifying for younger viewers. Some viewers love this cinema and for me it was rather disturbing. I don't understand why this film is rated as high as it is because it really isn't an outstanding film and could be consider a lightly expressed horror film instead of a magical fantasy. Pan's Labyrinth has similarities of a fairytale but is not your typical, colorful, and happy fairies. It's rather a dark fairytale that deals with death and with characters that aren't human that could possibly be from a dark underworld. There were times in this film where I would turn my head because of the gruesome murders and even some of the non-human characters were frightening. Even though this was not one of my favorite movies the graphics, setting, and story was rather great. The film never portrayed poor quality or terrible acting and the nonhuman characters looked realistic. Pan's Labyrinth is a creative film, but I would not watch this movie again and do not recommend any one to watch this film especially if you find gruesome scenes disturbing."
"danielparise-80503","9","0","1","14 May 2019"," A different take on fantasy
","Guillermo del Toro is the director of this masterpiece. The movie takes place in 1944 in Spain after a recent civil war. The costumes for the all of the characters as well as the way that some of the technology is portrayed almost captivates the audience into feeling like that all of this could have happened within this time period. The costumes are not only well done, but very intricate designs. The two best costumes within the movie is the Faun and the Pale Man. The design of these costumes in combination of the music and the scenes themselves really help set the tone for a surprisingly dark movie. The special effects are masterfully done in a way as to it is very surprising to find out not only that the film itself is low budget, but are for the most part done better than how its is used in most movies now. Some of the more graphic scenes are the ones that show the true potential of the special effects. All of these put together can helps the audience have a suspension of disbelief that can make them think that all of this is very much possible just from how well the setting, costumes, and special effects blend together as a whole. Overall though the film was really enjoyable and would recommend to anybody that not only loves films, but fantasy."
"jessicajdurai","3","0","4","13 May 2019"," Not for Children
","Even though the plot is told chronologically it is still hard to follow as Ofelia further disassociates herself from real life constantly.<br/><br/>The setting constantly reverts from realism to fantasy. The atmosphere is dark and pungent in nature, meaning its never a dull moment of references to the evil of men in war and the devil himself; who is supposedly Ofelia's father "" The King of the Underworld.""<br/><br/>With such a dark mood being set early on shadows are well used to portray the symbolic faun and fairy creatures messages. Many events in the movie happen to happen during night or darker hours so shadow use was important to be executed well, as it was overall. The lighting hitting Ofelia just so in many scene continues to portray her as the innocent of the situations pitted around her character.<br/><br/>Sound is used in the film as a bit of added disturbence to gruesome events, it is also added to emphasize footsteps and things of that nature to further the viewers suspension of disbelief informally.<br/><br/>The costumes I feel were executed well for portraying their role, except, I felt for the main trickster- The Faun. I felt his special effects were over compensated for as something much simpler might of portrayed his character better. The ""faceless"" man was utterly disturbing in the right way for his role, but in general just disgusting, as i do think that was the point though.<br/><br/>Overall this movie did do some things well but it did not meet my expectations and I was disappointed with how essentially ""boring"" it was.

"grumpybear-12381","4","0","1","10 May 2019"," AP movie review
","The setting of ""Pan's labyrinth"" setting is pretty realistic; I feel like everything flows together as if it is all meant to be in one place. Like the labyrinth didn't seem completely out of place when it was introduced. In my opinion I believe this story is linear, mainly because Ofelia has to follow certain steps to become the princess she is supposed to be. It is very thought out and every scene is meant to follow without any flashbacks or flash-forwards. I believe the audience intended for this film were adults, and anyone in the Spanish speaking community.
The costumes and makeup are either really simple everyday people and soldiers. However, for the labyrinth creatures and people, everyone has very detailed costumes involving either green screens and mechanical pieces. I feel that the creatures really bring out the mysterious side of the labyrinth to life. The fawn is a main part of the story, he is there to not only guide Ofelia but to also be a test. The naked and scarier creature will bring you anxiety and fear. Mainly because he will eat you if you eat from his table of treats, However he also is there as a statement. I think he's there to test anyone entering and to bring pain to those who fail."
"parkerguthrie","6","0","1","10 May 2019"," Decent portrayal of good v.s. Evil
","Rooted in traditional folklore, ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a story that highlights the importance of nobility in the face of the worst of evils. The most effective way the director conveyed this theme is through character development. The first characters we are introduced to are the protagonists, Ofelia and her pregnant mother. While her mother isnt't too actively involved in the plot of the film, the child she is carrying ultimately plays into the theme. Ofelia is a young girl with a very active imagination. Her mother and the other figures of authority in the film don't seem too fond of this fact, encouraging her to read books that would more suit the logistical person they want her to be.
After Ofelia and her mother's arrival to the captain's house, we are introduced to the captain. The captain is the father of Ofelia's mother's child. They're planning to live with them, but through dramatic irony the film reveals that there is an evil side to him that Ophelia's mother does not see. He's shown commiting evil acts and shows no remorse for them. These acts, unseen by Ophelia's mother are what develop the captain's character into the villain of the story. After this establishment of roles, we see Ophelia start to fulfill her role as the perfect protagonist. She makes many sacrifices for the greater good of something she doesn't even fully understand, further establishing her role as the noble protagonist.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the film that I appreciate is the special effects. Some of the CGI appears kind of clunky and awkward, but knowing that this film is low budget it adds a certain amount of charm. The practical effects however are very good. The pale man is terrifying and I feel that he wouldn't have that same haunting effect had the director, cast, and crew not gone the extra mile to blend him into the environment. Speaking of environment, the set design of the film is also worth appreciating. The captain's house, labyrinth, and forest are all designed well, but I think the most impressive is the set of the road scene. It's absolutely disgusting, and I mean disgusting. I'm a germophobe and seeing this set actually created that sense of germ induced anxiety in me.<br/><br/>Going into it I was skeptical, but the film grew on me. I highly recommend watching the bonus features of them film. The interviews with the director and other crew members provide insight to the film that helped me appreciate it more."

","This movie seemed to have solid film making at its basic but the story writing seems to be where it falls short for me. I think the plot line and development was lack luster and more mystical with a shortage of actual true grit. It seemed to swing back and forth between child like fairy tales and over the top violence from the military characters that leaves a bad taste in the views mouth. Most of the changes in style didn't seem dynamic or forward thinking but more lazy and hoaky. Overall I felt the tone of this movie takes the experience that was possible from the content available away and replaces it with pandering pulls at child like wonder and adult gruesomeness."

","I came here from Googling Tenome and a picture of the guy from this showed up. It's great and all, the faun's one of my favorite characters, but there's one line in the movie that bugs me. It's when Ofelia says ""you're working with the men in the woods"" or something like that to Mercedes (I'm watching it with English subtitles). How could Ofelia even guess that? There were no clues. At all.
Also, if I were a little girl that bug at the beginning would've freaked me out.
Another thing I've noticed: there're too many sounds happening at once. Sometimes you'll hear the gross fairy noise when there are no faires. Also how do you not hear the eye-hand guy when he gets up?!
The characters yell at the most ridiculous times to yell. For example, Ofelia yells when she goes into that pit. There could be something dangerous down there. When the captain goes on his horse to find the guys in the woods, he's surprised they left in a hurry. HM, I SURE WONDER WHY. IT'S DEFINITELY NOT BECAUSE THEY HEARD LOADS OF HORSES RUNNING TOWARDS THEM."

Her relationship with Ofelia is really touching and the end scene between the two made me cry.
Ofelia herself is an engaging character. She loves fantasy and other kids who believe in magic and fairies can relate to her. She's also very strong and brave, which makes her precocious and interesting.
The captain was also enjoyable. For a villain, he was interesting and he put up a good fight for the protagonists.
The fantasy characters were my favorite. From the creepiness and horror of the Pale Man to the cuteness of the fairies, Pan's Labyrinth was spot on. The Faun especially blew me away, with his design and personality where you always weren't sure if he was good or bad.<br/><br/>Anyways, I loved this movie and I would totally see it again.

","Long mystified by this film's grand reputation, I watched it for the second time yesterday, and the nicest thing I can think to say, really, is: I don't get it. Maybe that's because I can't easily dismiss plot devices and plot holes, even if they're part of an elaborate fantasy. <br/><br/>Guillermo del Toro is trying to have it both ways-- Brothers Grimm-style fantasy and the actual Spanish Civil War. Unfortunately, the fantasy is a virtuoso display of grotesque characters and a relish of cruelty that makes Hannibal Lecter seem like a faintly decadent gourmand, while the Spanish Civil War was no more real to me in this film than WWII was in the brilliant opening sequence of Del Toro's pure fantasy, ""Hellboy.""<br/><br/>At no point did I take the human characters seriously, especially not the relentlessly evil Colonel (Sergi López). He's the equivalent of Grimms' cruel stepmothers, which is as thin as fantasy gets. Three particular things bothered me, not all of which can be written off as fantasy or a child's viewpoint -- if it is a child's viewpoint. Adolescent Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is the heroine, but powerful Pan (Doug Jones) is the voice-over narrator.<br/><br/>1. When the mother (Ariadna Gil) tells her daughter that real life is hard, not like the fairy tales that Ofelia devours, I waited for some evidence to support such a claim. Ofelia's fairy tales are gruesome and repellent-- as bad or worse as anything in real life. <br/><br/>2. Toward the end, the housekeeper (Maribel Verdú) viciously stabs the Colonel, first in the back, then chest, shoulder, and mouth. The wounds leave him at her mercy-- but she doesn't finish him off. Given her risky loyalty to the rebels he's battling, and her willingness to stab him four times, the only reason for stopping short of murder has to be to set up more brutality. So the Colonel survives only to be almost-killed again. Indeed, he emerges from the quadruple stabbing strong as ever except for a bloody shirt, a bandaged lip, and a firearm. If you'll notice, the plot wouldn't change an iota if she hadn't stabbed him at all. The same is true a little later, when Ofelia poisons the Colonel. He staggers a bit in his bloody shirt, but in the next scene, he's back in fine form, gun in hand.<br/><br/>3. The movie really lost me at the end. When the godlike character on the throne says to Bardo Ofelia, ""Arise, my daughter. Come. You have spilled your own blood rather than the blood of an innocent. That was the final task and the most important."" The blood she spared was that of her infant brother. But she's, what?, 12? That's not an innocent? <br/><br/>Given that the actress who played Ofelia was at ""the bud-stage of breast development,"" as Humbert said of Lolita, I actually wondered if puberty is being referenced there, as the loss of innocence, the end of childhood. Probably not, since it's not an issue anywhere else in the movie. Anyway, the point is, in war, most if not all children are innocent.<br/><br/>I have not yet seen del Toro's latest, The Shape of Water, which is getting high praise as I write. But at this point, with the dominance of sensational visuals over coherent ideas in his work, I'm beginning to think Guillermo del Toro is Spanish for Tim Burton."

","Guillermo del Toro directs circles around most filmmakers, and PAN'S LABYRINTH is Exhibit Number One. The mix of brutal Reality and beautiful Fantasy has never been done better, though the historical horror overshadows (and eventually consumes) the imaginary world that del Toro creates. When Ofelia and her pregnant mother Carmen arrive at their new home with the sadistic Capatain Vidal in 1944 Spain, the stage is set for the fantasy that follows. The ever slow-moving camera watches scenes play out in an almost dream-like manner, drifting in and out and around the players the entire time. I've always liked this approach to cinematography: it helps make even static scenes tolerable. When the fascists begin to round up and torture and kill some of the ""rebels,"" del Toro contrasts these horrors with the mundane, everyday indifference of the world around them: the forest itself is undisturbed by the wanton murders. Ofelia follows a fairy into an underground world where she meets a faun. ""You're going to a very dangerous place,"" he warns her. Unfortunately, she doesn't heed the warning, and... well, see for yourself what happens next."

","We have layers of ideas here in multiple stories... a girls fighting against hope gets a chance for a better life in the kingdom she belongs, but the mythology that is required to follow falls short of being worthy. It's creepy in its' imaginary monsters and scary in its real fascist war monsters. Of course, they are one in the same in reality, just evil that can not be satiated. We have the actual story of rebels making a last stand while hiding in the woods. That story seems made for TV with small scope productions,black and white characters, dialog made for dummies (I mean, what person who is deathly concerned for a sibling greets him by saying ""Brother""?) Director and writer Guillermodel Torro took on too much and it shows. The way the Captain turns on his pregnant wife right in front of the daughter is just too deliberate, so that we would know how little El Capitan thought of her. The rebel mole, played by the chief woman on the compound, gives her speech about getting away with what she did because she was invisible to him? C'Mon... is this Telemundo TV? The lack of real fear and amazement in the little girl is understandable but detracts from a suspension of disbelief. Then there is the story of the ""worthy soul"", life after death, and deliverance of the princess to the King by the Faun. If the soul was worthy, why need to prove herself? Our narrator, as he explains almost everything related to the mythology, The Faun, is sometimes looking like the hind legs of the creature and at others, he seems to just be standing awkwardly. Again, Guiermo, I'm paying attention! Don't treat me like a kid who won't figure it out. This is not a kids' movie in any way shape or form. I'd like to think that you think more of your projected audience.So did I really hate this?

","Pan's Labyrinth has a staggering reputation with film critics and informed moviegoers. Many have titled it as the best film of 2006. I had never seen Pan's Labyrinth before this past week, while I cannot say I'm as enthusiastic about the film as most have been, I do recognize the art that went into making the film and the topics of war that are explored with the accurate grim. Violence is heavily stressed which grinds the audience into certain scenes the film more easily. <br/><br/>The main attraction with Pan's Labyrinth is obviously the visuals that are out of this world. Hued with blues and grays for the majority part of the film, the cinematography holds as much beauty and technique that you could find in a painting. The few scenes that contain bright-eye popping colors are made all the more pleasing when they are surrounded by the harsh shades around them. The cinematography glows in the usage of red colors and yellow/gold pallets when those scenes are called for, while they stand for escapism and change from the bloodshed. <br/><br/>Fantasy films that require otherworldly characters have been adapted into using computer generated effects or motion capture technology. Those advancements are impressive, but I've always found when an actor is complete in costume and fantasy make-up, a scene plays with more realism, rather than feeling like we are playing a video game. Pan's Labyrinth doesn't succumb to the new trends set by blockbuster action films, instead brings its fantasy characters to life through make-up prosthetics, which are done without a hitch. <br/><br/>The labyrinth set itself is like a setting we could find in a fairyland dream that we had, it's a beautifully recognized environment of the film. My problem with Pan's Labyrinth was that it didn't shock me into this world of fantasy right off the bat. I spent most of the movie trying to decipher if Ophelia's scenes with the Faun were reality, part of an adapted view world, or if was her imagination trying to find a sanctuary. It left me in the uninvested for half the film as scrabbled for symbolism that maybe just isn't there. Pan's Labyrinth shows war at face value and a child's struggle to adapt to that brutal environment.<br/><br/>Rating: 7<br/><br/>Grade: B+"
"antagonist117","7","0","1","18 August 2013"," Fairy tale violence and fascist violence are placed side-by-side, but one is far more interesting than the other
","Many of the world's most ancient myths and fairy tales are notoriously bloody affairs, perhaps because they date from times when death seemed to strike so capriciously. The 20th century, too, was at times brutally and indiscriminately violent, thanks in no small part to the fascist regimes of 1930s and 1940s Europe. Guillermo del Toro sets these two legacies of violence side by side at a Franco-era Spanish military compound built atop a stone ruin and surrounded by woods. This is the killing ground of a fascist officer, but it is also the home (really the prison) of his stepdaughter Ofelia, a book-loving girl who sees monstrous creatures in the trees and walls. Ofelia's encounters with a faun, insectoid fairies, and a faceless, child-killing thing with blood-stained claws are the most creative and interesting parts of the movie. It is unfortunate that so much time is spent away from her and these CG creations and spent instead on her stepfather, who feels like a villain imported from a slasher horror. His persecution of a band of clichéd guerrillas is predictable, and more gruesome than seems necessary for a fantasy period piece. At last, though, del Toro provides an ending that feels true to both the fairytale world and the real one, without compromising the dark tone he sets for both."
"rbubric","5","0","11","4 March 2013"," Don't you know that the Republicans were the bad guys!
","The Republicans--that is the parents and friends of the girl--were the bad guys! People nowadays misunderstand the Spanish Civil War in the mid-thirties. In short, while there were true ideological 'republicans' in the Republican coalition--that is, those who adhered, more or less to the principals of a free, democratic and liberal government patterned much after the US--many of the Republicans were Socialist and out and out Communists, including a faction from Communist Russia. While the Republican government started more or less OK in the early 30's, it soon became very anti-church. Now most of the population were Catholic and adhered strongly to that faith. Then the government started restricting religious freedom and soon factions among the Republicans starting invading and burning churches: even thousands of priests and laymen were arrested or murdered (some claim about 9000.) Naturally the majority of the people objected to this and many of the generals at that time agreed with them, General Franco among them. Franco, to help his people, formed a coalition of all people willing to defend their long established and cherished lifestyle that was being decimated by the Republicans. (Those on Franco's sided were called The Nationalist.) Included in Franco's coalition was the Falange, a fascist organizations; however, it was of the mild kind as found in Italy and at most formed about 10 to 20 percent of Franco's coalition. As for Franco, he was not a fascist: however, he had to impose dictatorial power given the nature to the times. It was said that the Communists used torture chambers of this sort: they placed their prisoners in small slanted chambers wherein the prisoner could not sit or sleep or stand properly, but had to stay in a excruciatingly torturous position for days on end: these are the people you would like as friends. No! By God, No! Some may say that Franco asked the aid of Hitler in his war: but where else could he get aid to save his people. Some say the whole town of Guernica was bombed by the Nazis. In fact only a small number of people died at the train station: a place of strategic importance in the war. In short, there has been a lot of negative propaganda about this war. Although I like many aspects of this film--I admire good fantasy--I can not condone another film that portrays the Republicans as all good and Franco Nationalists as all bad: The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, For Whom the Bell Tolls and even Casablanca (Rick states that he fought for the Republicans.) After the civil war was over in 1939 and the people regained their freedom, Franco was more or less neutral during the war and did not support Hitler and even opposed him in 1940 and after. During his leadership, people were allowed to say anything they wished. Read history books: that is primary sources or even Catholics sources and all sides in the issues. One will be startled at the truth."

"ynesh_91","8","0","2","19 May 2011"," Good. Not anything more.
","I watched the movie not knowing what to expect. All I knew beforehand were a bunch of comments full of praise in this review section. Having just watched it though, this is how I would put it.<br/><br/>To be unbiased at all, this was a very good movie. I loved the blend of fantasy and all the real-life metaphors it threw to the viewer of hard life through the eyes of a child. I loved how it captured the pure innocence of childhood through Ofelia's eyes, played beautifully by Ivana Baquero. The rest of the supporting casts were also stunningly portrayed by Sergi López (whom I thought was the best in the movie hands down, for his chilling portrayal of Captain Vidal) and Maribel Verdú. No complains about the performances or the equally matched soundtrack. I'm fortunately not going to rant about the rest of the technicalities this movie gives though, that's all readily out there with the rest of the reviews.<br/><br/>On the underside however, surprising to find little of those among reviewers here, I felt however, the movie falls just inches short of achieving what it strived to do. Which was to play that theme of innocence lost or however it may be put. I felt that in the end, the level of awakening, or rather the level of self consciousness that the film-makers wanted the viewers to feel just wasn't as profound as it could have possibly been. I thought the ending was maybe just a bit too abrupt, and the light was somewhat dimmed (I wouldn't say lost), at making this film an all together completely over-whelming experience. I would've preferred if the movie had a tougher climax, and a tougher build up to that climax, then maybe it would have been a complete experience for me.<br/><br/>I also watched previously the Bridge to Terabithia, which was a more moving experience. Didn't do almost as well in the reviews compared to this though, but I felt THAT movie did had a more complete sort of feel to it. It could so easily have been sort of a remake to this one - but with a more grippy ending, and with a lighter plot.<br/><br/>All in all Pan's Labyrinth is a great movie I would recommend to anyone, based on the stellar performances alone. But maaaybe a bit too over hyped here among the folks at IMDb. 8/10"
"Bunty-at-IMDB","8","0","6","1 September 2010"," A beautiful film but unnecessarily violent
","PAN'S LABYRINTH is probably a film which does not exactly fits into a fantasy genre. Perhaps it is a more kind of a parallel between the reality and fantasy, and thats what makes it one of a kind film.<br/><br/>Hats off to the director/writer Guillermo del Toro for a very different writing. The plot is something which is not seen before. The screenplay of the film is very beautifully crafted and very well written. The characterization of different characters in the film is also very detailed and deep.<br/><br/>The story basically follows a young girl named Ofelia who lives in the fascist regime of Spain. Ofelia is fascinated by fairy tales, and perhaps lives in her own fantasy world and very far from reality. She and her mother move to the house of her new step-father, ruthless sadistic Spanish Captain Vidal. After that she is taken to a labyrinth by a creature who is known as a fairy, and Ofelia meets a faun who told her that she is a princess of an underground realm, and to reach that world she needs to perform three dangerous tasks to prove her purity. I won't go into further details, but the film is just not what mentioned above. It is something much more metaphorical and symbolic.<br/><br/>In terms of acting, young Ivana Baquero is unmatched. She has done an excellent job playing a lonely child lost in fairy tales. Apart from Ivana Baquero, Sergi Lopez has also done a great job in portraying sadistic Captain Vidal. His expressions are merciless and fierce. All the other cast, honorable mention of Maribel Verdú (as Mercides) and Doug Jones (as Faun), are just great.<br/><br/>The film has top notch production values - breath-taking cinematography by Guillermo Navarro, beautiful sets by Eugenio Caballero and lingering music of Javier Navarette. Guillermo Del Toro's direction is very mature as well.<br/><br/>Only one thing that bugs me about the film is that the film is gratuitously violence and bloody. I don't know why, but the same thing could've shown in PG-13 levels. The violence in the film makes the film too 'uncinematic'. The film is also pretty misleading as a children fantasy, in fact it is very graphically violent. Also, the film goes a pretty too mechanical near the end, and the climax of the film could have been more emotional.<br/><br/>Apart from these two things, the film is very good in all sections of film-making. It is a very sad tale as well, and leaves you pretty disturbed. Definitely a must watch, but with a caution of graphic violence.<br/><br/>8.0/10"
"RJBurke1942","7","0","6","15 January 2010"," Where fantasy provides justification for reality
","I dislike fantasies, particularly modern versions. As a child, I saw many; and, as a child, I enjoyed them. There comes a time, however, when you must grow up to face reality. Or try to as Mercedes (Maribel Verdu) says in the story.<br/><br/>I knew nothing of Pan's Labyrinth (PL), and even less of the director, del Toro, before I finally decided to see it – on the recommendation of a trusted friend. Up front, I'll say this: technically and visually, it's quite stunning and worth seeing for those aspects alone. It probably deserved the awards received for those aspects (not sure that I would have applauded for the putative twenty minutes at Cannes, however). On top of that, the period setting, the music, the special effects and acting are all up to par.<br/><br/>But this film is not for children.<br/><br/>--- <br/><br/>(IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT, THEN READ NO FURTHER – MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW)<br/><br/>--- <br/><br/>Where the film seems to fail, for many viewers here, is in the narrative and plot. From my perspective, however, I think it succeeds for two reasons: first, all good narratives should achieve a thematic balance by foreshadowing the end of the story at the beginning. In that regards, PL opens with the young protagonist, Ofelia (Ivana Baquero), mortally wounded, on the ground, looking at the viewer; as the story ends, the film brings the viewer back to that same scene.<br/><br/>With the opening scene, as the camera slowly zooms in to Ofelia's eyeball, the viewer sees blood – that had been flowing from her nose – magically defy gravity and flow backwards: the viewer is now going back in time.<br/><br/>And so, the plot begins...<br/><br/>From that point, until the final scene, the viewer is inside Ofelia's mind: all that follows are the last thoughts of Ofelia before she dies, exemplifying the idea that, at the point of death, one's life flashes through your mind.<br/><br/>Ofelia, however, mixes the fantasy of her own collection of fairy tales with the realities of the cruel world of Fascist Spain and thus brings the viewer on an allegorical and magical mystery tour of the circumstances that result in her heroism when facing and defeating evil – in the form of Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez), her step-father – and her own death at his very hands. So, to that extent, the two worlds of reality and fantasy are in perfect accord (excluding some narrative inconsistencies – too long and complex to discuss here).<br/><br/>So, why does Ofelia review only the last few hours of her short life? In my opinion, as a child victim of war, she's coming to terms with the choices she's made that result in her own death while saving her new-born half-brother from the dictates of her monstrous step-father. Children are always the biggest losers in war and Ofelia makes the biggest sacrifice by choosing to die to save a baby.<br/><br/>Structuring the story around the idea of 'life flashing before your eyes when dying' has been done already in such diverse films as Donnie Darko (2001), Mulholland Drive (2001), Jacob's Ladder (1990) and others. For PL, it's the only narrative device that makes sense to this viewer and helps to resolve the apparent narrative discord in this film, between reality and fantasy, noted by many reviewers.<br/><br/>Having now seen PL, I'm glad I did, because it's a finely crafted story grounded in reality, and especially in the reality of fantasy, without which our common humanity would be much poorer. Having said that, I'll still avoid pure fantasy in film.<br/><br/>And finally, although I don't rate the film as highly as most do, I do recommend it – including the extreme violence – for all interested adults."

","Pan's Labyrinth is one of the most artistic films I have seen in a while. The art direction is amazing, with sets and effects that are astonishing. However, while the look of the film is gorgeous it holds a very dark story.<br/><br/>Pan's Labyrinth is about a young girl named Ofelia who is living with her mother and her stepfather who is a Captain in the Spanish Civil War. The brutality of this war is never masked and introduced to us from the beginning of the film. Ofelia is a child that does not deal with the brutality but instead goes into a magical world where she must deal with its own brutality.<br/><br/>This film has the most amazing visual effects that blend right into the film. Unlike most CGI, the effects in this film blend right into the story instead of sticking out like a sore thumb. The effects are done so well that they add to the visual aesthetic.<br/><br/>The story itself is very well done by combining the magical world with the real one, even color scheme remains the same allowing for both worlds to seamlessly blend into each other. Although the story does deal with a magical world it is obviously not for children and has been described as an adult fairy tale. This is exactly what this film is. With adult themes and detailed violence this film is meant for a mature audience.<br/><br/>Another part of this film that is interesting is that it takes a brutal moment in history and shows it through not only the eyes of an imaginative child, but parallels it with the world Ofelia is sucked into. While there is history in this film no knowledge of the Spanish Civil War is needed since a narrator explains the war at the beginning of the film. While in most films this can be a misplaced mistake, but in Pan's Labyrinth it fits very nicely. Overall this film is an visually amazing while also succeeding at telling a very captivating story."

"timeformime","8","0","3","10 June 2008"," Pan's Labyrinth - excellent period drama / fantasy
","Possible spoilers follow, but nothing plot-ruining.<br/><br/>El Laberinto del fauno is one of the most widely, metaphorically, allegorically, etc. (you get the idea) interpreted artsy movies I had heard of in a while. That said, I was fairly turned off at first to the idea of having to piece together a whole separate message, on top of watching a movie and glancing at the subtitles to see what was going on. I'm the kind of guy who loved and hated Dante's Inferno in class just because it was interesting but still so bloody metaphorical (and believe me, our teacher made it so).<br/><br/>If you are this kind of person you are in good company with the rest of that high school English class, and in good company with many film viewers out there who like fantasy. But probably more Lord of the Rings fantasy that introduces a rich world all its own and really sucks you in with something like 9 hours of screen time for the whole story, universe, and history of said universe. Believe me, I am one of the aforementioned. But if YOU are, do not by any means discard Pan's Labyrinth as fluff without substance. Because it isn't.<br/><br/>What works very strongly for the film, and which is what I noticed right off the bat, is the music. The music ties the whole movie together as it is powerful enough to give you an attitude toward a certain scene, but still subtle enough to not let you notice it's happening. Secondly all the actors are great. Not since Natalie Portman in Leon has a child carried a movie on their shoulders as well as Ivana Baquero in the main character's role of Ofelia. All the supporting actors are superb as well. Namely the captain comes to mind as he gives an unexpected nuance to his character that not many would, and I don't want to spoil anything by giving you details.<br/><br/>And now doubtless what some of you have been skipping through this review to find: the fantasy element. The tag in the title that made you check this movie out. It's misleading to say the least. Pan's Labyrinth isn't a Drama/Fantasy/Thriller as IMDb would have you believe, but on the contrary a History/Drama/Thriller/Fantasy (prioritized in that order). There's mostly a great intense war story going on that is supplemented by Ofelia's fantasy escapades. My only beef is that they didn't flesh these out a little more, if for no other reason than to toss us fantasy nerds a bone, and to utilize those awesome tension-building directing skills Guillermo del Toro has going.<br/><br/>The fantasy totally works, though. In a nutshell Ofelia has a few tasks, quests if you will, to complete. They seem at first trivial in the face of what reality is sending to both sides of this military conflict. However, the thing that makes you see the fantasy as appropriate is when it all comes together to show you that everything was for a purpose and was interwoven to work together. That's the ending and I won't spoil it for you, but it is certainly fitting considering what comes before.<br/><br/>Another thing is that the story works just by itself, considering significant points within the plot as they flesh out. For instance, watch out for when the captain is seen shaving in relation to the storyline. It's great to see it a few times just thinking of how everything ties together, and what could certain people have thought when they did certain things. Sometimes the movie tells you, sometimes not.<br/><br/>And if exclusively visual production values just add another layer of paint to an already solid movie, they dumped buckets of the best on this one. The makeup, cinematography, lighting, etc. are all fantastic.<br/><br/>So yeah, if you haven't seen this already see it. You'll like some aspect of it no matter who you are, unless you just can't watch the few but admittedly realistic violent scenes. Cover your eyes if you're squeamish. If it makes any difference, the violence isn't at all gratuitous and speaks volumes concerning the characters of those who inflict it. And incidentally I think the youngest person to appreciate this would be a teenager, anyone younger would probably just be bored out of their minds. They wouldn't catch the subtitles very fast anyway.<br/><br/>Final verdict: An enjoyable intense historical drama with a dash of fantasy that sucks you in with its incredible layers of polish and mesmerizing score. If you want a quality drama and don't mind leaving your brain on while you watch to take in the story (gasp!), see it! I just hope this makes a special appearance in theaters again, because it would just magnify the atmosphere by a fair amount with a big screen and surround sound."

It is a great travesty that despite this film being in many moguls eyes (mine included) the stand out film of 2006, it will forever remain only a cult classic, shunned by the masses.<br/><br/>One wonders if the role of Ofelia played by the superb Ivana Baquero was instead played by, lets say, Dakota Fanning and the equally impressive/terrifying Sergi Lopez as Captain Fidal was instead filled by, hmmmm, Johny Depp then along with the addition of an English dialect this film most probably would've got somewhere in the USA/Britain.<br/><br/>I'm not firing sour grapes at the fact that only movies spawned from Hollywood are deemed watchable by the mass public, for on a large scale I agree that those straight out of tinsel town are in most cases the best.

","You've probably heard nothing but good things about this film, if you STILL haven't seen it yet. Well, until just a few short hours ago I was among the ranks with you, my friend. Not any more. Having received it on DVD for my birthday, I finally had time to settle down and see what all the fuss was about. And guess what? You ain't gonna get a negative review from me! <br/><br/>This film is an absolute Must See! It's a dark, dark fairy tale for adults, set in the horrific brutalities of the end of the Spanish Civil War, yet somehow exquisitely jumping into a fantastic world of both beautiful and terrifying monsters. In either world nothing is what it seems, be it the cricket-type insect that transforms into a fairy, or the brutal captain who shows his true colours after Ofelia and her mother arrive at his base camp to live with him.<br/><br/>Obviously, as you can tell from its certificate, this film is NOT for youngsters. There are some bloody torture scenes and plenty of gunshots to relay properly the horrors of fascism. As for the monsters, probably the most famous scene is with The Pale Man, a ghastly child eater whose eyes fit into slits in his hands. However, the title faun himself (who is never named as Pan in the film at all) can at times be a little creepy, particularly in his dirty old man attitude towards our heroine, Ofelia.<br/><br/>All of Del Toro's trademarks as a director are here; this is a man clearly in love with monsters and mythical beasts, as one can see from other films of his such as ""Hellboy"". It is an absolute crying shame that this film was passed for an academy award for Best Foreign Film, but I think that it will still get the public vote every single time.<br/><br/>8/10"

"tonberrykinged","10","0","2","2 May 2008"," The clue doesn't reside in the title - this Labyrinth is not pans! (pants)
","It's easy for people to overlook a film like Pan's Labyrinth. Some people would be inclined to believe, prejudiciously, that this film is probably arty nonsense, for the following tick box reasons: It's a Spanish film (tick!), it has subtitles (tick!), it received Oscar nominations (tick!), and it has been described by Mark Kermode as 'the Citizen Kane of modern fantasy cinema' and 'a life-changing experience' (tick!). In fact, this film is first and foremost a great story, wonderfully told, albeit quite a dark and, at times, tragic one. Sorry was this part of the tick box? <br/><br/>Directed by Guillermo Del Toro (Hellboy, Blade II), the film is set in 1944 during a time of fascist rule in Spain. Ofelia is a young girl reluctantly moving with her pregnant mother to a military outpost where the baby's father (not Ofelia's father - her father died) is in charge of the brutal suppression of local dissidents. It is at this wooded outpost that Ofelia discovers the labyrinth and a mythical creature known as the Faun who reveals that she is the princess to a lost world but in order to return must fulfil three tasks. From the outset, the grim reality of Spanish fascism is juxtaposed with the dark fairytale of an underworld realm.<br/><br/>What most impresses, is that not only does the film work on both levels, but it also manages to weave the fairytale through the realistic portrayal of wartime Spain without undermining the latter's stark nature. If I was to continue the weaving metaphor, I would say that Ofelia is the needle. You'd then have permission to call me the prick.<br/><br/>But let's be honest, children can often be irritating in films. They either whine a lot, cry-a-lot, buy-a-lot (Richie Rich), or fly-brooms-a-lot (Harry Potter). Most importantly, they are always needy and it is the adults who suffer - both within the film and in the groaning audience. But here, in Ofelia, is an actual child you can sympathise with. She takes the worlds weight on her shoulders - then cries a lot and whines a lot But we forgive her. Ivana Baquero offers a central performance that, despite all the drama, is actually rather restrained and all the better for it. And surrounding her are a number of memorable characters, none more so than the sadistic Captain Vidal played with emotion-stripped menace by Sergi Lopez.<br/><br/>The direction from Del Toro is sublime, capturing the right balance between dark fantasy and cruel reality. Long lingering shots give the characters that extra life and breathing space so often lost in the hands of pop-video-turned movie directors. This is complimented by one of the best movie soundtracks I have heard in recent times. It's haunting, compelling and stays with you long after the credits have rolled. The Oscar nomination was rightly deserved.<br/><br/>It's difficult to recommend this film enough. It holds such a strong emotional power and tells such an engaging story that you soon forget you're reading subtitles. And ultimately Pan' Labyrinth is a fitting tribute to those who gave their lives in the fight against fascism.<br/><br/>Mel Dixon"
"Tweekums","10","0","4","29 April 2008"," Not all fairy tales are for children
","I probably wouldn't have thought to buy this film but I heard a very positive review on the radio and thought it might be good to watch something different. I'm glad that I did as it is a fantastic film combining fantasy with brutal realism.<br/><br/>In the beginning we are told that a princess from an underground kingdom left her realm and died and her father was waiting for her soul to return. We then see Ofelia, a young girl, reading a book of fairy tales as she and her pregnant mother are driven through Franco's Spain shortly after the civil war on their way to their new home with a captain in the Army.<br/><br/>On the way they stop and Ofelia sees a creature that looks like a giant stick insect that she takes to be a fairy, when they continue on their journey the fairy follows them and later that night, when shown a drawing of a fairy by Ofelia changes shape to look like the image. The fairy then takes Ofelia into the labyrinth next to the mill she is living in. Here she meets the faun who tells her that she is in fact the princess mentioned at the start of the film and that she must complete three tasks to prove that her soul has not been corrupted my mortal life.<br/><br/>Unlike many fantasy films Ofelia doesn't leave our world and remain in the fantasy world but goes there to complete a task and returns. In many ways the real world is far more frightening than the fantasy world as her mother is very ill due to complications with her pregnancy and her new step-father is a brutal man who we see casually killing and torturing people while fighting the rebels who remain in the hills.<br/><br/>The viewer is never explicitly told whether the fantasy world is real or a creation of Ofelia's so different people will differing opinions on the matter. The acting is is very good, especially Ivana Baquero as Ofelia and Sergi López as the wicked Captain Vidal and the cinematography is stunning throughout.<br/><br/>Be warned though, this may be a fairy tale but it is not suitable for children as there are scenes of brutal violence which may not be gratuitous as they help establish the character but certainly shouldn't be seen by youngsters."
"coldwaterpdh","6","0","6","9 February 2008"," An outsider's perspective.
","Being mostly a viewer of Italian horror films and vintage American slashers, I went into ""Pan's Labyrinth"" not knowing what to expect really. I'd heard it was a really great film with some pretty deep themes, but for the most part it was kind of an adult fairy tale.<br/><br/>I have to admit, I was pretty shocked by how graphic this film was. I'm a big gore fan, but this one had emotional shock to it that was a little tough to watch. A man sees his son's face smashed by a cruel military captain, a woman witnesses her own brother being tortured. It is basically a fable with a healthy dose of torture porn. Not unlike ""Hostel."" The acting is outstanding, no doubt. The special effects are really awesome too. I was impressed with the creatures and the monsters. It reminded me of books I read when I was a kid that scared me. I liked that part of it. I liked the ending a lot too, but what was the message really? Always follow your heart, I suppose...never stop believing in magic maybe? All in all, it was more shocking than anything else. I turned to my friend and girlfriend when it was over and all three of us were like: 'wow, that was messed up.' If that's what you're looking for, check out ""Pan's Labyrinth."" <br/><br/>6 out of 10, kids."
"Terrell-4","8","0","4","6 February 2008"," An extraordinary, major film...marred a little by three lapses into the genre of teen horror yuckiness
","Pan's Labyrinth is a marvelous, serious movie full of allegory, the easiest being fascism and freedom, nightmares and dreams. This is a film that people who like movies about ideas and implications will chew over and come back to. And I hope Sergi Lopez is doing things other than bad guys. He's a first-class actor. Those who've seen Dirty Pretty Things will recall him. As Harry in the French psycho movie, With a Friend Like Harry, he's exactly not the kind of friend to have. <br/><br/>I have one caveat. I wish first-class directors (and second-class directors, too) could resist indulging in the brutality ""wow"" factor some of their fans seem to love so much. I could see no purpose except to have the audience go ""yuck"" when the Captain's cheek is slit, when he sews it up himself and when he uses a bottle to smash in a captive's face. All are shown in close-up and in loving detail. Pan's Labyrinth is so good a movie that the three yuck moments aren't needed, in my view, except for pandering to a segment of the audience. <br/><br/>But doesn't the face-smashing truly and quickly establish the really brutal and vicious nature of the man, particularly as an allegory for fascism? Perhaps, but did it need to be shown in close-up? The whole scene was threatening because of the way Lopez played it. His brutal character, for me, was quickly set through Lopez' performance and the fright of the two peasants...there was no doubt, from my point of view, about the Captain's character. That was established to my satisfaction by the Captain matter-of-factly personally shooting the father more than once, then turning to put bullets into the son...more bullets than were needed, and by doing it himself. Then following that by the discovery of the rabbits in the knapsack and the...what? just irritation toward his subordinate for not thoroughly searching the two peasants. <br/><br/>I'll offer this as something to think about: If the three incidents I mentioned 1) had not been shot in close-up, but had been shown in medium shots or 2) with the bottle scene, the Captain starts to smash the bottle into the face but there was a cut-away so the direct smashing impacts weren't seen, and 3) if the cheek slitting had been shown in a different angle and the sewing had been seen from a different, non-close-up angle...would the impact of the story or the film be significantly changed in any important emotional or visual way? For me, the answer is ""no."" The cheek sewing, for me, established that the Captain really was an evil not of this world, worse than anything Ofelia had encountered in her world...but the director, from a practical, visual, emotional level, did not have to use close-ups of the needle going in and out of the flesh to establish that point. When I saw the movie the theater was packed. Believe me, when those three scenes came up all I could hear was ""Yuck"" from the audience with undertones of either delight or revulsion. It seemed to me people were caught up in the bloody close-up moment, just as they would be in some gory teen horror flick, and not in any expanded meaning about the characters or the story. <br/><br/>The movie, itself, despite this directorial indulgence, remains a fascinating and thoughtful film that will most likely be remembered and watched years from now."

","Ofelia goes to a Mill in Spain to live with her pregnant mother and captain stepfather to find that she is in the middle of the end of the Spanish Civil war where her captain stepfather is an evil minion of Franco who attempts to carry out the Spanish wish to eradicate a rebel faction . Her imagination and sense of adventure leads her to a labyrinth where she meets a faun who leads her through two tasks which (with the addition of a third) should result in her becoming a princess reunited with her father in the seven gardens of the underworld (never stated in the film:hell). <br/><br/>Ultimately, we see brutality in the human existence that would lead anyone into a quandary about which to choose. Ultimately, she chooses not to sacrifice her newborn brother to hell in favor of surviving to be killed by the brutal captain. Once she dies, she is reunited with her father and mother in a wonderful place that it seems she ultimately was meant to be a part of (the last 3 minutes). <br/><br/>Until the last 3 minutes, this film is ultimately about the choice between hell and human existence, and which is a better path. Why the filmmakers decided to answer a question about what happens to the child after she dies, I don't know. I LOVED the film through 113 minutes. The final three absolutely ruin it (tie it up in a bow so that those who don't get the literary references can be happy about the fact that the girl gets a happy ending, while horrendously disappointing those that understand the parallel themes between the Franco- Spanish reality and hell-based mythology)."

What more to say I have no clear idea. Surely though, I know I am being manipulated."
"Rasputins_Heir","6","0","3","6 April 2007"," Many good aspects, but poorly executed
","Pan's Labrinth is among the most overrated movies I've ever seen. I'm starting to think people go to all European movies expecting a high-concept, low-visual incomprehensible well, a stereotypical European film. Then when it turns out to be accessible and engaging they decide it's the best movie ever. It's not. In fact it's kind of a mess.<br/><br/>This film has some good aspects to it, a lot in fact. The acting is universally solid, especially Ivana Baquero as the little girl Ophelia, our heroine. The casting is pretty much perfect all around. The visual effects are absolutely flawless and beautiful. The Faun, who I assume from the dialogue is supposed to be friendly and benevolent, appears about 8 feet tall and seemed rather terrifying to me. Later there's a Resident Evil-esquire monster with removable eyes whom Ophelia provokes which is even scarier. There are a few fairies flitting around at different points in the film which have to be the most convincing fairies I can remember in a movie. There are CG walking stick bugs, a weird, crying baby-root creature, a giant toad and other fantasy elements, all very well portrayed.<br/><br/>The more reality-based side of the film takes place at a modest Spanish army checkpoint during WW2. It's bleakreally bleak. This isn't a complaint, it seems rather appropriate. Again, good costumes, good setsit looks perfect. The C.O. of the checkpoint is Captain Vidal (Sergi López) a completely inhuman, sadistic monster, who is married to Ophelia's mother (Ariadna Gil). She's pregnant and wants the Captain to be present for the birth so she's left the city to come to his station. Why she's bringing her daughter to a war zone I can't say. Assuming there were not family or friends available to take care of Ophelia, she'd probably be better off as an orphan than stuck in this nightmare.<br/><br/>Anyway, the sum total of all these perfectly competent parts is confusing and frustrating. The reality-based scenes feel like something akin to Shindler's List or The Pianist. The fantasy scenes feel like a low-rent Lord of the Rings (a compliment) or a humor-devoid Tim Burton project (would have been a compliment about 8 years ago). Both would likely be fine films by themselves, but feel incompatible and forced together in this one. According to a lot of people, the fantasy aspects supposedly mirror the real-life goings on, although I could not really see many parallels.<br/><br/>Also, the fantasy world doesn't really follow it's own logic at all. We're told early on that Ophelia is actually a princess in the fantasy world. Why?! Sure, fantasy stories are full of princesses but isn't there usually some lineage or magic or some crap that designates them as such? Ophelia says herself that her father is a dead tailor, and she doesn't bother asking her mother about it. Is the entire fantasy aspect of the film all in Ophelia's imagination? I don't think that's what was implied but I think the movie makes more sense that way, although it would also make the already-depressing ending much more depressing.<br/><br/>Having the fantasy sequences interspersed throughout the film feels like it cheapens the truly riveting war plot in the other scenes. We are asked to believe that Ophelia's actions in her little fantasy-world have serious consequences, while very real people are being brutally murdered by her real step-father in the real world. It's kind of hard to be concerned that the faun is a bit upset with Ophelia when there's a very real guy being tortured to death a few yards away."

","Just as something to think about: Pan's Labyrinth, either intentionally or because the director- writer was working unconsciously but coherently, is about the end and beginning of worlds. Fascism is equated with patriarchy, and is embodied by the villain, who passes on his watch (symbol, as in Peter Pan, of man's limited time--his mortality) to his son, the only way he can continue his line. He is completely indifferent to women; he lets his wife die and shoots his step-daughter; in this case, man and the patriarchal system is seen as cruel and based on orders--the absolute authority of the father. When the Captain is killed, Mercedes ends his system, promising that she will not even tell his son his name, thus ending the line of patriarchal cruelty.<br/><br/>Ofelia, on the other hand, represents the resurgence of matriarchy, and of magic. In the film no woman kills anyone. Her blood, which re-opens up the fairly world, is symbolic of her first period. Matriarchy is not necessarily opposed to patriarchy--it is based on egalitarian ideas-- hence her brother will be a prince in the kingdom."

","Set in Spain against the backdrop of Franco's fascist regime at the end of the Spanish Civil War, Pan's Labyrinth presents a world of childhood fantasy that coexists with more adult sensibilities. Far from being another Harry Potter, the director Guillermo del Toro explores themes from children's fiction in juxtaposition to the terror and violence inherent in themes of patriarchal domination and war. This original, yet ultimately flawed film moves easily between worlds, developing in the viewer a strong sense of duality through the events that surround the life of Ofelia, the young girl who acts as the protagonist. The plot cleverly threads the story of Ofelia and the world in which she finds adventure and solace, with the story of Captain Vidal, her unwilling step-father and his world of control and brutality.<br/><br/>Historically, popular children's literature has often blurred the lines between horror and fantasy using fiction like a parable, as a kind of morality play for misbehaving children, however del Toror creates ambiguity between reality and fantasy through the contrast of what is truly abhorrent and what is magical. Pan's Labyrinth creates enough to interest viewers willing to reach into the film to gain rewards, but may leave those looking for the film to do the work, feeling flat."

Not doing so makes it seem as though I was lied to when I arrive in the theater, get comfortable and then realize I have to read the whole damn thing.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong. I don't mind subtitled movies. when I'm prepared for them (Brotherhood of the Wolf). But when I go to movies I generally don't bring my glasses because I don't expect to have to read. There are certain movies I will plan ahead for and bring my glasses to. The Labyrinth of the Satyr (I call it this because that is what the title actually translates to) would have been one. I just feel that letting the audience know would have been more honest. I felt tricked into watching his movie and I know several others felt the same way.<br/><br/>Also, I have to wonder why Del Torro felt it necessary to have characters smash, cut and shoot each others faces so much throughout the film. Was it really necessary for every head shot be shown up close and not shooting the head but rather the face every single time? Was it really necessary to spend all the money on CG just to do that ""sewing my mouth back together"" scene? I get he was trying to show the violence of the real world from which this imaginary world has sprung, but really, couldn't that have been done in a less moronic and disgusting way? I mean the brain is not in the face after all. Shooting someone in the cheek cannot guarantee you hit the brain and killed them.<br/><br/>A reminder also, most people can tell the difference between a Mexican accent and one of Spain, even those that don't speak the language. Having so many Mexican and other Hispanic actors in a movie that is supposed to be set in pre-colonial Spain is utterly ridiculous. Sorry to say that this is Del Torro's worst mistake. The common South American belief that all Hispanics actually are Spanish has taken him on track of Historical Revisionism which only tells people what they want to hear instead of what is actually true.<br/><br/>This movie could have been a 9 or 10, but sadly it loses points for misleading the audience and inauthenticity.

","Greetings again from the darkness. From the creatively warped mind of writer/director Guillermo del Toro (""Cronos"",""Mimic"",""Hellboy"") comes a for-adults-fantasy that resembles ""Alice in Wonderland"" on steroids.<br/><br/>The strong point of the film is when young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) explores the fantastical underground world that the fairies lead her to. The effects are somewhat comical at times, but also chilling in their realism. Two other nice performances are by Sergi Lopez as the quite merciless Captain and Maribel Verdu (so wonderful in ""Y tu Mama Tambien"") as Mercedes.<br/><br/>What prevents this from being the masterpiece so many are intent on it becoming is, of course, the story itself. The underground world segments are fascinating and unique and spell-binding. Where the film lags is in the real world with the guerrillas in the forest and the odd military post that the evil Captain rules. While having a touch of ""Cinderella"" and ""Alice in Wonderland"", parents should be aware that it is in no way intended for young children.<br/><br/>The visual strength of the mystical fantasy world make this one worth seeing, but it definitely doesn't reach the level of classic or masterpiece."

","has no one mentioned the excellent film by this director called ""THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE""? that was an amazing film about ghosts and political landscapes, evil and redemption and the whole shebang. the theater experience was good, but to study it on DVD was super. i have seen it so many times that i don't have to read the words but can study the acting and camera moves, etc. highly recommended. the narration business is rather effective at the beginning and end, and all the possible things as to what a ghost could be are thought provoking. perhaps we are all ghosts of a sort, depending on how we flesh (groan) out our lives..."

","This was a great film and well worth seeing on the big screen to fully appreciate the sumptuous sets and cinematography. With its depiction of civil war through the eyes and unbounded imagination of a young girl, the film struck me hardest as a reminder of the inevitable loss of innocence that war leaves in its wake. The young girl indulges in her fantastical creations to help her escape her sombre reality - a world of war and sorrow. Like The Devil's Backbone, Del Toro has managed to create a wonderfully atmospheric film. I would urge those who enjoyed this film and who have not seen the Devils Backbone to seek it out. You will not be disappointed! Chamone."

","I can't understand why people are raving about Ivana Bacquero as the ""greatest child performance ever"". She hardly matches the performance of Ana Torrent in Victor Erice's ""Spirit of the Beehive"", another film about childhood and the Spanish civil war.<br/><br/>In fact Erice's film is far superior without the crutch of a computer graphics rendering bank.<br/><br/>Nothing here that hasn't been done far better by Erice, Bunuel or Tarkovsky.<br/><br/>If torture gets you off then don't miss this but if you want creative film-making without the pandering take a pass."
